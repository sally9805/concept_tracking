 | bottle of Schnapps at three o'clock this afternoon , and I did not begin thinking , I did not come to any conclusion . When I was half through it I sent him home and then I got dressed and while I was doing my nails over I finished the bottle , and then without coming to any decision I went to the hospital and they told me you would be here eating your supper . " She talked very calmly , very reasonably , sitting looking at her hand . " I do n't feel sick , " she said , " I do n't feel drunk . I just feel something inside me moving me very exactly . " " Look at me , " said Dr. Prochaska in a voice that was new to himself even . He leaned forward over the table and touched her black kid fingers with his naked hand . And oh , what rotten German she spoke , terrible , terrible , he thought even as the keen and powerful tide of blissful torment swept through his blood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of the Sleeping Beauty murinuring still in sleep . " This is n't going to get you anywhere , " she said , looking without any change at the long white femininely tended fingers closed on hers , and the smooth and almost hairless saddle of his narrow hand . " If I had another drink I might tell you I came because I was curious , like going to the side-show or the zoo , but that might not be quite true either . The man who believes in his country , and in women , and in love , I bet you . The genuine old article . If I looked at you I 'd see a Valentine with lace around the edges and a  | heart with an arrow through it and Ich Liebe dich ' written in gilt on it , and I 'm not having any , that 's all . So if you 've anything like that in your mind you 'd better go away and leave me sitting here with a pretzel or two to keep me company ? " " Look here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me since Sunday night . I have n't drawn a breath , eaten a meal , spoken a word . I do n't know if I 've been alive or dead . It 's impossible what 's happened . " " I know , " said the girl , looking still at their two hands . " I know . That 's why I came . "  | Chapter Nine THE dark streets shone with wet underfoot and there was a little snow left in the gardens behind the fretwork gates at the driveways , crescents of white left around the bases of the trees and honeycombed and soiled where the early rain had fallen . But at the end of every street rose the mountains , mighty as stone wings spread in immobile flight and the ice and snow blading their edges . Even at night there was the power of the mountains transfiguring the town , known in the lungs like new air breathed in , altering the voice in the mouth and the blood passing in the body . Even with the young life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's , Dr. Prochaska felt the awful ecstatic urge , the terrible speechless movement of the mountains around them , the strange and absolute power , pure and perfect enough to draw his heart forth , trembling , from his breast . He went down the little streets to the hospital , walking jubilantly and without secrecy with her under the trees set in the strip of earth at the curb and the streetlights , passing the gardens and the fronts of houses straight upon the street and their lighted windows , walking through the dark and the springlike wetness and the pools of light cast down at the  | corners , not for an instant losing the knowledge that the mountains were behind them and before them , at the beginning and at the end , arched strong and wild and unsubmissive as a wind over and beyond them . Ah , how can men live without a beautiful girl or without this power of the mountains , his heart cried out , exulting , and he lifted his head and pressed her hand wildly in his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to her . " Yes , " she said , as if she had known all along . " I want you to go there and to see it , " he said , " and besides , there is nowhere else . " He was not even thinking of a hotel , or her room there , but of other things . " I want you to see the photographs of my family , of my mother , and of my father who is dead , and of my three sisters . You do not know anything about me . I wish to make it possible for you to com-prehend ? " The garden of Inf ektionhaus was without light or shape in the darkness as they went through it towards the palace door . " I came here , " the girl said over the sound of their feet on the cinder-path . " As far as the gate ? " Dr. Prochaska opened the door at the top of the circular steps and cautiously and silently motioned her inside . The blue night-light was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on her arm and led her the other way . It was dark in his sitting-room and for a moment he did not touch the lamp but he said , holding her straight and rather  | sternly beside him in the darkness : " It is not a difficult thing I am trying to say to you , believe me it is not difficult , but you must understand that it is important to me that you should know these things that can not be separated from myself ? " So he spoke of himself , simply enough , but still as if he were something really of value , of quality , either to his family or to history or to himself , something that must not be confused with anything she had known before . " I suppose there have to be ancestors , antecedents crowding the picture ? " she said . " The genuine article . . . " Dr. Prochaska reached out and turned on the light and all the good shapely cared-for chosen objects in the place glowed quietly and discreetly with life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could scarcely trust himself to look at her and he stooped quickly down on the hearth and struck a match and put the flame to the paper which the servant had stuffed in under the kindling in the high wide fireplace . From the tail of his eye he could see her slender silk-sheathed legs and her black skirt halted near the table . " Those are the photographs , " he began again , rising , " of my parents , and of my sisters . That is my elder sister with her children . We were brought up in Vienna . My father was a doctor and had his practice there ? "  | " It is n't enough , " she said , sitting down . " I 'll have to see your credentials . " " It is not a difficult thing I am trying to say , " said Dr. Prochaska patiently . " Believe me it is not difficult . It is just that I have been alone a long time and I hope that it is true I shall not be alone any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of my country and of my age live with no possible thing to look to , no future to grow old in because of the absolute cessation of living . We have ceased , " he said . " If you put your hand upon my heart you would feel this . It might just as well have stopped beating , for I , like every other man of my nation , have ceased to live . " She reached forward and took a cigarette out of the silver box on his table , listening a little wearily to him . " When I was young , " he went on , putting his hand with the lighted match in his fingers steadily to the end of the cigarette in her mouth , " I could not see clearly as I now see what I wished to make of my life or how to let it serve . But I have been alone a long time in rooms studying in Vienna and in this room with the knowledge that the men of my time and of my country have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrecognizable instead . By the Treaty of Trianon . Yes , exactly . Instead of youth we have been offered despair , but the joke of it is we ca n't accept it , we really ca n't . You see we have absolutely no capacity for despair . "  | " You might borrow some from Wagtail , " she said , smoking . " I believe in the time when my father was alive , " he went on , still standing and watching the fire spread along the wood , " it was difficult then to see any solution , almost to hope for any ? " " Look , " said the girl quickly , " look at your mother . Her eyes are glittering at me , shining like a snake 's eyes ready to strike . . . " " You must understand , " said the doctor without turning , " you must try to see how it is . I want you to decide if you think it is possible for you to remain here  --  to remain with me , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the necessary things ? divorce . . . " " Good God , Herr Doktor , " she said , laughing dry little jerks of laughter , " things do n't happen like that , overnight ? " " You 're quite wrong , " said Dr. Prochaska , looking at her in surprise . " They do . " She threw her cigarette towards the fire and took another out of the box . " Have you a match ? " she said , waiting , and Dr. Prochaska leaned forward and took the straight white paper stem from her mouth and put it back in the box and closed the silver lid down . He looked at her with his dark hot eyes , not in anger but with passion for the thing that he was putting words to . " Stop smoking and listen to what I 'm saying , " he said , and it might have been that he did not see her  | face any more , that he no longer knew she was sitting there . " Does it mean nothing that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving beggars , not only children but men and women without shoes on their feet walking the streets of Vienna all winter ? That is what it has been and what it is now , but now something else has come to us so that we are no longer forced to accept the finality of despair . It does not mean that we are promised power , or promised comfort , but only that the promise has been made us at last that it is not necessary to despair ! If this means nothing to you when I say it , then I can never say anything to you that will have meaning . Because of one man we can now lift our heads again , we can remember our history without shame because of this promise made in our own tongue to us , not that we shall be conquerors , not that we shall be rich , envied , monstrously great , but only this , that I and every other man of my country will be able to put new shoes on for once in his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , drink wine in the evening ! " Dr. Prochaska 's voice paused for a moment and he looked swiftly around the room with his shining seemingly blinded eyes . " I am not poor , no , of course I am not poor . I have money from my father , enough for my lifetime if it comes to that , but I have come here to the Tirol with a purpose , with definite orders to pursue . " He broke off and shrugged his shoulders , looking at her with the strangely exhilarated reckless light in his eye . " Well , then , we have been condemned  | to die , as a nation , " he went on quietly . " A few more years of solitary confinement and then , as a country , to die . Except for the words of one man coming , not as a reprieve to us , not quite as much as that perhaps , but like a small opening , very tiny , just enough to indicate to us the direction of escape . You must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made us by one of our own people that it is no longer necessary to despair ! " " Your own people ? " she said , sitting with her legs drawn up under her in his chair . " Yes , " said the doctor and he felt the quiver of love and truth that stabbed through his body , " he is Austrian . " " I think I knew it once , " she said , " but I 'd forgotten . " " They say that if a priest speaks to the young people now about their neglecting to come to church , the answer is always the same ; it is : We do not need to go to church to worship the Saviour now for the Saviour is on earth again , ' " said Dr. Prochaska . " Like Abraham Lincoln , " she said . " Do n't , do n't speak idly , " said the doctor 's voice . " When you speak so I see you as an outsider , absolutely outside the thing which shapes my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you outside . " " Well , I do n't come from such a bad little place myself , " she said and she looked up into his urgent face with that undisturbed and only faintly bitter gaze of pure indifference . " Only we apparently do n't  | expect quite so much . There are quite presentable little mountains along the edge of where I lived , nice mountains , small , but still very wild . The horses go up and down them just as they wish without bridles and the fur gets thick on them in winter , and if you meet one suddenly when you 're climbing up through the woods he spins and sails off like a pheasant . There 's snow there too . Anyway enough to ski and slide on your face , and another thing : I have n't sat home being rich and innocent all my life and lifting my lorgnette , deah , deah , at the sight of the whimsical lower classes . There was my father , " she said and for the first time but only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly in her voice . " If I talked all night I could n't make you see him , or New Mexico , or Iowa , or prairies , or wheat moving straight out as far as you can see , grain climbing mountains , jumping rivers , enough of it to fill this poor little country and a hundred others full ? " Dr. Prochaska stood watching the fire burn , one arm along the stone of the mantel 's ledge , even in immobility the flesh like the quick eye persistently and violently aware . " You see we have to say these things to each other first , " he said , satisfied , triumphant almost , that they were being said . " We must say them before we can talk about ourselves . What does your father do ? " " He makes toothpaste , " said the girl . She sat looking past him , the high-cheeked short-nosed face il-  | luminatcd briefly by the fire and resembling a sensitively carved and immaculately painted skull . " He used to make me do everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays put together when everyone else falls in pieces . He used up all his money as fast as he made it , houses in whatever part of the country he liked or I liked but this is how it had to be paid for : learn everything there is to do damned well . He made me do that , swimming , shooting , he dragged me up mountains until I hate the sight of one , Swiss mountains , Canadian mountains . . . " " I 'm going to take you up mountains , " said Dr. Prochaska , his voice neither passionate nor tender making the quiet , unsensational statement of fact . " I 'm going to take you everywhere with me . " " You 're not going to take me to Italy , " she said . " My child , " said Dr. Prochaska without turning , and there could be heard the edge of weariness , almost of irritation in his voice , as if he had perceived at last the hopelessness of speaking at all , " I could n't possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture accurately enough of what is happening here , perhaps then you would understand me . " The girl reached forward and took a cigarette from the box on his table and lit it herself from the lighter in her pocket . " Have n't you a photograph of it ? " she asked , and she made a gesture towards the family photographs before them . " Conveniently and elegantly framed ? " He looked back at the cigarette in her mouth for a  | moment , the resentment going suddenly hot and violent in his eyes . Then he crossed to the table and savagely switched the little lamp into darkness . " Very well , " he said , standing close to the table , his hands down , touching nothing . " Very well , the photograph is like this : granite hills , glaciers , and starvation in spite of what you 're burning up and killing and throwing away into lakes over there . That 's the picture , and I 'm very big in the foreground of it , immense , enormous , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of cowardice every man is entitled to , because I am no longer a man , do you understand ? I am no longer myself even , believing as I do in the future . I am a signal , a sign of what is about to happen , I am , because I have made the choice between existing and not existing , the center of the photograph . " he stood saying this to her in the fire-touched darkness by the table , his voice low , quick , and passionate . " Have you any idea what I want and what every man in this country wants ? " he went on . " I want to be young as every other man is young , and to feel , without the wantonness and the greed America has for well-being , for superlative-being , that I am a part of something thriving , not doomed , and the doom sealed tighter every breath I take . I want to be in love with you , " he said without moving . " I 'm not listening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " you must listen . I want you with  | me , I want you here in my room , I want you going tip mountains , crossing glaciers , going with me wherever it may be I have to go . But I want you to understand . I want you to believe in what I 'm doing ? " " I do n't believe in anything , " she said , smoking , " so you see it would n't do . There was my father , as I was saying . And to him I 've always been Pendennis Queen of Sheba Jones . That 's how eloquent my father 's face got every time he looked at me . Have you ever been loved like that , Herr Doktor , by any of these dear good faces looking at me out of their tidy frames ? My father has a hawk 's nose and a blue eye and he drinks like all get-out . You could n't frame him ! You could n't put him inside a silver beading or whathaveyou and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our quickly from under her in the chair and he saw it , silk-encased and marvellously slender , dart though the flickering tongues of fire-light at the table and strike his mother 's and his father 's face and the faces of his sisters in a little clatter of sound to the floor . " Do n't pick them up now , " she said . " Do it after I 'm gone . " Dr. Prochaska stood quiet and outraged an instant and then at once and in amazement , as though someone else were selecting the words for him out of confusion and setting them in their logical order , he began to see : " She is not even a woman yet .. . eighteen or nineteen maybe . . . like a kid the first time away from home . . . and a bottle of Schnapps  | inside her . . . a whole bottle . . . hating them on the floor there because she misses . . .

" " Like a what ? " said the doctor . " You know , " she said impatiently . " Even if we have n't the same history you know exactly what I mean . My father made a man of me . A highball before dinner every night and your friends are my friends . I 'd have died with my boots on rather than have an inch of lace on me until a year ago , and my tweeds good and my coats done by a tailor , not your old anybody 's tailor but the kind of man who knows where your bones are and what pieces of flesh you would n't mind giving away for Christmas . My father 's in Florida playing golf , yours is lying flat on his face on the rug there . God damn my speechless little country , Herr Doktor , it has n't a word to say to yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood by it , scarcely knowing he had crossed from the fire , standing tense and quiet as if listening to what she said while the mechanically arranged words passed before him in explanation , as if stamped on a tickerribbon unwinding before his still incredulous eyes : " ' Phis is perhaps the first time she 's been away from him . . . not even to boarding-school . . . maybe her mother 's dead . . . no one to tell her except a  | mild ' neck Fnglish husband she somehow married when to get up in the morning or what time to go to bed at night or how many cigarettes are good for little girls . . . no one to tell her for how long as he , her father , must have told her every day : you 're going to do it , my girl , and do it well or you wo n't dare take that drink and meet my eye . . . . " " We ca n't be anything to each other , Herr Doktor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're sentimental , you 're hearts and flowers and I 'm hard broken bits and pieces of things they threw out with the skeletons and cactus ? " Dr. Prochaska sat down on the edge of the table in the half-darkness looking towards the white-faced shape in the chair , waiting for her voice to be done . " Perhaps she has n't eaten . . . that bottle of Schnapps and nothing else . . . and not a word about him , about the husband . . . as if she was n't thinking .. . as if she did n't really want ... " " Look here , " he said suddenly without knowing if she had stopped or if she was still talking , " if you want your husband to come back we could do it , you know . We could get him back ? " " No , " she said , " I do n't want him , " and her voice went on , " it 's because there have always been so many people like you that you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good thing for you . You belong to a permanent thing and to people that do n't change , but that ca n't put me together . Too many parts are gone . " He listened to her hard dry empty  | jerks of laughter , like a very old woman sitting there in the darkness laughing . " I 've been left stranded somewhere , " she said . " By whom ? By what ? " said Dr. Prochaska , swinging his leg and waiting , scarcely heeding what she said . " By myself , " she said . " The blame 's mine . I know very well . By me . My father made me simple as shooting but he could n't save me . " She reached quickly forward from the chair and lifted his hand and put it against her face and he felt the tears running down it . " Kiss me , Herr Doktor , " she said with all the hard bright terrible accouterments of youth laid down like garments discarded , and Dr. Prochaska felt the blood swooning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be saved , " she was saying , and Dr. Prochaska said deliberately and with great weight to his words , as if speaking in that last clear flash of sight and reason which the drowning know before the music begins , " I love you , I can be to you what the others have n't been . "  | Chapter Ten J , VE seen the gazelle in the fire , " said Helmut in the early morning . " I 've seen him . That 's how I know . When the fire is yellow along the top that 's the horns of the gazelle and the more wood you put on the higher he jumps for it . " Between his bed and the window open on the garden was an identical white iron bed in which another boy was lying , and on the other side of him beds stretched the length of the ward to the doorway , white-covered , neatly made , empty or else with the shrouded drawn-up knees of a child lying there , or a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , or else the face when the fever was done , blank and pointed and pale . Down the other wall ran the other row of clean white beds with a space left clear from the doorway to the window , so that all the unrunning feet of these children ill or convalescent patiently edged the ballroom of the intervening space as if halted there in perpetual attendance for the sound of music before they could begin to dance . Here lay Helmut , the round red-haired head like a doll 's unsubtly modeled wooden head with the nose carved button-small upon the front , the black eyes fixed on the window beyond Jochi 's bed ; and Jochi lying with the old snowburn and sunburn bleaching  | and yellowing fast from his face , his blue eyes pale as glass and turned to the window unmoving ; and Karli lying in the other corner by the window with his feet pointing straight to theirs , his hair in dry white curls upon his head and his scalp and the round high bones in his forehead showing clear as marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window watching with quiet unflagging eyes for the birds to come out of the grass and the branches , waiting , with the . submissiveness with which the poor wait , for recovery to come . " I 've seen my mother feed the gazelle with twigs when it was almost dead , " said Helmut . " I 've seen her . When I get up to go to school she puts a handful of salt into the stove to wake the gazelle and I 've seen him jump to catch it . " " That 's a story , " said Karli . His head was turned on the pillow , looking towards the trees . " I 've heard the gazelle running very fast , " said Helmut , and he raised his head and looked quickly at Jochi 's face in the bed beside him and at Karli 's , the pale lip arched a little in contempt , the light goatish eyes still looking away . " You better believe that , " said Helmut . " It 's true . I 've heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's just a story they tell children , " said Karli .

"  | " Christmas ? " said Karli , and he showed his small transparent-seeming teeth , like a girl 's teeth , when he laughed . " 1 was here for Christmas , " saying it the length of himself and his own bed to Jochi without rancor or complaint but as if in pride that he had been the precursor of them all . " If you do n't believe in the gazelle , " said Helmut , raising his head again , " it waits until you are sitting near to the fire sometime and then it jumps out into your lap and runs all over you .

" Look , " he said in a low , transfigured voice . " Two sparrows on the window . " The three boys lay still a moment while the two drab ruffle-breasted birds looked curiously at the stone . " They 've been here before this morning . They ought n't to count , " said Karli , and suddenly there was the split of his hands as he struck them sharply together . The sparrows flew off at once , each with a cry of indignation . " That 's not fair , " said Helmut , and Karli lay writhing with laughing , weak with laughing on his bed . " Anything 's fair , " he said , his voice squeezed tight with triumph , " anything 's fair , " and down at the far end of the ward , near the doorway , Cristabel stood up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caged her in and looked towards the sound of Karli laughing .  | There was a rubber cork in her mouth , stuck there to keep what remained of her youth or her life from spilling down her nightgown and running off over the floor , except that there was no certainty that this was youth or life at all but perhaps a grotesque and neither funny nor convincing imitation of them . She stood up in bed and looked straight towards the window and the sound , her deeply dimpled plump and lard-white hands closed on the bars , her moist silky curls set incongruously as a wreath of living flowers on a baby 's head shaped hastily from lard or dough . Her eyes , with veils of age or illness or merely of unintermitting pain filming the dark brown and the white as well , were loop-holes with the color of cinnamon thumb-smudged on the substance , whether of wax or dough , beneath them , were apertures whose reason for existence had not yet been determined , were , failing as they did to carry vision the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . She looked down the ward toward the window and without seeing , or else refusing to see , she said , " , Mamma , Mamma " to the sound of Karli 's laughter . " No , " Karli called down across the beds , the empty beds and the beds with children lying in them , " she 's not- here , Cristl . You have to go downstairs and cross  | the garden and get out through the gate and walk into town and take the tram on the Andreas-Hofer-Stiamc This was the way the farcical story began every day , or more than once in the day , told in Karli 's smart , piping , humorous voice to Cristabel who was three and who had been half her life there . A week after 1 ) r . Prochaska first arrived from Vienna they brought Cristabel in from the country with diphtheria , and in another day she would have been dead . But Dr. Prochaska and the visiting doctor had put a gold ring around her neck , like a beautiful necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front , where the jewelled clasp should have been , was the small jaw of steel holding something live and leaping in its teeth . It might have been that the rubber stopper was put in her mouth to hold her cries of terror and anguish in , or to keep her breath from passing , for the necklace held the severed end of her windpipe in its teeth and there it fluttered , the linked corneous yellow tube chopped short and sucking for air beneath her chin . " .. , and you get out at the Bahnho f , " Karli was saying to her the length of the ward , " and you get into a train , only be sure it 's going the right way because you do n't want to go to Basle . You ask the train where it 's going . You say to it , Are you going to Vienna or Kufstein ' ? " and the children who were not too ill began laughing , but Jochi and Helmut did not laugh , having heard this too many times over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the doorway , Cristabel held swaying to the bars of her bed , unseeing , unheeding , the rubber stopper fallen from her mouth because she had spoken and pendulant on a string against her nightdress , standing there lard-white and softly bloated like something vaguely human that has drifted a long time with the tide . " . . . and you tell him to stop and let you out at Wurgl , " said Karli , " because that 's where your Mamma is , in case you 've forgotten , and when you get out of the train at Wurgl , you just stand there and yell Mamma , Mamma ' ? " And without any warning but as if this were the signal for which they had been waiting , the step and the murmur and haste of the absent women came into the room , the old women , the young women , their hair in braids or their hair cut short , and some in their peasant clothes for church with the gilt lace on their stiff-brimmed hats and others in their aprons ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karli 's mother , and Helmut 's mother , and Jochi 's mother , and even Cristabel 's mother straight to the beds to which they had no right to come because of what they might bear away in affliction to others . They were poor women , all of them , without the time to come , the wives and the daughters of workingmen or of people from the land , and this could be seen in the constricted and grim patience in their faces , and in their subdued , their almost humble coming to this public institution to which their children  | had been exalted by disease . They did not come with tenderness or with melting look or with any of those recognizable lineaments of love , but with the familiar harassed shrewd look for which the children newly come to lnfcktionhaus cried themselves sick at night , t he critical and passionate eye , the slap and the intent to shape the character towards success as rigidly as they had the flesh in birth .

" " Mamma , Mamma , " said Cristabel , standing up , saying it obediently because it was what she had been told to say . And all the women went quickly among the beds , moving intently and their skirts and their voices rustling , moving swiftly as if to do what they had come to do in haste before Sister Resi or Sister Marianna should betray them . There were almost no kisses exchanged except for the one that Cristabel 's mother , young and her hair cut short and her body swollen with another child to come , put on the back of Cristabel 's bloated hand when she went to the cage to her , or for the sharp rapid embrace on one cheek Karli 's mother gave him as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving fast as she talked but no sound coming from them .

Her eyes moved quickly , warily over everything as she talked , over his hands and his face and the gray nightshirt they had put on him , seeing him after six months without him as a stranger might have seen his tightly drawn seemingly translucent skin and his bones lying languidly in it . " You came here in October and it 's March now . " Her lips shaped the words restlessly and without sound and her eyes ran back and forth and up and down over his body in the covers and his head on the pillow and his long weak arms and hands .

" Mamma , Mamma , " said Cristabel 's voice in the ward , uncertain as a lamb 's on the hillside in the spring , and the ghostly crowd of women who were not there and could not come pressed in between the children 's beds , the shape and the skirt and the intent fixed countenance of one passing effortless through another as rings of light or water widen into space . The tide of women rose and fell and rose and Karli 's  | mother emerged beside him , her lips cracked by the cold and whispering , her eyes swiftly turning in her fragile skull . Your sister this and your brother that and the Herr Oberlehrer something else , and Karli lay looking at her and beyond her through the window and over the windowsill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking joyfully and in a whisper , " there are three blackbirds on the window , " and there were no longer any women in the room . " Sister Resi , Sister Resi , " whispered Karli , " look at the three blackbirds on the window , " and " Ja , ja , " answered Sister Resi without turning her head . She went slipping from one bed to the next , her yellow camel-lip hanging loose and twitching , her large crippled hands smoothing out the pillows behind the links of the children 's sparsely covered vertebrae . " Ja , ja , " went her tongue in her head , like the bell of a leper ringing . " The doctor 's coming now , we have to be ready . Ja , ja , the doctor 's coming down the hall . " Suddenly the blackbird flew in over their heads and the intaken " all " of the children 's voices rose and followed after , like a wave rippling just behind him on the air . He made a brief circular flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palatial old and fly-specked carving of the ceiling . There he clung against the ancient scaling paint , pressed sideways to the cornice , his bright eye turned a little fearfully down on them , quite motionless as if a strong wind held him powerless and leaf-like there . " Sister Resi , look , Sister Resi , " whispered Karli in  | wild trembling joy . There was the bright yellow beak of the blackbird so close above him , so clean and brilliant , and the little bare featherless spot like a smile worn near the bill . Karli sat up , careful and breathless in his bed , pale and transparent in his flesh so that it seemed one could see the delicate veins of blood flowing through him , the green-blue threads that caught and held him in a net of life just visible beneath his deathly silky skin . And " ja , ja , " said Sister Resi pulling the covers straight around him . She was not thinking of the children or of the bird that had flown into the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " cried the children 's voices together as Dr. Prochaska came through the doorway . It might have been music suddenly playing , and Karli was shaking and shivering with delight as if he were dying of the cold .  | Chapter Eleven THERE was singing going on in the wine cellar when Dr. Prochaska and the girl went in , the pale-faced and softly effetelooking young man sitting high on a little platform at one end with the zither on the table before him plucking the tune from the taut and delicately vibrant strings and singing the words that everyone seated at the tables knew and sang out with him . The cellar was small with what seemed to be a lid of ancient dark-stained beams clamped fast upon the ceiling and dark wainscoting behind the benches , so that stepping down into it was like stepping into an ornately decorated box packed full with tables , chairs and people , the whole place quite airless and filled with the tinkling music-box ubiquity of sound . There was not room for more than twenty people there , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what women there were without shape or color , or the young ones with straight unpainted features , straight lightish hair , and tanned quiet faces , watching . Because of the paid musician on Friday night , if you came late you drank your wine standing for a little while until someone left his seat to go , and coming at nine o'clock Dr. Prochaska and the girl stood inside the door waiting , and the men looked up ,  | their eyes altering at once upon her , singing louder as they broke the big tough pretzels in their fingers and drank the misty wine . Overhanging the corner where the stairs ran up there was a cramped little balcony with a door in the wall behind it , a narrow projection made of the beams and the wainscoted wood as if this had once been the window over a stable looking down on an open court below . There was one table prepared on it , and the woman in the black apron led them through the smoke towards the stairway , forcing her hips sideways between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advancing the mountainous flesh wheezingly and with apologetic gasps of laughter clearing a way for the girl and Dr. Prochaska through the crowd . When she had achieved the foot of the stairs and the musician 's stand she drew her breath in and performed the seemingly incredible feat of speaking articulately to the white-faced young man who was not playing for the moment but drinking a glass of wine . " Give them Sage mir nur eimnal . ' They 're all asking for it , " she whispered , and the musician nodded behind the table with the zither on it , and then his blue , red-rimmed and heavily lashed uncertain eyes met the doctor 's and he smiled , the weak , quite colorless face slowly flushing , the soft feminine mouth with the light moustache above it saying , " Guten Abend , I Ierr Doktor , " as implicitly as if there were no one else to hear .  | " God greet you , " said Dr. Prochaska , and his intent dark questioning eyes looked straight for a moment into the musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but holding the query urgently unspoken . The musician 's eyes did not alter even when he began to speak again but met the doctor 's with that look of trust and weakness and love while his mouth began saying the name in a whisper as he straightened the zither before him in preparation to play , " Josef Bitter , Josef , " with his glance suddenly dropped upon the strings , " they got Josef Bitter this afternoon . . . . " " Come upstairs for a glass in the next interval , " said the doctor quickly , and with his hand under the girl 's elbow they followed the woman , two steps behind her because she climbed slowly , lifting and drawing her great limbs like separate burdens , one fat hand clinging to the bannister rail and the little swollen fingers creeping higher inch by inch . " Here we are , " said the doctor , drawing his chair in . He sat looking at the girl on the other side of the table , everything else gone from his face now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , transported into a kind of hard bright perfect isolation of sight . " This is Friday night and here we are . . . . " " Did you think we would n't be ? " she said and she looked down over the balcony at the tables in the Stube at the men with their heads shaved close and their wives beside them , some with their eyes lifted to her , and at the musician 's head bowed to his zither while his pure high voice and the other voices sang  | Sage Hair nur einmal aloud . Six days , and having begun at the end they had now to resurrect an imitation of a past together , regressing thought by thought to the first night she had walked into the Gasthaus and sat down drunk at the table beside him or beyond that to Sunday when they had climbed the mountain or beyond that even to what had from the beginning prepared them for a common tongue . Last Tuesday night when you came into the Gastzimmer and said what you did , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at her with the same dark trembling eyes from which it seemed the passion for her could never lapse , and then he remembered the two nights that came after , less like a continuation than a departure taking them each time a little further from the things that had first committed them to love . " Who is Josef Bitter ? " she said still looking down over the Stube and the tendrils and pools of motionless blue smoke and the singing people seen as if below the surface of the stopped dry fluid air . Dr. Prochaska 's face gathered at once the intent guarded look of watchfulness again . " He 's a boy who lives up in Kirchstadt , " he said and he would have let it end there but the girl leaned forward as if to see the musician 's fingers moving below them on the strings and she said , " I 'm waiting to hear the rest . " " He 's one of the boys who 's been making his living lighting fires , " said Dr. Prochaska . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the carafe of  | cold white wine and set it down and put the basket of pretzels between them . " I will bring the Herrschaf ten the goulash at once , " he said . " And another glass , " said the doctor . The waiter looked at the two bright-stemmed glasses an instant and the doctor lifted his quick impatient hand . " Yes , a third one , " he said . " I want a third glass . " When the waiter had drawn his towel through his arm and gone , the doctor put his fingers around the neck of the carafe and poured the wine into the girl 's glass and then into his own . She was sitting smoking , her black hat on the front of her head and her hair combed back behind the small carved buttons in her ears , her eyes half-closed as if in protection from the smoke or else to overcome the obstacle distance imposed between them and the covered courtyard of the drinking place below . " What sort of fires ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick little swallow of wine into his mouth and let it slide sharply down his tongue . " The kind of fires you see on the mountains at night , " he said , ready to let it end . " Well , go on , " she said in a minute , the cigarette hanging from her lip and her face screwed up from the smoke of it like a boy 's still unaccustomed hard tough face , not used yet to the bite or smoke or cutting of the breath . " The fires are not allowed . The law of the country  | forbids them , " said Dr. Prochaska , and then he stopped short when the waiter came running nimbly up the stairs with the two dishes of goulash and the paper napkins in his hands . The music had ceased in the Stube below and the people at one table paid their money out and left while others came in from the street , drifting like swimmers through the disturbed currents of heat and smoke to the empty places . The musician wiped the strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the platform . He was wearing gray knickerbockers and mountain shoes and the short gray woolen jacket that the country people wore . Going upstairs the musician passed the waiter coming down . " You 're the third glass , are you ? " the waiter said , stopping amiably as if to chat , but the musician passed him taking two steps at a time , scarcely nodding , and the look of homage and trust and love was in his face again when he stood by the doctor 's table . When Dr. Prochaska said the girl 's name to him , he drew himself up in his jacket and brought his heels together and bowed from his waist toward her . She did not speak but she lifted her hand and took the cigarette from her mouth . Then he sat down on the three-legged stool beside the doctor , just hidden by the side of the wall from the room beneath them , just out of sight from whomever might be below . " They got Bitter this afternoon , " he said , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him . " I saw Praxlmann two hours ago . He was  | expecting you in for supper there this evening and you would have known from him . I 'll go up to Kirchstadt tomorrow and take care of the side Josef would have been covering tomorrow night . Praxlmann said he would ask you to go up Sunday and take care of Sunday night ? " " Yes , " said Dr. Prochaska , watching him with his dark brilliant living gaze . " There 's a ski-meet Sunday and there 'll be lots of movement , " the musician went on , talking over the edge of his glass still , his pale blue eyes red-rimmed and thickly lashed and moving shyly in his not wellshaven rather soiled white face . " Yes , " said Dr. Prochaska , sitting quietly with his arms on the table and watching , harking , seeing beyond the eyes , the face , the bottle-green lapels to something else that had not the shape of one man but of many , listening for this message as it came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensable human mouthpiece that was for the moment the musician , and would be at another time the hotel-keeper , and at another a voice speaking on the radio . " So it makes it all the more important for there to be someone busy there on Sunday night , " the musician was saying . " I 'm playing at Wurgl and ca n't get away . I can take care of Saturday night and the others are seeing to tonight and if you could go up on Sunday . . . " " Yes , " said the doctor again . Without dropping his  | eyes but looking still at and beyond the face with the wine glass lifted level with the mouth before him , he ran one open hand over his hair , back over the straight thick short locks to his neck , the narrow gypsy-dexterous and sensitive hand pausing on the clipped hairs above the navy collar of his flannel shirt . " Yes , " he said , " I can go up late tomorrow night , on the twelve-three , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in the evening . If I get back to the hospital by eight Monday morning that will do . " " There 's a freight running down at six every weekday , " said the musician , and the doctor , whose eyes had not moved , seemed only then to perceive his empty glass and filled it . " Yes , " said the doctor , " they might let me on that , " and the musician went on saying , " You 're to oversee the south side then , all the territory from the Stuber hut as far as Franz Engels ' house . There ought to be three laid out and lit there . The snow could n't be better , unless it rains . I was down it last night . You 'll see Praxlmann before you go . " He finished his wine quickly , the black of his fingernails showing against the glass , and then he stood up and made the bow from his waist , his heels smartly brought together , smiling at the doctor alone under his pale sparse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch over the side of the balcony as he emerged below and climbed onto the platform and sat down before his  | zither while the talking voices subsided as if a hand had waved for silence in the room . " Where are we going tomorrow night ? " she said when the music began . Dr. Prochaska had started eating his goulash quickly and now he stopped and took a swallow of wine . " You 're not going , my girl , " he said and he filled his fork with potato . " Yes , " she said , " I 'm going . " The doctor finished his goulash , eating quickly , wolfishly , and breaking off bits of bread in his fingers to push the meat in the dark red sauce as he ate . When he was done he took a toothpick out of the little cup before him and wedged it between his clear white even teeth . " I ca n't take you , " he said . " It is n't just this once , it 's something that 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a long climb up and there 's no reason for you to be there . No matter how many they put in jail the fires must go on burning . " " Why ? " said the girl . She had taken her little box out of her pocket and was putting her lip salve on with her finger . " As a sign of what is going to happen , " said the doctor , " and to maintain we are ready for it . They could put half the country in jail and the other half would go on lighting the fires . " He was not only not arguing but he seemed scarcely to be telling her these things as facts or information , his voice warm and rich and merry even , arraigning the impotency of any-  | thing those others could do . " They lock up one man for a little while , " he said , " but they ca n't keep him in forever . When he gets out he goes back to what he was doing and while he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they get you ? " she said , taking her powder out . " They wo n't get me , " said the doctor . " I 'll go up as if for the ski-meet Sunday and try to hop that freight on Monday morning . That 's twenty-four hours without ... " " No , " said the girl , " it 's not . I 'm going with you . " Dr. Prochaska picked up the printed menu card and he said , " My heart , there is apple strudel and negroes in white shirts or golden-tiroler cheese for dessert ? " " I 'd like a toothpick , " she said . " Pass them over . You make even a toothpick look quite correct . " " You 'll wait at the hotel for me , " said Dr. Prochaska , looking at her over the table . " I 'll come straight there when I get into the station . You 'd better get used to this now . " " No , " she said , " I 'm not going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hotel in any country in the world and wait for anyone to come home . " She looked down over the room and the people in it , seeing the glasses of wine and the carafes , seeing the movement driftingly through the smoke from the reindeer pipes and the cigarettes , and the musician 's bent head with the part lying white through the pale unblooded hair , and the faces of the others , dimmed and softened by smoke and distance to the vagueness of those uncer-  | tainly living people who used to waver across the screen in the mottled flickering moving pictures of a long time back . " If I 'm living with you then I 'm not sitting waiting in a grand hotel for you to do what you have to do and then come back . It 's as if you were living somewhere very hot and fast and then coming back afterwards to nothing . But I 'm not understudying for nothing , you see . I have n't got time to play parts like that . I 'm getting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you if that 's a man down there with bottle green lapels on his coat or a relief map of the country . . . . " Even when it was dark in the doctor 's room and the window open on the garden the words went on , saying , " I 'm not pretending I want to go , I 'm saying I do n't want to go but that I 'm not going to be left behind . Something happens to people when you leave them behind , you can take that from me . You put them aside and then something like death or first cousin to it happens because you 've refused them an act . It 's like putting a seal of some kind on me when you say you 're not going to live tomorrow , my girl , you 're going to sit absolutely tight where you are and like it , like saying I 'm really awfully sorry but you 've drawn your last breath , you know , drunk your last drop , is n't that just too bad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me behind , first he left me inside by pushing out ahead and getting born twelve minutes before me , and that was just the beginning , only it might have been something else , too , it might have  | been the end and all the rest of the time we were just trying to get back as close as we 'd once been together . And what did he do next , " and the doctor listening and touching her fingers beside him heard her laughing as though something funny had been said , " they brought us home tortoises one afternoon , maybe you 've never seen them here , live ones with paste jewels wedged into their shells and making a pattern all over , very cheap and gaudy . And Gerald took the scissors before I even thought of it and clipped off everything that was sticking out around the edges , the feet of the turtle and the tail and the head , only the neck was tougher sawing through . He always said all the funny things first , I never could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were about three when that happened , the tortoises , and when we were eight this thing happened , mother went out riding with us , riding Gerald 's little horse because she had been sick for a long time and the horse was small and quiet . Gerald rode father 's big strong horse because he rode better than any of us , better than father even . Before that Gerald used to go out in the stable when everyone was away , and I know this is true only I always get it mixed up with a story about George Washington only it is n't the same . " She lay talking to him , her voice clear and disembodied in the darkness , her face , like the faces of the ill asleep above them , turned towards the tree-black night in the open window . " Gerald went into the stable every day for a month  | without saying a word and stroked the little unbroken horse and then the horse began waiting for him to come . And then he began putting the bridle over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never put the bit in his mouth , not for a long time after . The horse stayed quiet with the saddle and bridle on , only he shook with fright and all the time Gerald left it on him he never stopped shaking , but Gerald waited week after week because he always knew very well what was going to happen in the end and he never hurried . And in September , I think it was in September , he came riding out of the barn one day on the horse and father was driving up the road . I remember him driving a two-wheeled cart , whatever you call it , and when he saw Gerald on the horse that nobody was to touch he drew his reins up and stopped and he took the whip out of the thing by the dashboard , " and the doctor lay listening , the fingers of her soft open hand drawn close against his mouth . " And he stood up in the fly and when Gerald on the little horse came shying past him he lashed out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right across the face and the string of the whip wrapped several times around his neck the way it does when you lash at grass . The horse ran away for three hours with Gerald on him and Gerald saved him by not being afraid and by letting him go until he was tired and then he came back and walked into his own stall in the barn with Gerald still sitting on him . That 's how he got the horse . Father thought Gerald was  | killed and when he saw him back he ran out to the barn and gave it to him for a present and even then , the little horse very meek-looking and foam on his neck and his brown hair curling all over him with sweat , he tried to kick father when he came into the stall , and this was the horse mother got onto . He 'd been broken a year and everyone knew how he went under Gerald and he was so little nobody was afraid . Gerald and mother and I went out and father was in French Lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white checked habit , not a very pretty one , and she looked severe in her hard hat but at the same time helpless and aging , but not really aging either but as if she 'd had enough of it all and she did n't care what happened next , and at the same time a little bit afraid of what was going to happen . We were going to a place we called Scotland , off the road and over a couple of ditches and a stream and mother did n't like it . She kept a tight rein on the little horse and he was tossing the bit on his tongue and trying to get his head around to look her in the eye , and she kept saying to Gerald that he should dismount and let her have the horse he was riding but Gerald said , This one 's bigger so if you fall off you 'll fall harder , ' and mother said , I 'm going to repeat every word you 've said to me to your father , ' looking helpless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald that if he 'd get off she 'd give him five dollars . Ile was to get off and help her down and hold the other horse while she got onto it . He was to stop by  | a fence somewhere so she could get down and up again and then she 'd give him the five dollars right away . But Gerald said that was n't enough , he wanted ten dollars , and by that time she was getting tired because she 'd been ill and she did n't like the angle of the horse climbing up the kind of perpendicular way Gerald liked to ride and she promised him ten dollars . But Gerald said he would n't do it for less than seventeen . But she would never in the world give him that much , she said . I remember very well . She said she was going to write to father in French Lick about how Gerald had acted , but there was never any use in her talking that way because we knew as well as she did that there was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care what she wrote or if she never wrote to him . Gerald said , If I let you on this big old horse you can pay me for it . You wanted to ride my little horse and you can pay me for the time you 've been riding him . You can pay me ten dollars for the time you 've been riding my little horse and you can pay me seven dollars more for me to get down and stop near a fence so you can get off and get on again . That makes seventeen dollars you owe me . That is n't much . ' He kept saying that over and over for a long time because he knew if he said it long enough she would give in in the end . We went over one ditch all right but I did n't look back for the water because I thought mother was crying and I did n't want to see her holding the horse in too tight , and we do n't even know what frightened the  | horse . Gerald was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been nothing frightened the horse mother was riding but anyway we did n't see what happened or if he just went up on his hindlegs and shook her down backwards into the stream . The water was n't deep and mother lay there on her back with her hat still on and the little horse walked quietly after us , shaking his head . I turned around and got to her first and she looked up at me , still looking very severe and she said , You tell Gerald that if he 'll stop and let me down now I 'll give him the seventeen dollars , ' and that was the last thing she said . Gerald rode back into the water but he did n't get off his horse and he said , All right , you get up then and give me the seventeen dollars , ' and then in a minute we knew she was dead . " Dr. Prochaska touched her cheek with his hand and tried to turn her face to his face in the darkness , looking down on the almost-seen white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft still-painted mouth , feeling again as he had felt the first night that he was just beginning to know , just now just beginning to see . " But you and I are starting farther back than that , " he said , " farther back than you can remember . . . . " But her voice began speaking again and her face was turned from him , like the faces of the children lying ill , towards the open window with the trees standing in it . " And you come along , " she said , " talking about  | romance , all the emotions very pretty , a little domesticated , talking about divorce , marriage , law , as if those words meant anything , anything ! ? as if you belonged to a civilization I know nothing about , never heard of . I have n't told you half of what I wanted to tell you . What I started to say about Gerald to you was this : when he was seventeen he hung himself , and I was his twin , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dr. Prochaska , stroking the ripple of hair back from her forehead with his open hand . " You told me last night . You told me , you know . " " No , " she said , " I did n't tell you . I get just so far and then I ca n't go on . I told you something , but that was just the beginning of it , because when he hung himself it was just the beginning of what had happened to Gerald and me not once but over and over . . . . " Dr. Prochaska 's hand ceased moving on her hair , but it was not as if he were waiting for the words to come but as if he had heard them before they came , or as if without hearing them or ever having to hear them , he knew . " Just one act , one act on top of another , like the last thing Gerald did , has to be all the things you can never say out loud and then the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began saying things to me for the first time and telling me how he felt about mother and making the confessions he never made , because that one last act was the only thing in life nobody ever stopped him doing . It was the only way he had of  | saying , Pendennis , I ca n't get on without you , ' because words were absolutely no use to him . . . . " " Yes , " said the doctor , " yes , " and he lay unmoving and a little apart in the dark beside her , believing for a moment that he felt nothing now until she said to him , with her face still turned towards the window , " Do n't leave me alone in a room somewhere , do n't leave me , I 'm afraid . "  | Chapter Twelve /HENEVER the new boy woke up in the ward he said , " Sister , I want to go home , " and the women in bed could hear him saying it through the door that was locked between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three women who were recovering from diphtheria now , the burgomaster 's daughter and the newspaper seller from the stand in the station and the dressmaker from the Zillerthal . They had not seen him but still in listening for him and talking of him they began to see him , his cheeks stained with fever and his body and limbs drawn hourly longer and whiter and thinner , with death holding him fast and grim by the feet and pulling and grinning , and life or what he knew or now remembered of it with her hands in his curls and pulling hard the other way . They were drawing him out , like a string drawn taut between them , life at one end of it and death at the other , and when they had stretched him fine enough the string would snap in two . " How old is he then ? " asked the dressmaker when Sister Marianna came in with the little glasses of oil and Sister Marianna moving dreamily on her soft soles towards the beds said , " Oh , three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one portion of the  | dream through which one passed was scarcely to be counted off in periods of time but merely there to be relinquished lightly , like a garment laid aside at night . " Will he have to be here a long time ? " asked the burgomaster 's daughter , and Sister Marianna murmured , " Not very long now , not very long , " and gathered up the empty glasses in her hand . " He wants to go home , poor little mouse , " said the lady from the newspaper stand and Sister Marianna answered , talking to them dreamily and peacefully as she went out the door , " Ja , ja , surely . Surely he will go home in a little while . " The dressmaker sat up in the narrow bed , clean and sharp and bright-looking with her thin brown hair curled in a fringe across her forehead , and worked fiercely at a little blue skirt she had in her hands . The words she said shook the spoons and the empty cups and the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corpse-like white of the hospital room and the strong white medicinal-smelling air with the nervous viciousness with which her needle stabbed through cloth . " I do n't believe it 's right for me to go home , " she said in her quick strained voice . " I told the doctor I do n't think he should let me go . I 'll go home at the end of the week as they want me to and in three days the whole family will be here with diphtheria . I know how it will be . " " You must n't see everything in the worst possible light , " said the lady from the newspaper stand . She  | lay large and soft and languid in bed , dwarfing the pallet 's width , filing her curved nails . She could speak French well and she also knew a little English and because of this she dispensed an easy worldly presence , acquired not alone from the amount she had traveled , three times to Paris and once to Munich , but as well from the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tauchnitz books in the station . She had large Hebraic features , black curly hair , a woman of forty maybe with a thickly pored skin and a large dark amorous eye bulging beneath the heavy lid . But there was nothing Hebraic in her blood , not a drop of it : the arched nose and the quality of the flesh and the hair were common enough in Upper Austria and they meant nothing at all . Perhaps it was the Italians or the Hungarians who were to blame for the swarthiness so many of these mountain people had . A bastard group they seemed among the blond-plaited blueeyed Aryans who were there as well , but all of them , dark and light alike , rich with a bastard senseless gaiety . Not like the German thing for an instant , but without organization or enterprise , Slavicly and even bitterly merry at the thought of being alive at all . " You may be negative tomorrow , " said the lady from the newspaper stall , doing her nails , but the dressmaker stitched wildly on , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one woman to the other as she worked .  | " What do these doctors care ? " she said . " Dead or alive you 're exactly the same thing to them . They do n't care at all . You can be taken care of three weeks here and then out you go . Unless there 's a complication . My heart is n't bad , so they tell me , so out I go . " " Sister , I want to go home , " said the new boy in the children 's ward , and the burgomaster 's daughter said : " Dr. Prochaska says some people carry it all their lives . They do n't really have it , of course , but they give a positive reaction every time . " Her eyes were dark and quiet in her smooth , full face and her hands were knitting with coarse gray wool on the covers before her . " They call them carriers . " " Then I ought to live by myself , " said the dressmaker , stitching frantically in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and active as a hen 's eye , as if to catch the look of acquiescence before it had time to escape from their faces . " Dr. Prochaska is a human doctor , " said the burgo-11 master 's daughter . She had been away to Vienna to school , she had studied science , she knew music and had talked to him of this . " Some of them I used to know in the city were in it for the science only ? " " At least he 's a gentleman , " said the lady from the newspaper stand from the transcendency of one who knew . She put the nail file down and with her supple pointed fingers picked up her pack of cards from the tin table by the bed . " If I 'm going to die , " said the dressmaker , sewing  | in desperation across the cloth , " I must say I do n't care if it 's a gentleman or a butcher who kills me . " " Sister , I want to go home , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were crying now , they heard him say , " Heim , Heim , Heim ? " " He wants to go home ! Now what do you think of that ? " said Karli 's voice through the door and the children began tittering with him . In a little while , as it happened every day , the hours being too long to fill with talk of the places they came from or talk of their families who could not come to them here or talk of birth and death or clothes or travel or other places , they began to talk of the condition their country was in and speak of the one man who might give prosperity to them , saying his name and speaking of him as women of another less-desperate country might speak of an actor of whom they dreamed at night , in the same pleased self-conscious voices that women in a country of tearooms might talk of an idol of the screen . Or at least it was in this way the lady from the newspaper stand and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were parched with fear of the illness she was being forced to carry home and she scarcely seemed to hear the alteration in their voices or to see the burgomaster 's daughter 's photograph of him , cut from a printed page and folded up small and kept within the lining of her handbag , the black cross on his arm , the black lock falling on his forehead .  | The burgomaster 's daughter slept with this at night , opened out and her palm pressed on it under her pillow in warm soft feminine salute . The lady from the newspaper stall spoke of him as " A. , " not for the sake of secrecy , which was not needed here , but more for the taste of intimacy it gave anything she said . " When A. used to walk through the streets , " she said in those voluptuous lingering tones which lent just that touch of delectable contiguity to thrill the blood , " the mothers with babes in arms held their children out to him so that he could touch their brows and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one boy , I knew him myself , he was in love with the niece of my laundress , and he got over the frontier in October . He 's got a good job there now and good pay and there 's such comfort everywhere , he writes ... and once he was able to get quite close to A. during a meeting  --  A. was walking quite naturally just like a common person among the crowd it seemed ? and this boy , he touched A. 's sleeve , imagine it . And what do you think he did ? A. turned at once and smiled right into this boy 's face and this boy told A. he was Austrian and he said something to him that he 'd been planning for months to write to him . He said , Because you could not come to our country I left it and came to you , ' and it seems A. put his arm around his shoulders ? " Her voice was no longer an instrument recording fact but a lustful loose-lipped cry for him and her eyes swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had raised herself on one  | naked elbow , speaking of this man as if he were a lover not a stranger to her , with the secret curve of her mouth confirming and denying nothing , her nightdress undone at the throat now as it lay loose and open every night while she drifted to sleep in the dark with the thought , the desire , the almost palpable presence of the man there close , closer than the women in the room or than any of her kin . Or the burgomaster 's daughter told the story over again which her brother had told her of how two men of the forbidden party had saved Hofer from the Innsbruck jail . " His two friends went into the jail and left their car outside , " she said , telling it quietly with the knitting slowly growing in her hands , " and they told the jailer they had brought a little fruit for Hofer and they wanted to speak to him just for a minute if they could . And when the jailer , whom my brother always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hofer 's cell the two of them pushed the jailer inside and pulled Hofer out , ran quickly down into the car and drove straight out of the country before the alarm had spread . My brother never stopped talking about the reception they had for him on the other side . There was feasting for three days and it did our cause more good for them to hear what Hofer had to say about conditions and the profiteering here than anything since Suchenwirt went over . " " They 're not all as good as they make out , " said the dressmaker from the Zillerthal and her needle  | went viciously through the cloth . " There 's Gluck from Tirol and they say he lives like a prince on the party funds , and I 've heard they do n't care how much they drink or what kind of orgy they go in for ? " " Oh , you must n't swallow stories like that whole ! " said the lady from the newspaper stand as she shuffled her pack of cards . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could n't possibly know . I know for a fact from indisputable authority that A. wo n't tolerate any extravagance . You go over the frontier and you 've got to work , but the secret is there is work there . This boy says the food 's good and plenty of it too in Dachau . I 'm sure you have n't heard , for instance , that A. is so sensitive to music that a single false note played in a composition will annoy him so that he will have to leave the building . I know this for a fact , and the gentleman who told me went on to say that it is astonishing to see anyone as gentle as A. lose his temper , but just a false note played will jar upon him so ... " " Sister , Sister , I want to go home , " said the voice from the boy in the other room , repeated to them , over and over and over , like a tune in the head , like the words of a song they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night when Dr. Prochaska came down the hall and the women were asleep , the burgomaster 's daughter with the photograph under her pillow and the lady from the newspaper stand erecting virtue by virtue in her dreams a figure so heroic that , in becoming the example each man set  | himself and the man each woman carried in her blood , he was deprived of features , flesh and not alone of homogeneousness but even of reality , bearing resemblance in the individual mind to Plato , Gary Cooper , Lenin , or the Son of God , like a statue each one raised to love of man or love of liberty . Passing the open door of the children 's ward the doctor saw the screen the sisters had put around the new boy 's bed , three panels containing the candlelight within and on one the shadow of Sister Resi magnified to a grotesque and static pattern , appalling as the tomb , the sight of his death screened off from whatever children might be lying awake listening in the darkness or from whatever terrible apparition might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Prochaska paused a moment on his way downstairs , hearing the small hard-given moans of protest the new boy jerked out against the everlasting cold and dark of an extinction he had not yet ceased to fight . He had been dying for three hours , refusing it as a cat refuses death with tooth and claw and hair gone mad , fighting for this breath and the next one as they came to split his lungs apart , but dying , and Sister Resi sitting snoring in the chair beside him , her shadow like a monstrous camel watching by his bed .  | Chapter Thirteen IHE American girl and the doctor just made the station in time , just caught that Saturday night the Schnellzug that leaves Feldbruck a few minutes after midnight twice a week and runs swiftly out over the smooth scarcely rising valley towards the mountains . The cars of it are long elegant modernly lined vehicles that cleave suavely to the rails , having come a long way and from smarter places , from Paris maybe , and on their way , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna , Bucharest , or even farther , changing their motivation as easily as the accomplished voyagers in the diners change their money . The long windows are lighted in the night as the train glides , winding swiftly , along the richly swerving torrent of the river and flashes past the smooth aprons and falls , twelve or fifteen cars or more drawn gleaming and swaying onward through the darkness to the greater darkness of the mountains before them , without smoke and with no glowing tunnel of flame or sparkle of fuel cast upward but only with the lighted drawingroom windows of the cars de luxe and the quickly clicking electric language of their advance . The third-class carriages coupled on by the engine were filled with skiers going higher for the ski-meet  | Sunday , with the thin-lipped brown-necked and quiet men and women all dressed in dark seemingly interchangeable clothing , a special race of economically muscled and flexible-boned beings who had apparently never over-eaten or over-drunk or even become aware that there were such abuses of the flesh . Some had come from a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight-drawn weariness of this was in their faces , but none of them carried more than the rucksack which was now kicked beneath the seat and the ski sticks and the pairs , crossed from luggage-rack to luggage-rack above their heads , of dark-varnished broad long skis . This might have been in no sense a holiday on which they were setting out at midnight in dark clothes , their shoes not new and in their faces as well as in their garments the same mark of endurance , the unsensational committance to something that was for the moment not there , either to snow or danger or to the reckless precision of what they had done yesterday and what they were about to do . They had nothing to meet disaster with but the metal ski-tip in the rucksack , the brown hands and the short-clipped hair and the bare throats , the mens ' and girls ' alike , but they had crossed many valleys to come to this valley with nothing but cheese and dry bread and a comb and a bit of soap maybe on their backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses it had served , and a change of shirt and socks , and the teeth pure white in contrast to the wind-burned and snow-  | burned lips and faces of these skiers born in the country and knowing the country well , not holidaymakers dressed up for sport on a Sunday and shouting it aloud from one end of a holiday train to the other . Tomorrow the men would be hurtling off snow-packed platforms into the absolute nothingness of space , minus even the unfolding of a parachute to give dignity and presence to their descent , the faces set even now with the alert and unheroic look of resolution , and the women , the most of them , would be entering the ski-races down ice-hard slopes steep as a cliff 's edge on which the skis clattered aloud like wooden shoes as they took the corners , rattling sideways as they flashed around the red paper route flags and shot , with steel edges screaming , across the sheer smooth ice to the quick-grinding and powerful flourish of the end . Across the racks was laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and re-crossed , with the bamboo or the hickory sticks run through the foot bindings , and the skiers sat under , riding with the motion of the train . They were traveling all night to ski all day as if this were the natural and necessary order of things in a country where little work could be had , a strong-thighed nomadic army of women and men among whom the doctor and the girl sat like alien people , not a part of the movement in spite of their dress and their weapons , not a true part of this silent and purposeful advance upon the snow . It was as if the doctor were carrying Vienna and the good rugs  | and the silver frames and the handsomely embroidered things like money in his pocket among these others who had none , and it could be seen in the cut of his dark blue gabardine knickerbockers and in the white cuff of his sock and the fit of his jacket on the shoulders and the care of his hands . There was no air in the long over-heated car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather and drying wool , and the doctor and the girl sat between the skiers and the window against which the darkness seemed to stand , black and unfleeing , seemingly arrested against the glass . The girl smoking beside her own reflection in the window was singular among them not only because of the paint on her face and the white unburned skin of her neck and brow but because of the other things seen in her as they are seen at once in an American city street , pace and display and an entirely youthful and spoiled conception of what is sophistication and what is enough , so commonplace in America that no one stops to look but startling when transplanted from its soil . " When do we get to Kirchstadt ? " she was saying to Dr. Prochaska , and now the Schnellzug had glided into the gorges and the hollow sound of the water and of motion echoed roaring up the deep sheer walls of stone . " It will be about three in the morning , " said the doctor . " We will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , Tartar beefsteak , if you like , and drink heuriger. "  | " When do we see the others ? " she said . She was looking at the two women seated opposite them , pressed too like aliens between the close-lipped skiers who rode quietly , their arms folded , towards another triumph or defeat . The two women were dressed as well for snow but for a milder less relentless snow , with golden powder laid thickly on their skin . They were not quite alike but still they might be sisters , both with the rich Oriental mouths and noses of another people , both with the heavy flesh and slow sulky eyes of creatures of another species among these quickly moving and hollow-cheeked athletic women and men . " Tomorrow night , " said the doctor . " We 'll sleep in a Gasthaus tonight . " The two women on the other side wore heavy woolen socks like all the others but they had added little scarlet tassels at the ankles of their soft-fleshed shapeless legs and instead of traveling bare-headed they wore red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich oily undulations of their hair . " When there is trouble , the fact that I slept at anyone 's house would be something to go on , so that 's why . . . " said the doctor 's voice to her , just barely heard through the gorge 's high stone roar . " They 've been to prison and I have n't yet . That I visited any one of them on such and such a night the first week in March and spent the night there might put a stop ? " " With a woman , " said the girl . " Going up into the mountains with a woman you 've known six days . "  | " No , " said the doctor , talking softly to the side of her face and the hair against her ear , " that would n't come into it . You would n't be a moral issue but a political one . You 'd go to prison with me . I told you that . " The girl sat smoking and looking at the harem queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decked out for snow , at their hands lying biscuit white and soft on their knees , their tapering feline fingers sharply and ornately nailed . " You 'd be implicated , " said the doctor 's voice , only a little humorously . " I 've told you this . You know I want you to stop . I want you to keep clear of it . " " Stop ? " said the girl . " I ca n't stop . That 's the trouble with me . " She let the smoke drift out of her mouth while she watched the rich-skinned women shrewdly through her half-closed seemingly myopic eyes . " Going up another mountain as though I liked doing it , riding in a train all night and getting my hands dirty , and what will I be doing tomorrow ? Going up a funicular railway for the sake of getting higher when I ca n't stand altitudes , two hours ' climb on skins after that until I can see into every damned little Balkan state in Europe , and then what ? Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm fed up to here with anything like exercise . " She sat looking straight ahead through the scarcely moving smoke at the two women in their striped caps . " And why am I doing it ? Something like Marlene Dietrich kicking off her high heels and following Whathaveyou over the desert maybe ? Do n't you be-  | lieve it . I 'm doing it because I 'm sick of the sight of my own face in the mirror and I have n't a book to read and there is n't a show worth seeing . I 'm like any vulgar member of a crowd at an accident and even if I do n't like exertion much I 'll climb a post if I have to do that to see the gore . " And in the same voice , as though continuing the sentence from where it had not quite stopped , she said , " Let them implicate me . Even that 's not going to interest me in politics . " " Pendennis , " said Dr. Prochaska quietly to the side of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the day again without you . I am the one who knows you should not come , Praxlmann knows it , he spoke to me about it and yet here you are . You should be set aside at times like these and you are not set aside . I should be going here alone and I am not going alone , " and Pendennis , as though she had not known he was speaking , looked straight at the two women sitting within hand 's reach and said to them , " Are you going to Vienna ? " The largest one had caught her eye and saw the lips moving and the look of question pointed at them from the young foreign girl 's face . " Were you speaking to me ? " she said , leaning forward to hear and to be heard more clearly and when the question came again she said , smiling , " No , we are going to Kirchstadt for the ski-meet tomorrow , not to enter it , of course , but to watch , " her harem-soft and harem-seductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking-cap closer to the smooth black waves of hair . " But you do live in Vienna , I suppose ? " said the girl , still smoking , and the rich smile of welcome carved the other woman 's face as well . " Oh , yes , in Leopoldstadt , " said the second sister , leaning forward . " Our brother is coming up to jump in the ski-meet , and then we 'll be going on back to Vienna with him again . " " This young man comes from Vienna , " said the girl and she made a gesture , without turning towards the doctor . His face did not alter as he offered them cigarettes from the packet he took from his pocket and held the match in his hand for them , but the two ladies smiled humbly , eagerly at him , the delicate black silk hairs of their moustaches just visible at the corners of their mouths . They were returning from a holiday in Switzerland , the first one said , having gone as far as that for the sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the girl , watching them through the smoke . " The people are so intolerant in Tirol , " said the other sister and her dark bovine eyes rolled heavily from side to side in her thickly powdered face . " There is no feeling in Vienna , of course , but one feels it out of the city , " talking to them in her gaudy cap while her eyes moved with an anciently and deeply wounded but cannily guarded look of grievance over those others packed close about them on the benches of the steadily climbing train . " We always say we  | wo n't go anywhere in Tirol any more if we have to stop at small places , but then our brother telegraphed us up there to come ... " " What sort of thing can they do to you here ? " said the girl , smoking and not looking at the doctor but drawing the women out in the low quickly and cautiously spoken speech they were not afraid to give a foreigner . " Oh , it 's more that the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't like sitting down to meals in small hotels where something might be said . There are even times when we have been told there arc no rooms to be had .... " " If you do n't know Kirchstadt , " said the doctor , speaking for the first time , " then you should try the Theresien . Possibly the others might be ? " " Full ? " asked the first sister and the second one repeated , " Full , yes , of course , they might be full ... thank you . It 's very kind of you . " " This young man 's in the races tomorrow , " said the girl , making the movement again with her hand and the cigarette in it towards the doctor , and the dark eyes of the women rolled with pleasure on him , their flamboyantly curved smiles drawn up beneath their noses . " That will give us someone else to watch for , " said the first one  --  if you will permit us , prayed the humble and propitiatory eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make so bold .  | At Kirchstadt not only the two Jewesses , muffled and shapeless in their woollens and coats and their paraphernalia of tassels and pompons rose , but the entire car stamped to its feet and the pyramids of skis were taken , pair by pair , from the racks and the corners and carried by the rows of soberly dressed and quietly speaking people who moved , step by step like a chain gang advancing , towards the two ends of the car . The doctor lifted the rucksacks and the skis down and saddled himself with the big sack while the girl took the shoulder-strap of the other one in her hand . They moved into the row of people , step by step , step by step progressing towards the cold dark silent exits of the open doors . On the station platform there was little light , and here in the drifts of old scarred snow that stood along the rails the movement of the skiers opened out like the opening of a fan and the dark-dressed figures poured across the tracks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway where the station-master stood outlined against the oblong of meager light . The doctor gave their tickets over to the man and went with the girl and the others through the station-room and out onto the country road on the other side . Over the mud and the ruts of it was a little sprinkling of fresh white snow but overhead the stars were out so that no more would be falling . There was a streetlamp lit near the station door and then the darkness began , very beautiful and clear and high , and the skiers with their ruck-  | tacks on their backs and carrying their skis began to disappear singly or in couples or in groups without hesitation into the night , knowing even at three in the morning exactly where they were to go . " It 's not far , " said the doctor , passing from the pale whitish radius of the streetlamp 's light , the two pairs of skis carried tips downward from the shoulders . Before them went the sound of the other feet , steady and strong like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road into the chasm of dark . And whither , whither , the doctor 's heart cried out in sudden anguish and elation in him , and he felt as pain in his blood the strangely exalted darkness through which they moved and the springing arch of the unseen sky and the unseen mountainous land . Where are they going and where do we follow them except deeper into the snow and the dark and the country , and this is the answer , and now a marvellously stirring thing intoxicated the doctor 's blood as he walked with the girl walking not far from him , a marvellous sense of living , of being alive and of giving life , as if his flesh and the fire in it were rich enough to embrace the world as great music or as the words of a great faith were gigantic enough to give the world a wild and terrible embrace . He felt his own body pressing on through the dark , his own limbs prodigiously equipped for everything that was to come , his flesh clean , his power abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marvellously alive . I lc could almost hear the music playing , as if sweep-  | ing down from a symphony of the constellations , and for a moment he felt his mind swoon as the breath came cool into his nostrils and the words for which he could take no responsibility poured into his understanding . For a moment the sense of joy and reverence for his own youth was enough to make him tremble as he listened , " when the blood is so hot that you jump back laughing from the touch of it then it is not necessary to think , only to believe . I believe in the legs striking out towards what it is not necessary to know . It is not necessary to think but to believe in the power and the miracle of life , to see with the eyes the mountains and to hear the music and the words of men like strong drink . It is not necessary to think , only to believe , to believe in youth and in being young , and the mouth to . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out in pain and joy to the girl , " touch me , kiss me ! There is absolutely no end to what we are going to do . For God 's sake ... " He stood still in the road , his head lifted like a man struck blind , and when she stopped before him he threw down the skis in the darkness and seized her in his arms .  | Chapter Fourteen THERE were skis stacked up in the corners of the station-shed and the light new fall of snow unmelted still between the rails and to the sides the old drifts shoveled off and heaped like broken and soiled statues beyond the tracks when the three women got off the next train from Feldbruck , a little after eight o'clock . They walked through the station and out onto the road , the two girls carrying the basket between them and Muti Praxlmann leading the way . The chill of the early morning air had come to the end of her nose and given it color as she went a little hesitant on her town heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing beneath it and her velvet purple hat on her head . Oh , the country , the wet underfoot , the trees bare , the mountains still defaced with white ! She passed through it , withdrawn inside her coat , her kid gloves fastened neatly at the wrists , her snakeskin bag beneath her arm , her long colorless face refusing every aspect of it , her clean shoes touching the land as a cat touches water , her eyes running , her nose nipped with red . Having been born to this , a peasant , she could never forgive the country for it and having changed the clothes that covered her , never forgive  | the country for not changing or the pieces of the family that remained unaltered there . Behind her over the ruts and mud and the wet little scattering of snow Cilli and Hella came carrying the basket covered with a cloth , wearing short wool skirts and jackets of gray fur , and Cilli was speaking , her voice strong and merry as they came . " . . . and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and sat down at the table and he had a small hat on , a very small hat , way up on top of his head .... " Her cheeks like delectable and shining fruit squeezed up against the laughter in her eyes and she said : " If you 'd seen this hat , Hella , you would have died .... " Muti Praxlmann turned around and stood looking bleakly back at the girls who came slowly , hampered by the gasps of Cilli 's laughter and the basket to which she clung . " Stop laughing , Cilli ! " the voice said testily down the road . The eyes on either side of the long hanging nose were fixed in grieving accusation on the girl 's twisted face . She was cold even if the spring had come ; she could feel the cold in her feet and in her fingers in kid and through the long woollen drawers drawn down to her ankles and visible through the stockings folded over , and here she must stand , waiting for those two , waiting while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeped through the flesh to the marrow quaking in the bone . " I 'm not laughing ! Look , I 've stopped ! " Cilli had  | stuffed her woolen glove in her mouth to hold the terrible gasps and snorts of it in . Her head was bare and the straight part dividing the light yellow hair gleamed clear and strong and white as wax as she bent double in the road . Even Hella laughed at the sight of Cilli staggering , clinging still to the basket 's handle and reeling with the color of the cold and of laughing as pink as flowers even on her brow . " Oh , stop her , for the love of God ! " the mother cried . She snapped the snakeskin bag open , seized her handkerchief out and snapped it closed and savagely blew her nose . " I give you both a treat , bring you up here for the ski-meet , and then what do you do ? You keep me standing in the road like this , catching cold , getting my death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .. " Hella pulled the basket from Cilli 's hand and set it clown on the horse-soiled and myriad hoof-pocked and foot-printed mud and snow . " Aunt Kat does n't like it , " she said . She shook Cilli gently by the arm . " Aunt Kat does n't like it , do you see ? " " What is the matter with her ? What is she laughing at ? " said the mother . The tears of cold and outrage were standing like glass before her eyes . " Oh , at nothing , at nothing ! " cried Cilli , holding to IIella 's shoulder as she wailed . " Oh , no , no , everything looks so funny ! Everything , look ! Everybody 's had " She lifted one arm in anguish and pointed down the open valley to the Kaisergebirge and then she  | screamed aloud . Hella and the mother looked in spite of themselves out over the snow-streaked fields and the dark woods towards the mountains horning sharp across the end . " The snow ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes . " If you do n't stop at once I wo n't let you see the races , not for a minute ! " The mother 's voice might have been more the child 's voice , asking to be humored , to be assuaged . " Your hat ! " screamed Cilli . " My hat ! " cried Muti and the color struck her face . " What 's wrong with my hat ? " Her hand felt quickly over the velvet crown of it and feverishly along the brim . So elegant she was , so smart and stylish standing there on the foul road in the shabby country in her fine long cut of broadcloth and her furs , decked out in defiance it might be of the unleafed trees and the sodden snow-mottled land . Whatever she had in town was good enough to make shift with , black serge , or silk for the afternoons , good enough and to spare to sit behind the Gasthaus desk and take the money in . But here in the country she must outdo herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the shape of the mountains would never know from what she had once come nor the stream in summer ever know her face for the same under the Leghorn she put above it , and even her own sister , even poor Gertrud had once passed her by the church in Kirchstadt , not suspecting for an instant that her own flesh and blood could have become so fine and worldly  | a presence . The clothes she believed good enough for a queen to wear stood upright now in the middle of the road with the woman inside them looking furiously at Cilli , thin cotton stockings on exactly the same color as the flesh and patent leather slippers with raised heels and a strap across the instep , good enough for dancing at a ball , fur and broadcloth and snakeskin and the velvet brim conceived as insult to the humility of the ungainly land . " There 's nothing funny in my hat ! " Muti Praxlmann cried and she began running back over the filth of the road with the snow on it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big stupid girl like you laughing at your own mother , laughing at my hat .... " She reached out and brought her hand in its kid glove hard against the pink side of Cilli 's face and her yellow head , and the sound of laughing ceased at once , as if the dial had been swiftly turned to the absolute silence of the air . " Oh , Aunt Kat , " said Hella in a shocked low voice , " I 'm sure the station man saw you . " She stepped back and looked shyly around at the station and the trees . The tip of Cilli 's ear was turning scarlet underneath her braid . " There , " said Muti Praxlmann , her almost single eye fixed on Cilli . " Now pick up the basket , you and I lella . " Cilli leaned over to the handle of it and there was the struck side of her face , red as flame . The curls of the light fur jacket lay thick on her shoul-  | ders , and out of the collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and the smooth braids pinned around her head . She gave a sideways smile at Hella and her lip was quivering . " Now do n't let there be any more of that . " The mother settled herself better in her coat and turned toward the village , the look of outrage on her face disintegrating step by step to an expression that was partly concern with where she might sit down and warm her feet and partly the accustomed look she wore of wandering and haggard reproach . " Laughing like a child at nothing , as if times were n't hard enough for everyone , with everyone poor and not sure where the next groschen will come from while you . . . , " leading the way for them again towards the houses , stepping carefully through the spring disaster of the roadway and settling her fur closer around her as the wind came down the hills . Dr. Holler 's was the first house on the right with a tall unhappy pine growing in the garden just before it . In the look of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neglected decrepit look to it as if it had , a long time back , learned to do without any of the decent attentions such as painting or repair . Holding it together was the tough dry elaborate roping of a leafless vine that bound the balconies to the windows , the chimney to the gables , the sagging roof of the porch to the pillars that upheld it . The mustard color was peeling from the door and birds ' nests clung empty and ear-ringed with hard  | white pendants of last summer 's lime above the rotting timber of the steps . They lifted their heads and saw these over the doorway when they put down the basket and waited while Muti rang the bell . The doctor 's wife opened it for them , a woman small as a boy and her cropped hair springing with gray , and now the endless and peculiarly circumventing parade of talk began and would continue with Muti Praxlmann 's advance upon the village throughout the day ; the delicate manipulations of speech whose wariness was not for an instant disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry smile , the artful lipping and drinking down in effusion what the other person said or did not say . " We 've just come up from town , " said Muti and her head went forward as if in menace at the doctor 's wife , the smile stretched in her face beneath the velvet brim . " I just brought Cilli and Hella up to give them a breath of mountain air , poor things , and see the sports and we thought we 'd stop in to say good day in passing and to see how you and the doctor . . . " The little woman went down the murky hall before them , the different colors from the tinted panes above them in the stairway falling in lozenges and diamonds of red and green and yellow on her graying boy 's head as she walked . Behind her went Muti , her step mincing , her flesh shuddering with the damp and cold , and the little patterns of color lay for an instant on her hat 's brim and on her shoulders and slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all  | seated in the dark sitting-room where the stove was lighted , the doctor 's wife said : " The doctor is n't here . They have taken him off again . " " Herr Gott ! " said Muti , holding her hands out towards the cool-looking tiles of the stove , the smile still fastened to her face . " I did n't know ! Now what in the world is the country coming to ! " She began to laugh and shake her head but it was in her eye that she was thinking of the mistake they had made in coming in here . The fire was not throwing enough heat out to have made it worth while taking such a chance . " We do n't hear about things like that down in the town , " she said , looking almost gaily at the dark circular prints of grief that lay beneath the other woman 's eyes , as deep as heel-prints left between the lower lashes and the bone . " They let him out of concentration camp because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without emotion as if repeating words she had said a great many times over and that now had no longer any meaning to her . It was not in her voice but it was there in the chill dark room and the desolate house , in the unearthly and abandoned quiet of the halls . " He was just back and beginning to work again and then they came along , just three days ago , without any explanation . . . " Muti looked with a cold bright eye around the room , still smiling . There was a horsehair sofa underneath the window , a glass-topped case of medals the  | doctor was given in the war , and here and there in the half-darkness of the doctor 's waiting-room , hanging upon the antiquely and shabbily papered walls , were the paintings the doctor had done in the mountains around Kirchstadt or in other countries , like small windows suddenly thrown open to the sun or the snow or the sight of the springtime or the autumn coming up the hills . " Good heavens , they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Muti , neither knowing nor implying whom she meant by " they . " " People popping in and out of jail . Thank God it 's very quiet in Feldbruck . We 'd never know there was anything going on . " Her eye went to the doctor 's wife and searched her face shrewdly an instant , seeking to determine , to conjecture how much she suspected or knew . " Of course , if you have your living to make it 's hard and my husband and I always say nothing should interfere with the Gasthaus , especially with children growing up and being dependent on you . You must find it difficult , I 'm sure of that , but I know we all have the interests of the country at heart . One man 's like another underneath all this talk of ... " " Every time they see a fire lit at night they arrest a dozen people , " said the doctor 's wife , and then as if she felt she could say no more to them from that sense of caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet could not bear it any more alone at this hour of the morning and in the cold , she began crying , sitting small and upright in her  | chair and making no effort to hold back the tears or to wipe them from her face once they fell . " Making every man in the country a fanatic , " she said through her closed teeth . " Killing them and breaking them . That little murderer in Vienna , that little tyrant . . . " The girls had not spoken and might not have been there in the room at all but now Cilli leaned quickly forward in her chair , not looking at her mother 's face , and said : " Oh , Frau Holler , dear Frau Holler , do n't cry . " Her hand moved quickly to the small hard boyish fish which the doctor 's wife had doubled up on the upholstered chair-arm and closed on it , the broad scrubbed-clean young ringless fingers pressing the shape of sorrow into the flesh . " Just last year , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor went skiing on Maria V erkiindigung , " she said , leaning towards the doctor 's wife , her face flushed and the tears standing in her eyes as well . " Do you remember how we did the Horn on the day of the Annunciation last year and coming back we saw the swallows returning . . . , " speaking in a low tremulous voice to the little woman who did not speak or stir . " And next year even we might be doing it again when everything 's quiet and all the trouble over . . . . " " The only comfort there is , " said the doctor 's wife looking straight ahead still at the doctor 's paintings or at the paper peeling from the wall behind them or at the pair of Siberian string slippers the doctor had brought home from the war and hung above the case of medals , " is in knowing that it ca n't go on . It 's going to come to an end . That 's the only thing that makes it possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's talk one way and another but things never seem to change much , do they ? " said Mttti , and her desperately smiling face and her tall figure standing now brought them back again , gave them again the cue so that the performance , which had for a moment got out of hand , could now do nothing but proceed . The prescribed lines were recited , the indicated gestures made in observance of that mysteriously learned and never-written script which their own caution had conceived for them , actors in perpetual rehearsal of a play in which the entire nation was cast . " Things seem to go on without much change , really ... " Almost at once they set off again , the two girls carrying the basket between them and Muti going on ahead . " I intended giving her some cake , " said Muti , " but when I saw how matters were I knew there was no sense in it . She 'd get it somehow to the doctor and everybody knows our cakes and there 'd be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's the kind who loses her head , and that 's the danger . . . , " her words coating back to them , quickly and harshly and surreptitiously spoken as she slightly turned her head . Just past the crossroads , on the left , was the storehouse for the Feldbruck brewery and the beer-distributor 's living quarters joined to the building by  | the same white plaster wall . Muti stopped on the step and lifted the brass knocker on the stained wood door and let it fall . They were almost in the village now and the mountains were closing on three sides like a pure white cup rimmed with the dead rain-promising sky . It was a big lean country-burned blue-eyed young man who opened the door and he stood looking down at Muti , no collar on and the neck-band of his shirt undone and the sleeves of his striped shirt rolled up above the elbow , his bare neck red and the knob of his Adam 's apple jerking with shyness in it , the driver of the beer-distributor 's team not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashes at the girls . " God greet you , Frau Praxlmann , " he said , blushing to the line of his fair hair . " God greet you , Hans , " she said , her face lifted towards him , drinking , drinking with her neck stretched upward to the trough and h'tr lips drawn violently back in the spasm of her smile . " I 've just brought the girls up for the sports and I thought we 'd say a Griiss Gott to I.Ierr Kallas in passing . . . . " " Herr Kallas is n't here , " the team-driver said . " Gone off for the day ? " said the mother , smiling still . The driver lifted his hand and leaned against the jamb of the partly opened door . " They took him off again with the others , " he said . " Maybe you did n't know they took Johann off too last night ? " " They took Johann ? " Cilli called out from the road and the team-driver looked out at the two girls standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the band gaping open at his neck .  | " They found a rucksack of candles on him , " he said , the color running into his face . " Oh , he 's always getting into something , " said I fella . She dropped her head before the young man 's eyes and seemingly looked at her feet , thinking not of her brother but of the goitre in her throat . " He always has to be up to something , " she said , wondering if men , young men like this who saw her after three months away from home could see at once the difference in it . " Well , he has to keep himself busy , " said Muti , her face refusing to give up its smile . " In times like these : t boy does what he can , and who 's to blame him ? I hey ought to give them work , and that would keep them quiet . Going around selling candles , of all things ! " " Not selling them , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely taken in , believing that she did not understand . " He was lighting them . " " Lighting them ? " said Muti , shaking her head and smiling fiercely at him . " Well , that 's what candles are for after all , I suppose ? Perhaps you were there with hint and saw him so that 's how you know ? " " Not me , " said the team-driver . " I keep out of it all . " Mud turned , smiling , and walked the few steps to the covered basket and lifted the napkin off . Then she  | put her gloved hand inside and brought the cup cake in its paper jacket out . " You 're a good boy , Hans , " she said , returning to him , walking elegantly and mincingly towards him on her high uncertain heels . " Here you are ! " she said gaily , making light of it all . " Here 's a cake for you ! Now see you eat it all yourself and do n't go passing it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're a fellow of sense . . . . " It fitted without any trouble into the palm of his hand . The three women went up the road again , past the graveyard and the church , the girls bearing the basket between them and Muti leading the way under the arch of the barracks and into the cobbled street . The Gasthaus on the Platz was Hella 's house and she hung back from the sight of it , turning away from the windows after three months of not having seen the outside or the inside or any of the faces in it . In a minute we 'll be in there and mother will see the difference right away and Aunt Kat will start talking about the operation . They went through the doorway into the Gastzisnmer and with one hand Hella drew her fur collar up around her neck . Muti sat down like a lady at the table near the stove , the covered basket of cake at her feet , and began eating the Gasthaus pretzels and talking with the countrymen who drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm white tiles , chewing and talking , waiting for her sister to come from the kitchen where Cilli and Hella had gone . When Ger-  | trud came after a little through the kitchen door , wiping her hands in her apron , Muti finished her scntence , finished her smile completely before turning to see the stout woman in her blue dress and her cotton apron , Gertrud , the peasant , the worker still , the widow who had done so badly that she must hire her own daughter out , the respectfully and humbly attendant creature who was through some inexplicable error her sister and who waited modestly now for the first word of greeting to be said . Cilli and Hella had left the Gasthaus and crossed the Platz again and now they went down the stone steps beside the bridge and into the lane that ran beneath it . The mountain torrent that may have once passed under was there no longer and only a drift of snow lay underneath the dripping arches of stone . The two girls , standing in the shelter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane and little hard-packed pellets of snow towards the high barred pancless windows of the tallest house whose back Was turned , like the backs of all those houses , on the lane and the bridge and the roadway running on it ; until in a little while the faces of men , and their fingers closing around the irons , could be seen coming In curiosity to the morning light .  | Chapter Fifteen - ' THE prison leaned , tall and narrow , like a house of yellowish cardboard slightly askew among the other houses , the stones of the peasant dwelling it once had been covered with plaster and painted a light gold so that it seemed among the gray stone houses and even on a day as dark as this to be standing in the sun . It was built up the slope of land like a cliff-dweller 's house , the windows no larger and without glass in them , and on the two sides it was upheld by the wider squatter and deep-roofed habitations of the town . The prison and the harness-shop and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve of the old cobbled street to the Rathaus at the end . The church stood behind the girls , across the sunken lane , built high as the prison was and the gravestones tilting in their lingering wind-driven orbits of snow . And then the long wooded rolling country of the valley stretched away with everywhere a little white and on the north slopes the seemingly still unaltered depths of snow , but everywhere too the darkness of spring before the waters break and the mosses pushing out suddenly green from under the houses ' dripping eaves , a bright frog-green flourishing in damp before the black and white of winter and the cold have gone .  | Although they were high above the lane and the bridge , still the voices of the men in prison could be heard calling down , but not as if coming from the direction of the windows where the faces were behind the bars but as if the wall of the church and the bridge 's hollow were uttering the strong clear human sounds . They called the names of the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows ' stone , and the names " Cilli " and " Hella " seemed to roll out from the church itself or from the bridge 's arch as if the faces of the men in prison were merely audience straining to hear the jokes and catch the laughter from the top gallery where they were . " God greet you , Hella and Cilli , " came the voice of Johann , looming behind them in the stone . They could just see his brow through the bars at the top row of windows and his fingers drawing himself up to see . " God greet you , Johann . " The girls did not speak too loud and Hella looked quickly up the lane . " Now we 've seen Johann we 'd better go , " she said . " We 've just come up for the day , to see the races , " ( : illi said , talking through the cup of her hands . " We did n't know that you 'd be in here . We brought some cake for you and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw it ! " said Johann 's voice , and the sound of laughter filled the bridge behind them . I-Iella turned and looked sharply at it . " Cilli , we 'd better go back to Aunt Kat , " she said . And then they saw the point of Dr. Holler 's fair  | beard in the little square of the window under Johann , the white cheek and the head , small as a doll 's head , and the fingers clinging fiercely to the bars so as to see . " Is that you , Cilli Praxlmann ? " he said , and first they heard the scarcely perceptible thread of the human voice and then the reproduction of it magnified in stone . " Then ca n't you fix it to have me put in the cell with Johann ? " He seemed to be laughing , his beard wagging through the bars . " They 've put me in here with a murderer ! He seems a nice enough chap but I feel a bit uneasy . And the monstrous thing about this prison is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achtung ! " called the voice of the beer-agent and Herr Kallas ' head came to the bars in the next opening in the golden wall . " The fellow may get you from behind ! You 're in rather a delicate position , Holler . . . . " Over the sound of Herr Kallas ' laughter and Johann 's laughter the girls could hear the doctor 's cackle as it struck the stone , and his voice saying : " Oh , he 's out being questioned ! They 're giving him the third degree because one of his children is missing . They found his wife , quartered and spliced and hanging in the grain room . And if you think I ever feel like going to sleep with him in the room with me .. . " The faces , like puppets ' faces , were jerking at every window and the men 's laughter rolled along beneath the bridge , invisible but nearly felt , so close to living  | as it lapped the air that Hella turned uneasily from it . " We 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There were gypsy faces at the window of one cell , looking down and laughing at the girls , and now two other Tirol men , the dentist and the veterinary , came to their separate apertures and lifted themselves up . " You tell your mother for me , Cilli Praxlmann , " the dentist called out , " the way things are going the next time Dollfuss wants a tooth pulled he 'll have to go to jail to have it done ! " " Ha , ha , ha , " came the laughter from the church and the bridge and the tombstones in the cemetery , t he laughter striking out from the bewitched and lyresensitive stone . " Ha , ha , ha , " laughed the prisoners , the political offenders , the gypsies , and now the murderer with them . They could see his face appearing at the aperture beside the doctor 's beard . " And besides the inconvenience , " Dr. Holler 's voice called out , " this hotel , without a sign of running water in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And look here , we have nothing to sit on , not a thing ! " cried the veterinary . " The beds close up in the wall at six every morning and yesterday I at least had a book to read but today it got closed up with the bed and I ca n't get at it till eight this evening and then no light to read by , for fear we might eat the candles ? " " Ha , ha , ha , " came the laughter out of the stone ,  | and then the voice they had not heard before , the murderer 's voice called out : " What kind of men are you to laugh at me ? " Dr. Holler 's beard and his fingers disappeared from the bars as though he had been cast aside . " I 'm a widower , " the murderer called out . " My poor wife is dead and now they tell me I 've lost one of my little children too . Is there anything to laugh at in that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Someone will hear all this . We 'd better go . " " Get us some cake , Hella . Go on , Hella , " Johann said , the thin white pieces of his face held up against the light . " You two are going to get a good meal at the house .... " " But Aunt Kat would n't give it if she knew , " said Hella , not looking up because it drew her neck out of her coat and speaking so that only Cilli heard her . She watched Cilli put her hands around her mouth and listened to her call out the doctor 's name . " Dr. Holler , Dr. Holler , " said Cilli through the trumpet of her hands . " Do you remember we went skiing on Maria Verkiindigung last year ? Do you remember we saw the swallows coming back when we were coming down the Horn ? " " They say the swallows wo n't come back this year , " said the doctor 's voice , and they saw his fingers closing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before coming back , and go to another country instead . What do you think of that ? Even the swallows waiting the way the rest of us are . " The  | sound of it at first heard only sharp and gay , and then , as if the voice amplified dimensionally on the stone , it seemed to expand a little ironically , a little rccalcitrantly . " Even the birds holding off , and you know it 's quite true the finches have already gone . The first time I 've seen them go north in March . As if they 'd had enough of the country the way it is now , even the finches . . . " " Come , now , Cilli , " said Hella , and she pulled the other girl back into the shadow of the bridge 's arch . " I here 's someone coming down the lane . " It was a country woman in a long black buttoned coat and no hat on her head , only the elaborate little head-dress of braids . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tall yellow leaning house with the barred windows in it . " It 's for the veterinary , " she said , saying it clearly through the mouthpiece of her hands . " I lave you given her the prescription ? " said the veterinary 's voice , echoing from the church and far up , very high , they could see his mouth open at the bars , small as a doll 's mouth in his face . " Yes , but she seems to be burning up with fever , " the woman said . " She wo n't eat , not a mouthful of anything , and her teats are cracked and sore . " " I ought to see her , " said the veterinary , lifting hinself higher with his hands . " Are her horns peel-ing ? " " That I could n't say , " said the woman . " But she 's  | very weak now and she moans and swings her head . It 's dreadful to see her . " " You should bring her down and let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put a blanket over her and bring her down this afternoon . About two o'clock I could have a look at her . " " Unless he 's called out on an urgent case , " said Dr. Holler from his window . " In that case you can wait in the dispensary . " " Ha , ha , ha , " came the laughter of the men again as if it leapt up from the roadway , out of the very substance of the land . Muti Praxlmann had risen and fastened her coat over and was saying , in a surreptitious whisper of speech , the last things to Gertrud . She had parted with half the basketful of cakes not as a gift borne to her sister all that way but in exchange for fresh eggs and butter , and she had paid Hella 's salary for the three months past to Gertrud who stopped the curtsy almost in time as she put the fifty schillings in her dress . " She is doing not badly at all with the serving , " said Muti , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Gertrud , " thank you for your kindness to her , " lowering her head . " But she 's still untrained , you understand , and then she 's shy , of course . She 's timid . That goitre . . . " Hella 's mother looked quickly around at the men sitting at the other tables , her face flushing quickly in shame and fear that they had overheard .  | " Perhaps you could think of having something done , " said Muti in her rushing , whispering speech . " Her neck , you know . It does n't add anything and in fact it has been remarked to me that customers do n't like . . . " The girls came suddenly in through the door , flushed and breathing hard from their run across the square , and Muti said at once , smiling at the roomful of whoever might be looking on : " Then we 'll leave Hella with you , Gertrud , until the night train down . Cilli and I must hurry , with all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mother and daughter carrying the covered basket between them now , did her smile perish , her voice alter as she said : " I could n't accept to have lunch there , what with Johann in jail again and one thing and another . Every single Bauer in the Gastzimmer was a National-Socialist , " the word peasant spoken in damnation in the quick ferocious whisper of her attack . " I ca n't think what your Aunt Gertrud has in mind . She 's never made a success of anything , and now Johann locked up again and the Heimwehr forbidden the place . . . We 'll have something to eat at Toni 's and pay for it , so that no one can say . . . either one way or the other ... " There was no one else in Toni 's coffee-house for everyone was out for the sports and Toni himself in the ten o'clock race , the servant told them , and Muti sat down by the radiator with the basket of cakes and eggs and butter at her feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toni had fixed the place up when he bought it in the autumn and he had made it look very modern , very chic . He had taken the tiled stoves out and put in the central heating . There were silk curtains drawn tight on rods in the front and back windows , the front ones hiding the view of the square and the back ones of the mountains , and the benches were covered with upholstered velvet in geometric designs like the coffee-houses in Vienna . Cilli stood hesitant , teetering a moment before the table in the empty velvet-upholstered room . " You go out and find your friends , Cilli , " said Muti . " You go find Toni and the others . There 's no reason for you to stay inside when I brought you up here to see the sports . You go . " " Muti , let me have some cake , " she said . " I 'm hungry . Let me have some in my pockets . I get hungry standing out there . " Muti leaned over and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the cakes out one by one . " You come back when the others do , " she said , and Cilli said , wheedling : " Look , Muti , that 's only three . I might give one or two away . . . . " " You be careful who you give to , " said the mother . She looked sharply up at Cilli , counting out three more . " Give me a good one for Toni , " said Cilli . She closed the door with the silk curtain in it and crossed the Platz again and ' went quickly down the steps by  | the bridge , counting the men over as she went , running , Johann , Dr. Holler , the veterinary , the dentist , and counting the cakes , a little broken , crumbling a little in her pockets , thinking , Standing right out in the middle I ought to be able to throw that high if I take good aim first , if I 'm careful . . . having stopped thinking or never having thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the black mass of people gathered far away on the slopes below the ski-jump or even hearing the rising roar of voices from the crowd as someone hurtled through the air .  | Chapter Sixteen J T would be spring in a little while and even the night air was listless with it , scarcely cool on the face and the neck and the ungloved hands now that they had been climbing two hours fast . Pendennis climbed , as the men did , with a rucksack on her back , the small one holding their few things , not weighted with candles like the doctor 's pack and the others , climbing hard and fast on skins as the men climbed the invisible way through the trees and the fences with no breath wasted on speech . But moving with them went the confused sound of their advance , the silent army climbing with the harsh whispering of their ski-skins on the snow and the quick rhythmic thrust of many ski-sticks into the deep wet Firnschnee of the southern side . It was after nine when they got as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ten or fifteen men slipping the rucksacks from their shoulders and planting their sticks upright in the snow . Dr. Prochaska stood , his skis on and leaning on his sticks , watching the men as they began to work , their movements just visible in the seemingly thinning dark . " You sit there by the trees , " he said in a low voice to the girl , not turning . " Trees ? " said Pendennis . She had her stick out  | before her , as if seeking to puncture the darkness . " Were you speaking of that cocoanut palm over there with the flamingoes flying around it or the one with the cute little white-faced monkey climbing ? " " The moon ought to be up in a little while , " said the doctor , watching the men working with their skis still on and their flashlights now opening warily out in the darkness over the snow . " You can see the sky going lighter . " " Trees , " said Pendennis . " Maybe you would n't mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you talk about land somewhere to starboard or to stern . ... " " Take the rucksack off and sit on it , " said the doctor . " You 've got to sit down and rest now and we may be here some time . " She heard him going off through the dark and even saw him now , the heavyshouldered , thin-waisted shape of a man on skis moving towards the little battalion of cautiously lowered pocketlights . " There are to be three laid out here between the line of the Stuber hut as far over as Franz Engels ' house , " she could hear him saying , and the men 's voices in response , and she sat down and watched those who marked the place out and those others who returned to their rucksacks to take the paper bags and the bundles of candles out , crouching before the little fans of their electric torches like ruiners at work beneath the great and awful weight , not of the sky and night but of the threatening and palpable dark of coal or salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement , just outside the tinily flooded alleys of light , the quickeyed , quick-tongued master , not lifting a finger but telling them in short rapid speech exactly , harnessing them with accuracy and haste like beasts on which his quick warm hands ran marvellously , saddling them , buckling them , snaffling them quietly , swiftly , for the getaway . The girl saw them plant the candles , thick and white and still unlighted , within the inverted bags so that the wick stood out the open top , working quickly down the length of the design , and saw the candles singly as the furtive flashlights moved across the area of snow growing like pure white stalks of still unblooming flowers . " Very well , you Kopler and you Kaasar and you Schatz , light up , " said the doctor 's voice and the other men withdrew at once , it might be from the disclosure of the illumination to come , and shouldered their packs again and stood back , their ski-sticks in their hands . The three men the doctor had named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squatting as if in homage as they cupped the matches ' light , pausing a little while at each one to see that the wick grew upward , uncurling like a worm in death within the match 's flame . When the great cross was alight the doctor said : " Now , get along quickly . Keep up , keep straight , We do n't want to drop an inch below this one , " and when the movement of the sticks began he went back to the girl who was sitting fanning her face with her  | hat . " We 're going along to the next one , " he said . I lc stood looking down at her , standing between her and the shining ornament of fire . " You 're tired , " he said , his blood turning weak again . " I knew this was wrong . " " I 'm not tired , " she said and she put her cap over her hair again , the visor sideways . " I 'm scared . I never made any secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I ca n't see my hand in front of my face . I do n't know if I 'm rowing a boat or walking the tight-rope . " She stood up and took up the rucksack again and the doctor made a step forward on his skis and lifted the straps of it over her arms . " But I have to do it , " she said . " I have to get down from where I am , do n't I ? I'in seven thousand feet , is it , above sea level and I 've got to get down to something like normal again . So I 'll have to ski down . I do n't see any other way . But I do n't want to . Not in the least . " The light from the ( ire was shining now on her face and she stood settling the straps of the rucksack with her thumbs . Across the valley other fires were lighted , the great flaming crosses set obliquely and at intervals upon the dark , but here by their own supremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just without the honeycomb of dark and light , suddenly stilled and wondering at the beauty of this thing . They stood like children staring , their eyes fixed raptly on it , their lips parted , watching the separate living worms of flame moving tenderly , vulnerably in the balloons that cupped and magnified their light . The girl did  | not say to him , bewildered , Why are we doing this ? Why have we climbed up here ? What are we doing this for ? Why ? And he did not answer , Believe me it is not necessary to think , only to follow and to believe . It is not necessary to reason , only to feel the blood moving and to know . But for a moment their two hearts spoke the same inexplicably youthful and inexplicably terrible words , saying , Nothing having brought us here or together except the flesh of our bodies , the intoxication of movement , the mystery of the darkness together , nothing having any significance except those things we have not done before , our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eyes , the lips , the limbs even while the mind is shed as cowardice is shed , disdained like caution , the mind cast off and even the reason for it cast aside and the direction of the body not lost but weaving magically , like a trumpet call unwinding through the flesh , the destination not even questioned , residing as it does in every instant , every breath that 's taken , NOW . He saw the light painting her cheekbones high and golden and illuminating the wide-planted and now wide-open eyes , transfiguring the face and flesh and the visored cap until she seemed exalted by the strong pure light which made symbol or statue or insignia of her , the face one of a crusader lifted pointing towards the lighted altar , the bare fearless boyish hand closed on the spear , standing in a vainglorious attitude of worship in preparation for battle or for some in-  | credibly daring triumph of the spirit or the flesh . In a moment they had gone from the neighborhood of light into the direction the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins ' tracks towards the scattering of moving electric bulbs ahead in the snow . Not until the last of the three crosses was lit and the skins unbuckled from the skis and passed around the waist and knotted so as to dry in the descent did the knowledge begin to pass among them , quietly , cautiously from lip to lip of the band with cmptied rucksacks on their backs , slipping the leather thongs of the ski-sticks over their wrists , gripping the leather knobs deep in the palms ' hollow while the word ran quickly that there were men coming up from the valley , climbing without lanterns as the priest or mountaineers would not have climbed . " Then separate , " said the doctor , passing it softly and swiftly among them . " Take the descent the long way , get on well-marked runs . You know what to do . " They could not be seen or heard , these others , but they were there , the cautious crafty menace of them coming up the snows . " You and I had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Skins off , to get away the quicker if it comes to that . It would n't do for you and me , strangers , to land in Kirchstadt at this time of night with fresh snow on our skis . " They were standing alone in the abruptly hushed night , the men gone , the doctor 's voice suddenly stopped . When he turned up the sloping snow she kick-turned and followed the slipping sound of his skis as he climbed on wax  | before her . The sky was going light now as if the moon would come . " There was something I wanted to ask you , " she said in a little while . " Do n't waste your breath now , " the doctor said . " Ask it later . Keep climbing now . " " That Jew , " she said , working her way up hand over hand by the sticks with the leather straps over her wrists . " Why ca n't they let a man jump ? " " All right , " said the doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the light of the crosses when they heard the shout of the men and saw the figures running dark around the swastika 's illumination . There were the little caps of the Heimwehr men , the military set and shape of them against the far-seen glow jumping from side to side on their skis and stamping the lighted candles out  --  the mauraders , the destroyers stamping out the first great cross of fire . " Damn them , damn them , oh , God damn them , " Pendennis whispered to the darkness . She stood holding hard to her sticks , crying almost , watching them with anger as they did what they had climbed to do . " Damn them , damn them to hell , " she said , these paid men , these servants of whatever state it was snuffing the will , the spirit of a people out , cursing them as a child might the dog-catcher 's wagon with a fury as futile and as true . " Do n't stop climbing , " said the doctor 's voice . " They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wo n't be anything I can do ... "  | " Damn them , oh , damn them , " she whimpered savagely , and she began running after the sound of the doctor going higher , slipping and falling on the hack-sliding laths of wood , the tears in her eyes now , the power of her thin arms only taking her after him . The first miraculous cross was gone and the men were moving on to the next one and suddenly the girl stopped in the snow and shouted down : " Waschlappen ! Waschlappen ! Schwein ! " " Now , " said the doctor 's voice at once , but speaking quietly , " you 'll have to start skiing fast . I 'm going . You 've got to come . You follow right behind . " He raised himself on his sticks for an instant , clearing the snow from the grooves of his skis as his feet danced fast , and then he pushed himself off into the darkness , into the chasm of the invisible country , hearing the voices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , bearing eastward and downward towards where he judged the woods were , impatient of the air 's whine in his ears because he could not tell for a long time if the girl were coming down behind . The country was quiet enough in the day but once it was dark the fires began burning . First they would come alive on one side of the valley and then the dark on the other side would answer , like a great and true reflection cast bodily across the space between . They could be seen from Kirchstadt through the prison bars or through the back windows of Toni 's coffee-house  | where the people were dancing to the music of the upright piano and the accordion and the fiddle . The seats were filled at night and the tables shining with glasses and bottles and with the rings of wet that these had left behind , and in the center of the low-ceilinged , smoke-dimmed place , where the clearing was , the couples were dancing : the English girls in free light dresses dancing with their own men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Tirolian dresses or some of them in good silk frocks dancing with the men in knickerbockers and jackets that reached not quite to the waistline or with those men who wore the leather shorts and the bright red jerkins with the imperial coat-of-arms emblazoned on their breasts . It was like a fancy-dress place for the foreigners to come to and feel they had their money 's worth of the country , like Madame Tussaud 's for the public to come and pay to see . Here were all the guides and the ski-teachers the English loved , and the assistant postmaster who might almost have been Dollfuss if one did not look too closely , and Toni dressed as the English people liked to see him , his Lederhose leaving his shapely nimble knees out , his woven stockings starch-white and coming neatly to the knee-cap , his shirt white linen and laid back open at the neck . And whether he danced the ordinary modern dances with the English girls or the Schuhplattlertanz of his country with the country girls or the guides , still it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people looking on , the musical comedy circus he directed and  | performed in for them . " Ay-aie-aie ! " came the high wild call of his country 's ecstasy as he danced and the English looked at him with wonder and laughter , this vein of savage-seeming joy in him as startling , as incredible to them as gold . They could not take their ryes from him as he danced , the Englishmen in their ski-clothes or the dinner jackets sitting at the tables and drinking and talking while they watched , believing this was life , ah , this was truly life at last . He seemed mad as a Russian to them , but so compact and small , so cleanly dressed and washed , with even the steps he took subservient to them so that the English women were not afraid to accept to dance when he came to the tables and bowed before them . He came scarcely to the chins of them all but he held them strongly in a strong male arm and they knew at once that he would not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world make them conspicuous as they danced , his blue eyes bright with the almost callous merriment that shook like ice or broken glass within him , the dry light curls of hair growing thick and fragrantly pomaded on his head , his mouth pretty as a girl 's mouth , and the eye forgetting nothing , never for an instant the music or the tables or that he was owner of the place . Muti Praxlmann sat in one corner with the older women , the glass dish of toothpicks before her so that as she talked she worked carefully from one tooth to the next one , speaking rapidly , her eyes running on  | the dancers , the toothpick wedged upright in her mouth . " Take my sister now , take Gertrud , " she was saying . " Look at the kind of life she gives her children , getting mixed up in it . Hella ca n't come in here and dance with the young men because everyone knows how the land lies and nobody would ask her . Look at my Cilli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's after her and then the next one and in town it 's the same story . One day it 's a man in uniform and the next day somebody else . There 's no use ruining your social life for the sake of any government , I tell her . This country will go on just the same whoever 's sitting there in Vienna . " In the middle of the floor the Heimwehr men were dancing with the English women , and Toni dancing with Cilli , and the accordion playing and the fiddle crying aloud and the fat little fingers of the woman at the piano striking hard and firm on the keys . But outside the bright impervious merriment of Toni 's eyes and the sound of his voice speaking and the warmth of his flesh there was another thing , there was something else , however fast the drinking and the dancing went in the heat there was a reality like war , like death outside upon the mountains . There were the faces of the men at the prison windows waiting and watching not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness but for something else , something to return , to happen , to come from nowhere to them like the swallows on the day  | of the Annunciation , speaking in quiet even through the sound of Toni 's voice saying in the ear , " When the scason quiets down and the foreigners have gone I can start coming to town again and we can go to anothcr kino like in the summer , " or saying , " Well , we keep the curtains down at the back windows there so they ca n't see the fires while they 're dancing . Of course , foreigners are afraid of any political trouble . It came near to ruining the season for us . The Tirol ought to keep still about politics , at least until the snow is over and the visitors go . . . . " Or saying , " Cilli , do n't you let Dr. Holler or any of them fill you up with romance .... " Cilli with a pink silk apron on over her black dress and a jewelled collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uti 's table when the music was done but back to the windows where the people 's coats were hanging and she stood there , holding the curtain aside with her hand and looking out through the glass . There Were the fires burning in the dark , lighted high and lonely . " There is this thing outside and I do not know if it is right or wrong , but it is a thing like war , like death , and I can not bear it . It is Dr. Holler in prison and Johann in prison and in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost I can not bear it to be . " She felt the pain drawing tight in her throat and the fires melted one into the other through the tears in her eyes and she looked straight out , holding the crying down among the dead coats of other people hanging on the wall . " Last year I was a child still ,  | thinking of nothing but the swallows returning , but now I know what my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Dr. Prochaska , my love , believes , my love , whether it is right or wrong . " As if she had given away too much even to herself in silence she seized up a paper from the table in the corner and turned the pages blindly , seeking to swallow the palpable form of pain . " Last year I was a child . . . " Suddenly she could see the photograph with a great deal of sun in it of a new lamb standing up in the grasses and the one below it of a girl with light braids sitting by a lake with water-lilies on it , her face lowered over the young white rabbits which filled her apron and her arms ; and could hear the voice of Muti saying just beyond the coats , " Then not letting that Jew from Vienna jump this morning . I 'm like everyone else , I would n't sit down at a table if I knew a Jew were sitting at it , but in a matter of sports and out in the open like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissive garments that hung , deprived of life , upon the walls about her and turned the pages of the paper , holding the crying back from the memory of the ignorance of every other spring . The accordion alone was playing now for Toni and another Tirolian dressed as Toni was in Lederhose and a red jerkin ornamented with the imperial arms to dance . They were doing the Zeitungtanz in and out of the tables , back and forth , up and down through the room , the newspaper folded upright , fanlike , and  | the small end thrust in at the back through the broad black embroidered leather belt that Toni wore . It waved like an erect bird-tail at his rear while to the music , the clear melodious quickly gasping , deeply sighing music of the accordion alone he ( lid the backwards , forwards , sideways jerking , hopping , skipping , escaping dance with the other man behind him following in the backwards , forwards , jerking , hopping pursuit with a lighted match held warily , to protect the flame , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the newspaper as it waved upright in Toni 's belt and burn his tail off if one could , but every time the little Rag of fire came almost to the paper 's edge then Toni escaped with the hop and jerk of the accordion-noted dance and saved the paper from the flame . A match went out , another was struck and the dance went on unbroken , even the Englishmen jumping up to have a try with their cigarette-lighters as well . But just as the light came to the edge , creak went the leather shorts that Toni wore and the paper snapped to the other side , a clowning look on his vivid face but his eye still shrewd and sane . The men and the women roared aloud , the Englishmen in their dinner jackets laughing , jumping , hopping and living at last . At last they had taken the first long breath of life into their lungs in a foreign place and it would do them for a little while .  | Chapter Seventeen DR . PROCHASKA left the girl waiting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone from the sky and the high perilous land , for the moon had risen . He went in on his skis to the door of the hut , seeing the timber before him , each board and beam miraculously distinct and the glass in the small windows pure white with the moon 's light . The hot sight on the hills of artificial fires or windows lighted in the valley below were gone , the signs of what might have been life itself seemingly perished so that this became as they waited less the country on which the moon shone than the expanding territory of the moon and they stood quiet , their ski-sticks in their hands , on the peak of the white discarded planet of eternal death . Even the hut back among the pines was nothing more than a vestige of what had once signified small humanly made endeavor , seen now in this vastness of polar summits as pitifully inadequate and pitifully vain . The doctor knocked on the door with the leather head of his stick and the sound of it , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ran , like cracks in china , down the enormous alabaster bowl . But there was no other sound , no sound of movement within or movement  | across snow although their ears were sharp for it , for they had been a long time evading the pursuit , skiing fast from it and climbing until now they had come out upon the cold white shoulders of the world which stood ice-pure across the flooded sky . The doctor knocked on the door again and after an unmarked interval which might have been ten minutes or the best part of an hour , incalculable in the silence and at this clear height as if here time itself had ceased to be , the window over the doctor 's head moved slowly outward and the two of them watching saw the white nightdress behind it and then the man 's face in the moonlight , the moustaches , but particularly the dead-white scarcely animated nightshirt sleeve holding the window out . " God greet you , " said the doctor . He stood looking up at the man in the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? " " God greet you , " said the man in a low voice . " No , it 's too late . It 's one o'clock . I ca n't let you in . " " Come along , you 're not going to refuse to let us have a bed for the night , are you ? " said the doctor . " We want to go down the Horn early tomorrow so we got the most of the climbing down tonight . We just want a place to lie down in , that 's all . " The man did not speak at once but the window faltered , almost as if he might be closing it to come down and open the door to them , and then he said hastily : " You 'd better go back to Kirchstadt , sir . I have a  | child sick here . I do n't have to open after ten o'clock . That 's the rule , you know . It might make trouble for me , letting people in . " " Look , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice growing impatient , his head thrown back to talk to the man above . " We 've been three hours climbing . You 're not going to send us back to Kirchstadt like that ! " The girl started coming in over the path on her skis and she heard the man 's voice , cautiously , uneasily enquiring through the opened piece of the window . " Where are you from ? " " We 're up from Vienna on vacation , " said the doctor . " They told us at the hotel below you 'd put us up for the night . " " My husband 's a doctor , " the girl 's voice called out from the path . " He 's a child 's doctor . You 'd better let us in . " It was this perhaps or the sound of the girl 's bad German that made the man consider . They saw the hand draw the window in and then the light of the lamp began moving in the upstairs room ; they watched the hut go dark again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen stairs . He slipped the bolt and opened the door to them , holding the lamp before him , the wick of it turned low so that only a little ring of bright electric blue lay inside the curved glass chimney 's shape , standing in the timber hall short and strong with his head set straight  | as wood on his shoulders and his hair cut close like a Prussian 's , this and his neat moustaches gray . He was wearing trousers now , the nightshirt tucked in at the top of them and the braces tight on his shoulders , and hcavy gray wool socks pulled on his feet . " So you 're foreigners ? " he said , standing erect and official , watching them come in across the step carrying their skis , standing without submission with the lamp held in his hand , the contempt of his short stubborn features modified by pride as if he witnessed the invasion and violation of neutral ground or of ground that he had defended until the last , standing aside now before the advance of belligerent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt . " Yes , foreigners , " said the girl casually , and he closed the door of the hut and bolted it again , nothing within him allayed but held for the moment by the misshapen words and the twang of a place that was alien to him . He stood watching them unbuckle and peel the skins from their upright skis and hang them , soaking as if from rain , over the wooden pegs in the timber . " We have to watch out these days , " he said , not apologizing but vindicating himself from any suggestion of blame . " You never know who 's coming up the mountains at night . I 've got in trouble before . " The doctor stood the four skis up in the corner by the door and when he turned around he took out his handkerchief and wiped his hands in it and looked  | straight at the hut-keeper 's face above the ring of light . " It was n't you making those bonfires a few hours back , was it ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sharp eyes bounced up upon the doctor 's face , a movement as sudden as someone leaping to his feet . " Who ? Me ? Good God , no , " he said . " They 're always putting it on me , just because I happen to live high . " He stood with the lamp in his hand looking at the doctor with the marked graying weary features not of the aged but of those who have come through grief or fear or stricken pride to a simulation of the end so like the true end that hope and suffering or any sensation have almost ceased to be . " I 'm not Tirolian , " he said , " and they make you pay for it . They do n't let you forget it here , I can tell you that . " He stood looking first at the doctor and then at the girl with his neck unbending , his head unmoving , only his small bright belligerent eyes laying a prying finger of sight first on one face and then the other . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the partition , the gasp of it drawn tight and startlingly painful , startlingly close as though only a strip of paper stood between . " What are you doing for that ? " said Dr. Prochaska , stopping with the handkerchief in his hands . " I keep him downstairs where the stove is , " said the hut-keeper . " The girl 's getting better now . She 's  | upstairs with her mother . The boy 's been worse tonight . " " I 'll look at him , " said the doctor . " Have you a thermometer here ? " The hut-keeper stood quiet looking at the doctor 's face lifted beyond him and harking on that edge of vapor where the lamp 's light dwindled into the hallway 's dark , the face with the hot mobile look of interest , not compassion , in it waiting for the sound to come again . " How much will you charge ? " the hut-keeper said , watching with his sharp bright unmoving eyes . " How much ? " said the doctor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Good God , no ! Here , and I 'll pay you for the room now . " He took a blue ten-schilling note from his pocket and held it towards the man with the lamp in his hand . " That ought to be enough . And , look here , hurry up . I want to get to bed . " The man took the money from the doctor , his eyes not moving from the doctor 's face , and then he turned to light them into the room beyond the kitchen where the child lay and as he went down the hall before them they saw that the tail of his nightshirt was hanging out . The smell of the room was close and dry and the hut-keeper lit the oil lamp on the table while the two of them waited near the door . There was no bed in the room , only a divan across the end under the machine-made tapestry of Venice fifty years before pinned to the wall and faded from  | what the colors had once been to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone here she sat listless and tired a little while in the cold , picking the lumps of snow from the wool of her socks and the stuff of her trousers and listening to the doctor 's voice in the other room and the coughing of the child . She sat on the side of the couch and began pulling at the leather laces in her boots and " the bastards , " she said under her breath , thinking of the men stamping the fire out , " the bastards , " and one of the wet ski-shoes fell hard upon the floor . After a little she stood up in her stocking feet and put her jacket on the chair and she stood listening to the sound of the doctor 's voice speaking of the child or to it in the room where the fire was burning , and there was something else : her own face , white and thin and the rouge gone from it , was watching her from the shadows out of a square of fly-specked glass . Her hand went quickly to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand in the glass moved , the mouth moved and the whisper said : " That 's me , that 's me , thin , pale , tired , like something the cat dragged in , " as if for the first time seeing , knowing . " Because of him . Because if he were a miner I 'd be squatting underground with a pickax , hacking . Because if he were a prize-fighter I 'd be screaming at the ropes . I 'm nothing , nobody , " she said , looking at the shadowy and skull-white face that watched her from the wall , the words whispered . " I am whichever way he 's going . I 'm not even me. "  | She lifted one end of the dark red cover on the couch and bending nearer she saw all the flies of the r iiiuncrtime had crawled under it and died there , looking for warmth , maybe , last year or the year before . She stood holding up one end of the fringed rug and brushing the flies out with a calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of cows wading through a stream and a frayed yellow silk ribbon run through the cardboard frame , and the voices of the doctor and the hut-keeper could be heard still speaking through the wall . Then she lay down under the couch-cover , all dressed , only the hat and jacket on the chair and the wet shoes on the floor , her head on the straw-filled and coarse black pillow on which her handkerchief was laid , and at once sleep began to spread warmly and subtly through her flesh so dimming knowledge itself that the men 's voices seemed calling from a long distance to her , echoing in widening rings of sound down the anaesthetic-like submerging dark . " Have you been to the Tiergarten in Vienna then ? " said the hut-keeper , calling it deeply over the rising tide , and the doctor 's voice called down , the note of impatience ringing in it , " Ja , ja . Ja , ja . " He is standing in the room now , with no sign of weariness in his face , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to action , his blood kindling until I am destroyed . The man had put more wood in on the fire and set the kettle on it and now he did the other things the  | doctor bade him do . He left the room and came back with the odd lengths of white cloth and the sheet , cold , stiff and folded , which the doctor had asked for and he stood there , his eyes bright and hard and watchful while the doctor took them from him . The child was lying , asleep again , on the folding bed with a screen set up around the foot to keep the cold from the opening door away . The hut-keeper watched the doctor open the sheet out and shake it and spread it over the back of the chair near the cook-stove , and watched him take the remnants of cloth from the table and begin tearing them in broad straight strips from end to end . " I was out in South Africa in 1925 , " he said , watching the doctor 's face , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 've been to the Tiergarten you must have seen the giraffes there ? " " The giraffes ? " said Dr. Prochaska , tearing the white cloth still . " Yes , perhaps I did . I do n't remember . " " Two of them , " said the hut-keeper eagerly . " A male and a female . I caught them that year out there . We went after a herd of them and those two were the infants and they got left behind . I kept the female alive on cocoanut milk . It was n't easy . She slept right in my tent with me three months or more . " " Have you any pins ? " asked the doctor . He laid the strips of cloth neatly one upon the other on the back of the chair before the fire . The man went out of the room again , the tail of his nightshirt when he  | turned still to be seen hanging down behind , and as he stumped up the wooden stairs to the floor above the timber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor stood upright , his head lifted , lis'cuing to this and to the child 's breath from behind the screen , waiting for the kettle to begin . I Ie heard the woman 's voice speaking in the room above and the sound of the man answering and these two voices talking upstairs in the dark brought the thought of the girl to him , lying alone , the legs drawn up , the chin lifted , the white neck twisted to one side like the throat of a thin bird fallen in weariness from flight . In a minute I will go in there and lie down beside you . It is so narrow that there will not be room for anything to come between us , not even for my anger for having brought you here or your memory of any time or place or other man or for my fear that some day I will lie down to sleep without you . " Pendennis , " he said , looking at the boards between them , " Pendennis , " and then the muffled tread above recrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs , the throbbing slow beat of steps in the house like the beat of a pumping heart . The doctor took the pins from the hut-keeper and put them on the table and as he removed his ski- i jacket and hung it on the door the man stood looking at him , watching him turn up the sleeves of his flannel shirt , watching him as if from far away , out of the remote dark loneliness and speechlessness of some uninhabited place , some lost region which the doctor  | had no knowledge of and which no communication could define , following the meaningless ritual of action with his dark fixed obliterated gaze . " When were you in the Tiergarten ? " he asked after a little . " The Tiergarten ? " said the doctor without turning from the fire . " Oh , in Vienna , you mean ? Oh , perhaps a year or more ago . " Then he straightened up and looked around the room . " What about a basin ? " he said . " Have you something big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking at the doctor , watching motionless still as if he had not heard . Then he turned and left the room again , one short hand lifted to set the panel of the screen right as he passed it , and the doctor heard his footsteps down the hall . He crossed the room to the bed and stood looking down at the child sleeping on it , asleep on its back with the head with the brown hair on it flung to one side and the hot dry brilliant look of fever in its face . The breath was coming through the mouth , the loud dry shuddering snores of breathing ripping up through the throat , and the pulse in the body racing , racing . When the hutkeeper came back he was carrying a wooden tub that he might have brought in from a cow 's stall in the shed , the straw he had not taken the time to clean from it still sticking to the base and the heels of black manure peeling from it , carrying it before him at the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor before the stove . The doctor walked back  | to the fire and looked at the tub on the floor and at the kettle beginning to boil . " We 'll want more water on the stove , and water in that , " he said , striking the tub with the toe of his ski-shoe . " You 'll have to keep water boiling all the time in the room . " " If you were at the Tiergarten , " said the hutkeeper , looking at the doctor with the same sharp unflinching eye , " you must have seen the elephants . There 's one does a dance step when you feed her . I taught her that dance on the boat coming back . She used to follow me around the way a dog will . " " All right , " said the doctor , " you get the water into the tub . " He lifted the kettle off the stove and let the spout of water run smoking into the tub where the dry ungiving sheet refused to bend or to absorb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tin pitcher in his hand and poured the melted snow water in upon the sheet that would not sink or lie . " It 'll begin taking the wet in a minute , " the doctor said . He put his hand in the warmish water and held the horns of the white sheet down . The next pitcher of cold snow water ran over his hand and his wrist with the square black wrist-watch on it and he looked up sharply at the man . Then they waited , the hutkeeper standing not far and watching the doctor with the gleaming unmoving gaze that pressed like argument upon him , and the doctor squatting on his thighs , the stuff of his dark knickerbockers drawn tight across his knees , his one hand pressing the indurate  | crags and steeples of the sheet beneath the water , submerging one end while the other rose sharply to the surface as an iceberg might be convulsively and momentarily submerged . " Sometimes they send for me to go down , " said the hut-keeper . " They sent for me last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They paid my fare to Vienna for me . " The doctor looked up at the fast-steaming kettle , his hand holding the sheet down as if holding something living which had almost ceased to struggle now beneath the surface of the water in the tub . " They had veterinary-surgeons from Linz , let alone the two best in Vienna , and the elephant was already lying over on her side when I got there . She had n't eaten for ten days and they 'd poured three gallons of castor oil inside her . " " Let me have some of that water in here now , " said the doctor . " No , the water from the big one . It must be warm by this time . The other one has to keep boiling , you understand . You 've got to keep water boiling in this room without stopping now . " The water was leaking from the tub in a long dark thread of wet across the yellowish wood of the floor . " It 's taking it well now , " the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheet and over the doctor 's naked wrist and hand . " You get the boy undressed now , " he said , " and get one blanket free to wrap him in . " The hut-keeper went to the bed and set the screen  | wide and began taking the boy 's shirt off him , unbuttoning it at the neck and drawing the hot arms through . " Where am I going ? " the boy 's voice said , groping slowly towards speech as towards a light through the obscurely lit and unfamiliar place to which fever had spirited him and where it kept him bound hand and foot with sleep . " The doctor 's here now , " the hut-keeper said . " l ) id he come back ? " said the boy 's slow voice , letting the shirt be taken from him . " He 's been here all the time , " said the father . " We 've been talking in the room here . " " That was yesterday , " said the boy , and the father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me get the blanket around you . " Dr. Prochaska lifted the sheet from the water and began wringing it out , section by section , in his hands . When it was a long twisted rope laid over the chair he took it up by the ends and went over the room with it . " Now I 'll open it out , " he said to the hut-keeper , " and you lay the boy inside it . " The heat from the child 's bare body could be felt like a hot wind on the face as the hut-keeper lifted the boy and laid him in the wet sheet on the bed . Then the doctor swathed him quickly in it , the arms down , the feet wrapped in , and the boy began whimpering and swinging his head .  | " It 's wet , it 's cold , " he said . " Ja , ja , " said the doctor . " I know . " He pulled the free blanket under the boy and wrapped it fast around and then he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw his own ski-hat on the table and he crossed the boards and picked it up and went back and put it on the boy 's head , the shallow white wool crown on his hair and the white wool visor pulled down to his eyes . " There you are . Now you 're going to sweat , " he said . The boy was asleep again , his head gone deeply and slowly into the pillow again , the lashes short and thick on the cheeks , the chin fallen into the wide swathes of wet . The doctor looked at the time on his wrist . " We 'll put the compresses on in two hours . That will be four o'clock . I 'll have to be out of here by five but you 'll go on with it . Every two hours , first the wet sheet and then the hot bandages around the chest , and do n't let the kettle stop boiling . But tomorrow morning you 'll get the village man up . " " He 's in jail , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the stove and sat staring at the steam . " Then you keep this up until the fever drops , " he said in a moment . " If you do that it should n't go into anything . I do n't think it will go into pneumonia if you do exactly what I 've said . And tomorrow you go down or have your wife go to the chemist for ? " He stopped with the fountain-pen in his hand and  | then he seemed to come to some decision of his own and he wrote the prescription out deliberately and signed his name . " There , " he said . " You get that . " The man took the paper from him and looked at it , at the words and the roman numbers , and the flourish of the signature at the end  --  the first name , and then Prochaska , and then the fancy tail below it , and he said : " This elephant I was telling you about . It was n't so easy as all that to bring her around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , his hands clasped , looking at the steam rising from the kettle on the stove . And you , Pendennis , you , du , du , asleep alone and I awake alone so that all the years we have been apart can come up this mountain and come between us , and what I will be in the end standing as much barrier as that partition beyond the stove , an old man like my father with my father 's face and beard on his breast shaking his head in warning at me . You , Pendennis , du , du , with your mother dead in the stream and your brother dead on a rope , and your brother more to you than any man and coming into every room you lie down in and reminding you of it , and his tongue saying it for me as if it were my own tongue speaking , " Pendennis , I ca n't go on without you , not now or any night or day . " The doctor jumped to his feet and started walking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut-keeper had been talking and was talking still to  | him . " Great big animal taking up half the cage , " he was saying , " she tried to get to her feet as soon as she heard me speak . She had n't seen me for eight years , but that did n't make any difference . " The doctor walked back and forth in the room and the little mirror on the wall and the glasses turned stems-up on the open shelves were blurring white from the mist of steam , and the hut-keeper went on talking , not needing any word in answer , not seeking any , but offering this or whatever else he told as evidence given so that the doctor might come to see the truth at last , might recognize him not as a man paid to keep a hut open on a mountainside , paid to have beds made and ready for whomever came past , but as a man familiar with Vienna too who had seen other countries , suffered other climates , worn other costumes , a man whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got photographs of the whole expedition , " he was saying . Do n't think I 've always been up here , lost to the world , a man with old pants on and my nightshirt sticking out behind . I 've worn a pith helmet and had a parasol carried over my head and given the word of command to black men taller than you , my friend . " I 've got a snapshot taken of me with that elephant the day we caught her , " he said . " She never forgot anything I 'd done for her and all that time after when I went into the elephants ' house she heard me talking and she started twitching around in the straw , trying to get up and come to me . Her stomach  | was sticking out as if they 'd blown it up with air for her and she was so weak she could n't get up on her knees even . The first thing I did I said get me a lot of vaseline , a bucket of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I told them to stand that elephant up . There were ten of them keeping her standing and then I put a ladder up at the back of her and I covered my arm right up to the shoulder with vaseline and I put my hand right in where I knew the trouble was . As soon as I started pulling everything out of her she heaved a big sigh and leaned over on the side of the cage , grateful for what I was doing . It took me half an hour to get hold of what it was ? a hay-ball clogging up everything and when I pulled that out it was like taking a cork out and the whole thing burst . It burst all over me , but that did n't matter , the gallons of oil and the pounds of peanuts and everything she 'd had two weeks inside her shooting out ? " " Look , " said the doctor , stopping before the stove , " your kettle 's boiling dry . "  | Chapter Eighteen FATI PRAXLMANN was eating at the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting beyond the others at the crowded tables outside the smoke and the tumult of talk and the passage of the girls with trays of beer and the passage of those who came or left the benches , the napkin knotted around his neck , the Sch , weinskotelett on his plate as tough and colorless as rope , the boiled cabbage , dark , imperial , purple , lifted in enormous forkfuls to his mouth , dripping like seaweed from the pork salvaged from the sea of applesauce . He saw the doctor and the girl come in the door but only the white eyebrows jerked , the fork did not lower or the eye lift from the plate as they came along between the tables , the girl leading , her head bare , her hair curled and shining , a brown highnecked sweater underneath her small sharp lifted chin . Only when they had come abreast his table , the doctor just behind her in gray knickerbockers , the jacket short and buckled tight above the hips , the face and neck burned darker for one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their casual suede shoes , their ungloved and youthful hands advancing swinging , their moving limbs on a level with the old man 's lowered eye , he struck the heel of his glass  | boot on the table-planks and roared , " Beer , for the love of God , you women , beer ! " And then he raised his head as if surprised by the presence of these two and said : " Oh , it 's you , Herr Doktor ! You sit down here tonight and eat . You sit down . " The doctor stopped and leaned over , speaking , with his hand upon the old man 's chair . " I 'm not alone , " he said . " I 'll give our order and then come back and tell you how the work went . " " No , no , I do n't want that ! " the old man shouted , his wild eye watching the empty glass boot borne off in Hella 's hand . " You sit down , I said . If there 're two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were two things in his face when he stood up to bow to the girl : the salutation of the soft old mouth on the back of her hand given to what went by the name of lady no matter how lost , and the obscenely sharp penetration of eye isolated from good manners for what she really was . Whatever she was to him he stood on his feet , the napkin around his neck still , and bowed his heavy head before her , his knuckles on the table holding the soft old sagging body upright like props laid against an edifice of ancient crumbling stone . In a moment they were safe in the corner , the three of them , with the people drinking , smoking , eating , talking remote from them in the wainscoted room with the delicate stiff-throated hcads of the deer stretched out above them and the fragile horn-set skulls of the chamois studding the frieze , the girl and the old man and the doctor sitting  | on three sides of the table 's end , facing one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished dinner and the cardboard circular mats set out for the glasses of beer . " So you got the goods ' train back ? " Praxlmann said to the doctor . " Yes , " said the doctor , and he added : " We had to spend the night in the Stuber hut . We got the six o'clock freight train down . " " We ? " said the old man . He took the boot of beer from Hella and drank while the girl and the doctor read from the purple-inked and hand-written menu what they would have , but the words he did not say were gathering power and sight in the heavily lidded and un-Germanically warm dark eyes . " We ? " he said again when Hella was gone . The doctor 's hands moved on the table before him , setting the rounds of cardboard one upon the other , laying them in a pawnshop 's sign , destroying that pattern to set them in another way . " The Gnadige Frau went up to Kirchstadt with me , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted boot of beer and then on the cardboard rings in his hands and then on the old man 's face again . " We climbed as far as Leiten last evening with eleven men . The Heimwehr got up with us just after the third fire was lit . The Gnadige Frau is a good skier . She came down as well as any of the men . Only I did n't want to risk going into the village again at  | that time of night so we stayed up top till morn-ing " Herr Gott , " said the old man , beginning to eat again , shoveling the pork and potatoes and cabbage in . " A good skier  --  a good climber ! " he said , his voice roaring it at them . " As if you 'd been out on an excursion , out climbing , out racing ! You , climbing up mountains as if you were doing nothing but lighting a bonfire , no more to it than that ! Ja , ja , you , Herr l ) oktor ! You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lark , not one of you able to ice you 're in for something real this time , not just another prank , nothing like a schoolboy 's adventure , nothing to do with playing hooky . . . " Nothing scented to happen for a minute and then the old man threw down his fork and pushed his plate away . " There are plenty of these others , more than enough of them to go climbing up and skiing down and nothing else expected of them , but you a doctor , an educated man , not a peasant , but a man who has thought it out ? " The doctor watched the old man wipe his loose soft mouth with the end of his napkin and fumble with the knot of it behind . " Good God , Herr Praxlmann , " he said , " you do n't have to say these things to me ? " " Ja , ja , to you , to whom else then ? " said the old man , fumbling for the knot still . " Good skier ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the girl reached out and undid the napkin for him and the  | old man glanced quickly in anger , almost in hate at her , his dark seemingly swollen eyes flashing anger and hate as well at her from under the hanging lids . He stopped speaking and seized up the boot of beer as Hella brought the dishes of Leberrissota and Paprikahuhn and set them down before the girl and the doctor , but the doctor 's eyes did not move from his face or his hand move from the table 's edge , the knuckles shining white in it as if the bone itself were there . " The day this country can stop laughing , " said Praxlmann savagely when Hella was gone , " is the day our salvation will begin . " The girl began to eat now , the thin white hands with the big rings on them and the painted nails taking the bread and the knife and fork up and lifting the cool thick mug of beer . " You eat your supper , " she said to the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He ' full of pork and cabbage . You catch up with him before you start to talk , " and the doctor took up his fork and began too to eat , automatically , hastily , seeing in bewilderment the rice and liver lifted from his plate , and heard the girl 's voice saying , " You let him have time to drink now . You 're three necks ahead . " And now she became suddenly the recipient of all Herr Praxlmann , leaning forward on his big arms , wished to say not to her but to anyone who would have listened quietly and not remembered the exact words of it after , or not remembered enough to have repeated it in incrimination to others . He might have  | been talking of the country and the conditions in it , of the closed frontier and the plebiscite that was forbidden , but the subdued and painfully clear accents of his voice were communicating something else as he leaned across the table towards her , his head lowered between his shoulders , his wild and agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have spoken then of the Austrian Legion , of twelve , fifteen , twenty thousand men , Austrian men on the other side of the border , men like this man Prochaska , working and waiting there for the signal to come , the sign to be given ; young men waiting to return in triumph to their own soil , free men driven to a free country to escape suppression and tyranny , for it was then he spoke of how the Americans had gone with their belief to a new country , in the same way , with the same spirit , leaving but never relinquishing the memory of bitter injustice . The Americans , he said , and you an American can understand this and know that a man takes up arms for his faith , that he marches with his own people , mates with his own people , yes , mates with people of his own blood and his own race for this is the blood and the race he understands and anything else is disaster . I le was not saying you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant impinging on his life , on my life , on the youth of the country , on the Movement , conflicting and hindering , see yourself for one instant for what you are , a foreigner assaulting him , destroying him , but still this was in the regard ,  | in the pauses and in the uphanging and vindictive contemplation of her presence , said . It is time for you to get out and leave him , because of your own will and choice , because you have understood exactly what I have not said it is time for you to go . Or even if you are incapable of understanding , said the unspoken passion in the old man 's face , still you must leave this man to what belongs to him , to the thing he has now before him to accomplish and to the wife that will one day come to him , and the perfectly articulated speech came in the lowered voice across the table to her . He was talking of the country , perhaps , or purely of Prochaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the Kaisergebirge until this man , this young man across the table , had gone up there in January on skis and he and a guide , just the two of them , had come across the steepest end of it , and it is men like that , men like this young man sitting eating with us , that are the country 's hope and the Movement 's hope , the young and the strong , the young and the fearless , the young , the young that will resurrect us from the humility of poverty and the humility of defeat . He was telling her the same things , it might be , over and over in that passionately subdued voice which excluded the other tables , telling her of the newspaper next door which turned out pages of what no one believed , propaganda paid for by Italy or paid for by France , but his face was saying you 've got hold of something good , something we all want , part  | of the promise and hope , the power and resurrection . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unknown Soldier but in one country the Unknown Soldier has risen and it is to him we are turning in faith , men like me and men like this young man eating here at the table with us , " and Herr 1'raxlmann struck the heel of the glass boot on the boards and shouted , " Cilli , for the love of God , some beer ! " " And while he 's waiting , the young man eating at the table with us , he 's to go on living his own life , is n't he ? " Pendennis took her cigarettes out and put one in her mouth . " He 's to do just as he pleases only he 's never to do anything unless he 's told to do it . Otherwise he 's perfectly free . " ' I'he doctor held the match forward in his hand and Ile said : " I am free . No one 's ever going to change that , no one . " " Yes , " said the girl , drawing the smoke in , " climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you just as it 's told to you , and how can you go on swallowing it and swallowing it , why does n't something start choking you in the middle of every speech they 're roaring at you , each one a little bit louder than the other so you wo n't have the peace and quiet to put two and two together ? How can you get it down and keep it down ? " " Go on , " said the doctor , looking straight at her across the empty dishes . " Go on . "  | " I will , " said Pendennis , " I intend to , " but she stopped and looked up at the girl who had come back to the table carrying the full boot of beer . She looked up at Cilli , her eyes narrowed the better to see the texture and mark of youth on the girl 's face and the bright light braided hair , and Cilli set down the glass before the old man and as she wiped the table dry looked with pure unsmiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love .  | Chapter Nineteen EVEN before the light came on Sunday the singing in the chapel on the other side of Infektionhaus wall began . There was a double-door on that side of the general hospital , just under the maternity ward , and when this was opened for Sunday mass the altar far back across the end could be seen from a long way lighted in the crypt-like shape and darkness and the Sisters of the Order kneeling on the prayer-chairs or even on the pavings with their skirts spread . The priest 's voice spoke and the nuns ' voices came in answer and those others who were late , the Sisters from Zahlstock or from the eye and ear clinic or the emergency wing , came crossing quickly under the trees to the chapel , the silver chains at their waists and their carved wooden rosaries swinging with their gait , their darker better Sunday dresses lifted from the path and their umbrellas over them if the rain were falling or else the pale stars going out in the chill blue returning of the light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At five o'clock or earlier their hymns came through the open windows , sweetly , purely sung in the mysterious twilit air before the candle-lighted stage more appropriately set for frivolity than supplication.  | The three boys sat up in bed , harking , and even through the sound of the rain falling through the trees and the sound of the Sisters singing beyond in what was exemption outside Infektionhaus wall , the unspoken promise of Helmut 's going away was clear as a whisper in the room : " This is Sunday and my mother is coming on Sunday and on Sunday I am going home . " The beds of sleeping children stretched off from them down to the open doorway and the night-lamp 's blue light still burning in it , and only the three boys sat awake holding their shivering knees close in their arms and talking in whispers while they listened in the May early morning dark . " You 'll look funny all right walking out with that bandage on , " said Karli , and Helmut 's hands went quickly to his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . " Of course they wo n't take it off , " Jochi said . " They 'd be afraid of what would happen . What 'll you tell your mother when she asks you how you hurt your head ? " " I 'll tell her , " said Karli . " As soon as she comes in here I 'll tell her she ought to keep her house clean . " He seized the soles of his bare feet in his hands and rocked himself , squeezing the laughter in . " I 'll tell her about the bugs in your hair , I 'll tell her Sister Marianna tied your head up with kerosene so the rest of us would n't get them . " " You do n't have to say it , " said Helmut , looking  | helplessly , hopelessly at them . " You need n't say it to her . " " I 'll say it was n't diphtheria at all , " said Karli . " I 'll tell her , " and " Hushala , swishala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is n't six yet , Karli . You do n't want to wake Cristl , do you ? " The other two lay down and pulled their covers up , their wide-open eyes watching wakeful from the bed as she moved off between the two still rows of sleeping children . They saw her lift her hand and turn the night-light out and now everything was abruptly and completely left in the apparently unlifting somberness and shadowiness of early day inside the house . Then without any kind of warning the clear bright beads of the thrush 's singing were cast out across the fresh leaves and the grass . " The thrushes are mine , " whispered Karli , and hushala , swishala said Sister Marianna 's felt soles slipping past the doorway . It 's just after five , it 's not yet time for day . It is not day here until the lame and the halt and the blind begin to come cautiously , hesitantly to the doorways and take the one step down and walk out in the hospital grounds , the convalescent cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while like prisoners in their prison garments and allowed to go leaning on canes or crutches or on the arms of others or else pushed in wheelchairs , the remains of an army , the survivors of a great and universal disaster feeling their way slowly back to life again . They wear bandages or their limbs  | are molded stiff in plaster as they make the seemingly endless journey to the gate closed on the street on one side and to Infektionhaus wall upon the other , taking it slowly because their wounds are healing and they are only caricaturing the attitudes of living men . When it was truly day Sister Marianna brought the striped wrapper in for Helmut , carrying it , out of that unflagging practice of thrift and heed , carefully folded over her arm as if it were not for an instant a faded ancient garment in which countless children had wavered unsteadily down the ward 's length to the hall . Sister Resi had the black felt slippers four sizes too large for him or any child , and when he hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrapper on him . The sleeves were too long and Sister Marianna turned the cuffs back . " There , you look like a big man now ! " she said , standing back , and Karli said : " Especially with that bandage with only his ears sticking out ! " Helmut pushed his feet down into the slippers , feeling his way deep into the wide-spread soles and then he stood upright , holding fast to Sister Marianna in the reeling room . " Are you going to take the bandage off my head now ? " he said scarcely aloud , and Karli started laughing and this started Jochi laughing , their eyes light as goats ' eyes watching him standing holding to Sister Marianna , standing up , the only child in the ward standing , and the door at the end of the ward open to  | him and the garden underneath the windows open and the gate of Infektionhaus and the gate beyond that into the street open , wide open , and the street with the asphalt squares on the sidewalks lying open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loferStrasse , and behind the houses the mountains going up to green and from green beyond to the glaciers and open snow . " I 'm going to tell his mother she ought to clean her house , " said Karli , and " Hush , now , Karli , " said Sister Marianna . " She wo n't come up here . She 'll wait downstairs after lunch for him , so you see you wo n't be able . " " I 'm going to write her a letter then and tell her it was n't diphtheria but bugs and we might have all caught bugs from him , " said Karli . Watching 1 lclmut reach out and hold with one hand to the white iron bar at the bed 's end , he said : " Look , he ca n't even stand up , Sister Marianna . How can he go honk if he ca n't stand up ? Anybody could stand better than that no matter how sick they were , even Cristl can stand better . . . " " Are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Helmut and Sister Marianna let him sit down on the chair by the bed a little while and she said after lunch you 'll go downstairs and into the bathtub and then we take the bandage off your head and we wash you all over with black soap and when you 're clean and your hair all clean we put on your clothes and you do n't come  | upstairs any more after that but you wait for your mother in the sitting-room downstairs and then you say good-by to me and Sister Resi and then you go away with your mother and you take good care not to get sick any more . In the women 's ward she said to the burgomaster 's daughter , " Tomorrow it will be your turn . Tomorrow you 'll walk up and down the hall and then you 'll be going . " " I 'll come back and see you , " said the burgomaster 's daughter and Sister Marianna shook her head . " I 've been twenty-five years here , " she said , saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Order are taking it over and Resi and I are going to go " ; spoken without acrimony or without passion or eagerness , as if this or any other fact of life among the briefly living were recognized without emotion , without interest almost , as part of the required preparation for the enduring life of death to come . " Resi and I will take a room in town and live there together , " said Sister Marianna and she shrugged her soft heavy shoulders . " And what about the children ? " asked the burgomaster 's daughter . " You wo n't have any children ... " " Ja , ja , " said Sister Marianna , smoothing the sheet across with the side of her broad old hand . " Ja , ja , we 'll miss the children but there 's nothing for it . Ach , if you had been here at Christmas you would  | have seen what a time they all had , all sitting up in bed .... " She did not say anything more then when the bell began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food had come over from the kitchen-house and were waiting at Infektionhaus gate . Sister Marianna ran light as a girl , clean , white-haired , the flesh as soft as velvet and delicately veined with motionless bright blood , down the marble stairs with the key in her hand and out through the garden over the cinder path to the gate . The servants in their striped blue dresses and aprons came past her as she held it open , bearing the buckets of soup and the buckets of spinach and rice and climbed the stairs with them to Sister Rcsi 's pantry where the plates and trays were waiting . " Did my mother come yet ? " Helmut said down the length of the ward when he saw Sister Marianna going past . After lunch they put the wrapper on Helmut again and he felt his way into the slippers and then Sister Marianna took his hand in her hand and they began to walk slowly down between the beds . She took him as far as Cristl 's bed and she was standing in it holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping her mouth , the wax-white flesh held upright to see . Helmut sat down on the chair there and " Mamma , " said Cristl and the cork fell from her mouth and hung upon its string , and almost at once Karli 's voice began from the corner against the window 's light , " No , Cristl , that 's not your mamma .  | That 's Helmut and he 's so sick he ca n't go home because he has bugs in his hair . If you really want your maiiuua you just go downstairs and cross the garden and open the gate and walk right into town and take the tram on the Andreas-Hofer-Strasse .... " The children had begun laughing in the other beds but Helmut did not hear the voice speaking or know what it was saying , knowing that this was May and this was Sunday and now he would be home in a little while and in the mountains for the time the herds went higher , seeing himself going the certain distance the boys always went , running with switches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less by thought than by the season from the almost forgotten memory of last year , as the symbols of Christmas returned of themselves in winter and of Easter in the early spring . So he saw the young goats running , deer-brown with small black horns planted on their brows , and the young cows advancing on the road , a river of upward-flowing shoulders and bony rumps and young horns above the flickering ears passing between the old stone walls and even overflowing when they mounted wildly on each other 's backs , and the young men who would tend them all summer driving them higher to where the snows had been . And he would be in the mountains for the time that the herds came down again , and he saw them coming as they would come in October , the great bunches of white-topped grasses lashed to their full-grown horns and the flowers strung in necklaces  | over their shoulders or wound in crowns around their ears , the fast-flowing river of goats and cows and behind them the young men bearded now and their clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to home bearing great structures of tinsel and colored paper and ringing bells upon their heads like several-tiered and still unlighted bridal cakes , and the men with flowers in their eternally dust-sprayed and shapeless hats , and flowers worn in their ears , singing and playing their mouth organs or accordions as they came . He did not hear Karli speaking but Sister Marianna took his hand and led him back the long uncertain way again and standing beside Karli 's bed with hint she said , " Now , Helmut , say good-by to the boys , " and Helmut said : " Auf Wiedersehen , Karli . " " Auf Wiedersehen , " said Karli . Ile lay looking without moving at the bandage around Ilclntut 's head . " They 're going to take the bandage off and give me a bath now , " Helmut said . " Maybe they 'll be sorry , " said Karli , and Jochi and the others began to laugh . " Hushala , " said Sister Marianna and I ! clnrtit in his too-big slippers crossed the stone floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jochi , " he said , and Jochi put his hand out and shook Helmut 's hand , a quick short unaccustomed jerk from the wrist . " Auf Wiedersehen , " he said .  | Helmut went down the ward holding to Sister Marianna , the slippers flopping , the sleeves of the gray and green wrapper concealing even his fingers , wavering past the long watchful rows of beds , past Cristl standing , and out the door into the hallway , moving a little dazed and cured out into the incurability of the world again . In the bath he said : " What time did my norther say she 'd come , Sister Marianna ? " and Sister Marianna answered : " It 's early still . She 'll be coming in a little while . " If the burgomaster 's daughter could not sleep at night Sister Marianna took a cup of hot milk to her and sitting by the bed went on with the story where she had left off : " If you had been here at Christmas you would have seen how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the other and all the beds pushed to the middle so that everyone sitting up in bed could see everyone else no matter what they had wrong with them . " And it went on that Dr. Prochaska bought the Christmas tree himself and brought it up in the evening , carrying it right through Infektionhaus garden and up the steps in the snow . The night-light was burning outside in the hallway now and the swastika fires burning high and far on the mountains in the spring and Sister Marianna sat by the bed talking about Dr. Prochaska . He set the tree up in the women 's ward , right there in the middle before the doors were opened and the children never saw it until after supper , and they sat up in bed with silver crowns on that Resi and Marianna  | had made out of paper for them and they all began singing , " Ihr Kinderlein konrmet , o konrmet doch all ' . " Dr. Prochaska had trimmed the tree himself , putting glass birds in tinsel cages on it , standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resi standing below handing the separate birds carefully to him , white , golden , ruby , or aquamarine birds with straight silky-haired tails , some of them without cages but with a spring-like thread of leg to make them quiver on the fresh dark branches . " There was never a Christmas Eve here like that one , " said Sister Marianna , sitting there in the halfdarkness by the bed , her hands folded under her apron , her voice because she was sitting at rest , a little weary and old . " We never had a doctor here like him before , " she said , and with her head turned towards the night in the window and watching the great crosses of fire she said Dr. Prochaska carne upstairs two steps at a time with the things for the children in his arms . There were all these things he had bought for them himself but this was not enough to say , for there were the faces of these children , Karli and Cristl and the others , the faces of children who had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never anything at all , and they were watching him come into the room . Sister Marianna stood in the hallway and she thought she was laughing but in a minute she saw the front of her dress was wet and she knew she was crying . She did n't know why she was crying but she stood there watching him go into  | the ward with the dolls and the games and the sticks of candy and the houses and hearts made out of cake and the tears kept running down her dress . " And do you know what Cristl did ? " Sister Marianna whispered to the burgomaster 's daughter and she was wiping her eyes in her handkerchief even now and trying to laugh as she whispered the story across the bed in the dark . " Cristl had never seen a doll before and she cried when Dr. Prochaska put it into the bed with her and cried when he took it out ! " And Dr. Prochaska picked Cristl up out of bed and put her on his shoulders and he went running and jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she held on tight to his hair , not knowing how to laugh with the rubber cork in her mouth but still not crying , the windpipe he had cut so neatly for her clamped fast in the golden chain she always wore . " Now finish your milk-ala , " Sister Marianna whispered , and she said : " Ja , ja , things go on and then things come to an end , and we 've seen a lot of them , a lot of doctors here in the twenty-five years and there 's never been anyone like him . " And on her feast-day it was another thing : he had a gilded wicker baby-coach sent her , big enough for a doll to sit in and filled to the top with candied fruit and bonbons with liqueur inside them . There were pink silk roses covering the wheels , she said to the burgomaster 's daughter , and sprays of artificial fern and lilies of the valley . And on Resi 's feast-day he gave her white  | combs for her hair , seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and set with stones that might just as well have been diamonds . " I 've got the baby-coach still , " she said . " Done up in paper , and the flowers on the wheels the way they were ? " And then they heard the child call out from the other ward . " Sister Marianna , " Helmut cried out in his sleep . " Sister Marianna ? " When Sister Marianna passed out into the hall with the empty milk cup in her hand the burgomaster 's daughter lay quiet a moment watching the fires burning and then she took the photograph from under her pillow and put it against her mouth , embracing long and quiveringly what might have been the likeness printed there or the still undefined vision of a face to come , laying it at last under her pillow beneath the steady articulation of her heart . Sister Resi came hurrying up the stairs , mounting almost at a run , a look of chaos and inexplicable wildness in her face . She came breathless to the door of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness within , and she waited there , her under-lip hanging , her hands twitching in her apron , her face livid under the blue high-burning light . It was five minutes before Sister Marianna came softly down the avenue between the beds and passed her in the doorway . " What is it , Res-ala ? " she said . She put the cup in which the milk had been under the running tap in  | the lull and this sound of water entering a receptacle and filling it and brimming over unhalted was the only sound of the waking and the living left in the long stone corridor and the dark slumbering rooms . Sister Resi 's hands twisted a long time before her before she could bring herself to speech . Then she said wildly : " Dr. Prochaska . Dr. Prochaska . . . . Downstairs . . . . A woman came in with him . " She stood whispering in anguish up the distance between them and above the sound of the slow and steadily running water to Marianna 's face . " She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I was just coming out , just now , when I saw the two of them .... " Sister Marianna turned the frosted handle of the tap and stifled a yawn in her throat as she looked down in dreamy compassion on the startled eyes , the shaking lip , the trembling hands of this grotesquely humped , monstrously misshapen instrument of God . " Did you leave a note reminding Dr. Prochaska to telephone Helmut 's mother in the morning to find out why she did n't come ? " The yawn was rising again in Sister Marianna 's mouth but she managed to say , " You go close the laboratory windows while I boil the rest of the milk , " before it finally engulfed her speech . After their prayers , Sister Marianna said one more thing : " Dr. Prochaska has three sisters in Vienna . Perhaps one of them is visiting him . She 's been corning here since March now . Do n't think of it any more , do n't talk about it to anyone . Just watch the pretty fire-alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1HERE was one bathroom in the Gasthaus , installed in what had been a lesser bedroom , the tub a tin one and enclosed in a board . casing so that it now resembled a coffin with the lid off set down on the floor and the floor laid with a dark linoleum representing the grain of wood and the lower halves of the two windows that opened on the beer-garden pasted with a green and yellow patterned paper , the corners of which were peeling from the glass . Here on the plush divan by the linen closet Muti Praxlmann sat with the freshly dried and still unironed towels of the Gasthrrus heaped up beside her , the air warm and moist and a little clouded , the one bulb lighted and hanging the long way from the ceiling , the mirror over the wash-basin misted with steam . Her two hands worked together and independently of the action of her voice , seizing one towel and opening it out , the eye running sharp across it for stain or tear before putting it to one side or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tub Cilli 's hair and the side of her face and the neck and shoulder showed as she washed herself slowly , deliberately , in the deep hot Saturday night water , manipulating the soap carefully over her arms and body as she listened to what Muti said .  | " And if we give up another bedroom still for a bathroom then you 'll be turning the whole place into a bath-house , I told him . You talk about having enough baths for the clients but the first thing you know you wo n't have a bedroom left to put a client in if you keep on running pipes into every room like a boiler factory . " Muti seized the next towel and spread it on her apron . " I said to him you 've got the future to think about . You 've got a daughter who 'll be getting married before you know where you are and instead of having a room to put her and the children in when they come visiting you 'll have nothing but bathrooms . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe I wo n't get married , " said Cilli . She watched her feet drift lazily to the surface and the clean pink toes puncture the water and protrude . Muti looked quickly , sharply at her . " He said he 'd be coming down this week again , " she said and her hands picked up the next towel and opened it out . " Who ? " said Cilli from the tub , her head not turning . " Who ? " said Muti , stopping work . " Toni . I 'm talking about Toni . " Cilli rubbed the soap slowly down her lifted leg . " I thought you were talking about Fati putting bathrooms in , " she said . " But now I 'm talking about Toni , " said Muti . She leaned forward , watching Cilli sharply from across  | the room . " You , Cilli , you listen to me , " she said , not working . " You 've got the right to marry who you want to and your father need n't meddle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , you know that , Cilli . It 's not your father getting married this time . " " Ja , ja , " said Cilli without turning . " I know . " " He said he would be down again this week , " said Muti . She shook the towel out and spread it on her knees . " He told me that when he brought you home from the kino Tuesday night . " " Who ? Fati ? " said Cilli , soaping languidly down her arms . " Herr Gott , Toni ! " cried Muti . She sat looking in anger a moment at the side of Cilli 's face , her eyes fixed savagely on the bright pinned-up hair and the cheek flushed red with heat and the naked shoulder above the wooden rim . " Now , Cilli , you want to get married , do n't you ? " she said . " Ja , ja , " said Cilli in the lazily rocking sing-song of assent . " Ja , ja . " " And this Toni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own . Whatever your father says about him ? " " I 'd like to marry a doctor , " said Cilli suddenly . She saw her own hands and arms beneath the water , floating dwarfed and shortened like the limbs of a stranger rising slowly to the surface . " A doctor ! " said Muti . She put down the towel and stared again at the wet red cheek and the red ear close beneath the hair and the hair beginning to curl up  | in the neck from the steam , the bright white straying bits of it illuminated by the electric light and twisting delicately upward from the heat . " What doctor ? What kind of a doctor ? " Cilli sat quiet in the water watching her legs float in the tub and the kneecaps and the toenails reappear . " Just a doctor , " she said , without looking at her mother . " You know , perhaps a man like Dr. Holler , a man like that who believes ? " " Who believes ? " said Muti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But beyond this there was nothing , no words to put together , no answer to make , the unrest scarcely formulated in thought yet and it might be never to be given shape or speech because it was now and had been all year more like a suddenly fitful crying of the heart , the wishfulness and the despair coming quickly through the blood . Cilli sat watching the water , feeling the mind , the flesh , the bones within the flesh swept empty by what no one else could feel or recognize as the chaos and the power of the cyclone of fear and love that blew wildly and silently in gusts then ceased . She could not turn her head now , or see , because the tears had come into her eyes , but who believes in what she could remember hearing and the edge of the answer , like a bit of coastline just seen very far , scarcely perceived in sight but more like a memory of a line of land , who believes in this fright and in this chaos and in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said out loud in a moment . " I do n't know what I mean . " " Ja , ja , " said Muti with the look of craftiness come now to her eye . " You 're thinking of someone , some doctor , perhaps a doctor you 've seen here at the Gasthaus ? " " It 's not true ! " Cilli cried out . ja , " said Muti , leaning forward . " Someone has been saying something to you . I can see it . Someone 's been talking to you . " " No , it 's not true , " said Cilli , but Muti threw the towel aside and got to her feet and stood there , the narrow-faced , mahogany-wigged woman , staring shrewdly at her daughter across the room . " I wo n't have you talking like that with men , " said Muti in a low fierce voice and she began coming quickly , leaning forward , crouching a little and coming to the tub . " I wo n't have you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He comes in here with that foreign woman painted up and now he 's trying another game , is he ? He 's trying that , is he ? A man with no respect for the church or the state ? " " Who ? " said Cilli and she had already put her hands up to ward it off . " Do n't ever talk to me about a doctor again ! " Muti said in a fierce unshaken whisper and leaning at the tub 's edge she seized Cilli 's hair and jerked back her head . " Open your mouth now , open your mouth , " she whispered in strong wild sibilant speech . She had  | taken the soap up in her free hand and now she smeared it hard across Cilli 's tightly closed mouth and the pink shiny face . She drew the head back by the hair until the braids dripped in the water and Cilli , writhing sideways , screamed through her tight-set teeth . " Open your mouth , " said Muti and twisting the head back she forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming substance in and wiped it across Cilli 's tongue . " There ! " she said , dropping the soap and freeing Cilli 's hair . She stood back , drying her hands in her apron . " Now your mouth 's clean of it ! You 'll never talk like that to me again ! And you 'll not wait on that man when he comes in the place , and you 'll not think of him ? " She stood watching Cilli getting from the water , crying hard and feeling blindly for the bath-towel on the chair . " You 'll not even think of marrying a doctor , " she said and Cilli drew the towel around her , wiped her face with it and sat down crying . It could not be said whether the noise that shattered the house came first or whether this was preceded by the actual sight of the particles of glass blown suddenly in as if from pressure of the air outside . But at the moment it seemed that the sound of the explosion splitting the darkness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneous manifestations of disaster . The tiny glittering fragments of what had been whole panes rained down upon the divan and the heaped-up towels and on the floor , and Muti stood motionless a long while looking  | without emotion at the two ragged openings where the windows had been , looking and uttering no cry , speaking no word , straight out into the dark and smoke-filled night beyond them . Cilli , still sitting on the chair beside the tub , recognized slowly and without surprise the seat of one of the beer-garden chairs floating now on the surface of still unemptied water . They neither of them , the mother or the daughter , moved until an instant later when the voice of a man called out in the garden , " Air-raid ! Lights out ! " and then Muti spun around to the electric button and the room went dark . There they remained , the one woman standing in the dust of glass , the other seated in the bath towel , and no word spoken as they waited for the next bomb to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirr and whine of motors swooping near . But nothing could be heard passing overhead and out of the absolute stillness came Muti 's whisper , saying , " Dry yourself , Cilli . " Cilli began to rub her arms with the towel as if at this moment , with the end perhaps ready to strike just beside her or just before her , there was no other gesture to be made , and then the lights sprang suddenly up in the beer-garden below and among the many calling voices and the running feet they heard the roar of Fati 's voice and the roar and anguish of his weeping , the terrible sobbing , the uncontrolled loud protestations against the horror of what had come . Muti crossed the floor gingerly on tiptoe , drawn from the darkness of death  | it might be by human living sound , walking carefully , picking her way in silence as if a baby were sleeping in the room . Cilli could see her standing before one gaping aperture that had been a window in the wall , outlined against the flood-lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Herr Gott ! " she suddenly cried aloud and then she began laughing , laughing in high piercing screams as if the sight of it would make her die . Cilli could see her with her head thrown back laughing before the shattered window , shrieking it out in a high thin squeal of sound . " Muti , I ca n't walk , I ca n't get to the window ! " Cilli cried , shaking her hands . " I have n't any slippers and there 's glass on the floor ! Muti , what 's happened , what 's happened ? Do n't leave me here alone ! " " Herr Cott , Herr Gott ! " screamed Muti , and from the garden came the shouting and talking and the roar and sob of Fati 's grief . " Everything 's gone , everything ! " cried Muti and the laughter took flight again . " Everything gone , all the tables and chairs and the trees gone ! Nothing but ruins , nothing , nothing left ! " " But there 's the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She jumped up with the towel held around her and stamped her foot in fury on the floor . " There 's the house ! I can feel it ! We 're standing in it ! " " The garden , the whole beer-garden ! " Muti cried and then they heard the great roar of Fati 's voice : " You ! You , come down and see what you 've brought on us ! "  | " I brought this on you , I ? " cried Muti , standing on the edge of chaos . " Ah , Gott , ah , Gott ! " She stood at the opening looking down , the wild demented face lighted by the garden 's illumination , her hands clasped savagely before her , gazing stricken upon the devastation from which the smoke drifted quietly up two storys below . When Sister Marianna 's breathing began to come evenly and deeply through the darkness Sister Resi pushed back the covers , slipped one foot out upon the stone floor and felt across the bed 's end for the gray flannel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the edge of blue light that showed on three sides of the slightly moving curtain drawn between them and the hallway . She paused for a moment in the hall , her bare feet on the pavings , and drew the flannel jacket on , watching the doorways at the end and the curtain behind her with a quick startled eye . Then she crossed to the lavatories and opened the panelled door , passing from the corridor 's blue crepuscular light into this place and closed the door behind her . She did not turn the electric switch inside but stood waiting , seeing by what mysteriously muted luster came through the transom overhead the dripping tap fixed between the lavatories ' swinging doors . There she stood harking , her hand ready to move quickly to the knob behind her and close on it , the eyes ready to flash in warning from the drop fast gathering shape and hanging pendulant an instant on  | the tap 's mouth before dropping to the waste . In the hour she stood there waiting she did not stir ; except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand reaching slowly for the knob and then receding , and except for the eyes ' quick and occasional sharpening on what she took for sound she might have been held motionless and mindless there with sleep . But even from the first instant she had counted the drops as they gathered at the tap 's mouth and even counted the one which she did not see fall when her eyes flashed back to the door at the precognition of footsteps or of something opening or closing a long way . away . There began to come to her in only emotionally related stabs of thought the memory of days singled out of the semblance of youth she had lived through and out of the semblance of womanhood , and the shrunken and scarcely humanly conceived figure waiting humped and evil in the wan unnatural light and dress stood counting the drops of water and reviewing with triumph those isolated times at which the gesture had been made , the homage given by man or woman to her , the knee bent , the need spoken by either woman or man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and she went down the country road . from Uttendorf towards her mother 's little house , carrying the books for the last time as she and the other children who were twelve that year carried them but carrying too this other thing that no year or learning lessened , no knife struck off , this portion of  | flesh and blood and substance on her shoulders that even old age did not wither , this muscular and naked monster that rode astride her and that she sustained and nourished , with every mouthful she ate giving sustenance to him and lying down with him at night , unable to escape him , to shake him from the saddle , unable to strike him until he loosened his hold . Inside the little house in the country her mother looked up from the bed and gave her for the first time the subtle nurturing of the pride in words spoken to her : " Resi , now you will be with me all day . I 've needed you so much . This is the day I 've always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water until the back broke or to lean all summer in the fields , still the delirious wooing of the pride was there , the words articulated finally to her : " Resi , I need you . I have always needed you , " even if only to hew the wood and carry swill to the pigs . " Resi , I can not get along without you . Nothing else will do . " Or the first year she came to work in Infektionhaus after her mother was dead there was one man and she could remember his eyes and his mouth and the words he said . It was not the women and men and the children who had come and gone from there she remembered , or the children like Cristl and Karli who remained , but one man with the gray stubble thick on his jaw who in the last days did not call out to God any more or cry out from pain if this one woman , this toad , this viper whom Cristl hid her face from , came to him and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-light that came through the transom she could see him stretch his arm out and feel his fingers in her hair . Even if he could see no longer and was too near death to distinguish sleeping from waking or night from day , still his hand moved under the lay-sister 's cap and he spoke the words then , saying them softly to Tier as they had never before been said : " You are little , Sister Resi . I 've always been afraid of women , but you 're so little I would n't have been afraid , " using even the intimate " du " to her perhaps because he felt the approach of transmutation or because he no longer knew who stood there , but nevertheless saying , " Thou art so little I would not have been afraid . " Or remembering between the drops of water taking shape and falling the time Dr. Prochaska gave Marianna the camera in the garden , gave it without hesitation to Marianna so that he could put his arm around this practical joke of God 's and draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt of his long belted blouse and say those words which had never for an instant seemed a mockery to her : " Sister Marianna , you take our photograph now , you take Sister Resi and me , you take me and my girl together . " Once said this had been for a year inexplicably allied to truth , plausible even when she told herself grinning into the pillow at night that he who was thirty had somehow failed to see that she was twice his age . She seemed to hear the footsteps coming up the garden steps at last and the eyes darted , the hand  | moved crooked to the shape of the doorknob , but no other sound was heard and she turned back to watch the water gathering , pear-shaped , on the brass lip of the spout . Counting this as it dropped she remembered Dr. Prochaska 's voice saying , " When you leave here I 'll leave too , Sister Resi . I wo n't be able to get on without you when the Sisters in their high hats take Infektionhaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my bicycle in at night when I forget it ? I could n't get on without you , Sister Resi , " spoken a long time ago , before the spring began , before March , before the knowledge of this woman coining in at night with him to sleep in the same room with him and to go early as Resi had watched her go at five in the morning before the porter went on duty at the gate into the street . She had seen Dr. Prochaska in his dressing-gown and slippers come down the hall with her in the early day , his arm around her as his arm had been , and watching through the cautiously and tremblingly held lavatory door seen hint cover her mouth with his mouth as if still thirsting after the insatiate night . Sister Resi 's hands flew wildly to her face and covered her eyes as though to hide from them the memory of this sight . " Not me , not nie , " she whispered savagely against her palms , and then she looked fiercely up and counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more or me at any time but simply wanting someone here to serve and to see nothing , say nothing . Habicht and Frauenfeld talking over the  | radio from Germany at night and nothing said , nothing repeated , only the mute and the blind and the puerile here to cover what he is ; his " I 've got your photograph with me hanging in my room where I can see it , Sister Resi " like a mockery now not only of the spirit but of the incurably and miserably contorted flesh . Far down the corridor she heard the door open in from the garden and her hand closed eagerly on the knob . She drew the door to the lavatories imperceptibly inward and standing in the thread of crack she watched them from the half-darkness come into the stone corridor of cold blue light and watched them go , their backs turned to her , tall , slender , marvellous in their perfection , going shamelessly and carelessly towards sleep together and the vicious ambiguity of sin . When the doctor 's door had closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself and then the fit of trembling seized her , shaking her wildly as she crouched against the door-jamb in her nightdress , the little body dwarfed by the gigantic frame of wood . She stood watching the drop of water form on the tap , rehearsing the words as they might be written down , perhaps beginning " a friend of the hospital would like to call attention , " perhaps printing it out the way a child might . " Those two , " she told herself again , " using us , using me and Marianna . . . " She was standing there against the door still , her flesh crawling with the cold from the paved floor and  | seeing the words that might be put on paper or might be said , the knowledge they gave good as a slap across his mouth in parting , when the stones and windows of the hospital trembled about her as the explosion on the Andreas-Hofer-Strasse shook the valley and split the night in half with sound .  | Chapter Twenty-one FATI PRAXLMANN said it was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press next door , and " The Nazis ! " screamed Muti like a parrot on its branch . " As if you knew , as if anyone could say . . . " They stood in the beer-garden in the sudden summer of lunch-time , for the first time in their lives not dressed for Sunday , perhaps in their agitation having forgotten what day it was . " Look here , Prochaska , look here ! " cried the old man when he saw the doctor coming out the door . Ile shook out his hands and looked grief-stricken and still perplexed at the wreckage and the bomb-torn ground . " I heard it at the hospital , " Dr. Prochaska said and he came across the devastation to them , making his way over the shattered fallen trees , kicking aside the split planks of tables and the legs of chairs blown short , wherever he stepped splintering finer the layers of broken glass . " I 'd just gone to bed when the explosion shook Infektionhaus . Herr Gott , it 's a nice mess ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street side , Fad Praxlmann went on , but the watchman in the newspaper building had seen it and flung the bomb out  | the doorway in time . It blew a hole six feet deep in the Andreas-Hofer-Strasse but no tram had been passing that late at night and no one walking either . But last night it had been done from the beer-garden . " Done by somebody who came into the beergarden , " Fati Praxlmann said , roaring it across the broken timber to the sagging but still unfallen beams of the bowling alley at the end where the echo spoke it . " Somebody must have come into the garden last night for a glass of beer , hid away in the howlingalley maybe while we closed the place up , and then climbed over the wall to the newspaper yard and lit the bomb and then got out over the wall and the hack fences . And then that watchman , that coward , found the bomb and what did he do but pick it up and throw it right across the wall ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole blasted at his feet . " If there had been people sitting here eating , it would have been all the same to him ! I le would have thrown it into the garden here and killed half a dozen people , just to save that filthy rag of news , that damnable sheet of lies ? ! " " Now , now , my Rudolf , " Muti Praxlntann said , the fiercely conciliatory smile stretched at the doctor and at the people gathered at the rope and looking in through the passage from the street . " You 've never read the newspaper so of course you do n't know , and you 've no idea who could have put the bomb in there so it 's foolish to talk of people climbing over the wall and put suspicion on our clients ? " She  | was not sure whether the crowd in the street could hear his words but still she put herself between him and the people staring in , wearing the curious look of mingled shock and pleasure with which people view disaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Anyone might think someone here , someone in our house did it , " she said , the wildly given smile stretched naked in denial . " Silence ! " roared the old man . " You get in the house and let men talk together ! Look at my house , my garden , Prochaska ! " He turned to the doctor , his arms out , not even seeing his wife go towards the kitchen , not thinking of her any more . " Look at my balconies ! Look at my bowling-alley ! " he said and then he swung towards the newspaper plant on the other side of the wall . " And look at that place ! One window broken ! One window , that 's all ! " His face was loosening , quivering again with grief . " The watchman says he did n't even look  --  he just closed his eyes and threw it ! He could have put the bomb in water or called for help  --  at the worst he could have just got out and given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw it ! " He stood facing the gaping windows , his arms out , the great trees in full leaf fallen in the dust and chaos around him , and the tears ran down his face . " Who was in last night ? " the doctor asked in a quiet voice . " Two or three of them , " said Fati . He wiped his nose on the cuff of his shirt and looked with his  | sagging eyes at the doctor . " That fool who has the zither was in here late . Perhaps it was that one . He never waits for orders , never takes advice . Everyone of you going off on your own and doing whatever it comes into your heads to do ! " His anger was rising again , staining his soft old throat and his hanging jowls with red . " Somebody climbed up the church spire in Kirchstadt on Friday night , " he said , " and put the swastika flag on it . Everybody woke up there yesterday morning and found the swastika floating over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing a game of hide-and-seek instead of men ! Climbing up church spires , throwing bombs in beergardens , taking women up and down mountains on skis as if it were a Sunday afternoon outing , a big picnic you 're asking everybody in the country to ! Schlamperei ! " roared Praxlmann . " Schlrrmperei ! That 's what 's wrong with every one of you ! I 'm sick of having to deal with the lot of you ! It 's like trying to make a nation of children do the work of men ! " The two girls stood looking at each other in the ravaged garden , the American girl with her eyes narrowed against the noon-day light looking at the Austrian girl and without emotion at the devastated place . They stopped there looking at each other like two strangers who have wandered in circles through a nightmare or earthquake-distorted forest and have now come face to face with humanity in the shape of each other . " That 's your father over there . Praxlmann 's your  | father , is n't he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in her blue linen dress , her legs bare , her white canvas shoes dead white against the dust . " Yes , " said Cilli . The braids were down like a child 's on her shoulders and from one hand hung the potato basket she had been filling with bits of the glass and wood selected from the hopeless chaos . " My father 's in America , " Pendennis said and Cilli leaned down and began picking at the confusion on the ground again . " One time I said I was never going to leave him , " said Pendennis and she did not look at Cilli 's face when she spoke but she too began picking up the bits of glass and dropping them into the potato basket . " Do n't , " said Cilli quickly . " Look at my fingers . You 'll cut yourself . " " But I left him just the same , " said Pendennis . The eyes did not lift from the ground , the slender rednailed hand choosing still from among the seemingly untouched disorder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything I said I left him . " " But the Gnadige Frau will go home sometime and then she 'll see him , " said Cilli with her head down , and then the roar of Praxlmann 's voice made them turn . Cilli watched the American turning on her pure white heels , seeing the thin bare legs , the bare arms with the tight broad metal cuffs just covering the wrists , and " PAY ! " roared Fati Praxlmann . " I , pay ! " He was standing with the doctor beside him , the  | two men facing the newspaper plant , and they saw the man who had come now to the one broken window of the Zeitung office and was leaning on the sill above them , looking down . " You 'll pay for my broken window , I said , Praxlmann , " the man in the window said . I lc wore a light gray jacket flecked with dark and his bicycle-handle moustaches were gray . He leaned casually on the sill of his broken window , relaxing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And who 'll pay for all this ? " shouted Praxlntann . " Who 's going to pay me ? " The man shrugged his shoulders . " Your party set that bomb in here ? " he said . " My party ! " roared Fati . The blood was purple in his face and his fingers closed convulsively on Prochaska 's arm . " Ja , ja , your party , " said the man . " I 'm not even sure it was n't you . But anyway my man threw it right back where it belonged . " Fati began advancing , staggering with fury and clutching Prochaska , towards the wall . " You 'll have to pay , " the man 's cool voice went on . " If you ca n't watch out who comes into your beer-garden and climbs my wall , then you 're the loser . That was a political bomb . You 'll pay . " " And me ? " shouted Praxlmann , the veins swollen to bursting in his forehead . " Who 'll pay me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me and buy me tables and chairs ? " He flung out his quivering  | arm towards the Gasthaus . " Every window in the back of my house is blown in and there 's one tree left standing ! Who 's going to pay me ? " " You , " said the man , leaning on the window in the sun . " You 'll pay yourself , Praxlmann . You 'll have to . You know you 'll have to . Unless you send the bill across the frontier to the Gauleiter with a letter thanking him for the nice bomb he sent to the Landesleiter and explaining that the Gauleiter 's bomb was used to blow up the Landesleiter 's Gasthaus because no one in the party knows what he 's doing anyway .... " I wo n't pay you a cent ! " roared Fati , and Dr. Prochaska standing beside him under the window said : " Herr Praxlmann can put this in the hands of a lawyer ? " " A lawyer ! " screamed the old man , swinging around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only lawyer in Feldbruck who 's not in prison ! " " You 'll pay all right , " said the man standing in the window , his hands hanging loosely in his trousers ' pockets now . " The government has stood behind every case like it . " " And how much longer , " said the doctor , looking up , the blood gone from his lips but his voice ringing clear and unshaken up the wall ; " how long do you think your dictatorship of assassins is going to hold out in Vienna ? Do you think we have n't had enough of it ? Do you think it 's men like you who are going to keep half our country in jail ? " The two girls heard the roar of joy burst from the  | people gathered outside in the street and saw the doctor turn in surprise and lift his hand and shake it in acknowledgment to them . The words the crowd called out to him were almost recognizable , almost distinguished with meaning in the wave of incoherent sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the doctor give the salute and receive from the people crowding at the rope the forbidden salute in answer . She looked quickly , her eves narrowed , at the newspaper plant and saw the man was no longer in the window , and she began saving aloud , " Now he 's let himself in for it , oh , damn hint , damn him , oh , damn you , Herr Doktor . He has n't left himself a chance , not a sucker 's chance . . . . " She turned quickly to Cilli who was squatting on her heels , watching . " Have they ever put anyone you know , any of your friends , in jail ? " Pendennis asked her and Cilli said : " Yes , " looking up at the other girl .  | Chapter Twenty-two OW that it was May the window by the desk stood open on the well-raked driveway and the long curving beds of earth where geraniums , white or the many different reds of roses , stood out of the rich dark soil in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sister Francisca sat there in the office on the ground floor of Zahlstock marking the papers on the desk before her and listening to the pleasantly subdued sound of talk from the patients in the garden . This gabled and balconied villa stood in the hospital grounds , isolated not by disease but money from the promiscuity of the general yard where the free patients in striped wrappers took the air . Here , inside the wrought-iron gate and the picturesquely ivyblotched wall , the patients lay in individually elegant dressing-gowns on long reclining chairs , or wandered chatting among the flower-beds . Sister Francisca could see them through the window and hear the light dilatory talk among them tinkling on , the best of the town , even though ailing , the most prosperous people , and even a few traveling foreigners fallen ill and come here , the most considerate people , the most prepared to pay the price the Sisters of the Order asked  | and always something over . The gardener had sprinkled the beds and the ovals of clipped grass and the driveway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once dry yet pierced with wet like great drops falling unabsorbed on dust , pungent beyond fragrance and warm to the point of suffocation , was present on the edge of the room . The simulation of summer come for a little while too soon had given the air the weight of August and the look of thunder in the deep pansy-blue that lay behind the sunlight and the bright white snow-tops of the mountains , and Sister Francisca among the litter of statues of the Holy Family , the gold time-pieces , the chintz-aproned chairs , started as if out of sleep when Sister Atheline came silently in and laid the afternoon letters down on the blotting-pad and then , without word or sound , turned and swept in her majestic dress to the doorway and passed through it and humbly closed the door behind . In the villa 's garden there was a pedestaled stone basin in which a jet of water played , and taking up the burnt-wood cutter to incise the mail Sister Francisca heard this sound of water falling . It was good to think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing convalescent ladies sometimes dipped and not to know that the thrushes who came every evening flew fresh from the shambles of Infektionhaus , their beaks still decorated with what the smallpox or typhoid-fever or the diphtheria or scarlet-fever wards had left .  | The letter that stopped her short was the one written in a child 's hand , folded three times in the faded blue envelope and no signature put to it . It had been mailed from Feldbruck at nine o'clock that same morning , the seemingly intentionally disformed and intentionally misspelled message beginning with , " A friend of the hospital would like to call your attention to , " and conveying meaning to her only after a minute of blind floundering thought . Sister Francisca rose trembling to her feet and clinging to the side of the desk with one hand forced her sight again upon the words of incredible accusation that shook wildly on the wildly quivering page . When the strength of purpose had come she folded the letter and fumbled an instant in the folds of the thick wide closely gathered skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she pressed the bell-button by the inkwell and waited standing , facing the door , for Sister Atheline to come . By eleven o'clock at night the two Sisters of the Order were there , the two women abroad in the dark more than an hour after their customary time for sleep , huddled in the wall 's shadow and retaining even in stealth a propriety that was perhaps not independent of the clothes they wore . The carriage-gate was closed for the night and standing just within it against the ivy they could see in the street-light planted on the other side the long continuing avenue of trees and read the sign done in white letters on a  | red ground and posted at the turning of the street : " Hupe einstellen Spital , " and saw the last tram for an instant , its windows lit , its bell clamoring as it took the corner of the Andreas-Hofer-Strasse , far and toylike the six or more long blocks away . Behind them in the garden of Zahlstock the jet of water rippled into the bath , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly shaken between the stillness of the perfectly extinguished villa and the quivering silence of the women waiting in the wall 's shelter front where the letter had indicated they might see . It was not quite the half hour when the two figures began to take shape down the length of the deserted street , a man and a woman walking slowly through the dark spring night . Sister Francisca 's hand dropped in warning on Sister Atheline 's arm and " la , ja , " Sister Atheline whispered . " Is it him then ? " Sister Francisca asked in a low voice and the other one answered , " I can not tell . " The two of them were coming onward , the man and the woman not walking arm in arm or even close , the woman keeping to the outside by the trees , appearing and disappearing under their shadows as she came , her skirt narrow and short , her head hare , and swinging what was either a hat or bag in one hand ; and the man keeping to the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation towards the hospital 's gate and the separate gate to the Zahlstock garden at the street 's turning where the avenue sloped downward to the bridge . Sister Francisca took a step  | forward on the gravel , her watching head unbearably advanced and almost clear of the shadow , the white wings of her headdress coming perilously close to taking the light through the bars . Her breath was imperceptibly exhaled and taken as she stood watching the two still unrecognizable figures come , ready to see how exactly the letter had described their coming , the eye persuaded even before the sanction of sight . " Yes , " she whispered , stepping back in a moment beside Sister Atheline . " It is him . " " Ja , ja , " said Sister Atheline . " I can see him now . " The man and woman had passed under the streetlight at the corner and they saw her hair , the dark longish loose-falling hair , and they saw it was a cap she carried . The man had stepped first from the sidewalk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late and spring-soft stillness across the avenue . And now the two women behind the wall heard the man 's voice , the same cool and deliberate voice they had for a year heard speaking in the stairway of Infektionhaus or at the doorway of the contagious wards , the bold absolutely certain and now slightly impatient tone going on with " . . . and this time there wo n't be any necessity for it . I 've given you the reasons and they 're good but whether they 're good or bad I believe in them and nothing 's going to change anything I 've said . . . . " They were wandering slowly and still apart past the gate and the drive of Zahlstock beyond to the entrance to the hospital yard . The women saw the doctor as he passed them  | feeling in his pocket for the key , close enough to be touched had they stretched a hand out through the bars , and the girl came loitering behind him , her shoes scuffing slowly through the dust . And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began speaking quickly , standing close to them and unaware , outlined against the street-light , the head raised , the legs thin , the words flung sharply and quickly at the doctor who waited out of sight beyond . " What you wo n't see is that it 's not me going with you he minds , but it 's you not taking orders , his orders . That 's all the old men care about , the young ones not doing what they 've told them to do exactly as they told them to do it . And you sit there at the table with him night after night , believing everything he tells you , just like a kid taking it all in and looking ashamed when he speaks his mind out to you . . . . " " We 've had it all out , " said the doctor . " Now let it drop . " The Sisters could hear his bold cool impatient voice coming from where he waited for the girl . " I have n't said half , " the girl went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you go on swallowing it . You go on living your life , young man , ' that old bastard says to you , do just exactly as you please only do n't ever do anything unless I tell you to ! ' And you keep on crying for more as if you liked it ! You keep on ? " " Are you finished now ? " said the doctor 's voice . " No , " said the girl . " I 've just begun . They can even  | tell you who 's to go up a mountain with you and who 's to come down and you take it , you take it ! One day a man ca n't jump off a wooden platform and break his neck because he 's a Jew and the next day a girl ca n't go for a walk on Sunday with you and you take your orders , you swallow it all down along with your pride and your sense or whathaveyou ! One day they 're going to put a pretty little uniform on you with hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run along to war , dear , ' and wo n't that be a lot of fun ? And you 'll go , you 'll go all right because it might hurt Fati Praxlmann 's feelings if you refused to let that bullet go in one ear and come out the other , taking your brains for a ride on its way , only you have n't any brains ? " " You can stop it there , " said the doctor 's voice and the two Sisters heard his key turn in the gate beyond and watching from the darkness saw the movement of the girl 's body , the sudden droop and curve as if the will 's and the anger 's passion had abruptly perished at the sound . In a moment she would , exactly as the letter had described it , go through the gate with him and into the hospital 's garden and past the general buildings to Infektionhaus wall and through that second gate to the confusion of grass and weed within and up the steps and down the hallway to the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The two Sisters of the Order made no movement but stood breathless by the ivy , waiting ,  | listening , and then the girl 's voice , subdued now and persuasive , went on . " I 'm not just saying I want to go up that mountain with you . You know it is n't just that or just to have my own way . It 's because I want you to say hell to them when it 's hell and not let them tell you . " " You do n't know anything about it ! " said the doctor savagely . " You do n't understand for a moment what we 're doing  --  you ca n't see it ? " " Herr Doktor , I want to go with you on Sunday . I do n't care what anyone says . I want to come down the Schmittenhohe with you , " the girl said , speaking softly , urgently to him . " Take me with you . Let me go . " " We 've had it out , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it stop . " " All right , " said the girl , the voice hard , quick and bitter again . The women saw the paper pulled out of her pocket . " All right , " she said , " I 've got my orders too . Your old man back there showing me the way out of the country and mine paying for it . He 's sent me enough for the passage and he says if I do n't go home he 's coming over after me . Your old C:asthaus keeper telling you what air to breathe and my old man telling me what 's good for me . " Suddenly she took the letter in both hands and tore it violently across three times and then once the other way , and stuffed the pieces in her pocket . " What he sent is just about enough to keep me all summer if I change hotels and that 's what I do with orders ! Every one  | I 've ever had in my life , that 's what 's happened to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a damned one of them will drive me out or buy me out as long as I want to stay here ! I 'm not afraid of them no matter how loud they talk and you shake in your boots if they lift their finger , if they . . . " The doctor had begun to come towards her but the girl spun around and with her cap still in her hand ran back across the street and onto the walk beneath the street-light where the white letters on red said , " Hupe einstellen Spital " and , running fast now , passed out of the illumination into the darkness underneath the trees , running silently and swiftly down the deserted avenue . The doctor stood still a moment before the gate of Zahlstock watching her go and making no move to follow , his arms folded over , standing dark against the light beyond , saying nothing , and in a little while he dropped his arms and went on to the other gate and the two Sisters of the Order heard it open and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlighted yard . It was after twelve and the glass doors closed so that the hotel porter , the brass buttons of his jacket undone and his collar off , must come down the long hallway in which the light sprang up , hurrying down between the rows of potted plants to let her in . The girl waiting in the street could see him coming , halfrunning towards her , selecting the key from the others on the key-ring he held . Inside the lift-boy was  | gone for the night and the porter opened the elevator cage for her , handed her the room key and closed the gate . " Guten Nacht , Gnddige Fran , " he said and the lift began rising . " Guten Nacht , " the girl said . In the bedroom she threw her cap down on the table among the packages of half-filled cigarettes , the torn and ink-blotted bits of hotel writing-paper , the copies of several Paris-American newspapers that had been read and folded inside out , the pair of calf-skin gloves , the single silk stocking , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black suede-shoe cleaner marking the page , the three colored balls that had at one time been handkerchiefs of something like crepe de Chine , seeing with sudden interest the confusion of soiled crumpled blue ten schilling notes and the one twenty schilling note , the wheat sheafs and the grapes and the furrowed field weighted down by a handful of silver pieces and antiquely green . She took a cigarette out of the torn tin-foil and lit it and went to the bathroom at the other end of the room . There she switched on the light above the wash-basin 's mirror and looked at her face in it , the cigarette hanging , and combed back her hair . Then she turned on the bath water , kicked her shoes outside the door into the darkened hall and in her stocking-feet went to the immaculately opened bed and pushed the button by it twice . Because nothing happened and no one came she stood there awhile push-  | ing the white bell-button , two rings and then a silence and then two rings until the knock came on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl called out , " Herein ! " and turned and seeing the Zinrmermnadchen in the doorway , said : " I 'm leaving in the morning . You pack up my things tomorrow and the management will send them on . I 'll take with me what I need . You pack everything left tomorrow . " She pointed to the wardrobe and the tall thin girl reflected in the full-length glass lifted her arm and pointed back . " Get clean paper and things for my dresses and put all the shoes together in that leather business there . Just do anything with the bottles . Throw them away if you ca n't get them in . " She went to the littered table and took up from the discarded mementos of what life there had been the crumpled twenty schilling note and opened it out and held it towards the Zin nermadchen . " Here , " she said and the woman with the apron tied hastily around her nightdress and the knot of hair slipping sideways in her cap went quickly around the bed and curtsied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-past six . I want to get the first train to Vienna , " said Pendennis . " And turn off the water in the bath now as you go out . "  | Chapter Twenty-three ND then the interval of weeks or days that seemed to seek no conclusion nor to lead towards one began to pass in a fusion of time and space so that the doctor waking alone in the morning to an uncstablisbcd sense of shock or walking the streets a long time alone or sitting down alone to eat was less aware of bereavement than of a hopeless and speechless bitterness against the things that still were there . I le did not think of the girl , as if this sense of desolation were connected not with her but with the hospital , the town , the people 's faces or their voices , as if his doom were not to be without her but to be with them . It seemed to be summer evening after suninner evening that he walked into the Gasthaus and with his paper up before him ate reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beer-garden where the ground had been restored , before his beer and goulash and not watching the other people come and go . " So your young American friend has gone away ? " Praxlmann 's voice said out of a past that might have been last night or two weeks back , the sound of secret triumph never having quite expired . And the doctor standing impatient by his table answered : " Ja ,  | ja , it seems she 's gone to Vienna for a little while . " " So ! To Vienna ! " said Praxlmann out of space or memory or time . The doctor could see the quantity of beer left in his glass , the yellow honey-combed with unexploded air , and hear the snap of the pretzel breaking a long way back . " Our town a little too quiet for her , was it ? " said Praxlmann and the doctor 's eyes reached him an instant too late to catch the smile . There was the summer weather under the boughs of the one tree left standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light , and Dr. Prochaska did not sit down at the old man 's table before leaving and did not return directly to Infektionhaus but went further into the town to the Weinstube near the river to drink , and walked home late by the water in the darkness . " Going up to Kirchstadt tomorrow then ? " said Praxlmann through the blurred bright lens of beer . " Going alone this time ? " " Ja , ja , " said the doctor , his eyes too late again to see it . " Come to your senses then ? Keep things where they belong now , women where . . . " His laughter was shaking out in rings , ring after illuminated expanding ring behind which his open mouth , the white moustaches , the face itself dwindled and the sound of laughing dwindled to a point as if he were fading backwards down the corridor of when that was , while up the passage he had bored through  | recognition came two women , both of them wearing long serge coats and both leaning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pansies jerking on her hat wheeling what might have been a dollbaby 's coach before her and looking a little uncertainly ahead as she came . Dr. Prochaska saw them open the gate into the street and carry their bags through it and set them down and push the wicker doll 's coach through and stand there waiting and looking down the avenue towards the Andreas-Hofer-Strasse and beyond it to what was the freedom of this or any city , waiting perhaps for the sense of elation and the sense of release to come . Behind them was the hospital yard and the men and women in their striped wrappers still wandering there or limping slowly through it , and here was the gate closed for the last time and standing closed behind the two women who had put their bags down for a moment before going on . They did not look back or turn or speak but stood waiting outside the hospital gates , as prisoners at the end of a twenty-year sentence might have stood dazed by freedom and not knowing which way to go . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and his knapsack on his shoulders and calling their names aloud he ran down the avenue through the dust that lay on the walk beneath the trees until the two women , the one with pansies on her hat leaning to push the gilded wicker doll 's coach filled with parcels done in newspaper and carrying  | the bag in the other hand , and the other stooping to the suitcase she carried , the hump sideways on her back , the shoes or perhaps the feet in them too many sizes too large for walking , heard him calling and turned . " Sister Marianna , Sister Resi ! Sister Marianna , Sister Resi ! " Because it was Sunday he had the time to take the suitcases from them and go with them , walking at the pace the doll 's coach advanced , the pansies on Sister Marianna 's hat quivering below his right eye and below the other the twist and writhe of Sister Resi 's violent manipulation of shoe-leather and serge and blood and hair and bone . " So this is the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either of you ... not even saying ... " The bags were heavy , one hanging from each hand , his fingers closed fast around the leather that was not leather but paper stitched and painted or paper glued neatly over cardboard in imitation of the bags other people had . " We 've been together a long time now and you go off without saying a word of good-by to me . Is that any way to treat me , Sister Resi ? . . . " He might have been talking to someone else entirely , saying this out of grief and mutilation with his eyes closed to whom was there . But suddenly what he was saying stopped and Praxlmann 's face came into perfect and monstrous focus before him and Praxlmann 's voice said : " You know they 've been making enquiries at the hospital . " " Who 's been making enquiries ? About what ? " Dr.  | Prochaska felt the pull of his own mouth tightening . " The Herr Professor came in to lunch . Ike said he thought your radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I lc said the Sisters of the Order reported your radio disturbed the patients , particularly between seven-thirty and eight-thirty in the evening , every evening . He suggested you use a head-receiving set . " Dr. Prochaska stood by the old man 's table saying he was going up on Sunday and he had copied Habicht 's speech out , yes , and the other one too . He had got the information and he was going to communicate with Dr. Holler . You rolled the paper small and you forced it through a little opening in the skin of an orange and then you threw the fruit up to the window , and then Sister Marianna said : " Ah , we could n't find you so we were going to write you a little letter , Herr Doktor ! " She leaned lower at the curb to assist the gilt wheels of the doll 's coach , first the front ones and then the back ones over the edge and down into the street they crossed . " And going off in such a hurry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Prochaska , looking down at Sister Resi 's white high-built hair . Sister Marianna looked and laughed . " She 's wearing the white combs you gave her , Herr Doktor , " she said and her soft old elbow in the coat sleeve nudged his arm . " If I could get out of the place I 'd leave today , just like this , the way you 're leaving , " said Dr. Prochaska ,  | walking . " I swear I 'd go . If it was n't for the agreement made with them and the looking for something else I 'd get out now , this minute . I 've had enough of the place and the town and the people . . . " , his head and his shoulders riding up and down , steadily up and down with his gait , and his eyes staring blind and hot straight down the avenue of summer-headed trees . " There 's nothing to keep me here any more , nothing . . . . " " There 's the children , Herr Doktor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hat . " Oh , the children , " he said . " There 'd be someone else as good or better to look out for them . But I 'd get out of the way of the ladies in their bibs and hats prying into what I do . . . . " He was going too fast so he slowed down now , the two bags hanging heavier , and suddenly he stopped short under the trees and said : " Sister Marianna , take my handkerchief . There 's a clean one right here in my pocket . " He made the movement with his chin . " Now do what I say or else we 'll have you running the tram down with the baby coach and smashing the windows and the ... " " I 'm not crying , " said Sister Marianna , laughing , and Dr. Prochaska , standing holding the bags said : " Do as I say . " He saw her blow her nose , smiling , and wipe her eyes and then the movement began again as they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogging of the suitcases , the shoulders and  | the pansies , the turn and threadlike cry of the gilded wooden wheels of the doll 's coach pushed before them . " You 're too young , " he was saying with his eyes looking straight ahead down the avenue after the shape or the memory of someone running . " You two girls are much too young to waste your time back there in Infektionhaus . It 's time you got our and saw the world a little , traveled around . . . . " " Young , are we , young ! " cried Sister Marianna , laughing . " I 'm seventy-two , Herr Doktor ! ' har do you say to that ? " The smile went quickly from Sister Resi 's face for an instant and she glanced up at the doctor . " I 'm younger than Marianna , " she said . It was not a week or two weeks that passed , being a period unpunctuated by any consciousness of time , so that the day he climbed the stairs behind Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and watching her advance before him might have been part of that day or another . It was only the awareness of the rucksack on his back that established for him that this was Sunday still . He saw her standing on the stone floor of the fourth landing , watching him as he came , her mouth smiling , her hand opening the black handbag and taking out the key . " So you 'll stay on at the hospital just the same ? " said Sister Resi , her eyes turned sideways on him as she fitted the big iron key into the lock . The doctor put the two bags down on the paving stones of the landing and straightened up and took a breath .  | " I 'll have to stay another year there  --  unless they put inc out , " he said . Sister Marianna was still toiling up the stairs , coming into view behind him carrying the gilded doll 's coach in both hands and sighing . " Put you out ! " said Sister Resi with a little hoot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why should they put you out ? " she said . This might have been one Sunday of the period he began believing the girl had returned to the hotel room again or that she was the person just glimpsed beyond that group going along the river-walk in the sun or that buying tobacco in the Tabaktrafik he would turn and find her the woman who had come in behind him and was buying postcards by the door , having come now in this process of pain or hunger or despair to the altering of the dress and look and even the features of strangers so that they might resemble for a wild treacherous instant the pure and absent shape of love . He could see clearly the places and explanations of every possible return , her descent from the corridor of the train , the movement as she came in a new hat and a new dress he could almost picture down the street where the tourist char-abancs were lined . It was only in the unfailing exactness of detail he recognized the bright vicious lies his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in any of the ways he had conceived ; even as he looked eagerly in through the plate-glass window he knew she would not be waiting for him at the corner table in the coffee-  | house and when he went down the Weinstube steps at night and breathless and blind with hope pushed the door open knew she would not be there . This might have been the beginning of the night he made his way down the tramline to the cathedral square and crossed the cobbles between the statues and the two fountains to the coffee-house and through the billiard-room behind to the dining-room of the hotel and through it to the writing-room and there wandered among the glass-topped desks , picking the paper up and the pen up and putting the pen in the ink but not writing , not even knowing what to write . For a long time it did not become apparent to him that pride had no authentic place for existence between lovers as it had between friends or enemies and he walked through the rooms of the hotel where she had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning . Because of the work at the hospital and the other work possessing him , slowly completing the mastery of his will until even pain itself and the capacity to inflict it seemed blunted by the daily and scarcely varied motions of the flesh , he did not bring himself to the decision to go to Vienna or to any decision . IIc never once had the picture of himself saying the few words that need be said and getting his things together and going on a train . But instead of that he went at night through the hotel 's downstairs rooms and then up the avenue to the station and through the waitingrooms and the station restaurant and out along the  | platforms , as if this were the means , as if this were instinctively the way , wandering among the coming and going people and watching the trains come in and stop or pass , and then in a little while wandering out and down the Bahnhof-Strasse to the hotel on the square . All this , it might have been , was in preparation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the station restaurant and suddenly stopped short , as if for the first time knowing he was the man watching behind those eyes . He put up his hand to his cheek , the long strong slightly agitated fingers touching the substance of flesh and blood and he saw his own mouth shape a word , shape a name in anguish and wonder , and his heart filled up with joy as if he had been given speech again at last . " Pendennis , Pendennis , " he said . He stood saying it soundlessly into the glass . " Pendennis . Pendennis . " He said it out loud and once it was out of him he began laughing . He turned and went quickly out of the place and down the street in the dark warm night and he got to the square running . He went into the hotel the quick way , through the front door instead of through the coffee-house , and up the corridor lined with potted plants to the desk at the end where the telephone-booths were . The man in uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter where the register was lying opened wide , its double face partially covered by a yellow blotter delicately enscrolled with the blue tracery of fragmentary sig-  | natures and dates and names of other towns . When the doctor said her name , the man in uniform stood up . " She 's gone to Vienna , " he said . " Naturally , I know that , " said the doctor quickly . He stood by the counter , tall and composed , supremely certain now that he was here at last . " You told me that when I telephoned . I want her address in Vienna now . " The man in uniform turned his head towards the little green light that shone on the switchboard behind him and then he reached down and plugged the iron finger in and the light went out . " I 'm sorry , sir , " he said , coming back to the doctor 's face . " She did n't leave us an address . "  | Chapter Twenty-four THE room in which the music was playing was two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and strung with vines of variously colored bulbs of light , the tables and chairs , furniture that might have been lifted haphazard from kitchens and collected to do final service here , set along the two parallel walls the length of the space left clear for dancing . The piano at the end was an upright , black and highly varnished , emitting now a slightly off-key and purely personal rendition of " A Little Love , a Little Kiss , " played by the dapper ferret-faced man who sat bent on the stool before the keys . He had no score on the rack and his face was pointed over his shoulder and in absorption towards the floor on which the feet of people dancing moved , the bright brown melancholy eyes looking among the cracked patent leather oxfords or shoes of two shades of canvas , soiled white and black or contrasting shades of beige , as if for the notes and time and inspiration for what he played . The pianist 's black jacket was too tight across the shoulders and too short in the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrists , the jacket having perhaps belonged to a man smaller and the shirt to a bigger man before they had been handed  | on to him . He sat there playing , his head turned sideways to watch the feet , the feet of men dancing nimbly in shoes that were not new and never had been good , and the feet of girls in flat-heeled and dilapidated brogues , watching the men dancing with men , the women with women . His spine was bent like a finger and he wore a little saddle of black silky hair across his skull . Around the scam of his perfectly lipless mouth and up the jawbone to the ears , the bristles were shaved blue and the rouge on his cheekbones bloomed in great dark concave roses , rakish symbols of dissolution worn with resignation on either side of the long mournful nose . Playing , he saw that the American girl who had been coming in for a month now was one of them not dancing with another woman but with a tall stooping youth , an Englishman dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as holding her in his . He saw the other man 's violet-eyed and pallid face drooping across her shoulder , the throat in which the Adam 's apple jerked as he talked curving up , girl-white and slender , to the chin . At the tables or dancing there were all the others , the young men who might be waiters on their evening off dancing with each other , and the girls in plain dark suits and shirts and ties who danced in each other 's arms or sat stroking the backs of their friends ' masculinely clipped necks and touching each other 's hands and murmuring together , girls who worked eight hours a day in the cheap shops along the Maria-Hilfer
