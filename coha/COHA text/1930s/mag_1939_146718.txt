With religious and racial persecutions 10 a dozen in Europe , many people forget that in Mexico there has long been , if not a persecution , a very cramping restriction of Roman Catholics . Priests are forbidden by law to wear clerical garb outside their houses and their churches , and the cassock has not been seen in the streets of most Mexican states for many years . An eye opener for U. S. adepts of " selective indignation " * was a photograph circulated last week . It showed a group of Mexican and U. S. prelates , gathered in the patio of the home of Mexico 's Archbishop Luis M. Martinez . He and the Archbishop of Morelia wore their soutanes because , presumably , they were staying indoors . The others wore sack suits and neckties . <P> The U. S. churchmen-Bishop John Mark Gannon of Erie , Pa. , Bishop James A. Griffin of Springfield , Ill. , Monsignor Michael J. Ready of Washington-had gone to Mexico to confer on a joint enterprise , a seminary founded two years ago at Las Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For seminaries , as well as cassocks , are illegal in practice in Mexico . The U. S. prelates found the seminary with its 66 students , going well enough . For the rest , they visited Mexico City 's landmarks , were banqueted-in mufti-by a Methodist who has not always been popular with Catholic leaders , U. S. Ambassador Josephus Daniels . <P> * Catholic Author Arnold Lunn 's phrase for getting hot over persecution in one country , keeping cool over it in another .
