Like harvest time in the wheat belt , like the fishing season on the Grand Banks , the opening of the dressmaking season is , to Paris , a business event . Last week by boat , train and plane sharp-eyed buyers piled into the city to attend the official autumn &; winter openings of the great dress houses , openings that came so thick &; fast that exhausted buyers had scarcely time for more than a foot bath , a glass of tea and a herring between engagements all week long . At the most popular house of all , Schiaparelli , on the Place Vendme , department store executives who had crossed the U. S. and the Atlantic for no other purpose were glad to perch on a stair rail or the edge of a chromium table to peek at the new models . <P> One place that knowing buyers wasted no time on was the grandiloquent Pavilion d'Elgance in the Paris Exposition ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) , where frequent public fashion shows are held . Well they knew that none of the first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any style pirate or country dressmaker good at copying could walk into free . On the other hand more U. S. buyers than at any time since 1929 attended the private shows . <P> At week 's end when footsore buyers were ready to pack up with their order books suitably filled , the consensus on 1937 autumn styles seemed to be : <P> Dresses for daytime are slender , simply draped , with skirts still moderately short . Waistlines follow the designer 's whim . <P> Hats are very tall or very crooked , with few wide brims , many draped berets . <P> Evening gowns will be an embroiderer 's delight , appliqued with sequins , bugles , braid , beads and tinsel . Alix and Molyneux favor very full skirts , elaborately draped-fashion scouts kept harping on the word " Baroque . " <P> Sensation of the week was a group of transparent georgette evening dresses by Lanvin , embroidered with designs in wool . Demurely the models hoisted their skirts to show full-length opera tights , dyed to match the dress .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
