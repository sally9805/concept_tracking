THE SPECTER-Maxim Gorki-Appleton-Century ( $3.50 ) . <P> In 1930 U. S. readers got the first volume of Maxim Gorki 's lengthiest book . The story of Russian pre-Revolutionary intellectual life , it was called Bystander , revolved around an apathetic , intelligent provincial lawyer , Clim Samghim , who flirted all his life with the revolutionary movement , drifted with the winds of doctrine without ever finding harbor in a cause , a code of belief , a philosophy . Samghim 's story was carried on-in so far as it moved at all-in The Magnet and Other Fires . Last week the fourth and last volume , left unfinished by Gorki at his death in 1936. was published as The Specter , showed Samghim just as irresolute as he had been in the preceding 2,000 pages . <P> Why Gorki wanted to write 2,700 pages about this dull and will-less man is almost as great a mystery as the Moscow trials that disclosed a fantastic story of Gorki 's death. * The Specter begins with Samghim feebly awakened by an interest in a bold , mysterious client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shady negotiations over the sale of property in the Urals . But soon after they meet in Paris she is murdered , and suspicion of him in his home town drives him to Moscow . His wife , from whom he has been separated for years , dies , and Samghim becomes involved with a wealthy widow , with Bolsheviks before the Revolution , speculators during the War . Notes left by Gorki suggest that Samghim was to come to feel a personal hatred of Lenin , and to die in the Bolshevik seizure of power . Like the earlier volumes , The Specter is crowded with philosophic and political speculations , with scenes of suicides and bitter intellectual quarrels , with an oppressive boredom , which is the one sensation Clim Samghim feels strongly . Although The Specter is not likely to impress U. S. readers as a novel , the massive work of which it is part may well stand as a record of Russian intellectual life , for if Clim Samghim lacks reality as a human being , he responds like a barometer to changing pressures in stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , doctors either killed him or hastened his death .
