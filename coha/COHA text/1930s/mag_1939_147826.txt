For 17 years big Melville Shoe Corp . ( No. 1 U. S. shoe retailer ; sales : 10,000,000 pairs of shoes , 12,000,000 pairs of socks ) and J. F. McElwain Co. , Nashua , N. H. , shoemaker , have got along fine . The arrangement between them has been that Melville contracts to take most ( now 92% ) of McElwain 's yearly output , to be sold through its 652 Thom McAn chain stores . Under the plan the factory sold shoes to the distributor at cost , took a percentage of net profits from sales . This streamlined combine , which eliminated all conflict between the two main branches of an industry , did away with the expense of changing over machines , putting new models of shoes into production . It never failed to show a profit . Its boast was that neither half of the partnership had any control over the other . Last week that boast was liquidated . <P> To their stockholders the two firms proposed that they would merge . Reason : to make their cooperative enterprise permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) Melville to acquire all of McElwain 's outstanding 16,966 7% preferred and 104,726 common shares ; 2 ) Melville stockholders to submit to reclassification of their 99,992 6% preferred , 404,722 common shares , take shares of the new company in return . <P> To show that the merger was not born of necessity , both companies released their nine months ' earnings . On $27,019,958 sales Melville showed a net profit of $1,453,556 ( a shade under its profit for all of 1938 ) . McElwain 's net of $641,250 was well on the way toward topping its 1938 profit of $811,473 . <P> That done , dark , horsy Melville President Ward Melville , son of the late Founder Frank ( who fathered the idea of selling cheap , standard shoes at a fixed price ) , upped the price of his Thom McAn men 's shoes 15 to $3.30 a pair . He intimated he was doing so for the good of the industry . <P> Forced to import some 70,000,000 hides ( 15% of its cattle hides , 25% of its calf , 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , the industry has seen hide prices jump 10 to 30% since the advent of World War II . But shoe prices are only 12% above their Depression I low , are fully 30% under 1929 . That , say U. S. shoemakers , is giving the U. S. pedestrian a lot of shoe for his money . To the shoe industry , that also means a lot of business for its prices : 1936 and 1937 sales topped the 400,000,000-pair mark ( an all-time record , 60% over 1929 ) , and 1939 is expected to do it again . <P> Shoemaker Melville can afford to help the industry out . With his warehouses full of leather , the price increase should give him a nice inventory profit . Price boosts may work quite satisfactorily until they begin to set consumption back to the 1929 level .
