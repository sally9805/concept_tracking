If Albert Payson Terhune , Ernest Thompson Seton , Donald Culross Peattie and Thornton Burgess all put their heads together , they would hardly be able to devise an animal fiction as strange as the animal fact which baffled San Antonio , Texas last week . <P> Duchess Dumpy San Jos is a sturdy black mongrel ( Doberman pinscher &; Irish setter ) bitch belonging to Horticulturist Harvey C. Stiles . About a month ago , Mrs. Stiles held a dollar bill out to Dumpy and said , " Does n't that smell nice ? " Few days later , Dumpy turned up carrying in her mouth a dollar bill , which she pressed on her mistress . Next day she brought home another dollar . Each day for the following fortnight Dumpy brought home a dollar a day , never more , never less . Some of the bills were old-issue , large-sized dollars , most were current certificates . Only clue was that Dumpy 's snout was dirty , her paws muddy . <P> One day last week Dumpy fell sick ( indigestion ) . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt better . Next day , to make up for the day she had missed , she made two of her mysterious trips , brought back two dollars . Then she resumed her schedule of one per day . She made other extra trips later in the week , but disappointed her owners by carrying home in her jaws not extra cash , but a skimpy , flea-ridden terrier , a piece of bone , a sponge , a small grey kitten . <P> San Antonians began to follow Dumpy like children after the Pied Piper . Throughout the neighborhood , treasure hunters began pocking the ground like so many ' forty-niners . But Dumpy shook all pursuers , kept her source secret . By week 's end she had brought in $18 . Mrs. Stiles took some of the bills to a bank , where she was assured they were neither marked nor on wanted lists . This week all San Antonio was interested or involved in the hunt for Dumpy 's roll .               @ @ @ @ @ @
