txt Edwin 0 . Perrin , national commander of the American Veterans Association , alleged today that a pension program sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars would be so costly that " it would ultimately divert funds from the Treasury which are urgently needed to strengthen national defenses . " The proposed program , Mr. Perrin asserted , would be a step toward universal pensions , which would create eventually an expenditure of $1,000,000,000 a year . The criticism by the American Veterans Association , which opposed prepayment of the bonus , was based on a purported movement by the V. F. W. for pensions for all unemployed veterans and for needy widows and orphans of veterans , regardless of the cause of the veterans ' death . " It is the belief of our organization , " Mr. Perrin. said , " that the widow of a veteran uninjured in service is not entitled to be supported by the taxpayers for the rest of her life merely because her husband once wore the uniform of this country . Such legislation would blanket into the pension rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country during the war . " There are thousands of clearthinking veterans who believe every possible consideration should be offered the disabled and diseased soldiers whose afflictions are of service origin . To care for the widows and children of the combat dead land injured is a just debt a country owes its troops . More Aid to These Justified " If increased benefits are to be granted by Congress , more adequate provisions should be given this class . But it is reprehensible to maintain that every ex-soldier holds a chattel mortgage on the taxpayers ' money for years to come . " Mr. Perrin stated that in. the twenty years since the World . War a total of mime than $7,572,000,000 had been " given World War veterans and their dependents , as well as millions which have been spent for hospitalization of non-serviceconnected cases and other benefits . " " To impose another huge tax burden on this country at any time would be bad enough , " he added , " but to bring in widows of all the 4,000,000 " men who were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions when we . are faced with a gigantic deficit is nothing short of financial malpractice . " Legislation for all widows and unemployed veterans would , furthermore , be introductory to " the inclusion of all veterans and dependents in the fold of a universal pension system , " Mr. Perrin. alleged . " In cold mathematics such a drain on the national revenue would make current relief expenses seem to be a drop in the bucket , " , he added . " On the other hand , if such demands continue we are go // never asked for a pension for an able-bodied veteran . " We have asked Congress for Tensions for the widows of World ar veterans based upon the same ? rt of treatment that the widows of veterans of other wars receive . " It is true we are endeavoring every day to obtain jobs for veterans and all other persons who are innployable and who are over 40 gears of age .
