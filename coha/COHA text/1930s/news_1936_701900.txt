txt Herbert Hoover called upon the Republican party tonight to draw up a ! platform at Cleveland next month composed of " fighting words , " backed by " a determination to restore American liberty and to revitalize American life . " In a militant speech before a large audience assembled in the Academy of Music under the sponsorship of the Republican Women of Pennsylvania , the former President made public his conception of the campaign issues and the way they should be faced by the Republican party , " the only available instrumentality through which an aroused people can act . " Asserting that the platform should be " a platforts for the American people , " Mr. Hoover contended that factional issues should be dismissed and that an invitation should be extended to " those Democrats who feel as we do to join us in faith that we have but one purpose  --  that is , to place the Republic on the road to safety .

" The audience of more than 3,000 , which packed the auditorium and stage of the Academy , was an overwhelmingly Republican one . It seized every opportunity to express its anti-New Deal sentiments in applause , with which cheers and laughter were frequently mixed . During the speech , occupying more than thirty-five minutes , Mr. Hoover was interrupted some fifty times by the enthusiastic crowd . The applause was especially loud when , referring to the Democratic convention here next month , he said the delegates ought to " bare their heads before Independence Hall " and " apologize to the American people " under the " invisible presence of the men who founded a nation . that liberty might live . " " Instead , " he added , " they will produce splendiferous alibis .

" At another place , after asking the question , in his prepared speech , " Does it improve national morals and character in our people when they see such sums being rushed into politically important districts two jumps ahead of an election ? " he injected the further question : " Can the . American people be bought with their own money ? " After an ovation of nearly two iminutes at the conclusion of the speech the crowd renewed its cheering when some one shouted : " Boy , you told ' em plenty tonight !

" " We must get the government out of the home mortgage foreclosing and house-renting business and give a genuine impulse to better homes , " he said . The Republicans also must " demand a return to financial honor in government , " he said , and must fight the spoils system . Mr. Hoover suggested that Tammany Hall might " learn something new " about the spoils system from the New Dealers .

Harvey Taylor , Republican State chairman . In a brief speech he told Mr. Hoover it was " an honor and pleasure to welcome a Republican President to Pennsylvania . " " I know , " he went on , " that no State in the Union is more entitled to the honor . We have never failed a Republican President . " Mrs. George Horace Lorimer , president of the Republican Women of Pennsylvania , presided at the meeting . She was hostess earlier at a dinner at the Lorimer home in Wyncote , to which .
