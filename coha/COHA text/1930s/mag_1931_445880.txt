WITH the passing of the frontier , pioneering degenerated into mad scrambles for lands taken from the various Indian reservations . But after the experiences at the opening of the Cherokee Strip , in September 1893 , the government had to put an end to these land rushes en masse at a given signal . Giving away reservation plums at a tenth of their value incited to murder ; and murder , as a means of deciding who should win the prizes , fell into disrepute . Thereupon the government went into the lottery business , raffling off subsequent offerings of Indians ' lands by the drawing of numbers in envelopes from a big box . The Cherokee Strip ? more correctly , the Cherokee Outlet ? was a stretch of prairie country about sixty miles wide , extending for two hundred miles along the north line of the Indian Territory . North of it was Kansas ; south , the four-year-old Territory of Oklahoma . Its great extent , and its location next to settled country , drew the biggest crowd of adventurers ever gathered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were also a few farmers present . I went over from Nebraska to join the excitement . And of all the land booms this last of its kind was the wildest , most tragic , and most ridiculous . The Cherokees were originally a powerful Indian nation in Georgia . Successive treaties had cut their lands to what they considered an irreducible minimum . They might have hung to this minimum for some time had not gold been found on their reservation ; this shortened the story of the Cherokees in Georgia with a bang . They were ejected by a strong military force and led seven hundred miles through the wilds to the Indian Territory . Four thousand out of fourteen thousand died on the way . Horrible ? No worse , this exile of the // Cherokees , than that of some other Indian tribes to the Dump , ' except that there were more of the Cherokees to make a showing in the death total . From their reservation in the Indian Territory , the Cherokees were granted a ' perpetual outlet west ' to the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains . Hence the name for this long tract , ' the Cherokee Outlet . ' Successive treaties , again , had cut down their holdings in the Indian Territory . The last to go was this Outlet ; now it was to be rushed for on the crack of a gun at twelve o'clock noon , Saturday , September 16 , 1893 . The rush was to be made from a lineup on both the Kansas and the Oklahoma boundaries . I chose the Kansas State line , since two of my brothers , land men like myself , were living within twenty miles of the Cherokee border . it this point a railroad crossed the Strip , running southward to Oklahoma and Texas . My older brother and I , being landowners and therefore ineligible as homesteaders , were to make the run solely for the fun of it ; and , to get an extra kick out of the experience , we were going in on bicycles . I might anticipate by saying that we added novelty to the spectacle . Every other conveyance then known to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A week before the opening , we were exercising our steel bronchos along the Cherokee border . Thousands of boomers were already there , but arrivals just before twelve o'clock on the chosen Saturday would have the same chance in the rush . Yet most of these had been squatting here for a month or more ? members of that vast fraternity who spend a good part of their lives aimlessly waiting for something to turn up . A prairie-schooner crowd , largely , camped next to their tented wagons with their pots and pans and open fires , wherever space offered along the edges of the Kansas farms . Did the farm owners object ? Not many , if any . They were having a brisk local market for all their produce , from pigs and chickens to corn and oats . Objection might not have been effective anyway , with the southern borders of their farms virtually appropriated by the motley crowd waiting for the big run . It was a hundred in the shade , with no shade , and the south wind everlastingly blowing during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Texas to Canada , burning every green thing on the way . North of the boomers were the cultivated farms and tree-sheltered homes of Kansas . At their feet was the promised land of untouched prairie ; not a tree , not a building , nothing but the dried grass of a dry September , stretching as far south and east and west as they could see . Rich land , waiting for them at a dollar and a half per acre , and worth twenty ? but they were not to enter until the crack of the soldiers ' rifles out front gave them the signal to go . The new country had been surveyed in the usual way : four little holes at mile corners , with a small mound between them bearing the notched stone from which the land numbers could be read by those who knew how to do it . There were the half-mile marks , too , pointing east-west , or north-south , to send the boomer on the run to his mile corner , where he was supposed to stake a little flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all corners that that quarter section had been taken . This is the procedure : at the signal gun , Mr. Boomer starts on the fly ? on a wise little prairie mustang if he has good sense , or anything else from a race horse to a prairie schooner if he has n't ? and keeps going until he thinks he is well clear of all others still running ; then he and his partner ? they should run in pairs , to witness each other 's time of staking claim ? veer away from each other about a half mile , so as not to stake the same quarter section , jump off their conveyances , stick their flags , and note the time . The marking at the mile corner is then to be done as soon as possible ; but that first setting up of the flag is the legal time of entry . A pretty plan , neatly worked out in advance on paper ; but in the confusion of a wild race partners can not always stick together , and several others may be staking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hills . Days before the run , matters began to look ominous . Already there were twice as many waiting boomers as waiting farms ? and heaven knew what the proportion would be on the day of the rush . The idea was penetrating the deluded crowd that this was to be a race ? . not a prairie-schooner parade to a happy new home . Moreover , four sections in each township of thirty-six ? one claim in every nine ? were reeerved for educational and state purposes . Thus one man cut of every nine who might succeed in staking a claim ahead of the crowd was bound to find himself on reserved land . By the time he could look up his land numbers at the mile corner , his chance of going on and getting another claim would be nil . With a faint comprehending of the difficulties , there came the temptation to sneak into the Strip at night ahead of the run , choose a good piece of land , hide on it , and be there with the proper markings when the boomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly emerge from long grass , or a hole in the ground , with not much chance of getting caught at the trick . It looked easy , and it was easy . Under cover of darkness , more and more were slipping across the line . These too-previous gentry were known as ' sooners . ' The soldier patrol was supposed to put them out ; but the usual penalty for sooners caught in the act by boomers after the opening was sudden death . The patrolling of the Strip by soldiers was totally inadequate . So the bright minds in Washington who were engineering the project from afar got up a scheme for beating the sooners , Everybody must register before the run , said they , and have a sealed certificate with his signature attached , to make his claim good when he came to prove up at the Land Office . Notaries were posted all along the line delivering the certificates ; everybody lined up and got one . The poor fellows already in had none . It was a clever turn ? on those already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty now to one before , flocked across the border , armed with the certificates . Anybody versed even a little bit in the ways of the Western land boomer would have withheld these tokens until the morning of the run . But every new complication added to the excitement , and this one boomed business for the soldier patrol . Many a soldier , on discovering a hidden sooner , found himself susceptible to the touch of a ten-dollar bill ; then he would inform a comrade in arms , who also would drop around on the hiding man ; and so on , between frieUds , until the sooner 's money was exhausted . The last soldier , getting nothing , would virtuously escort the depleted sooner out to his officer on the border , // and receive credit for the act ? not much as compared to a ten spot , ' but better than nothing at all . Meanwhile , the crowd on the border grew ? and it grew distinctly tougher . The very notion of standing on land worth thirty dollars an acre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quickest man at one-fifty per acre , was tempting to men of the quick kind . We were now getting men in decided contrast to the inarticulate , prairie-schooner crowd ; men ranging all the way from mounted gun toters of the ranges to city sports with fast horses hitched to buckboards . Most of the fancy horses were to fail . It takes a prairie-bred horse to dodge badger holes and gopher mounds and hit the bunch grass with a sure foot . Speed , anyway , was only a single item in this peculiar race ; the consistent winners were to be men off the ranges with good mounts and plenty of gun bluff to clear off those who had arrived ahead of them . The race might be to the swift , but the land was going to the tough . Finally the eventful morning broke . A day exactly like all the rest ? hot , dry , a south wind rising with the sun . Dead ahead , a hot prairie wilderness where there was not a well , scarcely a stream not gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank on the one railroad running south to Texas . This water would be available only for the comparatively few who could stake their claims near by . Naturally there was a wild eagerness to make the run next to this railroad ; not only because of its water tanks in a waterless country , but to get land near it , and also for a chance at the town lots in the several sites which had been laid out near the tank stations . A boomer could take a farm or a town lot ? but not both . So at this point in the waiting line we had an immense number of town siters ' added to the land seekers . For their special accommodation a train of ten cattle cars was to be run , stopping for a moment at each town site . Its engine toed the starting line along with all the rest of us , with steam up and loaded to the cowcatcher with a human swarm , waiting for the crack of the gun at twelve o'clock noon . The train was to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give no advantage over the horsemen ; but a flock of one-dollar bills fluttering around the engine warped the trainmen 's judgment , and they ran it fifteen . Another fight provoker , this , in the already hectic scrap for land . As we walked down to the starting line that morning , coatless , of course , and pushing our bicycles , ? there was too much of a crowd to ride , ? I happened to be just ahead of my brother and a deputy sheriff , a friend of his . The deputy was telling of the valiant but futile efforts to disarm the boomers while they were in the law-abiding State of Kansas , and thus cut down the inevitable shooting in the Strip . Only a few hundred guns had been collected , he said . Probably , ' he remarked sadly , ' there are guns on most of the men all around us . ' Suddenly I happened to think that the barrel of my good old Smith and Wesson hammerless was at that moment sticking out at least an inch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred dollars cash in a money belt , to be ready for any possible business turn in the Strip , and I felt the need of protection . Without undue haste , but quite soon , I slipped around behind that deputy sheriff . Equipment for the run had to include water as the first essential ; then food for several days ? or for a day only , if one were going to a town site ? and a blanket to roll up in on the prairie at night . Those with wheeled vehicles could be more generous in carrying oats , but neither they nor the horseback riders could hope to run the race if carrying any water at all for their horses . In any event , the horses took a long chance for their lives in this merry race . This crowd of the final morning was as like the pastoral collection of a week before as a political convention is like a Sunday-school picnic . If , a week before , there had been two boomers to every claim , twenty had gathered now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line there were a hundred and twenty-five claims available , or one for every claimant if they had been standing forty feet apart . Here , with all kinds of conveyances ranged four to seven tiers deep , they must have averaged about a man to the foot . Not as bad elsewhere , but nowhere were there anything like enough claims to go round . As my brother and I were strolling along the line we came upon a friend of his , gazing down at the ground with blood in his eye . Somebody will get this land , ' he muttered , kicking the dust with his foot . Why not I ? ' At the crack of the rifle , he was going to stick his flag right there in front of his feet . Would we two stand by , and bear witness for him that he was the first man to claim this quarter section ? We glanced at each other , and winked . We had n't been born yesterday in the land game . Carefully we explained that ours was a pleasure party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds to mar the serenity , ? and besides , hon about the eight hundred and sixty-four men with blood in their eye now dig . ging their toes into the half-mile front of this same pretty farm ? No , ? sorry , ? but we still had a craving for life , such as it was . But this raised interesting questions about what was to happen after twelve o'clock noon , in this most stupendous race ever run . I sat down on a little knoll just behind the line and viewed the prospect ? calmly , not having any fevered ideas about the government owing me a farm . First , about that man with blood in his eye . Who would get that farm ? and the hundreds of other farms like it , lying in the first row against the border ? And the next row of farms , a half mile out ? Or the next ? and next ? Or any within , say , the first five miles ? The whole jam would be going over them practically at once . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might drop the flag on any one of these near-by claims ; swearing to the time would mean nothing , with country watches running minutes apart , where it was to be a matter of seconds . Then what earthly judge could decide which got to any claim first ? Why try to get there first , if it could n't be done ? Why not drop off and stick a flag anywhere , then fight it out with perhaps a dozen others who had done the same thing on the same quarter section ? As clear as daylight , ? or , to use a more apt Western term , as ' sure as shootin ' , ' ? getting a farm anywhere within that first five miles was to be a matter of bluff , or buying off , with the chances in favor of the nerviest man . Beyond ten miles , most settlements would be arranged by just plain shootin ' past the ears . ' Then I took to picking winners ? an engaging pastime at any race . // About those two-wheeled racing gigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses : these men could never have ridden in a gig , or a springy rig , over any kind of prairie without knowing that speed would very soon toss them into the air . A slow trot is the best that can be done over raw prairie . Then why the fast horses , even if they should happen to miss the prairie holes ? Few winners in that lot . Those range men on their prairie mounts , swinging easily into the front line : it is past eleven now ; they will not ride fast ? they never do . Among them are some not so good at riding anyway ? merely tough chaps , engaged in keeping out of jail . But they all have prairie mounts , and they all will ride sure . No hurry . They are taking this afternoon ride , not to win a race , but to get land by the gun route . Most of them will get it ? if they do n't have a falling out and try to get each other . The prairie schooner ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : here by the hundreds , loaded with stoves and chairs and babies and chickens , with now and then a pig ; pushing in against the back of the racing line , without exactly knowing why . In spite of what the moving pictures tell you , take it from me that while prairie schooners have housed many good and deserving people , they have housed more scalawags , and most often of all the wandering ne'er-do-well , the all-wise , know-nothing soldier of misfortune , the nomadic Western renter . Elsewhere , he is the sage of the corner grocery . He does better at wrestling with the tariff than at making a living for his wife and children . His farming is a joke . He moves along every year ? broke , plus one more in the family . And he blames everything except the child upon the currency . For months he has been camping all the way down from loway ' or somewhere , to have , at last , a farm of his own in the Cherokee Strip . But now his cocksureness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dream of a home for the asking . His great lumbering schooner can not make the run ? this much penetrates . So he proceeds to on-hitch ' his least-winded plough horse , and gets astride . IV A quarter to twelve . The line stiffened and became more quiet with the tension of waiting . Out in front a hundred yards , and twice as far apart , were soldiers , resting easily on their rifles , contemplating the line . I casually wondered how they would manage to dodge the onrush ; perhaps that was what they themselves were thinking about . The engine , a few hundred feet away , coughed gently at the starting line , while its tender , and the tops of its ten cattle cars trailing back into the State of Kansas , were alive with men . Inside the cars , the boomers were packed standing , with their arms sticking out where horns ought to be . Just then , as we learned afterward , a few miles east of us somebody 's revolver was accidentally discharged . A middle-aged man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashed at a gallop across the line . ' Come back ! ' yelled the crowd , in a wild , inarticulate roar ; but the man imagined the pack at his heels . Halt ! ' commanded the soldier in front . No one could have heard him above the din . That soldier did what he had a right to do : he shot the man through the head . Too bad that he did not think to shoot the horse . Five minutes . Three minutes . The soldiers now stood with rifles pointed upward , waiting for the first sound of firing to come along their line from the east . A cannon at its eastern end was to give the first signal ; this the rifles were to take up and carry on as fast as sound could travel the length of the Cherokee Strip . All set ! At one minute to twelve o'clock my brother and I , noticing that the soldier out front was squinting upward along his rifle barrel and intent on the coming signal , slipped out fifty feet in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best possible place from which to view the start . There were supposed to be somewhere around one hundred thousand men in line on the Kansas border . Within the two-mile range of vision from our point of vantage , there were at the least calculation five thousand , and probably nearer eight . The waiting line , viewed from out front , was a breath-taking sight . The back of the line was ragged , incoherent ; the front was even , smooth , solid . It looked like the line-up that it was . I thought I had realized the immensity of the spectacle ; but that one minute out in front gave the unmatched thrill of an impending race with six thousand starters in sight . First in the line was a solid bank of horses , ? with riders , or hitched to gigs , buckboards , carts , wagons , ? but to the eye there were two miles of tossing heads , and shiny chests , and restless front legs of horses . The medley of grotesque speed outfits , the stupendous gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? these faded before the acute expectancy of a horse race beyond words , incomparable . While we stood , numb with looking , the rifles snapped , and the line broke with a huge , crackling roar . That one thundering moment of horseflesh by the mile quivering in its first leap forward was a gift of the gods , and its like will never come again . The next instant we were in a crash of vehicle whizzing past us . It was like trying to see a hundred three-ring circuses at once ; and it was over while the mind was reaching for the start . But between the crack of the rifles and the dip of the last lumbering prairie schooner over the hills there was begun , made , and finished a chapter by itself in racing history . Then we sat down on the little mound of made earth that had fended off the rush , and looked out at about half-a-dozen wrecks picking themselves up on the prairie . With returning sanity came details of the run . The first to , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strung out from the start ; and not all of those in the lead were horsemen , Some of the racing rigs were making good ; fast horses were all right , so long as they could keep their feet . One man in a two-wheel spring cart was well up with the first horseback riders as they went over the hills ; at every bounce he threatened to miss the seat on the come-back , but our last view showed him still hitting safe . The funniest of all the starters was the engine , with her ten carloads of men . From our exclusive stand fifty feet directly in front of her , I happened to be contemplating the thing as the race 's chief absurdity when the rush began . The engine tooted incessantly and labored hard , but of course she could not get under way with anything like the quickness of the horses . The incongruity of starting a contrivance like that with a lot of horses and calling it a race made us laugh ? not only at her waddling so ridiculously behind at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard intended to be way ahead of the horsemen long before the finish of the race , if moral suasion or cash inducement could make the old girl cough a little faster than the rules allowed . Of course , everybody on the train was openly mad with excitement , without a chance to vent his emotion in any but some noise-making way . With the first toots of the engine came revolver shots from the crowds along the tops of the cars , and a few from those inside . The fusillade , keeping up all the while the train was pulling out past us , had a most exhilarating effect ; my old gun , I suddenly noticed , was barking with the rest of them . For any man who was a fair sprinter , the best chances of the run were aboard that train . It was to stop only at a few town sites , but one was not bound to take a town lot because he was on the train ; he could run either way into 1 the country and stake a farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would be limited to the farms within running distance of the town sites , but those , naturally , were the most valuable farms in the Cherokee Strip . That train carried into the Strip what might be termed a load of legally qualified sooners . V The last of all the freak conveyances to leave the border were a couple of bicycles . Leisurely we started south on the Texas stage trail that followed the general direction of the railway track . We wanted to get in as far as possible that night , camp on the prairie among the boomers , then go on to the town sites Sunday morning for a change of scenery . Freight wagons were already on the road in an almost solid stream , carryingsupplies to the boomers . It had never been more than a prairie trail , up to this twelve o'clock noon ; now , surprised by the extraordinary traffic , it sank dejectedly into a couple of sandy ruts . Many of the wagons avoided it ; so did we , and rode on the prairie , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut to a powder by too many heavy shoes . Traveling over virgin prairie on bicycles is possible , but not to be lightly recommended as a pleasure trip . At a hundred in the shade in a shadeless country , and with a strong head wind just blown in from Texas , it might with reason be mildly discouraged . This was our sentiment , after having done twenty miles of it . A country two hours old , with a boomer sitting on every square half mile , ? or even three or four gentlemen sitting on the same quarter section , and regarding one another with disfavor , ? still looks remarkably like untouched prairie . Three or four men to the half mile make a scanty population . The rush had gone by , and now ? until darkness should set in ? it was to be a case of suspended animation . Some of these personal arguments probably were settled at once , on the spot , and in broad daylight ; but the general understanding was that , in the case of several men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to determine which got there first . That first night was to be a tough one for tenderfeet . Twice during the afternoon we sampled the cussedness of those riding ahead of us . These knights of the front line had fired the grass ? nothing like a prairie fire in a strong head wind to take the courage out of boomers already dropping behind . On the upland prairie , where we happened to encounter these amiable gestures , the grass was thin . In thin grass a prairie fire runs slowly and has a way of creeping ahead of itself in spots , giving one a chance to step sideways across a bit of its line where there is no flame at all . We slipped through with no inconvenience , carrying our bicycles over the hot stretches of ground to save the tires . Men on not too timid horses could have picked the open spots as easily ; but vehicles , especially prairie schooners and freight wagons , are not good at dodging sidewise , and horses refuse to jump through even such mild little tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaten-down trail , as offering a safe but narrow path through . In the deep thick grass of the draws , prairie fires travel with a roaring heat at high speed . There were reports of these same fires catching prairie schooners in draws , consuming them , and badly burning the occupants . Fortunately the great drought had left few valleys sufficiently grass-grown to be dangerous . Other reports had to do with sooners . Feeling ran high ; and at least one sooner paid the penalty . Some boomers told of a deep ravine where they had found a man hanging to a tree . On his shirt was pinned a note : ' Too SOON . ' My younger brother had an experience with a particularly nervy sooner that afternoon . He had made the run for land on a sure-footed mustang ; had run at the head of the line for ten miles , in an hour and ten minutes , to a section picked out before the opening . Arrived there , he found a sooner coolly standing beside a horse whose hair was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse had not traveled a foot since the opening . For answer , he found himself looking into the little round hole of the sooner 's rifle . He at once conceded the point , went on three miles farther , and staked a claim . At a time like that , the wrong end of a gun is the most convincing of argu. ments . At six o'clock we were only twenty miles in ; but that twenty miles loomed up like a day 's work . Inflating and mending tires had taken a good deal of time , since we had been riding on the sharp stubble left by the fires . Deflation , too , of our own energy by the rough prairie and a head wind had slowed us down to little better than a walk . Six miles ahead was Pond Creek , the first town site of any importance . We could make that in the morning . So we picked a little dip in the land where there were no gopher holes , ? rattlesnakes have a way of inviting themselves as guests into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down to a hearty supper . But with the water it was different . A general inquiry for water since the middle of the afternoon had made everybody cautious in the use of the canteen , in spite of the heat . After supper we strolled over to a little rise and had a view of the country . It was a fine stretch of prairie , slightly depressed , and for that reason more desirable than the upland . Perhaps that was why we noticed considerably more than one man to the half mile . Very soon after sunset came darkness , and with it a multitude of stars . It was a blaze of light above , but pitch-dark below ; the brilliant starlight of an over-clear air seems to have little power to illuminate the earth . But these matters did not interest us . Dog-tired , we rolled up in our . blankets , rested our heads on our bicycle wheels , and dropped off to sleep . A little before midnight , we woke up // to a distant clatter of hoofs , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range ? K-e-e-p o-f-f and g-e-t o-f-f ! ' Then crack ! crack ! went the rifles , after each call , from the pretty country we had been admiring at sundown . The exercises had begun . Evidently a gang on horseback were cleaning up a few quarter sections in the district for their own use . Once they swung around within a few rods of us , judging by the sound ; but we could not see them , and it stands to reason that they did not see us , or we should have had callers . The affair seems to have been no more than the time-honored business of shootin ' past the ears . ' In those first nights and days of the merry life in the Cherokee Strip , a few well-placed shots next to the organs of hearing started many a tenderfoot on the run for his home town back East . After listening to the clean-up for a while , we fell asleep . Suddenly , at early daylight , a clatter of hoofs woke us again . Three horsemen had drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' here ? ' This was where the gun came in handy . It enabled us to talk with more assurance . We told them the facts : we were not claiming this land , ? did n't care whose it was , ? were just camping on it , and intended to stay there till after breakfast . They were sensible men . They noted the gun , and the accent , then rode away . If they had ignored both , and had ordered us then and there to move on , we should have done so . In that case we should have been the sensible ones . Since daybreak , boomers had been straggling northward , bound for Kansas and all points east . One young fellow who stopped for a moment whilewe were eating breakfast was a fair sample of the headed-out ' crowd . He asked for water , and we gave him a biscuit . Our few drops were no more . He had staked a claim in our nice little valley , along with a half-dozen others on the same tract ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived first . But for him the delicate question had been settled by the gay horsemen of the night before . By the time they were through with him , he felt assured that he must have arrived about a week late . I would n't live here next to such neighbors anyway , ' he told us with considerable heat . There was no need to tell him , since he had lost his claim , that if he had stayed he never would have had those men for neighbors . Farming in the Cherokee Strip was the last thing in the minds of any of these gun toters . Somebody would have to live on these claims for five years as homesteaders , but not they ; their plan was to get possession , file on it , then sell their relinquishments to farmers . It was to be the story of every move into the prairie frontier : first-crop settlers , mostly ' fly-by-nights , ' then a second incoming of farmers . Always the huge economic waste of an almost complete resettling . VI Now we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , our tires were hopelessly down . It was to be a walk and a push of six miles to Pond Creek . Same heat , same howling head wind . We had to lean our way against it at about two miles an hour . The one weak spot in our equipment ? in everybody 's equipment ? was the size of the canteens . All of us might better have carried twice the weight and had twice as much water . Now , as the forenoon wore on , that dry breakfast and the heat were making an impression . We were meeting boomers all the time now , headed out , with the usual story of several on a claim . By a lucky chance , we happened to spy a wagon with two barrels in it , half a mile off on the prairie . It was water ? warm to the touch , but still water . The men said they had hauled it in from Slate Creek , Kansas . We knew Slate Creek . It was all right to bathe in , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all we could drink , and our canteens full , for forty cents . A little farther on we came upon several men examining something in the bank of a little ravine . It was a drop-by-drop trickle of what had been a spring , and they were in line for the water . We tipped them off to the two barrels from Slate Creek . The town site of Pond Creek had stopped only a small portion of the boomers riding on that cattle train . Most of them had preferred to seek their fortunes in Enid , twenty miles farther south , where the government had established its Land Office . Pond Creek , less than a day old , was already admitting that it might turn out to be a small town . This was a most extraordinary concession . If any new frontier town , having the bare prospect of surviving as a post office , could not sell lots at least one mile out , its citizens were deemed lacking in the true spirit of progress . But Pond Creek was growing , that Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up on the newly acquired lots . Wagons and freight trains during the night had brought in lumber and building materials . The sound of the saw and hammer and plenty of shouting was in the air . Dust was already inches thick on the city streets , kicked up by horses and vehicles in from the sur rounding country for water and sup . plies . Lunch counters across the open fronts of tents were passing out ham sandwiches and black coffee to crowds several deep . At one of these , as we stood waiting , someone announced , Lady coming ! ' Instantly a clear way was made to the counter ? and here came the lady ! A bedraggled , sand-biting creature like the rest of us ; but in lonely state she ambled up , got her butterless bun and creamless coffee , and shuffled off again , There 's chivalry for you ! Under the railroad 's water tank a preacher of the exhorter type was delivering the town 's first sermon to a shifting handful , as boomers came and went around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group that passed as a dancing show gave the town its first suggestion of paint . Men coming in from the upland claims told of horses dying for lack of water , and of men desperately short of it . Few had comprehended the meaning of a waterless country . One man told of getting his horses to town only by giving them spoonfuls of whiskey along the way . How those few whiffs could have spread cheer over the vast extent of a horse it is difficult to understand . But , whatever else Pond Creek lacked in the way of social and other advantages , water was in abundance We celebrated the profusion by washing our faces . VII Of course we had to see the Big Town , Enid , and share the excitement of the Land Office on its first business day , Monday . Pond Creek 's hectic Sunday was only a starter . We shipped our crippled bicycles out on the train bound north . Their last service had been as pillows the night before , so low had they fallen from their proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them another twenty miles merely to rest our heads on the front wheels . Those spokes had an unpleasant way of raking one 's ear during the unconscious moments . Enid was said to have a population of five thousand that Monday morning . The man who gave us this opinion admitted that the number was varyin ' party rapid . ' This looked reasonable , considering that it had varied from nothing to five thousand since Saturday . The scenes and activities were much like those in Pond Creek , except that they were on a larger scale and the city was one day older , which made it twice as old as Pond Creek . This wide difference in ages was beginning to tell . Enid had a post office in a little tent , and a hotel in a big one ? the Heywood , if I remember rightly . We had boiled beef and potatoes for dinner . This showed that culture was creeping in , and we might as well go back to Kansas . Off on one of the town lots was a small safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A newspaper office was being built around it . In a tent bearing a big canvas sign , ' REAL ESTATE &; LOANS , ' I found one of our discarded agents of the farm-mortgage days , from the extreme northwest of Nebraska . He was one of those men always in the vanguard of the chronic pioneers . But the government Land Office was the centre of an activity all its own . Entrymen from all over the district were driving in to file their claims . There was a notion widely prevailing that the first to file on a disputed claim gained thereby an advantage . Soldiers held the men to a line , and the line extended off on the prairie for more than a mile ? some said two miles . Those way out would be in line for twenty-four , thirty-six hours . There seemed to be no way to speed up the work in the office . The great spectacle was over . The sordid business of fighting for titles was on . We had got , richly , all that we came for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined the track , waiting for a chance to get out of the Strip . In the wild scramble to get aboard the north-bound train that night my brother and I were among the winners ? by a hair . The last of the Prairie Frontiers !
