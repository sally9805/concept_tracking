txt Governor Leh. , man submitted tonight to the Legislature a budget of $385,824,459.11 , some $15,000,000 less than last year , to cover the operations of the State government for the fiscal year be- ginning July 1 , 1938 , and ending June 30. 1939 . The budget for the 1937-38 year was $400,969,842.41 . His estimates of income and expenses between now and the beginning of the new fiscal year show that the State will be " out of the red " for the first time since 1931 , when the new fiscal year begins , with a prospective surplus of slight ? ly over $2,000,000 by June 30 , 1939 . Despite the reduction in expenditures , the Governor declined to recommend any tax reduction . Instead , he asked for the continuance of all of the present emergency taxes , on the grounds that the general business situation , which reflects itself in State revenues , is too unsettled . $46,000,000 for Relief In fact , the Governor declared that his financial estimates were based on two things , first , the end ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and secondly , the continuance by the Federal Government of a liberal relief policy . For relief , the Governor allotted $46,000,000 in revenues due during the fiscal year , and some $4,000,000 additional which he hopes will be left from the relief appropriation for the current year . Viewing the recession as one that would probably not develop into a . Major depression , the Governor accepted the " rational outlook " that the beginnings of a business revival may be expected shortly . This view is accepted by economists and others whose opinions he values , the , Governor said . The Governor made but one con. cession to the advocates of the tax reduction . He urged , not the repeal , but the modification of the capital gains and losses provisions of the personal income tax . Subject to the proposal of a better plan by the Federal Government for modifying the similar Federal tax , the Governor suggested that the capital gains and losses be separated from the normal income of the taxpayer ; that capital losses be deductible only from capital gains , occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taxed according to the regular income tax schedules , 1 but at one-half the rate now prescribed for the net income . A " Tax Stabilizer " The Governor regards his proposal as a " tax stabilizer " and feels that some method of taxing capital gains should be retained despite the criticism of the tax that has come even from within his own official family , In his message , which bore all the marks of a valedictory , the Governor pointed with pride to the wiping out at last of the $100,000,000 deficit which had faced him when he took over the reins of the State government in January , 1933 . Then , as a warning , he said : " Any feeling of satisfaction with the state of our finances , based upon the progress made in eliminating the old accumulated deficit , is tempered with concern regarding the possible future repercussions of the present business recession upon both our revenues and expenditures ! In my judgment , there need be no particular worry regarding the situation ' for the remainder of the current fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no doubt that we should , at this writing , have been able to predict with confidence a substantial surplus for June 30 , 1938 , and should , in this message , have been able to recommend the modification or discontinuance of some of the emergency taxes in the course of a general revision of the tax structure of the State . As it is , I feel confident that an analysis of the situation will lead you to agree with my , conclusion at this time , , that we can not , under . existing conditions , discontinue any taxes . " Points to Drastic Pruning Without mentioning the renewed agitation for a State-wide sales tax , , the Governor barred its consideration at this time by . declaring that his planicalls for no new taxes , does provide for relief on a pay-asyou basis , and that if his ' assumptions as to the course of business activity are correct , the taxes now in force should carry the State through the next fiscal year with a , modest margin of safety . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after drastic pruning of budgetary requests which had totaled $547,000 , - He noted also that ' during the ' four completed fiscal years of his three administrations budgetary expenditures were $84,000,000 less than the revenues for the same period . For the year coming to an end he estimated an operating surplus of $10,500,000 , enough to wipe out the last of the deficit . The Governor 's message was read by the clerks to both houses of the Legislature , assenthled on Capitol Hill for the first Monday night session . In his estimates of revenues the Governor put the personal income tax for the fiscal year 1937-38 at $100,000,000 and for the Coming fiscal year at $91,000,000 . He figured on an increase of $1,500,000 in the utilities tax ' for 1938-39 , compared with 1937-38 ; cut the franchise tax estimate by $1,800,000 ; left the corporation tax estimate the same at $31,200,000 , and did the same on the inheritance and estate tax , estimating that for both years at $38,500 , - 000 .
