txt CHAPTER IV WOOD WORKING AND WOOD JOINTS Common wood joints .  --  Laying out and making wood joints . REPAIRS to buildings and their equipment requires a knowledge of wood joints and how they are made . The illustrations depict a number of the more common wood joints , some simple and others quite complicated . These are included so that one may have ample variety to select from . While wood joinery requires some skill , the main requisite is accurate layout so that parts will be shaped to fit snugly . Never attempt to make a joint without a layout , scribing the lines to which you are going to work . The adaptability of the various joints listed will readily be understood by the description of each type ; see Fig. 24 . I ? STRAIGHT OR PLAIN BUTT JOINT : This is the simplest joint ; but to make a good joint , regardless of whether it is a side or an end type , it is necessary to square the edges to be joined . Squaring should he done with the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . 2 ? MITER JOINT : This joint is similar to a butt joint , but the surfaces fitting together are cut at an angle , of 45 degrees . Tn cutting the miter end of the pieces it is best to use the miter box , as this provides a guide for the saw . Finally , dress the surfaces with a block plane . 3 ? REINFORCED MITER JoiNT : This is a miter joint reinforced by a block of wood on the inside , which to some extent simplifies the fastening of the joint , as the reinforcement can be clamped in position and fastened to one part first and then to the other so that an accurate joint is made without allowance for drawing to square the miter. 6o WOOD WORKING AND WOOD JOINTS 6i 4 ? DADO AND RABBET JOINT : This is a combination of the rabbet joint , Fig. 24-5 ; and a daclo joint , Fig. 24-12. 5 ? RABBET JOINT : A rabbet is a recess cut out on the edge of a piece of wood . The bottom is parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end or edge , thereby forming a reentrant square corner for another piece . A rabbet joint is a square edge or end fitting in a rabbet or two rabbeted edges fitting into each other . 6 ? DADO TONGUE AND RABBET JOINT : This is a combination of the rabbet joint and the dado joint , the latter being in the form of a narrow tongue . 7 ? TONGUE AND GROOVE JOINT : This is the familiar type of joint used on flooring ; one side of the piece is grooved and the other side has a tongue to fit into the groove of the adjoining piece . 8 ? FEy TIER JOINT : The feather joint is similar to the tongue and groove joint with the exception that both sides of the piece are grooved to take a feather which extends an equal depth into each of the two adjacent parts . 9 ? HALF LAP JOINT : This type of joint is similar to the rabbet joint excepting that the lap is formed on the face of the piece . It is another variety of what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This is a half lap joint but formed on the end so that two pieces when fitted together form a right angle . II ? MIDDLE LAP JoINT : Another form of lap joint with the lap formed at some distance from the end of one piece so that the two pieces when fitted together form a tee . I2 ? DADO JOINT : A dado is a groove cut across the grain of a piece of wood into which a second piece is fitted . It is known as a housed joint when the entire end of the second piece fits into the dado . There is also a form of joint which is known as a stopped or gained dado , in which the dado does not extend entirely across the face of the work . The dado may also be used in combination with the rabbet and dovetail. // 13 ? THROUGH MORTISE TENON : A mortise is a space hollowed out in a piece of wood to receive a tenon or projection of rectangular section at the end of the piece to be used in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is similar to the above type , but the space hollowed out does not project through the piece so that the tenon is not visible from the end when the pieces are assembled . 15 ? STUBB MORTISE TENON : This type of joint is similar to the blind mortise tenon with the exception of the tenon being rather short , from which it derives its name as a stub. 16 ? LAP DOVETAIL : This joint is similar to a middle lap joint but the surfaces joined together are not parallel . These are cut at a slight angle so that the joint can not pull apart , the width of the lap being greater at one end than at the other . 17 ? OPEN MORTISE TENON : This is a type of corner joint sometimes called a slip joint . It is really a through mortise and tenon joint with one end of the mortise removed . 18 ? THROUGH SINGLE DOVETAIL : This joint is similar to the open . mortise tenon but the tenon is dovetailed or flared and fits into a similarly shaped slot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a right angle . Some of the more complicated wood joints are shown in Fig. 25. 19 ? CROSS LAP JOINT : The cross lap joint is a more complicated form of the conventional lap joint . The parts are grooved to half their width , the width of the groove being the same as the thickness of the wood . When assembled the grooves overlap and form a cross as illustrated . 2o ? DOVETAILED DADO : This is a dado joint with one side of the groove and mating piece flared or tapered so that the parts can not pull apart . It is another example of the many combinations which are possible with two of the simplest joints . 2I ? DOWEL PIN JOINT : The dowel pin joint is in effect a secret joint , being so arranged that the dowels are not visible // from any angle . It is a rather difficult and complicated joint to make , and to . avoid splitting of the wood when assembling , the dowel pins should be chamfered on the ends so they will he self-centering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length to allow the air and glue imprisoned be-hind them to escape . 22 THROUGH MULTIPLE DOVETAIL : This is a form of joint comprising a series of single dovetails . It is a series of // pins and sockets , the sides of which are tapered so that when assembled the joint is self-locking. 23 ? STOPPED LAP DOVETAIL : This is another form of multiple dovetail joint except that the dovetails do not come through and are not visible from either side of the joint . 24 ? LAP DOVETAIL OR HALF BLIND DOVETAIL : Another form of multiple dovetail , in effect a combination of the through multiple dovetail and the stopped lap dovetail . The dovetails do not come through and the ends of the pins are seen only from one side of the joint . The joints shown in Fig. 24 , I to 18 inclusive , are more generally used in carpentry , while the complicated types shown in Fig. 25 , 19 to 24 inclusive , are used in cabinetmaking . While considerable variety is shown in the illustrations , these may really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the manner in which the joining pieces are brought together . LAYING OUT AND MAKING WOOD JOINTS Accurate layout of the work is essential in forming wood joints because strength is dependent upon the proper fitting of the parts , and strength is a requisite in joining two parts . Joinery may be called precision work , requiring accurate tooling with the saw , plane , and chisel . Before attempting to form even the simplest kind of joint , be sure the tools are sharp ; also provide a try square , and sharpen the blade of a pocketknife as this will be needed as a scribe for marking . Fig. 26-1 shows the importance of a square surface even when making a plain butt joint . Testing with the try square as shown at A , one finds the ends are not square with the sides and face . If assembled without squaring the result will be as depicted at B. First square the ends of both pieces on all sides using the try square and pocketknife to lay out the work . Work down to the scribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain of the wood . If you // have difficulty in noting the scribed line , sharpen a soft pencil to a chisel point and mark the lines after scribing . The end butt joint is easier to make than the side butt joint as the surfaces to be squared are small . To make a side butt joint , first straighten the edges with a fore or jointer plane so as to avoid the condition shown at A in Fig. 26-2 . In squaring the edges , test frequently with the try square , and continue fitting until the proper joint is obtained . The squaring of the ends should take place after the pieces are fitted together , and to identify the surfaces which are to fit together a marking scheme similar to that shown at B should be employed . The miter joint usually presents some difficulty as the appearance of the joint depends upon the accuracy of the layout . The miter is cut at an angle of 45 degrees , that is , half a right angle so that the two parts fitted together form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , square a line across the face of the wood , measure along one edge to a point equal to the width of the wood , and then connect this point with the other end of the square line as shown at B in Fig. 26-3 . Miter joints should be cut in the miter box as shown at C. In assembling a miter joint so that the corners will match evenly , as shown at A , one part should be drilled for the nails or screws and then a slight allowance made for drawing as the nails or screws are driven home . In making a lap joint , the pieces are first squared on all sides as in making a butt joint . For the end lap , line up the two pieces that are to fit together and with the point of the knife blade make a small notch on the edge of the lower piece as depicted at A in Fig. 26-4 . This will locate the length of the lap . Next square this point with the side edge and scribe a line as shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the face . Set a measuring gauge to one-half the thickness of the wood and scribe lines on the edges and the end for the depth of the lap . The completed layout is shown at 1 ) , and the use of the measuring gauge at C. Both pieces are laid out in the same manner and the waste material is removed with a saw allowing just enough // material to dress down to get a good fit of the parts with surfaces parallel , flush and square . A middle lap joint is made in a similar manner superimposing one piece on the other to mark the width of the cut , and the depth is scribed with the measuring gauge . The sides are cut with the saw and the waste material is removed to the gauge line working with a chisel from opposite sides as shown at E , Fig. 26-4 . This is shown by the shaded sections in the end view and is done with the wood set on edge , while the finishing is done with the wood set on its face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain , and in finishing hold the chisel perfectly level to remove the slight taper left in the opening . Usually one difficulty is experienced in shaping parts to form a wood joint . This can perhaps be best explained by using the tenon of a mortise joint as an example . Layout of the tenon is shown at A in Fig. 26-5 , the lines representing the finished proportions of the tenon , while B and C show the incorrect methods of making the saw cut . At B the width of the cut is divided on the line . At C the width of the cut is located inside the line . In either case the tenon will not be left full size . The proper method of forming the tenon is shown at D , in which the saw cut is taken on the waste line . What applies to a tenon also applies to any other form of joint , the cut must always be taken on the waste side of the line . The mortise for this tenon may be formed by laying out the rectangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and considerable of the waste material being bored out . Another method is " beating out , " the successive stages in this operation being illustrated in Fig. 26-6 . The start of the cut is shown at A , this being the center of the mortise . The next step is shown at B , cuts being taken at either side of the center cut and the first chips then pried out . This method is followed to each end of the mortise , beveling the mortise and working to about one-half the depth , chiseling out the chips as shown at C. These operations are repeated from the opposite side , as shown at D , until the mortise is beveled from both sides // as shown at E. The mortise is then finished by truing the ends as shown at F. When completed the sides of the opening should be checked with the try square to be sure they are perpendicular with the face against which the base of the tenon will bear , otherwise the joint formed by the two parts will not be square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is doubt as to this , Fig. 26-7 offers a suggestion for checking the position of the chisel . When cutting a long , narrow dado or rabbet groove there is difficulty in getting clearance for the chisel handle and the hand and this increases the danger of gouging-in . The chisel is sometimes held bevel down , Fig. 26-8 , to provide clearance for the handle and fingers . In making a dovetail lap , proceed to finish one member of a plain lap joint as shown in Fig. 26-4 . Next proceed with flaring the sides of this part , first laying out the work to indicate the proportions of the finished pin . Saw on the waste line and then remove the remaining waste material with the chisel , as shown at A , Fig. 26-9 . The next step is to lay out the dovetail as shown at B , using the finished pin as a template . Scribe the lines for the two sides and mark the depth with a gauge . The layout will then appear as at C. Cut to the waste line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally remove the remaining waste material with the chisel in the manner outlined for a middle lap joint as shown at E in Fig. 26-4 . The proportions of the dovetail , particularly the angle of the flared side , are important . The angle must not be too great as this would weaken the joint because of the short grain at the corners . These conditions are depicted in Fig. 26-To , the angle of the pins shown at A being too large , while B shows the improvement effected by decreasing the angle . The angle selected should give a rise of one inch in a length somewhere between five and ten inches . The strongest multiple dovetail joints are those in which the pins and dovetails are of the same size , although better appearance is obtained when the dovetails are made somewhat larger than the pins . CHAPTER V REPAIRS TO WOODWORK WHILE many woodwork jobs are simple , others call for a certain amount of ingenuity . All work should have careful thought . Each step should be carefully planned before the work is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as you have planned it ; otherwise you will find yourself in trouble and the results will be disappointing . Gather the necessary tools and material for the work . REPLACING SASH CORDS A vertical sliding window is balanced so that it will remain open in any position without tendency to raise or lower itself ; this is accomplished by sash cords and weights . When the sash cords break it becomes necessary to fit new cords . Two weights and two sash cords are used for each window frame . Fig. 27 shows the construction and details of the window frame as well as the successive stages in the replacement of the sash cord . The weight box is formed by the stile , studding , and inside and outside casing . The grooves for the windows are formed by stops and a parting strip , the latter being grooved into the stile to locate it in position . The inside stop and parting strip are nailed in position , but removable . When a sash cord breaks it is necessary to remove the old cord including that hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window frame to which the cord is attached . The inner window is held 70 // in position by the inside stop which must be removed to get at the cord end of the window sash part . Next remove the weight box cover to gain access to the weight . Use the old pieces of cord as a sample to determine the length of the new cord . Sash cord is a special pliable or flexible form of cordage and should be used whenever possible to suspend the sash weights . Its flexibility ? being made principally from cotton fibers ? permits it readily to conform to the pulley groove and thus avoids breakage of fibers . This is not true of clothesline and such cordage which might be used in an emergency . The latter is made from much harder fiber , which splinters and soon wears out in traveling over the pulley . With the cord cut to length , fasten one end in the sash weight ; the method of fastening will readily be understood by noting the manner in which the old cord was fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To tread the cord over the sash pulley , tie a piece of heavy twine to a small piece of lead or a heavy wood screw and allow this to fall into the weight box carrying the twine with it over the pulley . Reach into the weight box and pull the twine through , taking care not to pull twine from pulley . Next remove the mouse weight from twine and fasten the twine to the free end of the sash cord . Pull cord through weight box and over the pulley with the twine . In fastening the cord to the window it may be necessary to have assistance as the window must be held at the correct level for fastening of the cord . Before assembling the pocket strip , or cover , and inside stop , check the action of the window to be sure it travels freely and that the weight does not strike bottom of box because of cord being too long . Both upper and lower sash cords are replaced in the same manner , but replacement of the cord for the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good plan to replace all sash cords at the sane time as they receive practically an even amount of wear . When a window sticks be sure the corner joints are tight . // Joints can be tightened by using wood dowel pins or a metal cleat mortised into the frame so it will set flush . Always make sure these joints are tight before attempting to ease the win-dow by planing the sides or by any other method . // A window will stick when the stops or parting strip warp or when they are not properly aligned . In this case a mark will usually appear on both window and stop to indicate the point where it binds . The remedy is to align the parts to provide equal clearance . A window with too much clearance endwise in its runway will also bind , because it is possible for it to become cocked when force is applied to raise or lower it . This is true when the force is applied at any point except the exact vertical center . The only thing that can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runway to take up the excessive clearance . WEATHER STRIP There are many brands and types of both wood and metal weather strip . Some of these are quite elementary , the construction being so simple as to be readily evident upon inspection . Each product is supplied with instructions for its installation when sold through hardware dealers . One maker of a metal weather strip installs his own product . In general , weather strip is designed for fastening to the stiles or outside stop and parting strip and therefore must be removed when replacing a sash cord for the outside window . When the weather strip is of the tongue and groove type , it becomes necessary to remove it from the stile to permit pivoting the window to gain access to the sash cord fastening . First raise ( inside ) or lower ( outside ) window according to whether the inside or outside window sash cord is to be replaced , then loosen weather strip from stile and close window ; weather strip will then come out with window . With the window partly removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus expose the sash cord fastening . These operations are reversed to reinstall the weather strip . MAKING AND REPAIRING SCREENS The lumber and moldings for making screens may be purchased cut to width and dressed on all sides and edges . Saw , // chisel , and hammer are the only tools required to make both window and door screens . First measure the windows and doors to determine how much lumber will be needed . Num-ber or otherwise identify each window and door , making a note of the dimensions ; this will save time when you are ready to make the screens . In old houses there may be a certain amount of sag in the walls ; however , it is best to disregard this until the screens are ready to fit , but screens should be made to the greatest height and width . For the doors , one piece of lumber should be wider than the top and side stiles , being intended for the bottom of the door . Simple construction of screens is depicted in Fig. 28 , a simple rabbet joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vertical parts of the frame should permit a snug fit for the cross pieces . A butt joint can not he employed here as the screen is in effect a parallelogram and slight pressure at either corner would end to cause misalignment and loosen the joint . When a butt joint is employed it will be necessary to add a metal cleat , fas-tened in position with wood screws . Such cleats can be fash-ioned from sheet iron , or they may be secured from the hard-ware dealer . Cleats should be fastened to both sides of the frame and at the four corners . A screen door frame is constructed in the same manner , but requires a center stile . Wire screen is made in several sizes of mesh , but regard-less of mesh it is fastened to the frame in the same manner . An iron wire screen does not have the same life as copper even though it is kept well painted , but it costs less . It is good economy to use copper screen and if the bright copper color is objectionable , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed frame for inside dimensions , add to this the width of the molding on each side , and you have the size of screen required . Place the screen in position and fasten with large-headed tacks , stretching tightly . Finally fasten the molding in place with small brads . If the windows are not true it may be necessary to fit the screen by planing regardless of whether it will operate on a runner or is to be held in position by hooks . The strips for the runner can be purchased tongued and grooved , merely requiring cutting to length . The hanging of a screen door and fitting of the hinges is the same as outlined below for a paneled door and also in the chapter on building hardware . Before hanging , it is necessary to fit the door to its frame . Window screens and doors which have seen several seasons ' use may require replacement of the wire if iron wire was originally used . This is done by removing the molding , stretching the new screen in place , fastening it with tacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for the winter they should always be inspected for holes and weak spots . There are several methods which may be employed in effecting repairs . If there is a small hole , double the broken ends back and then weave in small wire back and forth to form a patch that has the same mesh as the original . Wire for this purpose may be purchased by the spool for a few cents ; weaving can be done with a darning needle . Another method is to fit a patch . This is clone by cutting away the ragged edges of the opening until a regular shape is obtained . Now cut a patch of the same mesh screen an inch larger all round . Unravel three wires on each side of the patch and bend the protruding wires up at a right angle . Now apply the patch so that the bent ends of wire extend through the screen around the hole . Finally , bend over the ends of the wires on the other side of the screen to hold patch in place . REPAIRING DOORS Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although a door is built of well-seasoned lumber , the // continual temperature changes through the seasons will produce some warpage and cause the door to stick . A door requires a certain amount of clearance in its jamb , and in easing the door it is necessary to locate the cause of the trouble . Sticking may be due to slight warpage of the door or of the jamb , but may also be due to sagging as the result of walls ? in which the frame is mounted ? taking a set . Slight sticking can be remedied by rubbing the surface with a tallow candle or hard white soap . If sticking demands closing the door with considerable force , the portion at the top , bottom , or sides which is causing the trouble will be evident upon inspection and may be eased by using a plane . First plane a light shaving from each corner or corner edge at this point where easing is necessary to prevent splintering . Carry the plane level to the face of the door which is to be eased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splinters from the sides of the stile . Sometimes this work can be done by leaving the door on its hinges ; but if the door will not close to permit the lock or latch to close , it is best to remove the door by lifting it from the hinges . If hung with loose pin butts , force the pin out with a small screw driver or a nail set and hammer . This is necessary only when the hinge pin is too snug to be removed with the fingers . Remove the lower pin first and the upper one will then hold the door and make it easier to handle in final removal . Stand the door with its length parallel to the floor , holding it between the knees while planing . An uneven floor may only permit a door to open part way . Easing the door for full opening may result in considerable clearance at the bottom . The best thing to do in this case is to ease the door enough to permit fitting what is called a threshold , saddle , or doorsill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of hard wood , 72 to inch thick , with sides beveled to blend into the floor . Leave the door in position on its hinges and close it . Now mark the thickness of the threshold at each end , measuring from the floor . Mark the door on both sides using a straight edge ; join the marks on both sides across the edges . This is necessary to provide a guide in sawing the // door , plane to a smooth surface , position the threshold , and reassemble the door on its hinges . If the door is tight on the bottom it is necessary to remove the door and apply the same treatment as was described for the top of the door . Sticking doors may also be remedied by manipulating the hinges , providing there is sufficient clearance between the front edge of the door and the jamb . The minimum clearance required to make adjustment is 1/16 inch . Adjustment is accomplished by removing the bottom hinge screws and inserting a piece of narrow cardboard under the butt of the hinge . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hinge . The limitation here is the clearance between the front edge of the door and its jamb . This same adjustment may be applied to compensate for unevenness of the floor . When the front stile must be raised considerably , substitute a wider hinge . It is necessary to keep the hinge pins in alignment , and when a center hinge is employed , the location of this will have to be adjusted for alignment with the upper and lower hinge pins . Shifting the center hinge will leave an opening between hinge butt and recess . This can be filled with a carefully fitted piece of wood , although it will he visible only when the door is open . Adjusting clearance by shifting the hinges is not generally recommended as even under ideal conditions there will always be some strain on the hinges . Storm doors and garage doors must of necessity open toward the outside and are subject to damage by high wind . Such doors will present plenty of opportunity for ingenuity when repairs are necessary . As a rule , some means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest itself . When the parts are clamped in position , holes can be bored through the stiles and into the rails to a depth equal to the width of the stile . Wooden dowels can then be driven into these holes and nailed in position before the clamps are removed . If dowels are not used , repairs can be effected with metal cleats similar to those mentioned for use on screens . // PICTURE RAIL AND MOLDINGS Plain moldings are much easier to work and are just as effective as the more elaborate types . Simple patterns are illustrated in Fig. 28 . One must determine the length of the rail for each wall and in the case of picture railing this should be parallel to the ceiling , as hanging will he judged by its alignment with the ceiling . Start with the longest walls of the room , cutting a length of molding to fit each wall , leaving the end square and the molding just long enough to hang in position . Cut the lengths for the end walls in the same manner . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit each recess in the same manner as an unbroken wall . Finally cut the short pieces for the side of the chimney breast . At the four corners of the room and at each side of the chimney breast , a butt joint may be used ; this is simple to make , is just as effective as a miter joint and gives the same appearance . To get a good butt joint , cut the end of the rail for the longer wall at an angle of 45 degrees . This can be done accurately with the miter box . Now saw or gouge around the resulting outline which will leave the end a perfect fit over the end piece . This method and another are shown in detail in Fig. 28 . The walls of buildings will set and it is also possible for the floor to sag , making it difficult to avoid gaps between the floor and the baseboard molding . When slight misalignment exists , either of these can be drawn into place with a nail . The nail should not be driven at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wood splitting , and in this case it is best to fill the opening with plastic wood or some other filler of this type . REPAIRING A FLOOR While wax , putty , paste , etc. , have long been used as fillers for wood , plastic wood is now recognized as the ideal material as it will adhere firmly to wood and dries quickly , leaving 8o THE HANDY MAN 'S HANDBOOK a hard , waterproof surface , similar in nature to wood but without grain . It possesses practically the same qualities as wood . Initially the material is of thick paste or dough consistency and while a certain amount of contraction takes place in drying , it adheres so firmly to its base that it does not draw away from anything to which it is applied . It is a material suitable for shakes in lumber and to hold screws without splitting . This material is applied with a knife or thin blade of suitable form . To fix screws in plaster walls , make a hole and fill with material ; when dry , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw must not enter the material until it has set . Another use for this material is the filling of cracks and holes in flooring , particularly when linoleum is laid over it . If the cracks are large and there are many such defects , the amount of material needed may prove expensive . A mixture of putty and sawdust may be used as a base and a thin layer of plastic material put on top of this . There is also a dry putty on the market . This comes in powdered form and is mixed with water to a paste consistency . It is applied in the same manner as glazing putty , but must be painted to preserve its surface . As pine flooring ages it has a tendency to warp and splinter . Repairing is quite simple when done in the following manner : Drive a wood chisel of narrow section into the joint of the damaged part to get an opening for the keyhole saw . Saw the bead in each direction until you strike a joist . Repeat this operation for the full length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the flooring by prying . If the flooring is laid in sections , there will be a butt joint over a joist . When this is not the case it is necessary to cut the joint at an angle as shown in Fig. 28 . Before replacing with new flooring , fit all tongues and grooves to be sure that nails and splinters will not interfere . Fig. 28 shows the various features in positioning the new boards . The new section will not fit freely and will have to be forced into position . The illustration also shows the manner of accomplishing this . Lay the hammer blows on a block // of wood and move the block along the joint as successive blows are delivered . Nailing should be done only when the flooring will not pull down into position with the block and hammer . As the end joints are made over a joist these may be fastened with a nail at each end . If the diagonal joint is necessary , the nail should be driven diagonally . This method of repairing flooring is also handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to install electrical wiring . The important feature to keep in mind is to get a good joint the full length of each board , otherwise the repaired section will squeak as one walks over it . OAK FLOORING Hardwood floors present practically no maintenance other than resurfacing and refinishing . To install an oak floor in an old residence , it is best to lay the new floor over the old one . The work of laying is not difficult , but any uneven spots on the old floor should be dressed down before the oak floor is laid . For a new sub-floor it is preferable to use r x 6 boards sur faced on all four sides but not tongued and grooved . This should be well-seasoned lumber and laid diagonally as shown in Fig. 29 . Lay sub-floor boards close but not tight and drive 8 2 THE HANDY MAN 'S HANDBOOK two nails at each joist . The sub-floor must be thoroughly dry and clean before the oak flooring is laid . The use of damp-proof paper , usually 15-lb. felt ? not ordinary resin-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended . It is important to leave about / inch space between the oak floor and the baseboard , to allow for expansion in case any dampness later gets into the oak floor . This opening is covered by the baseboard molding . The oak flooring should be laid at right angles to the sub-floor . After laying and nailing three or four pieces use a short piece of hard wood , 2 x 4 , placed against the tongue and drive it up . Do not drive up excessively tight . Nailing is important and all tongued and grooved oak flooring should be blind nailed . The following specifications are recommended by the makers of this type of flooring : Table Another excellent nail for oak flooring is the wire cementcoated nail , whenever it can be obtained . In estimating the material required to cover a certain space , figure the number of square feet , which means the width multiplied by the length . For example , a room 12 x 15 feet would contain 12 times 15 , or 18o , square feet . Add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Table // Table Where there are bay windows , hearths , and other projections in a room , allowance must be made for more or less flooring . It is always well to add 5 per cent additional flooring to take care of cutting and possible damage if carelessly handled . Oak flooring comes in bundles of varying lengths , and all lengths of tongued and grooved flooring come end-matched as shown in Fig. 30 . The 5/16 inch thickness is made only with square edge as shown in Fig. 31 . Moisture is a factor that must be taken into consideration . It is preferable to lay oak flooring over the old softwood floor when the old flooring is dry and in good condition , bearing iii mind that the old flooring must be perfectly level . Squeaking is often due to moisture in the sub-flooring which dries out . It is caused by the movement of the nails in the // sub-floor or joists , as lumber in drying shrinks away from the nails . Squeaks are rarely found in the surfaced floor . Squeaking floors also result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridging , from weak joists , and especially from insufficient nailing and the wrong kind of nails , and from laying the floor parallel to the sub-floor . In winter building , in the North , flooring should never be laid without first heating the building as there is always dampness in new buildings , which affects floors . Good nailing , however , is an important factor in preventing any subsequent trouble in any climate . Lay your floor well , see that it is well nailed , and it will " stay put . " CHAPTER VI FITTING AND MAINTENANCE OF BUILDING HARDWARE THE subjects of major importance under this heading are the fitting of hinges and door locks , the making of keys and the repair of locks . An important operation is the hanging of doors and the adjustment of hinges and locks of doors which have warped and require attention so that they may function properly . Doors will sag if hinges are loose and then refitting or alignment of hinges becomes necessary . Easing of doors and adjustment of hinges has been covered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes necessary to fit the hinges . This subject is covered below , but no attempt will be made to cover the wide variety of hinges available , as the method of fitting almost any type is the same as the method outlined here . The fundamental principles of installation are given and provide sufficient information to meet any maintenance problem . HINGES The three general types of door hinges are shown in Fig. 32 . Each of these types is made in a variety of sizes and each size of each type requires its specific amount of clearance to permit full opening and avoid strain on the hinge . Hinges are , made right and left hand and it is necessary to state the hand of the door when ordering . The rules for determining the hand of the door for loose 85 // joint butts are as follows : The hand of the butt is determined from the outside of the door to which it is fitted . The outside of a cupboard , bookcase , or closet door is the room side . For other doors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , standing outside a door which opens from you , the butts are on the right , it takes right-hand butts ; if on the left , it takes left-hand butts . If , standing on the outside of a door which opens toward you , the butts are on the right , it takes left-hand butts ; if on the left , it takes right-hand butts . FITTING HINGES A door requires a certain amount of clearance in the frame and the clearance of the door when open is controlled by the hinges . In fact , hinges must be fitted to predetermined standards based upon the size of the door and the size and style of hinge employed . When the door is closed the clearance generally recommended is i/16 inch at the top and I/8 inch at the bottom when a threshold is used . If there is no threshold , the clearance will have to be increased to 3/8 or 1/2 inch so that the door will close over floor coverings such as rugs . When hanging a new door it will be discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered by the mill and will require fitting to the door opening . First check the door opening for alignment . You will quite likely find that it is not square , due to settling of the building . The door will have to he planed down on both hinge and lock stile and sawed or planed to fit top and bottom and the misalignment of the door frame must be compensated for in this operation . Get the hinge stile smooth and square and use judgment in removing material , so the panels of the door will be as near the casing on the lock side as they are on the hinge side . In this manner you will have stiles on opposite sides of approximately equal width . With the door fitted to the opening for clearance , set door in opening and drive wedges under it to adjust for proper clearFITTING // ante at all points . The next step , locating the hinges , requires extreme care as the marks as shown by dimensions in Fig. 32-4 must register accurately to hold the established clearance , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upper mark represents the top of the butt of the upper hinge , and the lower mark the bottom of the butt of the lower hinge . Positioning of hinges may be done by recessing the edge of the door hinge stile for the thickness of both hinge leaves , making the total gain for both leaves on the hinge stile . Another method is to make the gains on both the door hinge stile and the casing , each gain compensating for the thickness of a leaf of the butt . The recesses or gains are made as described for a middle lap joint in the chapter on woodworking and wood joints . It is customary to make the gain in the door stile from a point 1/4 inch from the inside of the door except when the door is thin . This leaves 1/4 inch of wood beyond the leaf . To get the minimum clearance of i/16 inch between the door and its jamb , this dimension on the door casing is increased to 5/16 inch . Measure the hinge leaf accurately and lay out the recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casing using the marks previously made to locate the hinges . Much depends upon the accuracy of location and layout of recess . If this is properly done , the hinge parts may be separated , fastened to door and casing and when the door is put in place , it will swing freely . If the door binds , it will be necessary to adjust the hinges as mentioned under repairing doors in the chapter on repairs to woodwork . Large doors require three hinges , giving an additional bearing and support for the door , resisting warpage and springing , in addition to helping the lock to maintain its proper alignment . As much depends upon locating the hinges , the hinge should be used as a template for marking off the recess , using a sharp penknife to do the marking . The fitting of other hinges follows along the same lines as mentioned above . // FITTING LOCKS The various types of locks are also illustrated in Fig. 32 . The rim lock and the unit lock are much easier to apply than the mortise lock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door lock stile on the inside and merely requires drilling holes for the door knob shaft and keyhole . To apply this type , hold lock in place with lock face even with the edge of the door . Mark the screw holes , also the holes for the door knob shaft or spindle and the keyhole . Bore the holes and then fasten the lock in place with screws . Insert the knob spindle , attach knobs and finally the escutcheon plate over the keyhole . Close the door and locate the position of the striker plate on the door jamb and fasten this in place with screws . The unit lock is just as simple to attach but it has a different mounting and at the same time provides the same effect as a mortise lock . It presents a much neater appearance than the rim lock and can be installed in much less time than is required for a mortise lock installation . While unit looks are not reversible , they are made either right- or left-hand . To mount the lock a rectangular opening about 13/4 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . With some makes of this lock it is necessary to bore a hole for the knob spindle . The lock is then mounted over this opening and the screws drawn home through the face plates . A mortise lock is fitted into the door lock stile and requires a layout . This is made by placing the lock against the door with the lock face resting on the edge . Mark the knob spindle hole and the keyhole with an awl . While holding the lock in this position lightly mark the outline of the lock body on the door . Next center the edge of the door lock stile and bore the holes for the knob spindle and the key . ' Transfer the top and bottom line of the lock body outline to the edge of the door with a try square . Measure the thickness of the lock case or body and select an auger bit of the sank diameter as the thickness of the lock case . Drill a series // of holes in the edge of the door lock stile to a depth equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides and top of this mortise with a chisel until the lock will enter snugly . Insert lock and mark off recess or gain to be made for the lock face . Trim this out with the chisel and the lock can then be assembled to the door . Mount the escutcheon plates over the keyhole on both sides of the door stile . To mount the striker plate on the door jamb , closing the door will locate the vertical position of the plate . Next locate its horizontal position by carefully measuring from the face of the door to the catch . Use this marking as a locating point , hold the strike plate in position and mark around it with a penknife . Cut the gain to a depth equal to the thickness of the plate . If mortising is necessary this is done in the same manner as mortising for the lock case . With the plate fastened in position , the wood back of the plate can be cut out with a chisel to provide the necessary clearance for the catch and bolt of the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown in Fig. 32 . Door knobs are fastened to the spindle in several ways , by means of a grub screw , threaded on the spindle , and patented fastenings . The screw type occasionally gives trouble . Fig. 32 also shows a method of eliminating this difficulty . The spindle is of square section and sometimes breaks at the hole . Replacement is simple , new parts being obtainable from the hardware dealer . Other standing door fastenings are also illustrated . There are such items as sash fasteners , hook sash lifts , flush sash lifts , transom lifts and cabinet door hardware . Sash fasteners and lifts are fitted to the surface and their application is obvious . Hold the assembled unit in position , locate one part by marking the screw holes , then dismantle and fasten this part . Reassemble other part , mark for location , locking it to do the locating , and then fasten in position . The types of bolts illustrated are simple to fit , but the flush type is more difficult as it is necessary to mortise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND REPAIRING LOCKS In fitting keys do not alter the lock so that it will take a misfit key . One is tempted to do this with the mortised bitted key lock . Select a blank of the proper size and type , filing if necessary to make it fit . File off just enough of the face of the bit to brighten and have a sharp corner that will mark easily . This marking will be used to shape the key unless the old key is available for a pattern . Put the blank in the lock and turn until you feel it strike something . When this happens , hold it firmly and rock back and forth , which should leave a mark at the side of the bit . If it is impossible to get a visible marking , try smoking the key blank by holding it over a burning match . With the mark located , file a notch which will remove the mark , then file another notch exactly opposite this on the other side of the bit . When this has been done the blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original key as a pattern , care must be taken not to damage the original . Use the calipers and check each projection for width and depth . Set the calipers to the original and then check the duplicate key . The six-inch Warding Bastard file is the proper file to use for cutting notches in the side of the key bit when the lock has but one lever . For locks with more than one lever , use the same type of file but a four-inch size . The key should be finished with fine emery cloth or by buffing to remove all minute burrs left by theafile . Common bitted key lock trouble is the breakage of the lock // bolt spring . The compression spring operating the latch rarely gives trouble , but either spring is subject to breakage . Spring replacement requires removal of the lock , and this is also true in many cases when the key breaks off in the lock . The lock cover is held in place by a set screw , E , Fig. 32-IO . In oiling parts , apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one or both springs are broken , take , out the pieces and mate them . Get a new spring of the same width and length and position in the lock . Springs may be secured from nearly all hardware dealers . If the latch plate requires realignment , remove the plate and plug the screw holes with wooden plugs coated with glue . Cut away the door jamb in the direction in which the plate must be shifted , make new screw holes and fasten the plate in position . Glue a wooden strip in the place vacated by the plate , sandpaper the surface smooth with the jamb , and touch up to match finish . CYLINDER , PIN TUMBLER LOCKS AND KEYS Cylinder and pin tumbler locks must not be oiled . They should be cleaned by allowing them to soak for an hour or so in gasoline . Then rinse out in clean gasoline . Force the key in and out and turn while rinsing . Never oil a complicated lock . If a lubricant is necessary , use Plumbago and then jar out surplus lubricant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lock may need cleaning . Padlocks can also be cleaned in the same manner but as a rule they are not worth repairing . The key blank for all cylinder locks must have exact corrugations to fit the slot in the cylinder plug , otherwise it will not enter . Fig. 33 shows in general the construction of these locks , which differ entirely from the lever type of lock . The cylinder lock consists of a cylinder which is drilled to receive the plug . The plug has a slot for the key blank and both parts have a number of vertical holes depending upon the number of pins employed . This illustration is not intended to show any particular make of lock but merely to depict the principle involved . The assembly is completed by dropping two pins of unequal // length , one above the other , in each hole , backed by coil springs , held in position in various ways . The springs are shown as retained by a band , but there are some locks in which the vertical holes are drilled blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the holes will hold the springs in position . In this illustration , the cylinder is shown by the solid shading and the plug , shown in section also , is indicated by cross-section lines . Fig. 33-3 shows the lock position of the plug , and the only way it can be turned without the key is to shear the pins . The key , as shown in Fig. 33-4 , has a series of projections shaped to accommodate the pin lengths and also to line up the pins . It is evident that the projections on the key must be such as to line up the parting line of each pair of pins with the hole in the outside diameter of the plug to permit the plug to turn in the cylinder . This position is shown in this illustration . The cylinder is really a separate unit of the lock and various means are employed to connect it with the other parts of the complete lock . This means may be a tongue and slot or a projection which acts as a cam . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder . This may be accomplished with a wire ring or a shoulder in one form or other . In the latter case , a projection on some part of the lock acts as the stop . Still another method makes use of a disc at each end of the plug which holds it in position . In dismantling the lock , insert the key to line up the pins and then release the means employed to prevent endwise movement of the plug ; this will permit pushing the plug out from the rear of cylinder with a follower . Take care not to loose any of the springs or vins if plug is removed without a follower . It is sometimes possible to remove a broken key from the lock with small picks . If this fails , proceed to dismantle the cylinder from the door and other parts of the lock . If possible remove the endwise locking device and push out the broken key from the rear end of the plug . Sometimes the broken key can be jarred out of position by striking the cylin94 THE HANDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle while the cylinder is held in the hand . If these methods fail , it will be necessary to file away the means employed to retain the springs . This will release the springs and permit removal of the pins , after which the plug can be removed from the cylinder . The broken // key can then be taken from the plug . This procedure may also be necessary if all keys have been lost . It should be noted that the length of the pins will vary inversely as the height of the steps on the key , that is , the longest upper pin will have the shortest step on the key . The broken key , if this is available , can be used as a guide in determining the location of the various pins . However , it is best to note the location of each pin as it is removed so that all pins can be returned to their respective positions . This is particularly necessary if the lock is registered and the keys numbered , as standard keys may then be ordered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , fit the key blank to the slot in the plug . Push the key blank home and insert the lower pins into their respective holes in the plug . Give each pin a sharp tap with a light hammer . This will mark the blank at which point it should be filed until each pin fits exactly flush with the outside diameter of the plug . Bear in mind that the proper functioning of the lock depends upon the exact alignment of these pins . They must not extend above or below the outside diameter of the plug . One who is not experienced will do well to work with one pin at a time . Locate and file one notch , then the next , and so on . The filing of the notches should be done with a small file having a large cutting angle which demands the use of a diamond-shaped file . When the blank has been fitted , assemble the plug into the cylinder and note whether it turns freely with the lower pins in position . In doing this , keep the pinholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall out or be displaced . If one has positive assurance that the steps in the key blank have been filed accurately , this test may be eliminated . Assembling of the lock defends upon its construction . Assuming it to be the type with blind drilled cylinder holes , the first step is to replace the metal filed away at the blind end of the pinhole . This is done by soldering a piece of brass over the holes and then filing the cylinder so that it will fit into the // door . This is necessary since soldering can not readily be done with springs and pins in position . In assembling the springs and pins start with the end opposite to which the key is inserted ? rear end of cylinder . Obtain a piece of steel or wood dowel of the same diameter as the diameter of the cylinder plug . If the plug has a key or slot extension , shape the end of the assembling tool to mate the plug ; this will keep the plug from turning when it is assembled . Place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin ; now push down on the pin with a small nail or punch to compress the spring , and then insert the assembling tool or follower to retain this pin and spring . Assemble the next spring and pin in the same manner and push the follower in far enough to hold these parts in position . Proceed in this manner until all upper springs and pins are assembled . Insert the small pins for the plug into their respective holes after inserting the key in the slot . Start assembling the plug into the cylinder from the front end and as the plug passes into the hole in the cylinder it will push out the follower . The means of holding the plug endwise in the cylinder may now be assembled , the cylinder tested , and finally assembled to the door . The type of lock provided with a band to retain the springs can be assembled in the same manner , the springs being inserted in the holes before the band is positioned . The pins can be inserted through the plug hole one at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its pins may then be replaced as mentioned above . Another method is to position the plug and key , then all pins and springs , after which a loose sleeve is placed over the cylinder , compressing the springs one at a time as the sleeve is positioned to hold them in place . The locking band is now started over the cylinder and gradually displaces the assembling hand or sleeve , just as the follower was used in assembling the type already mentioned . Still another method is to use a small vise to compress the springs and gradually work the retaining band over the cylinder while changing the position of the latter in the vise . CHAPTER VII REPAIRS TO CEILINGS AND WALLS MOST interior walls of old buildings are covered with plaster on a wood lath foundation , the laths being nailed to the studding . In addition walls of modern buildings may also 1c covered with various sheet materials such as Insulite , Shectrock , Upson Board , Beaver Board , Celotex , Vitrolite , Tile , Porcelain , and Asbestos wall tile and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand mixed in varying proportions , sometimes containing a little hair to give elasticity . This is sometimes called haired lime and used with the admixture of patent plasters . Conventional practice is to cover the studding with wood lath , although metal lath may also be used . The plaster is applied with a hand trowel in several thicknesses about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick . The lath is spaced so that it forms a screen to which the plaster adheres by entering into and keying itself in the jont openings and by its adhesive quality . Although plaster may be applied to a bare masonry wall , the studding is erected to support the lath screen and both serve to keep moisture in the masonry wall from entering the interior wall . A section through the conventional wall ould appear as shown in Fig. 28-3 , the trim being set over the plastered surface at the floor line to finish the wall at this point . The lime used must be thoroughly slaked or blisters will be thrown out upon the work when finished . In the first application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sweeping with a broom . Finishing is clone by laying the finishing coat with the trowel or paddle and drawing a bristle brush full of water back and forth over the surface . 97 // PATCHING PLASTER When decorating , if one finds the plaster on walls or ceiling loose in spots this should be stopped and reinforced in some manner to avoid danger of the section falling . Even though the defective section of a ceiling may not fall , cracks and holes may easily be filled with plaster and whiting ; in no case should they be left . If not stopped in any other way , slips of paper should be pasted over them , otherwise the cracks will eventually show through the decoration . It is important to stop ceiling cracks before reinforcing because one edge of a crack is usually drooped and unless aligned with the ceiling before reinforcing , a sharp , irregular edge will show through the decoration . One form of repair is the holes formed in walls caused by door knobs , furniture , etc. , being forced against the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the average repair , remove all loose material , cutting this down to the lath . Scrape out all broken plaster with the putty knife until a solid foundation is obtained around the defective section . To key the patch in position , undercut all edges around the opening as shown in Fig. 40-I . Cut small cracks a little deeper to provide opportunity for the new plaster to adhere and interlock with the old material . With a brush or sponge wet the surrounding plaster to help the new material adhere and keep from setting too rapidly . If the repair is down to the lath , wet the lath also . Repeat the wetting operation just before applying the new material . Prepared or special patching plaster is preferable for such repairs . This can be obtained in small packages and does not set as rapidly . Nor does it shrink to any appreciable degree . If the patch is a large one , do the filling in two stages and thus allow for shrinkage . Fill the opening to within I/8 inch of the surface . Scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anchorage for the finishing coat . Let dry overnight so that it will be hard before the final coat is applied . A // sharp pointed trowel can be used to advantage in applying the material and smoothing it over repeatedly . With two stage work , it helps to add a little coarse sand to the first filling only . In finishing , always wet the surface and trowel smooth . Allow finished repair to harden , then rub lightly with fine sandpaper . In mixing patching plaster add water slowly and mix with a small trowel until a stiff mixture is obtained . Plaster mixture into opening until flush with surface . For a smooth finish , dip trowel in water and stroke to an even surface . For rough finishing use a smooth wooden block covered with carpet or smooth burlap . Dip block in water and rub down with rotary motion . REINFORCING DEFECTIVE CEILING OR WALT Reinforcing materials should be light in color so they will not show through the final decoration . Muslin or an old window shade will serve the purpose well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick . Apply a good coat of varnish ( mixing or wall ) size and allow this to dry thoroughly . Cover the reinforcement with paste such as is used for wall paper and place reinforcement over the defective section , working this out smooth with a dry brush . Tamp it with the points of the bristles to cause it to adhere firmly at all points . The area of the reinforcement should be considerably larger than the defective section . It is necessary to use judgment to get the necessary strength and bear in mind that it is only the overlapping portion which does the work of holding tlxvdefective section in position . APPLICATION OF TILE To tile a wall the existing plaster should be removed and if this has been applied directly to a masonry wall , the latter should be scored by raking out the joints . This is followed by dusting and washing down . Mix three parts of sand to one of cement which , when wet up and applied to the wall , is loo THE HANDY MAN 'S HANDBOOK well scored as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harden and apply second coat . This is intended to be perfectly straight and to insure this a straight edge and wood hand float should be used . The surface is scored lightly with a piece of broom to insure perfect bond with the tiles . The tiles must be thoroughly saturated by immersing in water . They are fixed in position with a mortar consisting of three parts soft sand to one of cement . Soft sand is used because it is more adhesive than sharp sand . When applying tile to a floor that is level all round , wood lath supports are not required . Place a small pat of cement in the center of the tile , place in position , and give a light tap to insure contact . The surface should be tested as the work proceeds . This is done with a straight edge and the tile must be thoroughly clean to insure tight fitting . There are many special wall coverings similar to tile . Each of these requires its special foundation and each is subject to repair when members are broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to cover each type , the best advice that can be given is to follow the maker 's instructions for installation . APPLICATION OF WALL BOARD Wall board and its application are of primary interest for alteration work , and the following instructions have been prepared by the maker of Sheetrock for such work . This material should be piled flat on the floor of a room that is dry , edges even and trade-mark side up , except the bottom board which should be reversed . Handling should always be done in vertical position on side edge . Nail furring strips over the plaster to which the material is to be applied and make sure these are level and straight . Any uneven places must be shimmed out level ; the old stud or supports being carefully located and Sheetrock nailed to them with 6d cement coated common nails . It is advisable to remove the // trim , although unnecessary if this protrudes 1/2 inch or more beyond the plastered surface . Always fur over old plastered ceilings . Apply 1 x 2 strips across the joists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two 8d common nails . Place headers so that all edges of Sheetrock will be firmly supported . Level the furring strips by shimming out the low places on plaster . Get the strips true and even before Sheetrock is nailed to them . When sawing or cutting use a sharp hand saw , place board on bench , trade-mark side downward and firmly support it close to the sawing edge . Cuts that are covered with trim can be made with a knife or chisel and straight edge . Bevel cut with coarse sandpaper on face side . Also bevel mill cut ends before board is nailed in place . This saves time in finishing the joints . In no case leave loose paper on cut edges , unless they are to be covered with trim . It is important to use the proper nail and under no condition should a nail less than 1 1/8 inches long be used . When nailing direct to studding , furring , or joists use 3d common cement coated nails with flat heads . If there is a floor above a Sheetrock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling . When nailing over plastered walls that are not to be furred use 6d nails of the same type . Estimate one pound 3d cement coated flat head nails to 200 square feet of Sheetrock . One pound 4d nails of the same type for 125 square feet and one pound of 6d nails of the same type for 75 square feet of Sheetrock . On all intermediate supports , space nails six inches apart on ceilings ; nine inches apart on walls . On all sides and ends of boards , space nails three inches apart and 3/8 inch from edge , on both walls and ceilings . Do not stagger nails on joining edges . Be sure to drive nails " home " with heads slightly below surface . Do not use a nail set . Draw all edges firmly and evenly against suppoi ts . If nails are not driven " hone " they will show through decoration . When nailing , first drive a few nails at the edge of Sheetrock where it joins the board last applied ; nail the first inter102 THE HANDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second intermediate joist or stud ; next nail the edges and finally the ends . Nail from center of board toward each end . If there is a slight bow , set nails in the board along the nearest support , push the hoard tightly against support and drive nails " home . " When a nail does not lit a solid support , it must be removed or it will work through the decoration . Instructions for the application of Sheetrock are as follows : I. Always place trade-mark side against supports . Butt folded edges . On mill ends of board , or cuts expos-ing the gypsum core , leave open I/8 inch . Be sure all edges are properly supported by studs , joists , furring , or headers . If hoard does not fit tightly at ceiling angles which will // Figure not be covered with picture or crown mold , scribe and saw to fit . When possible do not place a sawed edge against a folded edge . Before erecting , snap chalk marks as a guide for inter-mediate nailings . Do not apply walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always parallels the direction of supports . Under no condition nail in place a board with broken or rough edges . Save time by first cutting the loose paper with a knife . Before starting to erect on ceiling , provide a T made from I x 2 or I x 4 's , length about 1/4 inch longer than height of ceiling from trestle . Do not put braces on it . Have trestles or saw horses the proper height to allow 2 or 3 inches of head // Figure room . It is important to square the first board with adjacent walls . Recut the mill ends of any boards that have been made imperfect by handling . Do not force the mill cut or sawed edges together ? leave open about 1/8 inch . Before the board is put in place , be sure the ends are solid and bevel the cut edge on face side . When cross joints are necessary on the ceiling they should be broken except when wood panel strips are to be used . See Figs. 34 and 35 . Do not cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openings . Omit these until all full sized sheets are placed , then cut pieces to take care of such spaces . It is important to break joints on opposite sides of partitions , that is , perpendicular joints should not come on the same stud . Butt the boards together at all external and internal angles , Fig. 36 . Typical framing is shown in Fig. 37 . It is necessary to see // that studding and joists as well as furring strips are in proper alignment and form a level , even framework . For best results , supports should be on i6-inch spacing and bowed studs should be straightened by making a saw cut , pushing the stud in line , and then nailing a splice to the side . With rough lumber and uneven joists , some carpenters level by stripping the joists to let in the furring strip . At least 2 x 2 'S should be used for cross-furring , which is sometimes done when joists are extremely uneven . The low joist is notched to let in the furring strip . Joists must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur with 2 x 2 strips set on standard i6-inch spacing . Anchor furring strips in the usual manner ; plugging the old walls ; on new walls insert furring strips in the mortar joints as shown in Fig. 38 . Place headers so that all edges of Sheetrock will be supported . Around chimneys use 2 x 4 for framing and frame separately without anchoring on chimney . Two methods are available for finishing and concealing the joints . One of these is by means of a special finisher and the Io6 THE HANDY MAN 'S HANDBOOK other is by a metal reinforced joint system . Complete instructions are supplied with each package of this material . See that all trim has been applied before starting to finish the joints . Place picture molding close to the ceiling and have nail heads slightly below the surface . Boards or corners bruised or broken during application should be treated by cutting away all loose paper and sandpapering all edges to the solid board . The base must be smooth and firm before joint treatment is begun . Sheetrock is adaptable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcimine , enamel , lining cloth or paper  --  with or without panels . Greater care must be taken to make a smooth , even joint when paint or paper is to be used . First apply a good grade of varnish ( mixing or wall ) size for papering as this permits easy removal of paper when redecorating . When the size is dry , hang the paper the same as over any other surface . To paint , it is necessary to have the entire surface perfectly dry and sealed completely , thoroughly , and evenly with a siz-ing coat or primer . Unless this sizing coat be correct , the best results can not be obtained , as color is likely to strike in at certain places and cause a spotted appearance . Before apply-ing any decoration see that Sheetrock is absolutely dry , clean and free from dust . For the sizing coat or the primer , mix equal parts of good // grade varnish size with a good grade ready mixed paint of the desired color , or white lead thinned with turpentine or benzine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primer over the joints and nail heads , painting across the joints , and stipple lightly with stubby brush while the primer is wet . This should remove smoothness . Size the entire surface , and when dry apply the primer and allow to dry thoroughly . Look over the surface carefully , and if there are any " flat spots " touch them up again with primer and allow to dry . It is important , before paint is applied , that this priming or foundation coat be dry , uniform , and of equal gloss all over . If " flat spots " show up , indicating an uneven foundation , it is far better to go over these spots again with a thin extra coat of primer until of even gloss with balance of surface . After the priming coat is thoroughly dried and even , apply a good grade of ready mixed paint , or white lead and turpentine , following a standard practice . A good flat paint will give the best finish . Stippled effects are likewise desirable . Calcimining requires practically the same treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply calcimine according to standard practice in the same manner as it is applied to any other surface . The sizing will permit easy removal of the calcimine when redecorating . To enamel , first coat should consist of equal parts of good grade varnish sizing and flat paint in color similar to color of enamel to be used ; or white lead , raw linseed oil , and turpentine , tinted . When dry , sandpaper and apply two coats of flat paint , color similar to enamel to be used . Allow sufficient time for complete drying after each coat and smooth with No. 00 sandpaper . Finally apply enamel . A panel design may also be employed . When panels are to be used , first determine the most effective panel arrangement . When consistent with harmonious panel design , it is desirable to have the panel strips over the joints . If these are not needed over all joints , they may be omitted and the unpaneled joints treated with Finisher . Panels may be applied anywhere on the wall as long as there are supports back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use wood panel molding from 3/16 to 5/16 inch thick and from 2 to 3 inches wide , the size depending somewhat upon the size of the room . Stain or paint panel strips before they are applied . Also decorate your wall before the panel strips are applied . Nail panels with 6d finishing nails , spacing nails 9 inches apart . Stagger the nails . An effective paneling design is depicted in Fig. 39 . Sheetrock has been used as an example of applying wall board ; however , there are many varieties of this material on the market . It is not the intention to specify any particular material ; your local lumber dealer will be glad to go into the matter of cost , quality , insulation properties , and other factors concerning the material he is prepared to supply . // DAMP WALLS Cellar walls , brick , stone , and concrete walls often present problems in waterproofing . There are many compounds on the market for this purpose , but in any case it is first necessary to determine the cause of the dampness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement or brick work , and it is well to see that there is a clamp-proof course inserted in one of the bed joints of the brick work at least five or six inches above the ground outside . This will effectively prevent any moisture rising from the ground by capillary attraction . Old buildings subject to such trouble should have the walls treated with damp-proof cement mortar to prevent moisture from soaking into the brick work . Waterproofing solutions are effective in many cases , but they are not always permanent and require renewal at regular intervals . When using any process be sure to follow the instructions of the maker which are printed on the container . It is also essential to know that the pointing of the brick work is good . If not , this should be raked out and well pointed with new mortar . This work is described more in detail in the chapter on cement work . There are also such methods open as the application of weather tiling , stucco , etc . In some cases it will he advisable to treat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside walls properly treated it will be impossible for moisture to soak into the inside walls . If walls are damp from floor to ceiling , it is advisable to strip off all old plaster and replaster with proper material . Small damp areas can be effectually cured if the treatment extends some little distance beyond the damp area . Painting over damp walls will not be effective and in any case the alkaline action of the lime in the mortar must first he neutralized . For buildings which do not have a basement , dampness above the floor level is caused by insufficient ventilation or by an inferior layer of damp-proof course . This course is usually // a layer of tarred felt the width of the wall below the joists . Perforations in the brick work for ventilation should be well above the ground and underneath the joists . The ventilation should be such as to provide a good current of air under the building . CHAPTER VIII INTERIOR decorating is not difficult and can be done by anyon who will exhibit a little patience and give thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind is that the surface to he decorated must be perfectly dry and sealed corn pletely . The sealing coat must be thoroughly and evenly dis tributed to accept the surfacing material . Unless this prepara tion is carefully and correctly done , the best results can not bE obtained . CALCIMINING In putting on a new calcimine finish on ceilings that havf become covered with smoke and grease , it is necessary to wasl off the surfaces with a strong solution of sal-soda and water After the surface is thoroughly dry , a sizing coat should bE applied . This should be of a good grade of varnish ( mixint or wall ) size , and when this is dry and even apply the cal cimine . Be sure the surfaces are free from grease and soo before applying the sizing coat , otherwise these spots will show through the calcimine . The sizing will also permit easy remova of the finish coat when redecorating . For exterior use the following proportions are sometime : recommended : Dissolve 15 lbs . of salt in 7 1/2 gals . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack of hydratec lime or a putty made by slaking 1/2 bushel fresh quicklime it III I // water . Mix until a smooth paste is formed and then thin with water as necessary . For interior work , the above paste should have a solution of about 3 lbs . of glue in about 2 gals . of water added to it . Stir the mixture thoroughly , then thin to desired consistency . The surface to be covered should be damped immediately before the finish is applied to insure against chalkiness or flaking . Water used for washing should preferably have alum added to the proportion of one ounce to the gallon . Warm water is best . Wipe off all superfluous water with a cloth . PAPER HANGING In the application of paper , as with any other material , the walls and ceilings must first be prepared for it . Surfaces which are quite new and smoothly finished will require less preparation . About all that is necessary is to lay a coat of sizing ? the need of this being to prepare the surface so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In preparing an old surface , the calcimine or color is wetted with water and scraped off , after which the surfaces are rubbed down with a stiff brush to remove all that the scraper has left and also to make an even surface . In some cases it may be necessary to rub down with coarse sandpaper . If the walls of the room have been papered , the old paper may be soaked and then scraped off . Soaking is accompanied by spraying with a water mist which distributes evenly and . soaks into the paper quickly . To obtain the mist it is necessary to apply air pressure to the water . Fig. 40 depicts a simple device for this purpose . Fill container about half full with water and use a tire pump for creating air pressure in the container . Open the shut off cock and water will issue from the nozzle in a fine spray . If the spray gets too heavy , tilt the container to get a mixture of air and water . Direct the spray on the paper covered surfaces and allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then // readily part from surface if a dull scraper is used . A little soda or lime in the water helps stripping the old paper . If the old paper is not removed , the loose pieces must be torn off , especially at top and bottom corners and edges . All loose paper must be removed ; otherwise the new paper can not adhere to the wall . Any exposed portions of the wall must be sized . This sizing is also necessary if the old paper has been removed ; when the sizing is dry the new paper may be applied . The ceiling and walls get practically the same treatment , but always start hanging paper on the ceiling to get the proper joint of wall and ceiling paper at the corners . This is not so important if a drop ceiling with a wide border is used . HANGING PAPER ON WALLS In hanging paper on the walls , hang the edges toward the window , that is , start at some dark corner , as this will help to make lap joints invisible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length required , allowing 4 to 6 inches for trimming , keeping in mind the pattern of the paper , and cut it so that the pattern will match on adjacent lengths . Be sure to cut paper straight , otherwise there may be considerable waste in matching the pattern . It is advisable to cut only enough paper for one wall , stacking the lengths on the pasting board or table in such a way that all trim edges will be on the same side directly above one another . This trim edge assists in matching the pattern and its removal is the next step . Trim away the waste or uncolored portion . It is advisable to trim only one length at a time until one has gained a little experience with the pattern used . In applying the paper there are two choices : a lap joint for adjacent pieces of paper or the butt joint . The latter requires extreme accuracy and is not generally employed . For this reason the lap joint is described here . Apply paste to one length ; avoid getting paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot on the wall . Lay the paper even with the lengthwise edge of your paste board or table I14 THE HANDY MAN 'S HANDBOOK and the second length of paper under it so that it will extend beyond the edge of the top length on the paste board . This will keep paste from getting on the colored side and also on the paste board . Owing to the length of paper required it will be necessary to fold the ends to permit handling . Fold the top or ceiling end over so that it will shorten the length about onethird , folding it paste side over paste . The other end is folded in the same manner so that the length will be shortened as shown in Fig. 40 . If the paper is pasted in two stages , made necessary because of length , one end is pasted and folded and is then slid along the table to bring the other end into position for pasting and folding . Take care to slide it along that portion of the under length which shows no evidence of paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be hung immediately after pasting ; allow just enough time for both sides of the paper to become damp , otherwise it is doubtful whether the paper will stick . Hang the first length , bringing the top end to meet the ceiling and with the length hanging straight down . Grasping the two corners of the pasted edge , the folded portion will readily unfold as the result of its weight when held vertical . Do not let the paper touch the wall , but align it as mentioned , after which bring it into contact with the wall , then pull it away so that all but about six inches at the top is free . Now let it fall and it should drop into place without a wrinkle . Fixing the paper to the wall is best done with a narrow brush with stiff bristles . Begin at the top and press the paper to the wall , following from the center to the bottom and then from the center to the top . Press the sides alternately . There will be a slight amount of waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room has a picture rail . To remove this waste , take the scissors and with the point mark the paper where it meets the wall trim . Pull edge of paper away from wall and , cut along mark . Now work paper carefully into place with brush , brushing toward the trim . The next length is hung in the same // manner , but care must be taken to match the pattern , overlapping the close cut edge over the full width edge which was not trimmed . When paper will not adhere by treatment with brush it is necessary to use the small roller which is part of the tradesman 's tool kit . This is also used to smooth down the overlapping edges . This will squeeze the lap and sonic paste may get on the roller ; therefore , wipe it with the left hand after each stroke . HANGING PAPER ON CEILING In hanging paper on the ceiling , start at the window and work towards the door , thus having the overlapping edges face the window and not visible from the door or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is the same as applying paper to the walls . It is advisable to cover the ceiling first , even though you decide to use a drop ceiling in which case part of the ceiling paper extends down the wall a short distance . In cutting the paper to angles formed by the ceiling and wall and around projections , the less paper allowed to overlap the better . This cutting is done in the manner outlined , using the point of the scissors for marking . Several sections of paper at such points will have a tendency to " spring . " In overlapping paper on curved surfaces , the portion underneath should be notched with V-notches . In folding the paper , fold the long fold at the top and the short fold at the finishing end . In applying the second length , start with the hack to the length on the ceiling and at the right-hand wall . Use the right hand to hold the extreme corner of length by inside edge , opening the first fold . Tl* folded end will be somewhat awkward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper as a support . One can then move the roll about until there are two or three feet of paper between the hands . Success depends on placing this short length between the hands correctly ; if properly aligned , the remainder will fall in alignment . Hold the length to the ceiling with arms outstretched about // one inch from the ceiling , moving about until correct alignment of pattern is obtained . Do not allow the paper to touch the ceiling . As alignment is established , raise the left hand to bring the paper in contact with the ceiling . Supporting the paper with the roll in the left hand , carefully press to ceiling and run the right hand along the edge to fix the pattern in proper alignment . Still firmly holding the paper against the ceiling with the left hand , use the brush and brush out the first part of the paper , then continue to bring the rest of the paper into contact with the ceiling . The main thing to remember is never to allow the paste side to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position ? this is the secret of matching the first part of the paper . PASTE The paste can be made with old flour or it may be purchased already to use . The flour is mixed with cold water and a little size or glue added to make it spread more freely . Stir until paste becomes thick . Continue to stir and add boiling water . Paste should not be used while warm ; should be rather thick and applied evenly , to prevent squeezing out at the edges . When this happens it must be removed with a clean damp sponge . Any accidental smear of paste may be removed in this way if taken off lightly as soon as made . The paste brush should preferably be six inches wide and if the brush is new should be left to soak in water overnight . There are many old houses which have damp walls and it takes a strong paste to get the paper to adhere to such walls . To make such paste , soak about 1/4 lb. of glue in water for a day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pint of boiling water . When completely dissolved but still hot , stir in two ounces of Venice turpentine . Make the ordinary flour paste , using 1 lb. of flour to 1 pint of water , and when ready , stir in warm glue solution . Finally thin the whole down with two quarts of boiling water , stirring well . // REPAIRING DAMAGED SECTIONS To cover a hole or tear in wall paper , first match the pattern from the waste left over when the room was decorated . Tear a piece somewhat larger than is necessary to cover the damaged spot , in such a way as to give it a serrated edge all round . Using paste sparingly , stick the patch in position so that the pattern matches with the surrounding design . When dry , the jagged or serrated edges will merge into the rest of the paper ; the patch will be as nearly invisible as it is possible to make it . SURFACING MATERIALS Many types of surfacing materials have been developed for creating decorating effects . It would require several volumes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent processes , enjoying popularity , are sponge stippling , Solidon , Textone , Tiffany Cloth , Stippling , etc . STIPPLING Stippling demands a perfectly clean wall , smooth and with every trace of paper and paste removed . Stippling is done by applying a background coat of flat wall paint of the desired color , over which the stipplinj coats are applied with a sponge . In some cases the ground coat may require mixing with size to seal porous plaster and prevent the paint from sinking in . It may also be necessary to apply two background coats depending upon conditions . The stippling colors should be selected to provide texture ? the subtle weaving of bright colors to produce a neutral and conservative tone . Any repairs to the wall and the wall itself must be perfectly dry before the ground coat is applied , otherwise the wall will take on a spotted appearance . This is especially true if the repairs are made after the first coat is applied and the ap I .

Also solder a shut off cock to the container near the bottom . Test the com plete device for air leaks by pumping full of air with tire pump and submerg ing in water . Air bubbles will show location of any leaks . Attach rubber tubing to shut off valve with wire , also fasten nozzle to other end of tubing in same manner .

Fit opposite side of room in same manner , then work in short pieces at each end , taking care to match the pattern . // pearance of the defect magnified by the application of paint . Always allow ample time for the wall to dry before applying the second coat . Stippling is done by the application of a sponge saturated in the stippling color , joints between the cells of the sponge separating the imprint on the background . ' 1'lie sponge selected should have cells of a delicate , lacy nature , and must have a true , flat surface to contact with the wall . This is obtained by trimming or slicing it off on one side . Soak the sponge in warm water and trim with a pair of shears . The sponge can also be cut with a knife when dry . The printing surface must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imprint in the stippling operation . The final operation is to rinse out the sponge in water and then wring out moderately dry . Pour a little of the stippling color on a piece of tin . Rub the sponge in this color and tap a few times on a piece of paper to remove excess paint and avoid heavy and unsightly stippling . The stippling is done by patting the flat side of the sponge against the wall as shown in Fig. 4o . It is necessary to avoid any tendency to turn or twist the sponge and application should be with a firm but not too heavy stroke . The amount of material which can be loaded into the sponge can readily be judged , but the number of strokes between loading depends upon the capacity of the sponge and the effect desired . Ten to fifteen strokes is a fair avcrageefor sponge capacity . Check carefully the number of strokes obtained from the first loading and use this as a guide in completing the work . Much depends upon having the right amount of paint in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much paint ; weak , uneven prints are due to too little paint on the sponge . Bad effects are also produced by placing prints in line ; it is better to stagger the prints as you go along , carefully lining up the print with the one previously applied . Avoid overlapping prints . Develop your design on a sheet of paper first , using dark paper if the background is dark , and light if the background is light . Adjust the touch of the hand and also determine the Ito THE HANDY MAN 'S HANDBOOK proper amount of paint for loading the sponge as well as the number of strokes this loading will permit . Start at a point which is least conspicuous , usually back of the door . The surface of the sponge after cutting will have considerable area and it will he difficult to use this in the corners , at the edges of woodwork , and against the ceiling . Save the small piece of sponge for these places . In the final finishing operation another factor must be taken into consideration ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodwork . If this happens , wipe them off quickly while the paint is fresh . A good way to prevent such difficulty is to hold a piece of cardboard against the ceiling or woodwork . The cardboard will then receive the daubs instead of the other surfaces . The sponge must be kept clean and should have the same treatment after use as it is given before . This treatment is to rinse out in gasoline , followed by washing out in soap and warm water . TEXTONE Textone can be applied to any base suitable for paint . It will stick to glass and wood . It is brushed on and while still tacky , the desired texture is obtained with a sponge , brush , crumpled paper , or ordinary brush stippling . No sizing is necessary but the wall must be in the condition necessary for any other surfacing material . There are certain features which must be observed . These are mixing , tinting , and application . Textone should be mixed in pails of ample size to provide enough material for all surfaces to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion of one pint of water to one pound of Textone . This should insure a consistency that will produce the desired texture . Stir continually while adding the dry powder to the water to avoid lumping . Do not attempt to mix the material thin like calcimine . The mixture should stand about thirty minutes before it is // ready to apply . If the water is too cold a longer time will be required . When considerable resurfacing is to be clone , mix only enough material for a day 's use . Cover material that is left over with a little clean water and before using next day , stir in sufficient fresh powdered material to take up this additional water . Poor results will be obtained in using the material after it has stood forty-eight hours unless about 30 per cent fresh material is added . If a one coat tinted effect is desired , the mixture can be tinted suitably by the use of dry Lime Proof colors . Mix the color with water in a separate container to break up the color . Wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tint is obtained . The color must be thoroughly stirred into the Textone . When dry colors can not be secured , colors in oil or japan thinned with turpentine may be employed . Bear in mind that it is difficult to match colors ; therefore , prepare enough tinting material for the entire surface . To apply Textone use any clean brush ( most economcal results are obtained with a Dutch calcimine brush ) and lay ' l'extone on to a uniform thickness of about 1/i6 to 1/8 inch . Work the texture in as desired . A great variety of textures can be obtained by the use of tools commonly used by the painter and decorator . Hardened Textone is insoluble in water ; do not allow spatters to harden on woodwork or trim . Wash off at once with sponge and water . When the trim is in place it is best to protect it with adhesive tape . Pails , brushes and tools should be kept clean and the material should not be permitted to harden on them . Moderate temperature should prevail in the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafts ; open them after application to permit free circulation of air . Build a fire in cold weather . When the surface is dry , place a piece of sandpaper on a flat surface and rub lightly . This enhances the texture by removing the rough or pointed edges . After the surface has been dusted , it can be sized with Textone Sealer . Mix this material according to directions on the package . It makes an attractive // decoration , and increases the durability of the surface as it prevents absorption of grease and dirt and permits washing with greater ease . FLOORS The most general method of treating old floors is by painting , using either regular pigments or one of the many brushing lacquers . These methods are covered more in detail in the chapter on painting . Quite often softwood floors are in such condition as to make it practically impossible to produce any effect that might be considered an improvement , without an immense amount of work . In such cases one has an alternative , and that is to cover the floor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linoleum is available in designs which imitate both hardwood and softwood flooring in the conventional board widths . These patterns come in rolls of varying widths and in determining the amount necessary , waste can be avoided , by figuring out the most economical width since the entire floor is not to be covered . The greatest durability is obtained with the fewest number of seams . The rug should overlap the linoleum about one foot on all sides . Linoleum should never be laid over boards that are worn , with raised edges or cracks as the foundation is then not smooth and cracks in the covering are likely to appear in a short time . Smooth off the sharp edges , build up the worn spots and fill the cracks with plastic wood or filler . Thoroughly clean floor before applying the filler , and when filler is hard , sandpaper smooth . When patterned linoleum is installed on wood floors , it is essential that a lining of i 1 /2 lb. unsaturated building felt is used . This felt is to be laid opposite to the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapped . The felt should be thoroughly and entirely sealed to the floor with linoleum paste . The linoleum is then laid over the felt in opposite direcCEILINGS , // tion to the strips of felt and with the fewest possible seams . Fig. 40-5 shows how linoleum is laid . Linoleum can be laid directly to a concrete floor without using felt . Allow to lay several weeks to permit stretching thoroughly . Any trimming that becomes necessary after stretching will have to be done at the outer walls and this trim edge should be hidden by the quarter-round baseboard molding . When stretched , the linoleum is cemented to the concrete floor with linoleum cement . Makers of this material advise that most economical and efficient maintenance is by the waxing and polishing method . Keeping floors clean with a scrubbing brush or a wet mop is not only costly in labor , but actually harmful to the linoleum itself . Excess water may penetrate the seams , causing moisture to collect between the linoleum and the under-tour . The resulting dampness will always cause trouble . Linseed oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powders are damaging to this base . Once a linoleum floor is clean it sin be waxed and polished . If it is possible to do this by machine , so much the better , because the machine , rubbing at 4igli speed and vigor , creates friction which warms the wax , and spreads it easily and evenly . The floor is more thoroughly waxed by this method , no excess wax is left upon it , and it is never slippery or sticky . In varnishing linoleum with white shellac , the linoleum must be thoroughly clean , otherwise the results will be poor . The linoleum must also have been thoroughly stretched before the varnish is applied , which should be done in two thin coats . Ample time must be allowed for the varnish to harden before placing anything heavy on the linoleum . The most satisfactory practice to follow is that recommended by the maker of the floor covering . Just as hardwood floors will scratch and splinter if abused , so will resilient floor coverings he marred if too great concentration of weight on small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this floor covering can be // maintained by using glass sliders or round-edged cups of glass or bakelite instead of castors . CLEANING VARNISHED FLOORS To clean a varnished floor properly , wipe it with a cloth dampened in lukewarm water . It is unnecessary to scrub , scald , oil , or soap a varnished floor to keep it clean . Its hard surface will not permit dirt to reach and impregnate the wood . When a varnished floor begins to show the effects of hard wear ? once a year , or oftener , if necessary ? sandpaper it lightly and put on a new coat . The habit of doing this every spring preserves the fresh , elegant appearance of good floors . OAK FLOORING There are several preparations marketed by varnish and wax manufacturers which give excellent results for cleaning and care of oak flooring . In the winter months it is necessary to avoid excessive dryness . Never use water , oil , kerosene , turpentine , soap , or any other cleaning agent except as follows : If water has been spilled on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisten a soft cloth with denatured alcohol and lightly rub the spots , which should immediately disappear . Do not repeat this operation too often or the finish will be entirely removed . Shellacked floors sometimes take on a clouded or grayish appearance because of dampness in the air . This condition can be improved by the same treatment . If the finish has become badly soiled so that it is desirable to remove it entirely , first scrub the floor with a standard brand of varnish remover . Then bleach the floor with a saturated solution of oxalic acid and hot water ? never use lye , as it turns the wood black and ruins the surface permanently . After all moisture has evaporated , the original finish may be applied . If the floor has a varnish finish and this has become badly worn , thoroughly scrub it with a brush , a good cleaner and water ( never flood the floor ) . After it has dried out , apply // a thin coat of varnish ; or if time can not be allowed for the varnish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wax finish should be dusted with a broom covered with Canton flannel . Keep on hand a can of wax , and should the finish become worn in the doorways or elsewhere , apply a thin coat , rubbing well into the wood . Allow the wax to dry for one hour , and then polish thoroughly . Before rewaxing a floor , scrub it thoroughly with turpentine and a piece of cheesecloth . A good method of applying the wax is to take cheesecloth and double it to get added thickness ; then fold it into a sort of bag . Put a handful of wax inside and go over the floor thoroughly . It will be found that the wax works through the meshes of the cheesecloth and gives an even coating over the floor . This prevents waste , as well as excessive wax in spots . CHAPTER IX PLUMBING REPAIRS THERE are several defects in plumbing which arise intermittently . These are leaky faucets , defective flushing valves , clogged drains , and frozen pipes . To these a host of others may be added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are included here to cover all possibilities under this heading . When the simple facts concerning the functioning of these various parts are understood , few difficulties will be encountered in making repairs to the plumbing system . REPAIRING FAUCETS There are several types of faucets in use and it is necessary to ascertain the type in order to determine what is necessary to effect repairs . Two types are known as the " Fuller " type and the " compression " type . The former has an eccentric as the valve operating member and the handle may be turned around and around . The second type has a thread to raise and lower the valve or stop and the handle will come to a stop after several turns . Both types are illustrated in Fig. 41 . Either type is employed for sinks , laundry tubs , and lavatory , but the compression type is now generally employed for bathtubs . The principal part to give trouble with the Fuller type is the ball , and with the compression type the washer , A. The Fuller type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both require a packing to secure a water-tight joint around the stem of the handle . These troubles are indicated by leakage after the handle is in the closed position . Repairs are simple , 126 // and the necessary parts can be secured in any hardware store and also in the ten-cent stores in the larger cities . Leakage may be indicated by an intermittent dripping or even a small stream . This is caused by a worn valve ; this part may also be responsible for the low rumbling noise often heard , though it is possible to turn the water off completely . Poor flow may be due to a swollen ball or washer . In this case , with the handle of the faucet in the open position , the water passage will be nearly closed by the swollen valve part . To repair a Fuller type of faucet , first shut off the water supply either at the main or intermediate shut off valve . The latter is generally placed between the plain supply line and the faucet . Open the faucet to relieve any pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his type has a connector C , to which the body B is attached . The body must be removed from the connector to get at the ball . Use two wrenches , one to hold the connector and the other for turning the body . Double a strip of burlap several times and place this between the wrench and the body to avoid marring the plating . While holding the connector from turning , unscrew the body . The ball A being accessible , it will be noted that it is held in position on the link pin E by the nut D. Remove this nut , turn handle of faucet to open position and the ball may be removed from its pin . Replace with new ball , the rounded por tion or small end being placed against the valve seat . Faucets are made in several sizes and it is necessary to use the proper size ball . Replace cap , washer and nut , then turn the handle to an angle of 45 degrees . This should draw the ball into the valve seat . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an adjustable ball pin and adjustment for ball seating is accom plished by shortening the stem . It is not economical to effect repairs to other worn parts ; it is more economical to replace these or the entire unit . After long use , wear at point F is likely to be sufficient so that the ball will not leave its seat far enough to permit full flow through the faucet . In this case it will be necessary to replace the worn parts . Some hardware dealers stock these parts . // To dismantle the faucet , remove the lever handle and then the packing nut G , which permits removal of the eccentric and link pin . If there is a seepage around the stem of the handle , the packing H should be replaced . Before replacing , open and close the faucet several times to make sure it is working properly . If the packing nut is drawn too tight it will cause the handle to work hard . This nut should be drawn up just enough to cause the packing to function but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TYPE FAUCET To repair this type it is also necessary to shut off the water and then open the faucet to relieve any pressure that may exist . This type need not be removed as all parts are accessible by unscrewing the packing nut C. The handle with its parts lifts out when the packing nut is free . Remove screw B and washer A. Inspect this washer as it may be possible to reverse it on the stem if a new part is not available . New washers should always be used when they are available . There are two methods of supporting the washer , one in which it seats against the stem and another in which it is fitted into a recess E. See Fig. 41 . The new washer must be of the same size as the old one . Black washers should be used for cold water and red washers for hot water . If the stem has no recess , the washer should project only slightly beyond the metal of the stem . With a recess E , the new washer should fit snugly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leakage around the stem , replace the packing F. Replace stem and packing in body and draw up packing nut . Try faucet several times and then turn on water . PIPE Both hot and cold water pipes are subject to a certain amount of corrosion which in time causes a small hole or crack . Pipes // may also burst when frozen . An effective repair for a small leak is shown in Fig. 41 . There are also cements on the market which can be applied directly to the defective area and do not require the use of a clamp . The cement must be tapped into the hole or crack so as completely to fill it . The cement is then allowed to set until it is hard . When there is a leak in the main water supply pipe or in a branch , this can be detected by means of a listening device fashioned from an old telephone receiver , a short rod being attached to the diaphragm . Hold the rod against the supply pipe or fixture and a distinct rumble or hiss will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for plumbing especially when erosion is an important factor , but where this is not of importance , iron pipe is now generally used and especially inside pipe protected from the elements . The joints of this form of pipe are effected by means of screw threads which have a slight taper and the same method is also employed for all fittings . Pipe fittings include elbows , tees , couplings , reducers , etc . The elbow is used to change the direction of a pipe and the reducer elbow permits changing direction through a smaller pipe . The " street elbow " also changes pipe direction , but has a male and female thread , the male thread being used for connection to the water or gas main and thus derives its name . The " tee " fitting permits taking a branch from a pipe at a right angle . It is in effect a coupling with a side outlet . A nipple is a short piece of pipe for connection between two fittings . It is made in several lengths known as close , shoulder , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nipple but has internal threads and is used to connect two lengths of pipe . A reducer serves the same purpose but is used to connect different size pipes . A bushing is threaded internally and externally , and as the name implies , serves for joining pipe or fittings of different sizes . A cap has an internal thread , is closed at one end , and serves to close the end of a pipe , while a plug has an external thread and is intended to plug a tapped hole . // Iron pipe can be bent and this is sometimes necessary , but when possible changes in direction should be made with fit tings . To bend pipe , mark the location of the bend with chalk and open the vise jaws to hold the pipe without gripping . Heat the pipe between the marks which indicate location of bend . When the pipe reaches a red heat , place it iii the vise and pull towards you . This will prevent bulging , hut the bending must be done to gentle curves and in successive stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining an even heat while bending . Lead pipe is bent without filling , plumbers relying on drifts and special tools to work out the inequalities . ( ' upper pipe , un less small , should be filled with rosin or lead to prevent kinks and dents . Fasten paper to one end of the pipe and imbed this end in sand , while the molten filler is poured in from the other end . The pipe must be filled completely before bending and if bent without ' filling must be annealed . Annealing is done by heating to a red heat and then plunging iii water , which softens the metal . A good way to bend the pipe is to have a hole in the bench slightly larger than the pipe . Anchor the pipe iii this hole and bend a little at a time . If it becomes dented , the dents can he worked out with the ball face of the hannner . This insist be done before the filler is removed . Finally , heat the pipe and run out the filler . The usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaded joints . The gasket joint is rarely used as it is more liable to leakage than the threaded joint . Leaks are mostly due to imperfections in the thread , although it is pos sible for a pipe to crack at the threaded joint . // Materials used for securing tight threaded joints in pipes include shellac , asphaltum , a mixture of litharge and glycerine , white lead and red lead , and the many prepared cements that are on the market . These are applied to the threaded surfaces before joining , preferably to the male thread . Pipe size depends greatly upon the number of outlets and the number of outlets that are apt to discharge at the same time . Also upon the pressure or head of water , length of pipe , and resistance . A small pipe is likely to be noisy when of great length and subject to a singing noise and water hammer . A large pipe reduces the velocity of the moving water and greatly reduces the possibility of noise . Water hammer in a pipe is a shock that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . This term is also applied to the loud humming noise frequently heard in water pipes when the outlet is suddenly opened but disappears as soon as full flow exists . Also the rumbling and snapping noise made by kitchen boilers and hot water pipes . Such noise depends upon conditions . When water moving through a pipe is abruptly stopped , the water having no elasticity will not compress and momentarily must absorb its own momentum . The force of this shock must be expended on the pipes , faucets , and fixtures . The use of air chambers will cushion such shocks while a slow closing faucet , such as the compression type , will also help matters . The second cause is the interference of a current of water within the pipe and usually occurs where a branch is taken off . It is likely to occur in long pipes of small diameter in which flow velocity is high . Hammer noise in the kitchen boiler or the hot water pipes is due to the formation of steam in the water heating element . It is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to the water being heated to the steaming point ; as soon as the faucet is opened , the pressure is rePLUMBING // duced and steam is liberated in the boiler or formed in the heating element . Noise will result in either hot or cold water systems equipped with compression faucets if the washer is worn . Sometimes the noise is only evident when the washer first leaves its seat , further opening of the faucet causing it to disappear . FROZEN PIPES Water pipes exposed to low temperatures will freeze . Water expands as it freezes and if the solidification progresses far enough , the pipe will burst . Exposed pipes should be protected to prevent freezing . Under ordinary conditions any non-conductor ? bagging , straw , oakum ? will serve as an insulator . When pipes are exposed to severe weather , cover them with a thin layer of straw , sawdust , tanbark , or the like , then pack around pieces of unslaked lime about the size of a potato . Now add another layer of insulating material and bind the whole together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material will protect the pipes from the action of the lime and the covering will allow little air to reach the lime so that it will generate heat all winter . Lead pipe is difficult to thaw out with a flame because of the low melting point of this metal . The usual practice is to thaw out a lead pipe with successive applications of cloths saturated in hot water . Iron pipe can be thawed out with a flame , but this must be done carefully , applying the heat slowly . The heat should be applied over a considerable area and not concentrated at one point . Move the torch along as much of the length of the pipe as possible . Another method is to invert the faucet and fill the pipe with boiling water . This can also be done with lead pipe . TRAPS An important device in the plumbing system is the trap which , in effect , is a water seal to prevent gases generated in // the sewerage system from entering the building . Sewage dis posal is really an important feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof of the building , but this vent alone can not prevent the entrance of gases . Sewage is carried along the piping by flotation and there is no hidden force to carry the sewage and solid matter other than the force of the water through the piping . The vent pipe provides for circula tion of fresh air through the system and is so arranged as to avoid the possibility of the water seal in the traps being broken . Vent pipes also relieve the pressure and to some extent prevent siphonage . The sewerage system must handle a mixture of water , grease , soap , etc. , and the animal and vegetable matters in sew-age rapidly decompose . In decomposing they generate noxious gases , called sewer gas , which produce sickness when they enter the building . The use of traps combined with proper venting prevents their entrance . The trap must not check free circula tion of air through the venting system , yet it must allow for passage of liquids through it and such solid matter as the liquids will carry . The trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . It may be provided with a vent which helps to avoid danger of the water seal being broken by siphonage . Several types of traps are shown in Fig. 41 , including the conventional pipe or S trap for the kitchen sink , lavatory , and laundry tubs , the same type equipped with a vent , and the drum type sometimes used for bathtub drainage . The action of the trap depends somewhat upon the head of water above it and occasionally siphonage may break the water seal , in which case it is possible to detect the gas odor . Open the cold water faucet for a few minutes to allow water to collect in the trap and thus reestablish the seal . If this happens frequently it will be necessary to add a vent , connecting this vent with the vent pipe of the system . Grease and slop are two elements which cause a trap to clog . These matters gradually accumulate at the lowest point of the trap and either restrict the flow through the trap or prevent // it entirely . The force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when the trap is completely clogged , it becomes necessary to remove the clean-out plug to remove the obstruc-tion . The force cup is a hollow rubber vessel or semisphere with flexible walls . In use , the unit which the trap serves is filled with water to submerge the cup and movement up and down then causes an alternate pressure to he applied to the column of water in the trap . This pressure is transmitted to the partial obstruction , gradually dislodging it from the lowest part of the trap . Since water is not compressible , the displacement caused by the downward movement of the cup has the same effect as a solid ram on the obstruction . The closet also has a trap provided with a water seal as shown in Fig. 42 . The drainage pipe from this fixture is con-nected to the vertical branch from the soil pipe , the upper end of which is vented . Air pressure acts through the pipe and also on the water in the trap , while the sewer gas pressure acts through the lower portion , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , the water will remain at the same level in both legs of the trap . The vent pipe helps to maintain this condition , as any excess gas pressure is permitted to escape through the vent pipe . For flushing this unit is generally served by a flush box pro-vided with two valves . The low clown type of box is shown . The flush box is proportioned to the requirements of the closet and provides the proper amount of water to permit flotation of solid matter and liquid through the trap . As the result of defects in the valves of the flush box , it is possible for the trap to clog and in this case the force cup can be brought into use , if the clogging of the trap is complete . This is necessary to hold water above the normal water level . Clogging can also be corrected by the use of patented augers . These are hand driven and have a flexible shaft which permits the tool to follow the drainage channel . This tool is similar to the one now extensively used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a main trap connecting the soil pipe with the // sewerage or drainage piping of the building . This trap operates on the same principle as the other traps , but when it becomes clogged the entire drainage system will be affected . The general difficulty is a partial clogging of this trap , which restricts the flow and results in a sort of gurgling noise . There are on the market several chemical compounds scientifically prepared to remove stoppage from pipes and drains . Also a number of cleaning compounds intended to be used at regular intervals , and when so used keep fixtures , including traps , clean , odorless , and sanitary . FLUSH BOX One valve of the flush box is to permit it to fill with water , and the other to permit draining the box when flushing of the closet bowl is necessary . Most flush boxes are patented and there are many types on the market . It is difficult to cover all types in detail ; however , the basic principles are much the same . For various reasons , the valves must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in construction . Several diagrams showing the action of the flush box are depicted in Fig. 42 . The water level is controlled by the opening and closing of the water inlet valve which is actuated by an air-tight metal float through a suitable linkage . When the float is in its highest position , the valve is closed . As the float drops , the linkage moves away from the valve and permits it to open . The water then enters the flush box as indicated by the arrows . The low inlet avoids noise in the filling of the box . The functioning of the inlet is dependent upon the float or water level , and some means of checking overflow must be provided . This is combined with the flush valve in some designs . Regardless of the combination , is can be understood that bending of the float rod will not alter conditions , and that the water level is predetermined by the height of the overflow . Attempts to bend the float rod will usually be brought about by failure of the valve to close fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat or maladjustment of the float linkage . Bending the float rod is also attempted when there is noise in the flush box as the water level reaches its maximum . This may be effective temporarily , but it is better to repair the valve and seat as this makes a permanent repair . // Automatic flushing is accomplished by means of a siphon action . The flushing valve is in the form of a rubber ball or a ring , but the principle of operation is the same . To be understood this principle requires a detailed explanation . Referring to Fig. 42-3 , which depicts the condition existing after the water inlet valve has closed , it will be noted that the rubber ball is seated in its spherical seat . It has a rod extending through a guide , this rod in turn being connected to a rod extending from the operating lever . The siphon may be in the form of a closed end tube surrounding a smaller tube , open at both ends or in the form of a U as illustrated . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U to the level of the water in the flush box since this leg or branch is in communication with the water in the box . This level is the lowest part of the curve joining the two legs of the U. This feature forms the overflow should the inlet valve fail to close . Functioning as the overflow , the excess water flows through the leg of the U , around the curved section to the other leg , and then out through the outlet below the ball valve seat . The leg of the U which is not filled with water is also open to atmospheric pressure and therefore filled with air . The space above the water level is likewise under atmospheric pressure and the pressure in the flushing system is balanced . As the handle of the flush box is manipulated , the ball valve is raised from its seat through the rod linkage , as shown in Fig. 42-4 . The water rushing from the box forces the air out of the outlet pipe and this draws the air out of the leg of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held from its seat for just a moment , but this is long enough to exhaust the air from the leg of the U. As the air leaves this leg , the air pressure above the level of the water in the flush box causes the level to rise in the other leg of the U , and it flows out through the outlet , setting the siphon into action . This continues until the water level reaches the open end of the U , when the pressure is again balanced by air entering the U. The approach to this condition is shown in Fig. 42-5 . There are many applications of the siphon principle in use // and when water continues to flow to the closet bowl after the flushing box has been emptied , look for a poor seating flush valve . The rush of the water past the opened valve forces the valve to one side and causes excessive pressure on the small rod and its guide . This rod is likely to become bent and then this feature or wear does not permit the ball valve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit refilling of the flush box , otherwise the float can not rise and be maintained at the proper level to hold the water inlet valve closed . The siphon tube must be kept intact , that is , there must be no holes in it which permit air to enter any appreciable distance above the water level , otherwise action of siphonage would be destroyed . Sometimes there is a suction noise just before the siphon is broken . Such noise may sometimes be reduced by drilling a small hole about one inch from the open end of the U tube . Continual flow of water from the flush box to the closet bowl may be caused by a poor seating inlet valve , the water passing through the siphon or U-tube , which then acts as an overflow . As drainage is effected by flotation , two conditions may give trouble . First , the trap may fail because of the escape of water by means of capillary attraction , a thread , lint , or small piece of cloth leading the water slowly over the hidden wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vigorous use of the force cup may dislodge the material . It is also possible for the trap to become emptied by siphon action . This usually happens when water is emptied into the bowl and flushing is done . The rush of the water and the excess volume to be handled in this case fills the drain pipe , and the water is then subject to a siphon action similar to the action employed in the flush box . Flushing the closet bowl after this has taken place will immediately restore normal conditions . When a flush box does not stop flushing , it is generally due to failure of the air to enter the siphon tube at the open end of the U as the water falls to its lowest level . This may be due
