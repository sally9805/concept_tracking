Traditional starting point for a brilliant legal career is a year 's service as secretary to a great Justice of the Supreme Court . Justices Holmes and Brandeis crystallized this tradition . Some of their young men were Stanley Morrisson , Thomas G. Corcoran , W. Barton Leach ( Holmes ) , Jim Landis , Dean Acheson , Calvert Magruder ( Brandeis ) . No newcomer to the Court in recent years is more alive to its traditions or more avid to enrich them than is Felix Frankfurter . Last week , fresh from his first term in Washington , pausing in Cambridge , Mass , en route to kudos at Oxford , Justice Frankfurter announced who his first protege would be : Edward Fretwell Prichard Jr . of Paris , Ky. , who was graduated by Harvard Law School cum laude last year and stayed on with a teaching fellowship . Friends of this year 's Harvard Law graduating class opined that His Honor could scarcely have chosen more picturesquely . For even at Harvard , " Pritch " Prichard , a roseate , rotund , raven-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pritch confidently styles himself " The Future Governor of Kentucky . " At Princeton ( Class of 1935 ) he made himself conspicuous by running the Democratic Club as a practical vote-getting machine in a community normally Republican . He beat Colonel Henry Breckinridge ( Lindbergh attorney ) , candidate for the U. S. Senate , in a campus debate on the New Deal . He blathered his way out of punishment for a Democratic beer party , enrolled the dean and proctors in his club . At Harvard he made the Law Review , stumped the State for Roosevelt in 1936 , but his chief fame rests upon having coped successfully with the withering classroom manner of Professor Edward Henry ( " The Bull " ) Warren . In the midst of a laying-out by the Bull , Pritch raised his hand for silence and declared : " Sir , it is not stupidity that makes me give the wrong answers , but terror of the monster before me . " He has promised to let the Bull rewrite the statutes of Kentucky .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
