Mei Lan-Fang , China 's greatest actor ( TIME , Feb. 17 ) , began a two weeks ' engagement in Manhattan by presenting selections from his repertoire of some 400 plays : <P> The Suspected Slipper concerns the return of a warrior to his wife after years in battle . All goes well until the couple retire , when the warlord discovers a strange slipper in the nuptial chamber . The wife coquettishly pretends that she has transgressed , that another has been buying her rice , occupying her bed . As she describes him , her raging husband perceives that the description fits one whom he has seen killed that very day . Then the tragic truth is made manifest-that the slipper belongs to the couple 's own son , grown to manhood while his father was away . <P> The End of the " Tiger " General depicts the fate of Fei Chen-O , a court lady who is claimed in marriage by the conqueror of her nation . When the victor sends his " Tiger " General to marry the girl in his stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to death in the marriage bed . Then , having revenged her people , she slays herself . <P> The King 's Parting with His Favorite discloses a woebegone king who must hasten off to battle , whom nothing can console until his favorite does her sword dance , after which he is exultant and leaves her to her moaning . Oldest of Mei Lan-Fang 's selections , this play was written two centuries before Christ . <P> Simple as these tales , their presentation is made to seem curious to occidentals by the antique conventions of Chinese drama . A formalized art , devoid of spontaneity and realism , it uses little scenery other than chairs and tables which may represent almost any architectural feature . The actor expresses himself in turn by speech singing , gymnastics and dancing . Fearsome , comic masks and face-painting , costumes , and a whole intricate play of gesture have complex , traditional significances ( stooping , for instance , means passing under a lintel , i. e. , entering another house ) . The singing is accompanied by one musician producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument ) , by others tapping wood blocks , striking cymbals , plunking rudimentary banjos . Their approaches to harmony are painful to western ears ; their rhythms are often complex syncopations , recognizable by jazz enthusiasts . <P> Mei Lan-Fang 's genius , say his Chinese critics , resides in the perfection with which he executes the bewildering Chinese orthodoxy of posture and diction . Playing his feminine roles he seemed like a painting of Hui Tsung miraculously come to elastic , undulating life . His dances with swords and wands possessed an extraordinarily feline continuity of movement . His falsetto was harsh but expressive . Watching his gait , his play with hands and voluminous sleeves , his tender coquetry , you could understand why Chinese poets have written panegyrics about his eye , smile , shoulder , even his waist .
