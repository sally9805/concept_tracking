txt The Senate adopted today without a record vote the Glass-Barkley bill providing about $530,000,000 in direct loans from the Federal Reserve Banks and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to solvent business enterprises to tide them over the present credit stress . The bill was ordered prepared for immediate transmission to the House , where a similar measure has been reported from the Banking and Currency Committee and is awaiting its turn on the legislative program . Under the bill passed by the Senate about $280,000,000 would be made available by the Federal Reserve Banks and $250,000,000 by the RFC . The share of the Federal Reserve Banks would be made up of about $140,000,000 from surplus now in hand , plus funds from their surplus already paid into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , but which would , under the bill , be rebated by the Treasury out of the so-called " gold profits . " Individual loans from both agencies would be limited to five years in duration and advances from the RFC would be limited to $1,000,000 to any one borrower . Loans would be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain credit in regular channels with which to maintain and increase employment . Political Influence Is Forbidden . Handlers of the bill in the Senate brought up the administration 's reserve strength to run it through a gauntlet of amendments . The measure was amended in only one important particular . This was to make it unlawful for members of Congress or other Federal , State , county or municipal officials or members of political party committees to exercise political influence in the obtaining of the industrial loans through the RFC . This amendment , proposed by Senator Black and supported by Senators Byrnes , Norris , Ashurst and others , was sharply assailed by a group led by Senator Barkley . Its consideration occupied most of today 's long session , which continued from 11 A. M. until after 5 P. M. When the final vote came both sides agreed to a viva voce vote . The result was an overwhelming chorus of " aye . " Later Senator Clark , who was not in the chamber for the voice vote , demanded reconsideration . His motion was voted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition of Senator Robinson , the Democratic leader , and nineteen other Democrats , plus seventeen Republicans and the lone Farmer-Labor Senator , to politicians having any voice in the business loans contemplated by the bill . Senators Glass and Barkley voted against the restrictions on public officials and party leaders . Series of Changes Is Beaten . Proposals to open the RFC to a variety of public loans were voted down . Among amendments rejected was the one offered Saturday by Senator Johnson to permit the RFC to make twenty-year construction loans to public distributers of electricity that have contracts with the government ; a revised version of the Vandenberg-Copeland amendment , reoffered by Senator Copeland , to empower the corporation to lend to receivers and liquidating agents of closed banks on the " full " appraised value of the assets of those banks ; and a proposal , offered by Senator Walsh at the instance of a Mayors organization , to permit the RFC to lend to municipalities on tax anticipations . The Johnson amendment for loans to publicly owned power distributers was defeated by a tie vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 , but Senator Stephens was able to obtain a transfer of a pair with Senator Robinson of Indiana , who was absent , and voted " no . " As adoption of an amendment requires an affirmative majority , the Johnson proposal was lost . Later Senator Robinson of Indiana entered and made a motion to reconsider this vote . Senator Barkley moved Immediately to table the motion , thereby cutting off further debate . On a roll-call the motion to table the Robinson reconsideration motion was defeated , 34 to 30 , but on another rollcall Senator Robinson 's original motion was voted down , 32 to 30 , and the rejection of the Johnson amendment stood . Copeland Presses Bank Aid Plan . The Vandenberg-Copeland amendment was rejected , 36 to 34 . Its form was changed from that in which it was defeated Saturday to make the lending power " discretionary . " In asking defeat of the amendment , Senators Glass and Barkley insisted that the subject should be treated on its own merits and suggested that a separate bill be offered . After its defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it be referred to the Banking and Currency Committee . Senator Walsh found a hostile reception for his proposal to liberalize the RFC lending powers toward municipalities . He had hardly presented it before Senator Couzens was on his feet warning of the dangers inherent in such a proposal . " This is the most dangerous thing , so far as the public treasury is concerned , that has been offered ' for this bill , " Mr. Couzens said . " The chief fault with these stricken municipalities is that their administrative officers will not collect the taxes . . " They have the taxing power and ' ; should provide for themselves . But just so long as the Federal Government relieves them from collecting taxes , they never will collect them . We 'll never educate them to look out for themselves as long as the Federal Government goes unnecessarily to their aid . " Robinson Fights Plea by Cities . Senator Robinson of Arkansas joined in the opposition , saying : " This would impose an appalling and impossible burden on the Federal Government . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the municipalities . We 'd just as well recognize now that the Federal Government can not finance everything and everybody . " Senator Walsh insisted that the one question before the Senate , as presented by his amendment , was whether the government was going to discriminate against municipalities in favor of private industries . In a roilcall the vote was 42 to 16 against the amendment . The Black amendment to bar office holders and politicians from influencing the RFC in making loans occasioned the major part of the day 's debate . Senator Black told the Senators frankly that it would prohibit them from putting pressure on the loan agency , and to , that extent would preclude them becoming " glorified messenger boys for votes back home . " Mr. Barkley contended that Senators could be trusted to exercise prudence in such matters , and insisted that they should not be prevented from calling on the RFC and introducing constituents who were not familiar with Washington procedure . " This would be a fine thing for lawyers , " Mr. Barkley said . Senator Norris entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not kid ourselves , " he said . " When people come to us to intercede for them in these loans they come because they want political influence . " Adams Defends Proposal . Senator Adams expressed surprise . " I 'm new here , " he said . " But I thought I was coming to a body of honest men . I resent the implication carried in this amendment that Senators are dishonest or are not to be trusted . This amendment would not only prevent political influence , it forbids the exercise of influence of any kind . " Senator Byrnes said the amendment would . enable Congress members to take greater care of the public 's business and keep them from becoming mere " brokers " for the loans provided in the bill . Senator Ashurst remarked that under present conditions members had become like " hunted animals . " Lobbyists " swarmed " about the Capitol trying to influence them to ' influence others , he said . " I am going to vote for this amendment , not because our own virtue needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassured , " he declared .
