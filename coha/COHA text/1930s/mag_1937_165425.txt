Experience long ago taught Britain the necessity of presenting a united front to recalcitrant foreign debtors . The instrument shaped for this purpose was the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders , a tough-minded agency which has the active support of the British Government . In the U. S. , Congress provided for an analogous agency in a rider to the Securities Act of 1933 , but because this smacked of dollar diplomacy President Roosevelt instigated a private agency called the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council now headed by Joshua Reuben Clark Jr. , onetime Ambassador to Mexico . Last week the Council published its annual report for 1936 . An 866-page study in U. S. gullibility , it was the most complete record of the country 's investment abroad ever compiled . <P> At the end of last year there were $5,374,000,000 in foreign dollar bonds outstanding . Of this grand total no less than $2,000,000,000-38%-were in complete or partial default . Many an issue is so hopeless that market quotations are no longer available . In listing a 6% issue of the State of Coahuila ( Mexico ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose for which it was sold . Yet Russian Imperial bonds repudiated by the Soviet 20 years ago , are still active on the New York Curb Exchange . Last week 's price : 1 ? . <P> By far the worst default area is Latin America , which accounts for more than one-half of all dollar bonds in default . Approximately 75% of the $1,500,000,000 worth of Latin American dollar bonds outstanding have gone sour in some degree . Only country with unblemished standing in this area of blighted credit is Haiti , which was , in effect , thrown into receivership by the U. S. Marines in the days of Woodrow Wilson . The neighboring Dominican Republic which also received ministrations from the U. S. Marines , has kept up on interests but is behind on sinking fund payments . In national credit standing Argentina outranks all Latin America but several Argentine city and provincial issues have defaulted . Like Canada , where the sins of Alberta are not visited on the federal credit , Argentina can now afford to draw the line between local and national credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refunding program for its dollar bonds , selling 4% issues in the U. S. to pay off the old 6% series . All the rest of Latin America with dollar bonds outstanding is in default to some degree , ranging from partial payments in Brazil to complete default in countries like Bolivia , Costa Rica , Peru .
