Greatest name in U. S. private detecting is Pinkerton . The founder of the name , Allan Pinkerton , was a Scottish cooper who became Chicago 's first city detective in 1850 , soon started a private agency . <P> In 1861 his Baltimore operatives reported a plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln on the way to his inauguration . Sleuth Pinkerton rushed the President-elect to Washington by night , was rewarded by a White House invitation to create the U. S. Secret Service . After the Civil War , Pinkerton resumed his private work , grew rich and famed in the service of pioneering railroads beset by train robbers . But while boyish hearts thumped to the exploits of intrepid Pinkerton men in dime novels , Labor grew to hate the name more &; more . For Pinkerton 's was also making money by supplying armed guards to employers with labor troubles . In 1892 hard-boiled Henry Clay Frick imported 300 " Pinks " to fight a bloody , all-day battle with his steelworkers at Homestead , Pa . Ten were killed , 30 wounded and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government or any District of Columbia official ever again to employ a Pinkerton operative . <P> Last week it was the embarrassing task of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency 's fourth-generation head to discuss that law in Washington before the Senate committee investigating labor spying and coercion ( TIME , Feb. 8 ) . From the agency 's instruction book , Committee Chairman La Follette read an item order-ing operatives to submit their bills to Government officials on " plain paper . " <P> " That , " snapped the inquisitor , " clearly was intended to indicate a method of evading the law , was n't it , Mr. Pinkerton ? " <P> " Yes , " said unhappy Robert Allan Pinkerton , 33 , a slender Harvardman who quit his New York Stock Exchange seat to take over the family business only year and a half ago . <P> Senator La Follette drew Pinkerton blood again when he produced evidence that the agency had planted unregistered labor spies in Wisconsin for General Motors and other clients . A Wisconsin law requires all industrial detectives to be registered . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , Pinkerton officials admitted that U. S. employers had paid the agency $1,750,000 for labor spy and strikebreaking services since 1933 . Last week the committee produced figures to show that General Motors , biggest Pinkerton customer , had paid at least $419,850 . Pinkerton services to G. M. had ended suddenly only the previous fortnight . Most of the G. M. jobs were the routine stuff of planting agents in labor unions to betray them . But one shocker revealed a new angle of U. S. labor espionage , cast a shadow not only on Pinkerton ethics but on Pinkerton competence . <P> In the witness chair sat one William H. Martin , a slick-haired young onetime Pinkerton operative , now unemployed . In 1935 , he said , he was sent to Toledo to work on the Chevrolet strike then in progress . He was assigned , he recalled , to shadow " a man named McGrady , a Government mediator . " <P> " Do you mean the Assistant Secretary of Labor ? " cried Chairman La Follette 's scholarly colleague , Senator Elbert Thomas of Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
