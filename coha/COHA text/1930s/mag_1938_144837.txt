( See front cover ) <P> The President had transformed himself into the Statesman of the Democratic Party and gone voter-wooing ( see p. 7 ) . The Vice President was puttering around his home in Texas , fishing for bass , gar and cats in the Nueces River . Congress had been gone three weeks . Most of the Cabinet were scattering for vacation. * Except for the Secretaries of State and the Navy , the only top functionaries of the U. S. Government left in hot Washington last week were the Spenders &; Lenders . <P> Most conspicuous of these , in the daily news if not in person , was long-faced Harry Lloyd Hopkins , working in shirt-sleeves at his plebeian office on the top ( ninth ) floor of an old yellow-brick structure which houses the Works Progress Administration . Because more than 8,000,000 U. S. persons look to WPA for their toil-won bread , and because $1,425,000,000 is a lot of Government money to have to spend in an election year , Harry Hopkins has inevitably become regarded as a prime mover-and prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remains first &; foremost the dutiful boss of " Men at Work . " <P> Frontiersman . While most of the 85% of U. S. citizens who still earn their livings in private industry wonder whether the remaining 15% will forever remain dependent on the Government for daily bread , Harry Hopkins has long since made up his mind . Behind his immediate plans for this year 's relief , is something far bigger , an economic philosophy in which work-relief is not an emergency measure but a permanent program for the U. S. <P> Now that the last geographical frontiers of the U. S. have been reached and exploited , Harry Hopkins believes : " The new frontier is idle men , money and machines , and all the resourcefulness , ingenuity and courage that reside in twelve or 13 million unemployed men is helpless to take up this new frontier without tremendous organization of productive forces such as only Government can supply when business is in the doldrums . " Henceforth , in short , the Government should subsidize citizens who need to start or recoup their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senate committee last April : " . . . This program must be such that American citizens accept it as a matter of right-with no feeling of social inferiority . " He saw six things to do : <P> 1 ) Cradle unemployed youth in CCC and NYA . <P> 2 ) Find jobs for the employable through the U. S. Employment Service . <P> 3 ) Tide over laid-off workers with un employment insurance benefits . <P> 4 ) When those benefits are exhausted , find relief work to keep workers going until private industry can reabsorb them . <P> 5 ) " The aged population will continue to grow in the future . " * Insure the aged . <P> 6 ) Support other unemployables-blind , crippled , orphans , mothers , etc. , etc. - directly . <P> " This program , " Mr. Hopkins summed up , " . . . is not simply a security program .
