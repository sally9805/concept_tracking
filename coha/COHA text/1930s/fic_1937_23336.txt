MR . DALLAS HAS A QUIET EVENING A STORY BY L. A. G. STRONG T OJOKING neither to right nor left , Mortimer Dallas walked across the floor of the Paradise to his special corner table against the wall . He was aware , subconsciously , of the quarter-hush that descended on the restaurant , and of the indefinable stir at several of the tables which meant that their occupants had caught sight of him . The Paradise was a favorite haunt of the theatrical profession , and there was no star of stage or film , however illustrious , who would not be glad to recognize and be recognized by the head of Transatlantic Talking Pictures , Inc . But Dallas did not recognize any of them . He reached his table , murmured something faintly to the waiter who pulled back his chair , and sat down , with slightly hunched shoulders , looking at a point on the tablecloth just in front of him . It was one of Dallas 's regular habits to visit the restaurant alone once a week and have what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , snatching meals at the studio , entertaining and being entertained , he liked to have an evening without disturbance , when he could concentrate upon a carefully chosen meal and ponder any problem which might be claiming his attention . At the Paradise his practice was known and respected . No one now walked up to the solitary diner to introduce himself or to talk . The few who had tried it had met with such disconcerting receptions that they did not try it again . Dallas had notsnapped or made himself offensive to them . He had simply not been there : making them feel , with the full force of a personality so quiet as to seem almost negative , that they were intruding , grossly and unpardonably , upon his privacy . This was one of his rarest talents and the main causes of his ascendancy in the world of the film . After he had given his order  --  he and the waiter spoke barely above a whisper  --  Dallas placed his folded hands upon the table and , without raising his eyes , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them there : the Flaterington , loud and self-conscious , at a table near the door , with two friends , less eminent , whom she was busy impressing ; John Dill , by himself , morosely picking at a steamed sole before going off to his performance at the Odeon . Presently he became aware , through the vague dream into which he had fallen , of the table nearest but one to him on his left . There was a girl sitting there and a man . The girl reached his consciousness first as a black evening frock with a white collar , and pleasant , rather ridiculous , little white puffed sleeves . He had not noticed her face nor had he seen the frock before ; but something about the whole dimly registered effect told his trained instinct that he ought to know something about her . He perceived also that she was acutely aware of him . He sighed again , and presently , when she was looking at her companion , favored her with that swift sideways glance , the most disconcerting thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in as much as five minutes ' observation on the part of ordinary men . Yes ; of course . Amidst a thousand feminine faces , his memory placed her at once . She had been introduced to him , of all odd places , at a verse-speaking festival in the provinces , to which an enthusiastic dramatist friend had beguiled him . He had heard her performance , and in a minor way , had been favorably impressed by it . She had personality , and , although verse-speaking was not much in Dallas 's line , he had too much instinct for everything connected with his business not to realize at once that she spoke it beautifully . Her looks were nothing much , more a matter of coloring than feature ; but it was a courageous , humorous face , with frank brows and eyes and , though she was on the tall side for films , she carried herself with an air . These favorable impressions had been confirmed when he was introduced to her , still radiant and flushed with her success . Her manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with him frankly , as one human being with another  --  an experience sufficiently rare for Dallas to make him score a mental good mark in her favor . Well  --  she was not radiant now . She sat tense and pale , glancing once or twice toward Dallas , not anxious , but positively afraid to be noticed . For the first time Dallas looked at her companion . A big , handsome fellow , four or five years her senior , he was clearly the cause of the trouble . His face was flushed with constraint and ill-temper , his mouth sulkily set . His whole posture suggested a man whose mood compels him to make himself objectionable , even in his own despite . A moment later Dallas , his attention reluctantly engaged , heard the resentful growl of his voice . It was a familiar , tedious little scene : the girl , miserably conscious , glancing about her in terror lest they attract attention  --  particularly his attention , Dallassaw , with a wry inward smile of pity for youth and innocence ; the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping perhaps to use her very fear lest his behavior be noticed , in order to blackmail her into submission . Contemplating them , Dallas thanked his stars that youth and its agonies lay well behind him . No longer should anyone make him jump through emotional hoops , nor should he make anyone . That kind of thing was all so Iong ago that he regarded the antics of these two unhappy young creatures with a benign dispassionate sympathy , as one would regard the behavior of puppies . The man 's voice was suddenly upraised , thick and menacing . With an agonized gesture , the girl put a hand on his knee and , bending forward , entreated him in whispers . So that 's it , thought Dallas , the fellow 's tight . " I do n't see why the hell ? " " Sshl " The waiter was approaching . With a quick nervous smile he placed the dishes upon the table and , while he was serving them , the man sulkily desisted . He leaned back , and , out of sheer perversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he caught Dallas 's eye . Coldly Dallas held his gaze . Drunk though he might be , the young man did not miss the chill rebuke of those almost colorless eyes . He drew himself up , and glared back in undisguised hostility . As soon as the waiter had gone he leaned forward , pointed toward Dallas with his cigarette , and said something to the girl . She tried to suppress him . His answer was to repeat the remark in even louder tones . Panicstrieken , she caught at his wrist . He disengaged himself with brutal rudeness , scowled across at Dallas , and insolently blew out a cloud of smoke . Dallas stiffened , his irritation caused not by the young man 's boorish conduct , but by the fact that his quiet evening had been irreparably broken . He knew that his attention was now engaged beyond recall and that , for the rest of the evening , he would be surreptitiously watching the couple , perhaps even speculating about them after they had gone . There was nothing he could do short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause too much fuss , demand too many explanations . Besides , he was damned if he would be invonvenienced by any sodden oaf or chit of a girl , whether she spoke verse or not . Then the waiter came up with his iced melon and set it deferentially before him . Dallas allowed his attention to relax . With dreamy contemplation he regarded the fruit upon his plate . Years of training and concentration came to his aid , and in two minutes he had almost forgotten the couple at the next table . Calm flowed back on him again , soothing and pervasive , like the cool flesh of the melon . " I tell you I wo n't have it . I 'm not going to have you messing about ? " With a frown Dallas looked straight in front of him . It really appeared as if his dinner was going to be spoilt . Other diners had become aware of the scene . Curiously , incredulously , heads were turning toward it . A scene at the Paradise ! Such a thing was unheard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , biting her lips , aware of the general attention , trapped . Once more she looked toward her companion , pleading earnestly with him in a whisper . For an instant a different expression came over the sulky face , and Dallas noticed it with genuine surprise . The man was as miserable as she . He was not making a scene for the love of it , but because some wretched compulsion spurred him on : an uncontrollable temper , an unreasonable desire to hurt , even if the hurt included himself . Then something more deliberate wiped the expression from his face and he hiccoughed aloud . Dallas averted his eyes . Vicarious embarrassment was becoming too much for him . A slight but definite tremor of uneasiness within warned him that he was not going to enjoy his dinner . Tough though he had made himself , well nigh impenetrable as was the armor in which his experience and trade had clothed him , Mortimer Dallas was vulnerable at one point . Any kind of an emotional upset affected his digestion . A strike of studio operatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cutting-room : anything in the way of business he could deal with unperturbed , and sit down to his meal as though nothing had happened . But embarrassment , anything which shocked . his sense of the civilized , anything which he did not expect , and with which , therefore , it was wrong to confront him  --  these things , and these alone , could penetrate his composure . And when they did penetrate it they made him angry to think it could be penetrated . They roused his moral indignation ; and moral indignation is very bad for the digestion . The vicious circle was complete . The waiter took away the melon and brought him soup . Before he could begin it a movement at the table caught his eye . With the exclamation , " Filthy muck ! " the man threw down his fork , got up , stood for a moment glaring at Dallas , then made unsteadily for the cloakroom . Dallas looked at the girl . He knew in his heart it would be fatal , but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of entreaty and indecision . She looked down for a moment , drummed with her fingers on the table , and then , as he knew she would , rose and came swiftly across to him . " Mr. Dallas . . . you wo n't remember me , but . . . " " How do you do ? " Dallas had risen . He gave her his celebrated , almost imperceptible bow . " I remember you perfectly well . You are Miss Joan Durham and you were introduced to me at Wood-borough , just after you had taken first prize in the Verse-speaking Festival . " He turned to the head waiter who had hurried up , all consternation at the outrage . " Gustave , please bring a chair for Miss Durham . She will be joining me at dinner . " For the fraction of a second the head waiter stared . Then he turned to obey , and a simultaneous sigh of amazement went out from a dozen tables , as the girl and Dallas sat down together . " Mr. Dallas , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help it . There is no one else I know here . " " You have done quite right . I saw what was happening . " She looked apprehensively over her shoulder down the restaurant . " He will be back in a moment and ? " " You just leave that to me . " He leaned back as the head waiter and a satellite hurried up to lay a second place . " It will be all right , " he went on . " Make your mind easy . " He murmured something in the ear of the head waiter , who nodded comprehendingly . " Now , " he picked up the menu . " I think , in the circumstances , you had better let me prescribe for you . " " I could n't eat any ? OhE " She caught at the edge of the table . " He 's coming back . " Dallas as he watched the young mart lurching his way across the floor felt , the first time for many years , a faint tinge of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was genuine . It concerned himself . Firmly though he had the situation in hand , there was the possibility , just the barest possibility , that he personally might be involved in a scene of violence . He considered the situation , and found it mildly amusing . The young man reached his table and , with an exclamation of thick surprise , perceived that it was empty . He looked about him , with the angry glare of a bull in the ring , and finally saw the girl , sitting at Dallas ' table . With a thunderous scowl , and an exclamation of , " Well I 'll be damned , " he advanced toward them . Everyone in the restaurant was watching now , and there was a dead silence as he reached the table . Once more Dallas had the queer sensation that the young man found it difficult , that it was an effort to him to go on . " What the hell is the meaning of this ? " He looked from Joan to Dallas and backagain . " This lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without replying Dallas beckoned to the proprietor , who was hovering discreetly in the background . Then he turned to the girl , " Miss Durham , it seems that you will have to make a choice . Do you wish to dine with this gentleman or with me ? " For the fraction of a second the girl hesitated . " With you , please , " she replied . Dallas turned to the proprietor . " You have heard the lady 's decision , " he said . " I wonder if , in the circumstances , you could persuade this gentle . man to withdraw and leave us alone . " The young man swallowed and stood glaring at Dallas . His fists clenched and unclenched . Before he could do or say anything , the proprietor tapped him on the shoulder , and two burly waiters , who had materialized from nowhere , appeared suddenly behind him . For a moment it looked as though he were going to show fight . Then , evidently thinking better of it , he glared once more at Dallas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll pay for ? " Then the two waiters seized him by the arms , and in an incredibly short time they hustled him , shouting and protesting , across the floor . As the swing-doors closed behind him there was complete silence for a couple of seconds in the restaurant . Then , released , the voices suddenly soared up in a positive babel . Dallas turned to his companion . " That was very painful , " he said . " But it is all over now . I want you to put it right out of your mind and make a good dinner . " " I could n't eat . " The girl had turned very pale . Her voice was unsteady . She looked as if she were about to burst into tears . " I think you could . " Once more he beckoned the waiter and , almost immediately , a dish was placed in front of the girl . Placing the tips of his fingers together , Dallas began to talk , in soft , even tones , about Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various contretemps of the studios , with such persuasion and effect that , almost before she realized it , the girl was eating and answering with the exaggerated response which comes from relief after a threat of hysteria . It was not until an hour and a half later , when the meal was over , and Dallas had beckoned for the bill , that any allusion was made to what had happened . Dallas had noticed that her nervousness was returning and that she kept glancing toward the door . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I am going to see you home . " She turned to him . " Would you really ? I hate to trouble you any more . You have been so good to me , only .. . he might be waiting . " " That 's all right . " Proprietor and head waiter ushered them out , and a moment later they were seated in a taxi , heading for a part of London which it was safe to say Mortimer Dallas had never visited before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he said presently , " because , as a matter of fact , I was going to look for you . " " To look for me ! " " Yes . I had you in mind for a small part . Only a small one . The character has to speak a poem . It is rather off the beat of most film actresses ; so I thought of you . " Then , as she said nothing , " I will call you up about it in the morning . " " Oh ! " The girl was sitting up straight and stiff . She gave a little strangled gulp . " That finishes it . Now I must tell you . " The light of a passing arc lamp , leaping into the taxi , showed him her face , a tense affair of lights and shadows . " Mr. Dallas-1 have been deceiving you . I have played a mean , unpardonable trick on you . Frank  --  that young man . He was n't drunk . We were n't quarrelling . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ahl " Dallas 's voice was completely without expression . " Yes . You see , after I met you .. . well I was afraid you would forget me . Iwanted to attract your attention , and Frank  --  we thought  --  at /east I thought ? " Dallas nodded as she stopped speaking . " Well , " he said quietly , " you put it over pretty well . I did wonder , once or twice , whether it was a plant , but ? " He suddenly sat up , and took her by the wrist . " Hell ! No ! " he said , " you ca n't play it as well as that . You were trying to stop him all right . " She hung her head . " Yes , I know . Once he really started , I could n't bear it . " " Fond of him , eh ? Could n't bear to see him make a show of himself in public ? Even in a good cause ? " " That 's it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw himself up to go through with it . " Her head was in her hands now . " I know ! I know I I should never have let him . I did n't somehow realize what it would be like . " " It was damn silly anyway , " said Dallas drily . " That sort of thing does n't cut any ice with me , or with anyone else in my sort of place . If I want a girl I want her . If I do n't , not all the monkey tricks in the world will make any difference . " " 1 know . " She was crying softly . " No ! " he repeated , " you ca n't act aswell as that . It is just as well I do n't want you to act , is n't it ? Standing up and speaking a poem  --  that is n't acting . " " What ? " She was peering up at him in amazement . " You mean to say that , after all this , you are still going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He leaned back in the corner . " Did n't I tell you that no amount of monkey tricks cut any ice ? Only do n't try any more . Someone might notice you could n't act , and that would n't help . Nol Do n't thank me . Just you be a good little girl , and say your poem nicely and do what you 're told . " Five minutes later , standing on the pavement and wondering whether to walk , or take a taxi , Mortimer Dallas realized , with something approaching wonder , that his digestion was in perfect order . That being so , he decided to walk .
