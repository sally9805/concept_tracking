THIRTY-TWO grim drivers faced the starter 's checkered flag , awaiting the signal to roar away in the 500-mile grind around the Indianapolis , Ind. , Speedway which was to dump fame and fortune into the winner 's hands . The year was 1935 . Among the racers were Kelly Petillo and Wilbur Shaw , both using motors built by an unknown western mechanic . Petillo won , and Shaw placed second . Twelve months later , thirty-two racingcar pilots again faced the same black-andwhite flag . Now , eleven drivers had turned to that obscure builder of speed , for power plants which they hoped would bring them a share in the prizes . One of these , Lou Meyer , eased through the field to victory , while three others beat the jinx of accident that dogs every entrant in the premier race classic to place third , sixth , and seventh . Just a few days ago , sixteen of America 's most skilled and daring drivers ? half of the total starting field ? converged on Indianapolis from East and West in late May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom-made motors cast , machined , and assembled by the man who two years ago was known only to the racing fraternity , and who never in his life has driven a racing automobile . Only once has he ridden with a racing driver , an experience he declares he never will repeat . A stocky , baldish mechanic named Fred Offenhauser supplied the speed that drove Petillo and Meyer into victories , and thereby established himself as the No. 1 builder of racing motors . In his modest machine shop on a quiet street in Los Angeles , Calif. , Offenhauser builds the sleek engines of bronze , aluminum , and steel whose speed and stamina have carried thirteen drivers through two 500-mile races without failure . Today , practically all the leading pilots , including Petillo , Shaw , Meyer , Bill Cummings , Chet Gardner , Emery Collins , Ralph Hepburn , Lou Moore , Phil Shafer , George Lyons , and Floyd Roberts , turn to Offenhauser for their motors . Unknown two years ago , today toasted by racing drivers everywhere as the world 's premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing rise to motor prominence . But to pick up the thread of this man 's story , we must turn the clock back nearly a quarter of a century . Offenhauser went to work in 1913 for Harry Miller , who later was to build more winning racing engines and cars than any other man in the history of the sport . For three years he built carburetors in Miller 's small Los Angeles plant . Then , in 1916 , Bob Burman , who had gone west to enter a series of road races at Santa Monica , burned up the motor in his French Peugeot . To secure new parts from Paris was impossible , and Miller dumped the job of repairing the ailing power plant in Offenhauser 's lap . The mechanic fixed up the engine satisfactorily . Miller became interested in racing , and soon Offenhauser found himself superintending the building of the famous Miller engines and cars . Barney Oldfield bought the first , and within a short time other track and road-race stars of the day ? Tommy Milton , Billie Arnold , Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter De Paolo ? changed from various motors and cars to Miller 's products . For twenty-one years , Offenhauser worked with Miller . During that period  | he superintended the building of seventyfive engines , each hand-made and fitted like a kid glove . " Harry Miller spent plenty of money on research , sometimes more than he made on sales , " Offenhauser told me . " Consequently , I was learning what materials to use and how to put them together so they would not break down . " Miller quit the game in 1933 , and his veteran mechanic bought some of his machinery , set up his own shop , and announced his readiness to take up where Miller had left off . Immediately he plunged into further research , decided to increase the weight of some parts for greater strength , changed the valve timing and port openings to speed up their action , and obtained the newest products of metallurgy so that the heat generated during fast running might be quickly dissipated and the parts would not crack under terrific pressures . Petillo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to build engines that could " take it . " left his job in southern California in the autumn of 1934 and plunked his life savings , $5,000 , into the chassis of a racing car . Some of this money had come to him as prizes at the old Ascot Speedway , near Los Angeles , the rest from small wages earned by driving a fruit truck . " I 'll furnish the car if you 'll build motor , " he said to Offenhauser . " But I ca n't pay unless I win . " Offenhauser , anxious to determine whether the skill he had been slowly acquiring really could be converted into the reliability and speed demanded of a racing engine , quickly agreed . Some months later , Petillo rolled his car onto the speedway for his first qualifying round . Track rules required 105 miles an hour , but Petillo burned up the pavement at 121 . On returning to the pits , it was found the motor had burned too much gasoline . Offenhauser checked that trouble , and Petillo again roared around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap , the engine became overheated and one of the connecting rods broke . Fearful that other rods would crack , Offenhauser telephoned to Los Angeles for a reserve engine , one on whose building he had gambled for just such an emergency as this . Forty-eight hours later , the plant arrived by air . Night and day , mechanics labored over the new installation , completing it barely five minutes before the time for trials expired . Petillo qualified , and next day , not conceded even an outsider 's chance by the experts , the little Italian pounded around the 2/-mile brick track at an average speed of 106.24 miles an hour , not only setting a new track record for the 500 miles , but also collecting $35,000 as first prize , lap awards , and for testimonials . Offenhauser modestly disclaims any superiority for his motors . " Any good motor will carry through a race , " he says . His record in the brief period since Petillo 's throttle , jammed to the floorboards , set that dazzling track record at Indianapolis , demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certain victory from many drivers . " Petillo had his troubles , " Offenhauser remarked , " but " ? knocking on the corner of his desk ? " not one of my engines has failed during a race . Some of the boys have run out of gas , others had trouble with the chassis .... " " What is the most common trouble ? " I interrupted . " Hard to say . One year , Mays was lead ing by a comfortable margin , when a spring shackle broke . This was entirely unfore seen , yet it forced him out . He could n't stand the pounding . " Last year , Mays was out in front again . It looked as though he would win , but a cotter pin fell out of his carburetor control . Mays pulled into the pits to have the pin replaced , and Shaw moved into the lead . He was running well ahead of the field , but the rivets on his hood broke . That let him out , and soon Meyer jumped ahead , to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speed the year before . Say , did you ever have430.000snatched right out of your hand ? If you had , you could understand how those boys felt . " But those are  | the thrills , the superficials . How are the records made possible ? You will find Offenhauser on the side lines checking and rechecking engines of various drivers to make sure they are ready to burn up the track , surely and economically . When Petillo , for instance , found his motor was consuming gasoline at a too-lively rate , Offenhauser connected a cable between the dashboard and carburetor , with which the riding mechanic closes off the idling jets at high speeds , opening them when the car comes into the pits . THIS master builder never permits an engine to enter a race until it has been thoroughly and completely tested , not on a block but on the road or track . This year no premium fuels were permitted , all drivers being required to use " standard " gasolines , meaning those which have been selling to the public at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pistons and cams strengthened . Where formerly a compression ratio of fourteen to one was common , this now has been lowered . On a dirt track near his plant , Offenhauser tests his engines to determine the maximum compression he dare employ before the engine " pings , " or detonates with a bang . Offenhauser uses only metals which have been thoroughly tested in recognized laboratories . Not only does he make his crankshaft of nitrolloy steel , but after machining it he heat-treats the finished product in an airtight oven in the presence of ammonia gas . This makes the shaft so hard that he actually can cut glass with a sharp edge , a feat impossible with ordinary , tough tool steels . Connecting rods of chrome-vanadium steel are first rough-machined , then heat-treated to make them tough , and finally are finished by machine . A high-tin-content Babbitt metal lines the crank-pin end , while the wrist-pin end is fitted with a hardened steel bushing . " We found in the past that bronze burns out under the high compression , " he explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thrill for the thousands who witness it . This race is the crucible from which , sometimes at the cost of human life , come scientific and mechanical developments that make for greater comfort and safety on the highway . - I asked Offenhauser what he considers the greatest contribution of racing to motoring in general . " Begin anywhere you like , " he replied . " Four-wheel brakes were used at Indianapolis five years before the public got them . Thanks to racing demands , you have tires which will give service 20,000 miles or more . Antiknock fuels were tested first on the track , and as a result you have higher-compression engines . UNIVERSAL joints which will stand both speed and heavy pulling were developed in racing cars . Also , carburetors which give a gasoline mileage once thought impossible . High-pressure oiling systems guaranteeing lubrication to all parts , shockproof steering , and shock absorbers came from the Indianapolis Speedway , partly because the boys could not stand the bumps . Springs , once long and comparatively unyielding , have been replaced by short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The racing drivers who first tested them made possible these luxuries and economies on modern automobiles . " While Offenhauser 's fame as a builder of racing motors was skyrocketing , the midgetcar craze swept the nation . Four years ago the first of these peewee racers , powered by ancient motor-cycle and outboard engines , roared around a  | flat dirt track at Los Angeles . For two years , youngsters , coaxing speed from frail chassis and power plants of more than dubious reliability , risked their necks for small purses . Then Offenhauser motors placed one-two at Indianapolis , and Earl Gilmore , California oil man , who had built a stadium to accommodate the throngs that sought admittance to the midget races , came to this master craftsman with a demand . " We must keep the show moving , " he told Offenhauser . " Twelve cars start , and two finish . " Offenhauser built a sleek little motor , one capable of turning up 7,500 revolutions a minute to pour 150 horsepower out from the ninety-seven cubic inches of displacement within its four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutch and transmission , and turned it over to Curly Mills , one of the midget stars . That was in September , 1935 . During the same month , he delivered the second engine to Bob Swanson , another young ace of the midget pilots . ? SHE 'LL do ninety-five , " Offenhauser cautioned Mills . " Do n't try to open her up on those straightaways ; and do n't gun her too quickly , or you 'll skid . " Mills took the engine , entered a race later that week , and won . Since then Offenhauser has built twenty-one motors for the midgets , and has lost only three races in the hundred or more his baby speed plants have entered . " These events , " he told me , raising his voice above the whirr of machines turning out parts for the larger racing cars which a few days ago faced the starter 's flag at Indianapolis , " are tougher on cars and engines than the big races . Meyer and Petillo , to take a couple of the leaders , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their engines more than 1,400 revolutions a minute . But the midgets ' They roar down the straightaway , scarcely one sixteenth mile long , jam on the brakes . slow to 2,300 , then jam the throttle down and wind up to 5,300 revs at the drop of a hat . Remember , too , this happens twice every time they circle the quarter-mile track . " Oddly , the baby is running away from the parent . This year , S150,000 in prizes is being offered at various midget tracks , whereas the total offered winners in the major large-car racing events falls short of that amount . In ten weeks , according to Offenhauser , a good driver can place in the money often enough to pay for his car and engine , cover all operating and travel expenses , and save $5,000 . BET the speed builder 's heart is in big-car racing , and for six months each year he works fourteen hours a day fitting parts to a split hair breadth , so that they may not fail when put to the crucial test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from block to lock washers , to specifications taken from blueprints . Once assembled , his motors give greater speed than any yet built . What is the secret Offenhauser would have you believe that hisuccess lies in the use of proper materials of the proper weight at the proper places . H , neglects to add that for more than two decades he toiled without recognition , acquiring the experience and skill that drives his creations across the finish line ahead of their rivals .
