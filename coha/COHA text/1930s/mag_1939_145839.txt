For the jitterbug , jazz is an orgy of epileptic exhibitionism . For the casual collegian or cafe socialite it is a moony , soothing stimulus to social pleasures . To a third , and smaller group of jazz fans , good jazz is a serious art with its own history , traditions and standards of criticism . Up to now the critical bible of most serious jazz lovers has been Le Jazz Hot , written by a French swing pundit , Hugues Panassi , after a study of phonograph recordings in an isolated French chateau . To Panassi 's pioneering effort was added last week a second , somewhat soberer and better grounded book of serious jazz criticism : Wilder Hobson 's American Jazz Music. * <P> Author Hobson starts off with a short account of the jazz musical language and its origins , traces its historical development from the early " spasm " ' bands of New Orleans to the " Chicago Period " of the 1920s , and from there to the still-raging swing fad . A less thoughtful writer might have been content merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining and colorful artistic developments . But Author Hobson goes much deeper . Real Jazz is a music of " suspended rhythms , " produced only when its improvisers are free from self-consciousness . Knowing that the most shouted-over is not necessarily the best , he uses his critical scalpel to divide the real thing from the huge growth of plagiarism , imitation , faddism and trickery that has battened on jazz from its very beginnings . The real thing , he finds , was always a very scarce commodity , and the reasons for its scarcity are bound up with the economic instability of a jazz artist 's life , public preference for cheap vaudevillian tricks , the pressure and grind under which a commercially successful jazz artist works . <P> In 1917 , the Original Dixieland Jazz Band gave Manhattanites their first taste of real " suspended rhythm . " They went on paying money to hear a rackety , acrobatic parody of what the Dixielanders had given them . In the 1920s , when Beiderbecke and other Chicagoans were doing the subtlest sort of improvisation jazz has known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Whiteman , who made big money . Swing , too , has become commercialized , tricky , exhibitionistic . Even the best of the " big name " bands seldom produce the authentic article . " Natural jazz music is still to be heard at its finest only under one general condition-the musicians ' pleasure . " <P> * W.W. Norton ( $2.50 ) .
