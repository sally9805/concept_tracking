 | I WAS certain , as I stood one day last winter in the Grand Central Station at the close of the Christmas holidays , that all the young people in New York were going to college . Racing up the stairways , crowding the rotunda , and hurrying out the exits to the train sheds was one stream of young America . As I stood there looking at you , and also trying to visualize similar crowds in hundreds of other railway stations of this country , I could not help framing in my mind the question , " What are you going for ? " And in my eagerness to have this question answered , I felt myself almost compelled to gather a group into a corner ? what a hopeless task at a time like that ! ? and ask . " Are you going , or are you being sent ? " For it makes all the difference in the world if you are going of your own choice , willingly and gladly . Another emotion swept over me . I saw the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel before reaching life 's midway , but it is true , nevertheless , that it will not be many years until I begin to close the door behind me . You stand at the opening gates of time . and set for history its course as it passes through . You are not concerned with what has been , but what is going to be . I saw that not what I think , but what you think , will the world think by and by . I should like to tell you what I see in you , and what I am hoping for you , as I behold you trooping off to college . One can hardly expect you to answer in one sentence the question , " Who am I , and what 's all this college-going about ? " To a biologist you are one thing . to a psychologist another ; to a philosopher you are quite different , and to your friends you are something unique . But you can begin where Descartes began , " I think , therefore I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , to feel , and to do . You can evaluate the thoughts of others and come to intellectual conclusions of your own . You can feel bodily sensations , von can love your friends , and feel the emotional thrill in the presence of the sheer beauty of a sunset or a symphony . You can will to write a book , paint a picture , build a house , or make a garden . You can carry out a plan or help to remake some part of the social order . All this makes you a person instead of a mere animal . In addition to this you are a self-conscious being . And that is the most important part of you . Whatever the mechanists may say in depreciating the significance of human personality , it remains a fact that there is a type of reality inhuman life that we find nowhere else in nature . It is the thing which enables you to make choices and helps you to shape your destiny . You are something more than a piece of complex mechanism which is rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually know . It may be indescribable , but you know that it is within you , and that it makes itself heard in no uncertain tones in the various crises of life . This consciousness of your inner self is the thing which makes you boast of free-@#  | dom . And what could be a greater destiny ! And since your desire is for freedom , I 'd like to see you do something during your college career , and afterward , that is free . You have the finest chance in the world to learn freedom ? not freedom from something , but in a great human sense freedom for something . You have the privilege of becoming an individual . To be an individual it is not necessary that you aim at peculiarity . You do n't need to be outlandishly queer . The uncouth and the bizarre are not distinctive marks of the educated . Being normal , you will wish to size up well with your fellow-students , with no sense of superiority . I know a lad who refused the nomination for the presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial influence would carry him through the election . You will plan to rub elbows with others , carry your share of the burden , and prove yourself a worthy citizen . After graduation you will not wish to become a nonentity , to have no one care whether you are at home or abroad . But if you are going to be a sort of poll-parrot , if you are going to be a human flint which never by any chance strikes fire , if you are not going to be sufficiently non-gregarious to stand out against scornful laughter , if you are going to be afraid to be alone because of what is known as " campus opinion " ? which is often hostile to learning ? you had better not go to college . You 've already shown some marks of individuality which are commendable . First of all , you speak right out in meetin ' . You brook no shams . Whenever I think of you I think of Hans Andersen 's story of " The Emperor 's New Clothes . " You read that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever rogues who persuaded the king that they had produced a marvellous sort of cloth . They sang the beauties of its delicate texture so eloquently that the king became befuddled and could not tell whether there was any cloth present or not . When the king ventured out on parade in his supposed new clothes , all the courtiers praised the wonderfully woven cloth although nothing existed at all . Their timid minds said , " Yes ! Yes ! " to the royal opinion . " Notice the sparkly of the sunlight on the cloth ! " they exclaimed as the naked king rode by . Finally a boy standing on the curb blurted out the truth , " Why , he has nothing on at all ! " There are many things passing for reality among us older folk , but you say , " There is nothing real about them . " Again you are fearless and willing to venture into the unknown , regardless of consequences . You are not waiting for a mansion in the sky . That has little concern for you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how people can grow old or reach the time when certain things are impossible for them . Nothing is impossible for you . There is nothing you can not do . You have health and strength . and you feel that all you have to do is to say to this mountain , " Be thou removed , " and it will obey you . I should be disappointed if youth were always saying as we do so frequently , " It ca n't be done . "  | not and should not look at things as does maturity . Maturity is apt to think that the problem lies in adjusting the status quo ; youth assumes that the problem is to get something done for which the status quo has proved itself to be an inadequate medium . If ever you come to the place where you are forever setting up obstacles and seeing bugaboos , you will be in a dangerous rut . It is hard to get out of a rut . You possess another asset , and it is this which makes the older ones wrinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evil pass . You are the soul of frankness and sincerity . There is nothing hidden that is not revealed . You are determined to be yourself . You allow no one to set your bounds and habitations . There was a time when the younger generation copied the older generation . As the young advanced in years , they gradually took on the manners and customs of their elders . But not now . That day is past . If you want to smoke , you smoke right out in front of your parents . We stole our father 's tobacco and cigars and went out back of the barn to smoke . You stay out late at night and march boldly in by the front door . We stayed out late , too , but we took our shoes off when we returned home , and stole up the back stairway . There is an openness about your conduct that strikes terror into us who were secretive and lived double lives , not daring to speak the truth to ourselves . All hail to the youth who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined though it be ! If there is one thing you are determined not to do , it is to become like the former generation . This is the frankness of youth . I should not like to see you be otherwise . Yes , you have achieved a certain freedom from fear of the hereafter and from fear of the past . What we regarded as immodest , you consider as perfectly proper . You are critical and impatient of any creed or dogma . You refuse guess-work , old wives ' tales , traditional percepts and maxims . If your parents attempt to carry you back to standards of another day , you are prompt to tell them that we are living in a new age . What Is Freedom ? I envy you the fresh eyes with which you look out upon the world . I envy you your chance in college in this day . But how are you going to harness your sense of personal freedom to the broader and deeper life of the age ? You 're honest enough and bold enough when any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty and courage be something more than an expression of your own personal selfishness ? Will they carry you over into those matters which vitally affect human welfare ? Mere self-indulgence , lack of restraint , vulgarization of speech , manners , and conduct , and flaunting of conventions are not unquestioned signs of moral or intellectual advance . To be insubordinate one must be insubordinate for some moral end . As I see you go to college , I see you as individuals who must live each in his own age . And one of two things is going to happen . You can not stand still . You will live either backward or forward . If you live backward , you will rest in the securities of your age and accept its established ways . You will see no **25;865;TOOLONG , no overmastering and powerful ideal . You will stay upon the green shore , piping a silly pipe , and taking tea and comfortable advice . If you live forward , you will come upon the " forehead of the age to come , " and meet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . You will think in terms of humanity , and while you will discover that humanity is sometimes disagreeable , it is often so because it is not rightly understood . I am reminded of the remark an old gentleman made to an old lady at a backwoods railway station as they watched a small dog chase an express train which had just whirled past the  | station . The old lady , turning to her companion , said eagerly , " Do you think he will catch it ? " The old man replied , " What will he do with the darn thing if he does catch it ? " What are you going to do with your education when you do get it ? We of an older generation want something more than words . Some day we are going to shuffle off . We stood one day where you stand now . We shared the joy of cap and gown at college commencement . I shall never forget the day I first set foot in college , a scared , green kid from the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dollar would come from until the middle of the year . That first year in college was a nightmare to me . But I managed , by the mercy of the professors , to squeeze through . At the end of four years I brought up with the rest of the class , a few jumps ahead of last place . We took our places by and by , in industry , in business , in politics , in church . Whatever these things are now , our generation made them so . True , we inherited some things we did not like , and if we have not been able to change everything , it is because in some sense we were holden with the dead hand of tradition . Some things we have made better , and some things we have succeeded in bungling . But for the most part we are responsible for the world as it is today . Our hands and our brains have done the fashioning . Now , when you reach our age , and when you come to the place where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better ? If things are not what they ought to be , will you succeed in bringing them a little nearer to perfection ? What Will You Do About War ? This is your job . Let me note a few of the problems with which you will have to deal . There is the problem of war . I was engaged the other evening in a conversation with a father about this very problem . He has a fine young son who will soon be ready for college . And that makes any future war a serious thing to that father . Is there a possibility that his son Johnny will ever have to go marching off to war , and if so , will Johnny ever come marching back again ? Perhaps Johnny 's father is unduly alarmed , but what about Johnny who will some day have a son of his own ? By that time the horrors of the last war will be forgotten , and all the old lies about the glory of war will be dug up again and retold . Some men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought we had the best instruments possible for killing in the last war , and the record shows that we had some deadly weapons . But what we had then compared with what we have now were mere pop-guns . Have you young people in college enough moral power to keep the world at peace and preserve it from-destruction , from poisonous gas and the death-ray ? Will there be less likelihood of war when you reach our age than there is now ? How about unemployment ? Was there ever a time when so many different groups were talking , not only about measures of relief , but about what can be done so that we shall not have this condition again ? I remember , as a boy , what keen suffering there was during a period such as this . But I do not remember anybody asking what could be done about it to prevent its future recurrence , except that the talk was about a certain political party being to blame . My mother , who was a good woman , and whom I saw giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask what could be done to prevent such a situation . She did what she could in a charitable way and looked for things to right themselves . I am not asking here , What is responsible for the unemployment ? I am asking , Who is responsible ? Who but men and women of my age and older ! All of us who were graduated from college a quarter of century or more ago ? we are to blame . But by the time you reach my age , I and the rest of the folk of my age will be about ready to pass on . Industry and economics will be in your hands . The church will be in your hands . When that time  | comes , will industrial conditions be better or worse than they are now ? Will the good in industry remain as good , and will the evils of industry be counteracted by good ? Recently I heard a man of about my age speak about this period of depression . He said that we have always had these periods of depression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of them with a greater faith in God . It is for you to choose whether you will take that position or the position of the Young Man , who , many years ago , stood up in one of the most august assemblies and spoke . Authority was graven on the faces of those men and woven on their gowns . It was the Sanhedrin , convened in the night . Before them stood this Young Man , clad in the majesty of courage , and unawed by the grandeur and trappings of power , and announced , " I am come that I might bear witness to the truth . " That truth has created a new ideal , and your bearing witness to the truth of things will mark you as an individual of power in helping to solve this vexing industrial problem . How About Politics ? Take the politics of today . It will not be long until you will be making the laws and wrestling with international problems . The chief thing which so many of our politicians have to offer is oratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of guaranty that a man possesses either wisdom , character , or intelligence . Are you going to worship at the shrine of old conventions ? Are you going to build up fairy-tales about old heroes ? Are you going to be among those who destroy books that depart one jot or tittle from the legends of the fathers ? Are you going to retain a child mind which never grows to the full stature of a reality-facing age ? In short , are you going to train in the old , or are you going to teach and practice a new kind of politics ? I I 'm trying to make you see that the youth who goes to college must bear some responsibility . It is a serious thing to be young and go off to college . You can not turn back the clock of time . These and a hundred other problems are staring you in the face and calling upon you to do something about them . I 'm hoping that you will be as frank and aggressive about them as you are about late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to true freedom , and that is the way of religion . Yes , I am a minister , and perhaps a lot of you look upon my work as a matter of routine ? a sort of going up the hill and down again ? and you become impatient with it . Maybe you are right . But when I was a boy , a man used to come to my father 's barn to do the threshing . The threshing machine was driven by means of an old treadmill . It was interesting to me to see the horses tramp that treadmill . They did a lot of walking , but they never seemed to get anywhere . But that old treadmill was hitched to the machine which threshed the wheat that gave food to man and beast . The tramping of those horses was highly necessary . You 've got to reckon with religion the same as I had to reckon with that treadmill . Gone is the old method of threshing , but threshing is not obsolete . Gone , too , are the old approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific viewpoint of the universe . But religion is still here , and will be . The simplest definition of religion I know is the one Donald Hankey gave , " Religion is betting your life that there is a God . " You tell me that you have difficulty believing in God . Is that so strange ? So do I ? sometimes . I 've struck out toward some desired goal , and shaped my plans and labors to that end , only to find that some opposing force defeated me . I 've come to the turn in the road only to find that there was a stone wall blocking the way . I have gone on at times with I high purpose only to sink back disillusioned  | and discouraged . I have sometimes become pessimistic . For a long time I have believed that the good life is the right life , and yet my belief that God is steering this world has been knocked into a cocked hat as I beheld ruthless men carrying out their evil designs without hindrance . I have sometimes grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degradation so often seem to rule the world . I am sure at times that if there is a God , he does not care for me or for anything that interests me . But then I come back and ask , " What is this thing which gives my life purpose and direction ? " And I take it that you are made of the same stuff as I am . Life is something more than comedy or high tragedy or plain farce . Jesus did not die upon a cross for a cause he knew to be a stupid comedy , and no person will ever bear burdens for truth 's sake or goodness ' sake or beauty 's sake , believing at the same time that all life is mean and cheap and meaningless . One may be unable to tell who God is , or what He is ; but there is a way of knowing that He is . And that way is to stake your life on the belief that somewhere in the heights above or in the earth beneath there is a Power waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Th4 Power , if you find it , you may well call God . What other name should you give it ? Religion is not a dim and ghostlike thing that shrinks back into the twilight and fears to face the blaze of day . It is the only kind of knowledge that lies within the reach of every one . Any one can pray and discover whether it really works ; any one can venture upon God and so determine by personal experiment whether he is better for it or no . Recently I talked with a young married couple who said to me : " We have never felt the necessity of God . Our modern science has made God less essential . Besides , we are young , have good health , and make a good living . Maybe some time , if a great sorrow comes into our life , we 'll find a reason for God . " They will wait till some emergency arises , and they can see no other way out . I 'm willing to grant that the pressure of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that the blindness of John Milton gave us " Paradise Lost . " Without his imprisonment in Bedford jail John Bunyan would not have produced " The Pilgrim 's Progress . " Beethoven might never have given us the heavenly beauty of the " Moonlight Sonata " without the tragedy of his deafness . But you can depend upon it that these men previous to their tremendous difficulties , were not praying , " Science is my Shepherd ; I shall not want . " Science Versus Religion - Set over against this idea that science makes God " less essential , " the testimony of a great scientist like Charles P. Steinmetz : " I think that the greatest discovery will be made along spiritual lines . Here is a force , which history clearly shows has been the greatest power in the development of men and history . Yet we have been merely playing with it and have never seriously studied it as we have the physical forces . Some day people will learn that material things do not bring happiness and are of little use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists of the world will turn their laboratories over to the study of God and prayer and the spiritual forces which as yet have hardly been scratched . When that day comes , the world will see more advancement in one generation than it has seen in the past four . " If religion is in a bad way in the minds of you college youths , it is because you are thinking of it in terms of the ideas and conceptions of the past . What you need to do is to free yourself from that dead hand and take a look at religion in terms of the freedom which is yours through your educational opportunities . The vital acceptance by college youth , of the faith and ideals of religion , is the door into richness of life and into progressive welfare for society .
