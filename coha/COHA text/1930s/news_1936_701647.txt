txt The Late Theodore Jaeckel . To the Editor of The New York Times : To most Americans who never leave these shores , the passing of Theodore Jaeckel may go unnoticed . For many years he represented this government as consul general at Hamburg , Warsaw , Rome and Zurich , and as a young consul he performed sterling service at Bordeaux and Stettin . Those Americans , however , who had the privilege of knowing him at his various posts , and the select few who , like the writer , were his colleagues , mourn with his passing , a man of deep culture , a tactful diplomat and a stanch friend . He was a credit to the American ideal of humanitarianism and gentlemanliness ? " a combination and a form indeed where all the gods did seem to set their seal upon to give the world assurance of a man . " S. BARTRAND JACOBSON . New York , Dec. 31 , 1935.
