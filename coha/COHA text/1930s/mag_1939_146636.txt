Montreal 's baseball stadium last Sunday presented an unusual sight . Before an altar , built between centre field and second base , stood 105 brides in white gowns , white veils , 105 bridegrooms in blue suits . In St. James Basilica that morning they had received Holy Communion . In the Wind sor Hotel they ate breakfast , signed marriage registers . On the baseball field they heard a sermon by Most Rev. George 's Gauthier , Archbishop-Coadjutor of Montreal . A dynamic , youngish priest whom they all knew , Father Henri Roy , celebrated a nuptial mass after 105 priests made the couples men and wives . Then , in 105 automobiles lent by General Motors of Canada , Ltd. , the couples drove to St. Helen 's Island , where they ate with 3,000 friends and relations , were given rosaries , crucifixes and photographs of Pope Pius XII-all these tokens sent with the apostolic blessing of His Holiness . <P> The 210 young people were Jocists , members of a Belgian-born youth movement , Jeunesse Ouvrire Chrtienne ( Christian Working Youth ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) . For eight years Jocism 's most vigorous leader in Canada has been Father Roy , 40 , a onetime newsboy who belongs to the same religious order ( Oblates of Mary Immaculate ) as Quebec 's Cardinal Villeneuve . To Father Roy , 50,000 Canadian Jocists , aged 14 to 25 , look for spiritual inspiration . The mass marriage was his biggest effort to date in providing it . It would , he thought , offset " all the unfavorable publicity that marriage is getting in the world 's divorce courts . " <P> Believing that 50% of young people are intellectually unprepared for marriage , 20% financially unready , Father Roy put his Jocist candidates through exhaustive preparation , weeded them from 400 to 105 couples . The chosen ones he sent to lectures , both in mixed and segregated groups , on the medical , economic , social and ethical aspects of marriage . After the weddings , Father Roy hoped that many of the couples would postpone honeymooning for three months , rather than get acquainted in a hotel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around $25 a week-was 26 , of the women , who were to give up their jobs if they were employed , 23 . According to Jocism 's rules , the weddings automatically ended their membership in the movement . But Father Roy got around that by launching for young married couples a new Ligue Ouvrire Catholique ( Catholic Workers ' League ) , with similar aims . <P> Father Roy 's motto for Jocism is : " On Guard For Christ , Young Workers ! " He has yanked many a Catholic off the streets and into his organization . Said he last week : " I speak their own language . When I talk to my boys I do n't use any two-dollar words . I 'm just one of the boys and we all get along fine . By jingo , we ... are the most patriotic people in the empire . No one is more British . "
