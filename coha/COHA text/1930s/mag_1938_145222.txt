Since 1934 the $15,000,000,000 U. S. public utility industry , rightly or wrongly convinced that the present U. S. Government is bent on sending it to the death house , has been fighting a rear-guard legal action with about as little success as Convict Tom Mooney . It has lost two major appeals in the Supreme Court . Last fortnight utility lawyers concluded a last-ditch attempt to get the currently New Dealish Supreme Court to reverse the " brutal doctrine of Chattanooga " - the opinion of a three-judge Federal Court this year that since TVA power sales are legal , utilities have no legal relief even from ruinous TVA competition . Last week from the death-house came a highly articulate croak . <P> The croaker was President Wendell Lewis Willkie of $1,000,000,000 Commonwealth &; Southern Corp . A shaggy lawyer with a sharp tongue , Wendell Willkie has not only shepherded his colleagues through their court battles but has maintained a spectacular standing offer to sell vast C. &; S. outright to the Government before it is destroyed piecemeal . Last week Mr. Willkie was again yanked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to explain what was holding up the negotiations for TVA 's purchase of Tennessee Electric Power Co. , one of four C. &; S. operating subsidiaries in the Tennessee Valley . But , well aware that the committee was winding up its labors on a report that will have the attentive ear of Congress when it convenes next month , Utilitarian Willkie took full advantage of his first good opportunity to shift the Power fight from the courts to the people 's forum . <P> To the committee , Mr. Willkie gave a vivid picture of what utilities , and utility investors , are up against . If subsidized low TVA rates and the " brutal doctrine of Chattanooga " forced utilities to sell out to the Government , their troubles only began . Mr. Willkie , for instance , thought Tennessee Electric Power Co. was worth $120,000,000 ; TVA was offering $65,000,000 . If any public purchaser disliked the utilities ' price , bitterly protested Wendell Willkie , it could set up a duplicating system with PWA funds , getting 45% of the money as a gift and borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Ickes was the only judge of the fairness of the utilities ' offer , Mr. Willkie snapped : " Utility properties without a market are valueless except as junk . ... In effect , the Government holds a gun to the head of the utility and says ' Sell at our price or we duplicate . ' . . . This is one of the most cruel , brutal , and unAmerican doctrines ever adopted . . . . " <P> Sadly detailing his own experiences with TVA , Mr. Willkie claimed that every time his negotiations with TVA Director David Eli Lilienthal reached a crucial point , " there has been an interesting coincidence in threats of duplication , either from the PWA or the Chattanooga Power Board . " <P> " Who should determine a fair price ? " inquired Committee Counsel Francis Biddle . <P> " Any fair and disinterested third party , " replied Mr. Willkie . He suggested the SEC . Mr. Willkie said Mr. Lilienthal had vetoed a suggestion that both sides name an arbitrator and the Supreme Court nominate a third . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
