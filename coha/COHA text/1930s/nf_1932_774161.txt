txt  | verses of a psalm , either a little before or a little after the rest of the congregation ? may any of them be disguised expressions of the will to power , ways of self-assertion . ' Reference was made on the last page to the phenomenon of physical compensation , where the organism as a whole " develops a tendency to stimulate an ineffective , inferior ' organ to greater efforts , or to strengthen some other part of the organic system connected with the inferior organ , and to increase its development and effectiveness , so that the total operative capacity of the organ in question attains a normal level ( compensation ) , or even exceeds it ( over-compensation ) . " 8 This is the process known to biologists as " regeneration . " Examples of it are not uncommon in every grade of organic being : thus , in many cases , " if a part of an organism is taken away by mechanical violence , the remaining part regenerates the lost part , and so restores the complete organism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most widely-known. . . . " 9 These facts help us to understand how , when a physical defect can not for some reason be thus physically regenerated by the body-mind unity , which is , so to speak , the teleological agent at work , another course is open ? namely psychical compensation for purely physical inferiority . Thus , " We may notice that many remarkably small men ? of course by no means all ; overstatement is especially deplorable in such instances ? speak unusually loudly , as though to say Stop ! Do n't overlook me ; although people fail to see me , they shall at least hear me . ' Perhaps one might discern a similar motive behind the child 's habit of talking and crying more loudly than necessary , although this is certainly to a large extent to be interpreted in terms of the pleasure of right function . ' Further , the trivial fact that almost everyone imagines that by loud speaking he emphasizes Footnote  | his words or commands , points to a similar connection . This mechanism of compensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accounts , at any rate partly , for the frequently noted intellectuality of hunchbacks , as in the case of Moses Mendelssohn , or for their malice and love of intrigue , as with Thersites . A very remarkable instance is that of Shakespeare 's Richard III . " i0 The tendency to regard persons as things may be mentioned here : it is sometimes the consequence of a perverted sentiment of self-regard , sometimes an expression of the will to power , sometimes of both . Nothing in our experience is more beautiful than the true pastor 's relation to his flock , loving them as brothers and sisters for whom Christ died : and nothing , surely , less Christlike than the attitude of a clergyman who regards his people as a mere means of livelihood , or ( still worse ) of self-advancement . That is this sin at its worst . A slightly less odious form of the same thing is the habit of dragooning people , trying to manage their lives for them ; in intimate dealings with individuals , forgetting that the true relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which a director of souls should set before himself and before those who seek his help ? is not that of a slave but of a son.11 There are of course connexions of other kinds between traits of personality and physical disabilities . We will mention only one . Probably every parson is subject at some time or other to that horrid concatenation of depression , unaccountable laziness , and irritability over trifles which the ancients called acedia . Bishop Francis Paget 's paraphrase of S. Thomas 's description of it is worth quoting : " the dreary , joyless , thankless , fruitless gloom of sullenness , the sour sorrow of the world ; the wanton , wilful , selfdistressing that numbs all love and zeal for good ; that sickly , morbid weariness in which the soul abhors all manner of meat and is even hard at death 's door ; that woeful Footnote  | lovelessness in which all upward longing fails out of the heart and will ? the sin that is opposed to the joy of love . " 12 It should be recognised that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical as spiritual ; that other factors go to the making of it as well as ? generally , perhaps , even more than ? the mortal sin of sheer sloth . Such are , commonly , lack of exercise , overstrain , unsuitable diet and , in many cases , perhaps , malfunctioning of certain of the glands of internal secretion . It will be noted that none of these factors is beyond the competence of the subject ? with the help of his doctor and wife or housekeeper ? to handle . A frequent accompaniment of accidie ? though it may exist alone ? is hypersensitiveness or " touchiness , " for which the clergy are not altogether unjustly noted . This may be due to various causes ; most commonly , perhaps , to an exaggerated sentiment of self-regard , which shrinks from the cold light of reality and truth , and adopts this attitude to protect itself . On the other hand , hypersensitiveness may represent an over-development of the " instinct of submission " ; or it may be a disguised fear ? of giving oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation , of the opinion of others . In any case , an essential stage in the process of letting the Holy Spirit work in us the conquest of this sin is , as always , self-knowledge . Another weakness greatly illuminated by Adler 's theory is self-pity . It is part of the mechanism of compensation to project a double picture of oneself . First , there is the picture of the man we should be if it were not for circumstances over which we have no control ? our weak constitution , ill-health or poverty ; other people 's stupidity and lack of responsiveness ; the enervating climate in which we are forced to live ; and so forth . This we are apt to regard as the picture of our real , essential self ? the self that , surely , God must recognize as the true one . And then , secondly , there is the picture we perforce present to the world Footnote  | broken and spoiled : but it ' is life , not we , which has spoiled it . Self-pity thus enables us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it protects us against disappointment , and it throws a high light upon those exiguous fields in which ( as we flatter ourselves ) the ideal and the actual coincide . This is the age of the expert , when a man must be master of his job if he is to succeed . And it can hardly be denied that the impression given by a good many clergy is that they are not experts : there is evidence , too often , of uncertainty , indecision ? in short , as a friendly critic put it to us recently , of " dithering . " Now , in so far as this charge is true , it is fair to remember the nature of the Christian minister 's task , the most difficult , the most delicate , the most responsible work that any man can undertake , and which none dare undertake save in reliance upon the special grace of God . On the other hand , it is true that , in the Church of England at any rate , the parson 's is on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravest moral dereliction is he likely to be unemployed so long as his physical health lasts . He is perhaps the only salaried worker who is practically free from the terror that besets the vast majority in these days ? that of being out of work . It is clear that this subconscious sense of security must minister to any tendency towards sloth , half-heartedness , procrastination , unpunctuality or forgetfulness , that a clergyman may have : it must strengthen any disinclination to become a more and more perfect master of his craft . And we mention this trouble of half-heartedness at this point because it derives great , if unconscious encouragement from any tendency towards self-pity . " I would of course do this or that if I could . But  --  owing to circumstances entirely outside my control ? I can not . It is no use my even making a start : I should be harassed and hindered , as I have always been in the past . " It is probable that a vocation to the ministry ( as , indeed ,  | to some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the will to power . It may also be , in the language of Freudian psychology , a disguised exhibitionism , or a flight into security by a man who knows ( unconsciously , or only half-consciously ) that , though he would fare ill in one of the more rough-and-tumble professions , as a clergyman he will always be in the centre of the stage , though it may be a small stage . One of the present writers has recently had to deal with a case in which both these motives were realized by a candidate on the eve of ordination . Among other reminiscences of the past it appeared that his favourite game as a child was to dress himself in a white nightdress and " preach " to his baby brother : there were other indications of the same tendency . Also ( he was a man of thirty ) he had never been able to keep any job for long , and had never been promoted in any position which he had held . It had to be pointed out to him , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute bar to ordination ; they were in any case not the sole motives ? indeed they were not conscious motives at all ? in his seeking to serve God in the ministry ; and to be forewarned was to be forearmed . But we mention the case here in order to suggest that these closelyrelated factors ? the will to power and the impulse of selfdisplay ? are surely involved , in a barely sublimated , unconsecrated form , in many cases of clerical censoriousness , ambition for preferment , laying down the law , playing to the gallery in " popular " preaching , petty jealousy and aloofness ? to say nothing of " spikery " ; and that we should be on the look-out for these vices at the least signs of them in ourselves .  | PART III THE FLOCK  | INDIVIDUAL TYPES THE obvious fact that every man 's individuality is unique has never deterred the observer of human nature from dividing his fellows into classes and groups . We may perhaps distinguish three kinds of classification . ( I ) The popular . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on this reckoning , there are almost as many types as individuals : quot homines tot varietates . It is this popular , loose discrimination that we use when we describe a person as belonging to the gentlemanly type , or to the uncouth , the optimistic , the pessimistic , the peppery , the vain , the aesthetic , the " muscular Christian , " the bellicose , the jovial , the moody , or the aggressive types ? and so on ad infinitum . What may be called the " literary " classification is no more than a refinement of the " popular " : it is familiar to Englishmen from the pages of The Pilgrim 's Progress and William Law 's Serious Call . ( 2 ) The earliest attempt at a scientific classification of psychological types is that associated with the name of Galen , a Greek physician who lived in Asia Minor in the second century A.D. He distinguished four varieties of temperament ? the melancholic or gloomy , the choleric or excitable , the sanguine or unreliable , and the phlegmatic or self-contained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classification ? though not , it should be added , in its hypothetical basis , Galen supposing that the differences were due to a predominance of gall , bile , blood  | and phlegm respectively in the system . Nevertheless , it is a striking instance of science , like history , repeating itself , that in our own day the most probable explanation of the ultimate basis of temperament should be a physical one . " The temperament of a man , " says McDougall , " may be provisionally defined as the sum of the effects upon his mental life of the metabolic or chemical changes that are constantly going on in all the tissues of his body . " 1 Recent research has shown that the most influential of these chemical changes are those that take place in the endocrine glands ? or glands of internal secretion , as they are also called : we shall have something more to say about them later . ( 3 ) The classification of temperamental types most generally accepted to-day is that suggested by Dr. C. J. Jung , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the one most familiar to the layman , is that between introvert and extravert . The following description of these two types is by a writer thoroughly familiar with Jung 's thought : " Jung has worked out . . . two fundamentally opposite types . . . to which he has severally given the names of extravert ' and introvert . ' They are distinguished by the attitude adopted in each case towards the object . The libido , or psychic energy , or interest , of the extravert flows outwards to the object : objective facts or external happenings are the all-important factors of life for him . People and things and events are endlessly interesting to him , and he adapts himself easily and well to his environment . He is the man with many irons in the fire , ' and is never so happy as when his days are full to overflowing with business or other activities .... He is eminently social and detests solitude . . . . The attitude of the introvert is diametrically opposite . His interest is fundamentally subjective and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | object lies not in itself but in how it appears to him . It is not the situation objectively considered , but the situation as he sees it , that is the decisive factor . The first reaction of the introvert to the object is apt to be a negative one . Whereas the extravert , so to speak , enfolds the world in his arms , and cheerfully seeks adventure therein , full of faith in its benevolence towards himself , the introvert is never quite at home in the external world of men and things . He views it with more or less suspicion and fear , and unable to adapt easily to it , withdraws into himself , into his own inner kingdom , where he is quite at home . He can not only endure solitude , which would break the extravert : a certain amount of it is necessary to his mental health and happiness . As a rule , self-expression is difficult to him , and he is apt to appear dull and uninteresting . " 3 It will be noticed that introversion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality as a whole to the external world . In Jung 's own words , " this then is the basic characteristic of the extraverted attitude : the psychic life is displayed , so to speak , outside the individual in objects and relationships to objects . In especially marked cases there occurs a sort of blindness for one 's own individuality . In contrast with this , the introvert always conducts himself towards the object as if the latter possessed a superior power over him against which he had to steady himself . " 4 The problem of psychological types would be simple indeed if this were all ; if the distinction between introvert and extravert were always plain and unmistakable , and we could label any individual " E " or " I " without more ado and be done with it . But of course no one is completely introverted , and no one completely extraverted . It is always a case of " on the whole . " Further , there is abundant evidence ( in dream-experience , for example ) that the introversion of individuals belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 in the hidden and normally inaccessible depths of personality known as the Unconscious , by extravert elements ; and vice versa : and that some neurotic conditions are best understood as the rebellion or self-assertion of such unconscious elements , hitherto denied sufficient expression owing to their incompatibility with the dominant attitude ( whether introverted or extraverted ) of the person concerned . The matter is still further complicated , if we follow Jung , by the fact that , in addition to these two distinguishable object-relationships , colouring the whole mental and physical life of the individual , he divides the activities of human beings into four separable functions ? sensation , thinking , feeling , intuition . " Under the heading sensation , I wish to include all apperception by means of sense organs ; by thinking I understand the function of intellectual cognition and the forming of logical conclusions ; feeling is a function of subjective evaluation , and intuition I hold to be apperception by an unconscious method , or the perception of an unconscious content . " 6 Now , one or other of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . There are people ( the " sensation-types " ) whose lives seem to be wholly at the mercy of their environment . At its most self-conscious and most sophisticated , the sensation-type is seen in the pseudo-hedonism which affects to regard it as man 's highest duty to himself to refuse no experience ; - at its worst , in the man or woman " tossed about by every wind " and influence . The thinking-type is the logician pure and simple , or the philosopher , or the man who knows what he wants from life , and plans and follows every step of the way to his goal . The behaviour and interests of the feeling-type are dominated by his likes and dislikes ; while " intuitives ' concern themselves neither with ideas nor with feeling reactions , nor yet with the reality of things , but Footnote  | give themselves up wholly to the lure of possibilities and abandon every situation where no further possibilities are scented . " 7 Now , " every one of these types ( sensation , thinking , feeling , intuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the object in the way described above . " 8 Humanity is thus , on this elaborate theory , divided into eight main types . We must not allow ourselves to be blinded to the fundamental truth and practical usefulness of the theory by its appearance of artificiality and ingenuity . " Too neat and tidy to be true , " the student is inclined to say . But an example or two may convince us that Jung is on the right track , although some of the terms he uses to distinguish the subdivisions of his two main types are somewhat vague and ambiguous . ( It will be remembered that we are here discussing pure types ? which of course do not exist . Any of the following descriptions would require to be modified in the case of any real individual , however nearly he seemed to correspond to it . ) Consider two clergymen of the thinking-type ; one of them extraverted , the other introverted . The extravert 's knowledge tends to be of the inductive kind , based upon the contemplation and study of external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge with others , he has the makings of a good teacher in him . It is easy to persuade him to join a study circle . At the same time , he tends to be dogmatic , even dictatorial , and his pupils or fellow-students may find him unsympathetic with their point of view : they may suspect that he thinks of them largely as wax tablets to be impressed with his own personality . And it is true that his capacity for sympathy , as for feeling of any kind , is exceedingly small . This defect he shares with his introverted brother of the thinking-type . ( This , perhaps , is why both of them tend almost to overemphasize the truth that religion is a matter of the " will " Footnote  | and not of the emotions . ) But in other respects they are very different . The introvert 's mental processes are deductive . He is interested in ideas for their own sake , less than for what they will accomplish when translated into conduct . He is never a pragmatist . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge with others or to bring them to think as he does , with the result that in conversation he is apt either to be inarticulate or to mislead people as to his own real opinions . He is a bad committeeman , and the idea of " groups " or " circles " as conducive to sound thinking seems to him preposterous . He probably keeps a diary ; but he will never publish his autobiography . As examples of the feeling-type we will consider two young women of the educated class who have just left school . The extravert is at the university , having persuaded her parents to send her there , not so much for its educational advantages as because many of her schoolfellows are there , and she is likely still further to widen the circle of her friendships . She makes friends very readily : it is the easiest thing in the world for her to be all things to all men ? and most women . She takes to others so easily , and they to her , that she hardly has time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth , or that one or two of them are , on her side , almost insincere . Her few enemies accuse her of being shallow . She is highly impressionable . Her religious sentiment is finding expression in Buchmanism : the emotional side of religion is very real to her , and she has no difficulty or shyness in discussing religion in general , or her own religion in particular , with other people ; she is a good " sharer . " The introverted girl of the feeling-type presents , to the intelligent observer , a striking contrast . She is sensitive , retiring , shy . Being a person with a great capacity for affection , she is not without friends ; but they are few , and even those of them who know her best sometimes remark on  | how little of her they really do know . To strangers she appears self-conscious and aloof : this is because she finds it very difficult to be " natural " in the company of others . It is possible that she will never marry : not because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to know her well enough to penetrate below her reserve to the deep wells of affection beneath . She finds it next to impossible to discuss , even with her nearest and dearest , the things about which she feels most deeply . This applies to her religion , which is of the mystical type , and does not easily find itself at home in what is called " Church life . " She is apt to be misunderstood and misjudged : her vicar , for example , who notices that she is frequently present at the weekday Eucharist , and that she often remains on her knees for half an hour or more after the service is over , can not understand why she declines his repeated invitations to her to teach in the Sunday School , or to become a district visitor . He recalls , too , that , when he prepared her for Confirmation , though he was somehow certain that the instructions were making a real impression on her , and though , in particular , he guessed that she was going through something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of making her confession . He concludes that she is an odd creature . The practical usefulness of these distinctions , general and liable to modifications as they undoubtedly are , is that they help us to understand many of the difficulties and incompatibilities of everyday life . It is clear , for example , that an introvert-thinking vicar is unlikely to be a hero to his extravert-feeling curate , while there are obvious opportunities of friction in a family which contains marked examples of several of the types . To return to the broad distinction between introversion and extraversion . It should be remembered that these words apply to different types of temperament , that is , to different attitudes ( having an ultimately physical foundation )  | of the whole personality to the whole of experience . Temperament is to be clearly distinguished from disposition , by which ( following McDougall9 ) we understand " the sum total of an individual 's instinctive tendencies . " " When some one of the instinctive tendencies is disproportionately strong , that one characteristic becomes the individual 's disposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pugnacious , we say that he has a pugnacious disposition . " The difference between temperament and disposition may be seen by remembering that , while a man 's disposition is only manifested under appropriate conditions ? a sociable man 's , for example , being in abeyance when he is alone , and a greedy man 's when he is replete ? his temperament is concerned in every thought , word and action of his life . It would be an exaggeration to say that disposition is what we make ourselves , while temperament is what heredity makes us : but it is true that whether we are predominantly pugnacious , inquisitive , fearful , gregarious , etc. , or not , is a matter very much more under our own control than whether we are introverted or extraverted . The ideal , presumably , would be a perfectly disciplined expression of all the instincts and a perfect balance between introversion and extraversion . And , before we decide that such an ideal would be cold and dull , pulseless and lifeless , we may reflect on the striking fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the senses just defined , you can describe neither our Lord 's disposition " nor His " temperament . " The dangerous potentialities of extreme introversion and of extreme extraversion should be noted . If , for whatever contributory reasons , the introvert falls a victim to mental disorder , it is likely to be some form of neurasthenia , possibly dementia praecox : the mentally deranged extravert , on the other hand , tends to hysteria . One or two clinical descriptions will make this clear : Footnote  | " The patient was a puny , nervous child , with fears of the dark and of birds . He had to leave school at 16 because of timidity ' and self-consciousness . At 23 he graduated from college and went on his father 's farm where he has worked ever since . He had already at zz begun to have depressed episodes . His personality was quiet , shy , book-loving , unaggressive , but ambitious and day-dreaming . For two years before admission to hospital he was gradually losing interest in his work , and was eating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , so that his work seemed difficult . His farming had not been financially satisfactory in recent years , and his love affairs , of which he had several , had not prospered . When first seen he was inactive , lying in bed a good deal . He admitted some depression , but his principal complaint was lack of energy and of interest . There was no difficulty in thinking and no evidence of emotional or intellectual defect . He discussed his condition willingly and accepted the explanations given him . " ? The authorities here quoted remark that nowadays neurasthenia in pure culture has become very rare " since physicians ceased to expect it so frequently and to search for its symptoms so diligently. " 11 Every mental hospital , on the other hand , contains cases of dementia praecox , so called because it tends to lead to a state of dementia and is so liable to arise ( it need not : most cases begin in the early twenties ) in childhood . The disease , says McDougall , " remains a mystery and a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three kinds of dementia praecox are commonly distinguished : but " there is one symptom which can be said to be common to all , namely , a loss of emotional or affective contact with their fellow-men . " Iz " Q.M. , who was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital at the age of z6 , was reported to have been always nervous . ' He had stuttered at the age of and as the consequence of a fright , when he had been left alone in a schoolroom , he was kept away from school for a year . He Footnote  | was easily led by companions , and very obedient to his parents . Once at school his teacher had drawn his face on the board and said it was like the moon . ' He remembered this bitterly , and his personal appearance became an increasingly sensitive point . Partly as the result of this , he was shy , and felt like a kind of clown ' in company . When he left school at 16 he was apprenticed as an engineer , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work unsuitable . In 1914 ( at 18 ) he enlisted and was not discharged till 1917 , but he saw no service , having spent most of his time in hospital on account of a supposed heart lesion . On his discharge he had an operation for cervical adentis . He became increasingly preoccupied about his health , so that if he read a book in which a disease was mentioned he at once imagined that he had that disease . At zz he courted a girl , but I felt that if I kept it up I 'd go wrong in my head . ' He ceased seeing the girl , concentrated on his work , and felt better for a time . This failure only increased his general sense of insufficiency . I never felt I was just a man . I was n't taking my right place . I was going about things apologetic . I could never talk right clear . I could never take the place I should have taken according to my age . . . . I never let myself go ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . ' After discharge from the army he had worked for his father , but his anxious preoccupation about his health , his sensitiveness about his appearance and his general feeling of dissatisfaction with himself interfered so much with his concentration that his head buzzed , ' and he had done no work for ten months before admission to hospital . After leaving off work , his preoccupation increased , he became more and more depressed about himself , and more and more secretive , so that he did not wish to see anyone , thought everyone was looking at him and hinted at suicide . When admitted to hospital he was quiet and co-operative , but very jerky in speech and movements , hesitating in the middle of sentences as if his thoughts had been interrupted . Soon he began to express definite persecutory ideas . He was being made an example of , ' and to appear the biggest fool in the world . ' Finally , there was a system being worked ' against him . His conduct became impulsive ? he escaped over the garden wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do him good . ' Within four months of admission  | hallucinations appeared , and at times mutism , verbigeration and flexibilitis cerea . Physically , there was no evidence of organic disease . " 13 It may be said that reference to such cases is unnecessary in a volume on Pastoral Psychology : they do not come within the purview of the clergy . But in fact they may , at least in their early stages . It is in most cases unlikely that the incipient signs of dementia praecox will be recognized for what they are by the patient 's friends . Prevention is better than cure : and , as we shall see later , the whole tendency of modern psychology is to emphasize the importance of readjusting and redirecting mental kinks and crookednesses at their earliest appearance.14 Apprehension , then , might reasonably be felt concerning a child who was abnormally shy and seclusive , shunning companionship in work or play , absorbed in his own society and his own phantasies , his only response to others being to accept complacently any suggestion made to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led to do as the result of such suggestions ) . No less suspicious would be a boy in the later stages of adolescence whose general attitude to his surroundings betrayed a profound introversion : who became markedly apathetic and indifferent , to the point of being regardless of the impression he made ( however surprising , disagreeable , or provoking ) on other people ; with whom it became more and more difficult to maintain really sympathetic relations ; who was apparently incapable of regret , or pity , or enthusiasm ; whose personal habits grew slovenly , or worse ; who plainly regarded the world and its inhabitants as existing for his comfort and convenience , and interpreted trivial events and casual remarks , even by strangers , as directed either to his own harm or well being . In either of these cases the observer would be justified in Footnote  | warning the individual 's family of the probable outcome of such traits of temperament if allowed to continue unchecked . If the characteristic neurosis of the introvert is dementia praecox , that of the extravert is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is to say the splitting of the personality into two currents flowing independently of one another . " Functional " par.lyses , tics , fugues , and double or multiple personality are typical hysterical conditions : illustrative cases may be found in any text-book of psychopathology . But the potential dangers of even extreme extraversion are so small compared with those of the " shut-in , " introverted temperament that we do not think it necessary to say more about them here . Attention has been called above to the important distinction ( for purposes of psychological discussion ) between temperament and disposition . Both are to be distinguished , further , from temper , mood , sentiment and habit . Of the nature of a sentiment something has been said in Chapter II . We may follow McDougall in regarding a man 's " temper " as expressing " qualities common to all his emotional tendencies " ( steadfastness and fickleness are good examples ) and " mood " as the persistence of an emotional state of mind , even after the object which evoked it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue for some time after an angry dispute . Finally , " habit " is " an acquired facility " ? primarily of bodily movement.15 McDougall carefully distinguishes between true habits ( which may be good or bad , valuable or not ) and such miscalled " habits " as punctuality , courtesy , thrift , etc. : these , as being " that consistency of conduct which comes from the sentiments , " are principles . True courtesy , for example , comes from the soul : it is more than a certain automatic movement of the hand to the hat when meeting a lady . Footnote  | The sum-total of the mental and physical states so far mentioned in this chapter constitutes personality or character : a man is , we might almost say , what his temperament , disposition , sentiments , habits and moods make him.ls One of the most interesting developments of recent psychology consists in various attempts to devise means of discovering the " set " of an individual 's personality , by methods more accurate and scientific , and less liable to distortion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary , common-sense " observation . The practical value of such " tests of temperament and personality , " if they could be perfected , is evident . It would , for example , save many young people from entering forms of employment in which they will find themselves square pegs in round holes . It would enable an employer , who knew what kind of man he wanted for a particular job , to avoid engaging another kind of man . It might even help a vicar to discover whether a prospective curate was really likely to be as " good with men and lads " ? or at any rate with the men and lads of this particular parish ? as the young man was confident he would be . " Vocational guidance " ( in the choice of work ) and " vocational selection " ( in the choice of applicants for particular kinds of work ) , based on " tests " of temperament and character , are already much used in America , and their use is growing in England . An example or two may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of words and asked to cross out those which arouse unpleasant associations in his mind . Such a test , assuming the honesty and good faith of the individual , clearly gives some insight into his emotional make-up . Or he may be asked to arrange a series of delinquencies in the order of what seems to him their heinousness ; this is a test of moral judgment . A boy known to us was told to write the alphabet as quickly as he could ; then to write A 1 , B 1 , C 1 , D 1 , etc. and then A z , B z , C z , ? and so on till he was stopped . When he had got as far as K 4 , the examiner suddenly rapped on the table and said , " Now make an S ' backwards and then get on with the other job . " This was presumably to test the ease with which the boy could be thrown out of his stride.l " As an example of industrial tests , we may refer to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , under conditions analogous to those of the streets , but without their dangers , the quickness of the men 's response to stimuli representing various degrees of danger . ( In view of the mortality from street accidents it is difficult to see why tests for pedestrians have not yet been introduced ! ) The most obvious weakness of most tests of this kind is that they assume that the meaning and significance of any particular stimulus will be the same for all examinees : they ignore the infinite complexity of the human mind . It would seem that more reliable results might be expected from the supplementation of such " objective , " " controlled " tests by a frankly " subjective " observation and interpretation of the examinee 's spontaneous comments and behaviour when faced with the performance of a number of simple tasks under conditions as normal as possible . Footnote  | An extremely interesting series of such experiments has been made by Mr. P. E. Vernon , of the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory.18 A dozen men and women were given a number of simple performance tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and door-handle mechanism from about nine component parts ; the arranging , into any pattern the subject chose , of a number of pieces of card , triangles , squares , etc. , of ten different colours ; the doing of a post-card size jigsaw puzzle , representing a landscape ; the piling on top of one another of fifteen irregularly and unevenly cut cubes of wood ; and a puzzle consisting of guiding a steel ball up an inclined plane , beset with obstacles and pitfalls , by means of a knitting needle . No one , we think , could read Mr. Vernon 's account of these tests without feeling that his inference is justified : namely that here ( and a fortiori in improved forms of such tests ) is a valid and reliable guide to the detection and measurement of such character-traits as the capacity for being interested , persistence , emotional instability , and degrees of introversion and extraversion . " I could guarantee , " says Mr. Vernon , by means of the first two tests mentioned above , and one other , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are predominant in any subject , without any introspection on his part or previous knowledge of him . " One of the subjects was a rowing man , of whose capacities Mr. Vernon knew nothing : " but I managed to deduce from all the tests that he was somewhat slow in the boat , but was very persistent , and not easily upset or hustled ; also that , socially , he got on very well in any boat that he was in : these deductions were entirely confirmed by subsequent enquiry . " Work of this kind is in its infancy . But no one can doubt Footnote  | that it will develop , and that improvements in such " applied " psychology will result in greater delicacy and accuracy of method and greater reliability of results . Its potential importance is enormous . The reader need only reflect on its bearing on the problem of vocation in many of its aspects in order to realise this.19 Having considered the general nature of temperament and of character , we now proceed to a somewhat closer analysis of their component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said . Instinct is innate ; the fundamental endowment with which every individual enters upon life . So much is indisputable , together with the fact that instincts are inherited , in varying degrees of strength , by different individuals.20 The problems and arguments arise when the further question is asked : are the organization and combination of instincts , to form the bases of sentiments , character and personality ( good or bad ) , also inherited ? We can not enter here upon the immensely complicated and debatable topic of mental heredity . But one or two points should be noted . In the first place , even the most enthusiastic champions of the influence of " nature " against that of " nurture " are less inclined to-day than they were half-a-century ago to interpret the workings of heredity as simply the mechanical " evolution , " in the sense of unrolling , of what is contained in the germ plasm from which any human being took his beginning . There is the fullest recognition , on the contrary , of the reality of novelty , individuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chip off the old Footnote  | block . Secondly , the whole question of the heritability of " acquired characteristics " is far from having been settled . The relative independence and seclusion of the reproductive cells from the rest of the body led to the doctrine ( associated with the name of Weissmann ) of the " continuity of the germ-plasm , " and thence to the view that the parents can hand on only what they themselves receive , nothing that happens to the rest of their bodies being able to affect the germ plasm of which they are , so to speak , the incorruptible trustees . But some recent experiments would seem to suggest the need of considerable modifications of this doctrine.21 The truth is , that far less is known about heredity than the popular mind supposes . Broadly speaking , it is of course true that like begets like , that neuropaths will breed children with neuropathic tendencies , and that the children of the mentally sound will be like their parents . But the Mendelian laws of inheritance are more complicated than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay ) suggest . On the whole , it is more important for two people contemplating matrimony to consider the character of the stock from which they come respectively ? and this involves as complete ( and as accurate and scientific ) a record as possible of their forbears ? than that of their parents . Finally , we must be on our guard against the fallacy of simply transferring to psychology ideas and expressions Footnote  | derived from biology . " There is an important point , " as Professor A. E. Taylor insists , " at which the analogy between biological and psychological heredity ' breaks down . On the biological side there is continuity of an unmistakable kind between the parent organism or organisms and the organism of the offspring . What becomes the organism of the offspring has been at one stage in its history an integral constituent part of the parent organism or organisms . Its history can be traced back to a stage at which the subject of the evolution is actually a part of its own ancestry . On the psychical side this condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any stage of its development , been a part of the mind of my parent or parents . . . . We can understand the notion of a continuity of germ-plasm ' ; to speak of a continuous psychoplasm ' would be to speak unintelligibly . . . . The appearance of a new psychical subject of experience is a fact which is and must remain inexplicable by any theory of development . " 22 ( 2 ) We have already alluded to the curious parallel afforded by current theories of the influence of the endocrine glands to the ancient " humeral " doctrine of the physiological basis of the four classical temperaments . These " glands of internal secretion " are so called to distinguish them from those glands ( such as the liver , the kidneys and the pancreas ) whose secretion is discharged , through openings in themselves , either to the surface of the body ( e.g. , the sweat glands ) or to the viscera ( e.g. , the salivary glands ) . The endocrines , on the other hand , are ductless ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their secretions ( " hormones " ) , very minute in quantity , are conveyed to other parts of the body by absorption into the blood . The adrenal , the thyroid , the pituitary and the thymus are the principal glands of this character . ( The last named , like the liver and the gonads or sex-glands , is a gland of external as well as internal secretion . ) Their importance for our present purpose is their influence on temperament and char-Footnote  | acter . Thus , to take the best-known example , a deficiency of thyroid is associated with dullness , apathy and a lack of vitality : cretinism is its extreme form . Conversely , extreme emotional instability may be due to over-secretion of the thyroid gland . Less certainly , excess of thymus secretion is connected , in adults , with abnormal development of the secondary sex characteristics ? in men , with slim waists and beardless cheeks ; in women , with small breasts and hair on the face ? hence it may be a predisposing factor in some cases of homosexuality . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances is sufficiently proved by the influence of drugs , notably of alcohol . As McDougall points out , " the introvert who takes successive doses of alcohol " ? the effect of which " is to produce a state of relative dissociation of the brain , from above downwards in the scale of functions " ? " is pushed by them towards the other end of the scale , and , with a sufficiently large dose , becomes markedly extravert . " Conversely , " the action of opium and such drugs is notoriously to induce day-dreaming , to throw the subject into the state in which he dreams rather than acts , and finds his waking dreams , his fantasies , more real than the life of action in the real world ; that is to say they push the subject towards the introvert end of the scale . " 23 The influence on temperament of such chemical substances as the secretions of the endocrine glands should , therefore , cause us no surprise . No shepherd of souls can ignore the practical certainty that in many cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors are concerned . On the other hand , our knowledge of these glands is extremely limited . Endocrinology is in its infancy : it certainly will not do all that some enthusiasts are claiming for it ? an American writer , for instance , who divides humanity into pituitary , Footnote  | thyroid , thymic personalities and so on , and can tell the reader to which group any figure in history belonged.24 ( 3 ) It was pointed out above that the characteristic neurosis of the extravert is hysteria , and that this always involves a greater or less degree of dissociation . The nature of the physiological concomitants of mental dissociation is a difficult and obscure problem , and we can do no more than mention it here . Dissociation would seem to be connected with a heightened resistance of the synapses , which are the junctions or weak points between the cells ( " neurones " ) of the nervous system : the passage of the nervous impulse is thus inhibited , with the result that the lowerlevel activities of the brain ( the instincts and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher brain-levels . Conversely , when there is no such resistance or blocking of the current at the synapses , the lower-level functions are controlled and inhibited by the higher levels . Introversion and extraversion , therefore , are on this view related to peculiarities of nervous equipment.25 So far , we have considered the part played by " nature " ? the given ? in the formation of temperament and character . The old controversy , " nature or nurture , " has lost most of Footnote  | its point . No doubt much is " given " ; much is beyond our control . But the whole tendency of modern psychology ? and of all the schools of psychology : here , if nowhere else , the Behaviourists and their bitterest opponents speak with one voice ? is to emphasize the immeasurable importance of environment , outside impressions , experience ; of what happens to the individual no less than ? many would say , incalculably more than ? what he brings with him . Illustrations of this will be found in plenty in Chapters IV and VI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental and other early influences . We need do no more than mention certain factors of obvious importance , such as over-crowding , vicious or brutal parents , absence of opportunities and facilities for play , and extreme poverty , involving undernourishment and a cramping material environment . Two points may be quoted from the discussion of these factors in Dr. Cyril Burt 's book , The Young Delinquent . As to the influence of poverty , Dr. Burt says roundly , basing his conclusion on very careful statistical records , that " over one-half of juvenile delinquency is found in homes that are poor or very poor " : 26 in London , the largest annual percentage of such delinquency occurs in a district which includes " the most densely populated parts , " where " the death rate is all but the highest ; and here , too , is one of the highest of the birth rates . " 27 Dr. Burt is careful to add that " only in three per cent . of the male delinquents " studied by him , " and in not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the prime contributory factor . . . . If the majority of delinquents are needy , the majority of the needy do not become delinquents. " 28 Nevertheless , " one delinquent in every ten comes from a family wretchedly poor ; lives in a home grossly over-packed at night ; and is destitute during the daytime of all means for rational occupation . " 29 The second point on which Dr. Burt 's opinion may be quoted is Footnote  | the influence of the step-mother in a poor home . " Whether she manifests the imputed prejudices of the legendary stepparent or not , the sense of such an anomalous relationship , even if but half-realized by the child , is bound to tinge and distort his developing outlook upon social relations as a whole . " 3U What constitutes the danger of such environmental factors as these is the mental disturbance and interior conflict which they may set up . Similar witness to the influence of such early conflict is borne by those schools of psychology broadly distinguishable as " analytical " ; those schools , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of an adult 's mental traits by exploration of his earliest experiences ? whether by means of the ordinary interview , of introspection , of psychoanalytical technique , or of hypnotism . The great names here are Freud , Jung and Adler . This is not the place to discuss the controversies to which their work has given rise . No doubt many of their conclusions will have to be revised in the light of further knowledge : indeed these men are , in the course of their own lifetime , beginning this work of revision themselves . But as to the fundamental soundness of their central tenets we can only here express , without attempting to justify , our profound conviction.31 One of these tenets is the immeasurable importance , in the formation of character and personality , of the child 's mental life . The child 's relationship to its parents , and especially to the parent of opposite sex , is of particular significance . It is plain that its first " love-object " is its mother ; that is to say , if the child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " heterosexual " : if a girl , " homosexual . " If , now , we consider the process Footnote  | of normal , healthy development , we shall see that its course is slightly different in a boy 's case from a girl 's . The normal boy passes , at about the age of seven or eight , from a stage at which his mother comprises all but the whole of his universe ( outside himself ) to one in which his father is the centre of interest , the standard and measure of all things : from a heterosexual stage , that is , to a homosexual . This lasts till he is ten or eleven , when a third stage , another homosexual one , is reached , and the boy begins to find his closest attachments and interests among his own fellows : he becomes a scout , or joins a " gang , " or goes to a preparatory school . This stage lasts until puberty is well advanced ; not until seventeen or later does he begin to take much serious notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the final and permanent heterosexual stage . The " emotional " development of the girl is clearly different , passing through two homosexual stages ( mother o ? to , fellows Io ? 15 ) and a period ( heterosexual ) when her father occupies the centre of her picture ( 15 ? 18 ) , to a final heterosexual stage.32 Now , what seems to happen in too many cases is that this development is arrested at some point , and that the child 's affective capacities ( or , as Freud would say , its " sexuality " ) are " fixated " on one or other of the parents . The most obvious illustration of this is the case of the " boy who can not grow up , " the mother 's darling who is very often not allowed to grow up , to pass on from the stage in which his mother is the dominating emotional , affective influence in his life.33 It is no good pretending that this is a palatable truth . But neither can there be the slightest doubt ? no priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that many failures of emotional readjustment in adult life are traceable to a " mother-fixation . " Footnote  | In cases within our experience , it has been a predisposing factor in masturbation and in homosexual behaviour , as well as in incapacity to choose a career , keep a job , or stand up to the knocks and blows of life . The matter is complicated by the fact that where such fixation occurs , repression inevitably occurs too . On the one hand , there is the " pull " of the mother , and of the son 's complete attachment to her and dependence on her ( often rationalized as " duty " ) : on the other , the " pull " of his own instinctive impulsion towards independence , curiosity , adventure , creativeness , and of the world of persons and things . That the causes of such " fixations " are sometimes obvious , almost inevitable and even excusable ? as when a mother and son are drawn together by the former 's neglectful , unfaithful or brutal husband , or by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which makes it seem natural that the son should assume his father 's duties of protection and devotion ? do not make them less undesirable . It is perhaps hardly necessary to stress the inadvisability both of over-demonstrative affection and of continual " repression . " The spoilt child is likely to form an altogether exaggerated notion of his own importance , which ( as he will incredulously discover ) is not shared by the outside world , and perhaps not by his brothers and sisters.34 Accustomed to his every whim and request being granted , or at least taken seriously , at home , he may come to take such submission as his right : at the least he will have learnt that he can always be sure of attention : he can be the centre of the stage . And this passion for the limelight may cling to him all his life . Open and unashamed , it may make him intolerably egoistical , obtuse and domineering : repressed , it may find disguised satisfaction in some form of exhibitionism , or as some kink or idiosyncrasy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : or it may lead to a " double " life in which his Footnote  | repressed sense of superiority expresses itself in dangerous , anti-social or even criminal ways . Adler 's theory of " organ-inferiority " may be mentioned in this connexion . In Adler 's view , the fundamental human impulse is the " will to power " or " masculine protest , " the determination to be at the top of the tree . The sexual impulse , so central in Freud 's thought , is in Adler 's only one variety of egoism . And he points out that a condition which , unless carefully controlled , presents obvious opportunities of being made to serve egoistical interests is that of physical inferiority ? sickness , malformation , or what not . Such a child may unconsciously find compensation for its weakness in the sense of power and domination to be obtained from the over-indulgence and inordinate affection of too sympathetic parents.35 The snubbed , ignored or bullied child , on the other hand , is exposed to even greater risks . He may be driven into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to find their satisfaction , it may be , in lying , petty thieving , masturbation , eavesdropping and unhealthy prying . Finally , the child 's place in the family may be an important factor in the formation of his character . An only child , the first child , the last child ? especially if , in the two latter cases , a long interval separates him from the child next to him in age ? runs an obvious risk of being spoilt ; though it is also true that " the child who comes second or later in the family , without being the last , may suffer and react just because another is indulged and he is not . " " Footnote  | A TEMPERAMENTAL condition as to the physical basis of which we are as yet wholly in the dark is the sexually inverted variety . It is of supreme importance , in any sane discussion of this subject , that we should disabuse our minds of certain popular fallacies : the more so , because they are shared by a large number of inverts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " perversion " on the one hand , and what has been called " bi-sexuality " on the other . The meaning of the former term is obvious ; it is bluntly described in Romans i , z7 : a pervert is , by any civilized ethical code , a grossly immoral person . Bi-sexuality may be thought of as the possession of a " homosexual impulse so weak that it is eclipsed by the presence of the heterosexual object " 37 : with this we are not here concerned.38 The true invert , by contrast , is one whose sexual feelings are evoked solely and exclusively by members of his own sex . That is the fundamental fact , and the one which normal people find so incredible ; that to the attractions of women and girls the male invert is completely unsusceptible . The thought of sexual relations with any woman is to some inverts as abhorrent and " unnatural " as the thought of such a relationship with any man would be to their normal brothers . We shall here confine ourselves to inversion in men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Footnote  | Havelock Ellis observes that " well-marked and fully developed cases are probably rarer in women , though a slighter degree may be more common . " 39 That there are such people is the first fact to be faced . But it has also to be recognized that the possession of the inverted temperament need not involve ? and in numerous cases does not involve ? conduct which in England ( and in some other , though not in all European , countries ) ? is punishable with penal servitude . At the present time there is in some quarters a deplorable tendency to be sentimental about inversion , even to glorify it . This is silly and unnecessary . We do not underrate the possibilities of " sublimation " : we may even allow that in some rare cases " the invert who is genuinely and ' passionately in love ' can , and does , rise to heights of heroic fidelity and devotion ; ... that this , like any other pure and self-sacrificing passion , incalculably exalts and ennobles the man who feels it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imagination . " 40 Nevertheless , the fundamental facts remain , that inversion is biologically useless , 41 and that , if some great names can be quoted as having belonged to the inverted temperament , 43 it is no less common among criminals , degenerates and neurotics.43 The case-histories given by Havelock Ellis hardly suggest that the world would be the richer for more inverts . We may rightly regret , then , much of the current cant on this subject . But we must be careful to avoid the Footnote  | other extreme , of supposing that inverts as a class are incapable of self-control . As Havelock Ellis ? a writer . with whose ethical judgments we are naturally not always in agreement ? remarks , after quoting a very pathetic confession by a man of obviously noble mind : " However painful the sufferer 's lot may be , it is not without its consolations , and he would be best advised to pursue , as cheerfully as may be , the path that he has already long marked out for himself ? that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The invert sometimes fails to realize that for no man with high moral ideals , however normal he may be , is the conduct of life easy , and that if the invert has to be satisfied with affection without passion , and to live a life of chastity , he is doing no more than thousands of normal men have done , voluntarily and contentedly . " 44 ( And , he might have added , thousands of normal women . ) The cause of inversion is a much-debated subject ; but we need here do no more than briefly indicate the principal current views . ( It will be remembered that we are throughout this section speaking , not of passing homosexual inclinations , to which many men ? perhaps the majority are or have at some periods of their life been liable ; but of inversion , the position represented by the man who has never known , and can not conceive himself as knowing even if , which is rarely the case , he desires to know ? " normal , " sexual feeling. ) 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizing the influence of " nature , " the other of " nurture . " Of the latter school the principal representatives are the psychoanalysts . Freud , as is well-known , regards inversion as the result of a " fixation " on the mother ( the " Oedipus-complex " ) , which prevents the patient being attracted by other women : his sexuality therefore finds an outlet by seeking members of his own sex . Adler , as Footnote  | we should expect , sees inversion as an expression of the " will to power " : the homosexual , " by excluding the conditions making for difficulties , succeeds in creating for himself a type of existence to which he is either quite adapted or which he can more easily follow than that of heterosexuality , which continually throws him into the current of life and brings him into relation with all the problems , demands and difficulties of social existence . " 46 Psychoanalytical literature produces abundant evidence that in some cases factors such as these do contribute to the situation . But the fact that many cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this school is inclined to under-estimate the hereditary element : and , where complete inversion ( as distinct from temporary homosexuality ) is in question , Havelock Ellis seems to sum up the available evidence when he says : " It may now be said to be recognized by all authorities , . even by Freud , who emphasizes a special psychological mechanism by which homosexuality may become established , that a congenital predisposition as well as an acquired tendency is necessary to constitute true inversion , apparent exceptions being too few to carry much weight . " 47 Footnote  | SIN AND MORAL DISEASE THE tendency of many psychologists to discard the notion of sin as a superstition , and to regard all forms of imperfect behaviour as so many varieties of " moral disease " and nothing more , is due to an inadequate understanding of the word " sin . " It is a Christian word . Or , if this is putting it too strongly ? and it is true that if we turn up the word Sin in the Sin ( Buddhist ) , Sin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sin ( Muslim ) , and others , as well as Sin ( Christian ) ? at least we must insist that the word as used by a Christian has , not merely a religious , but a Christian reference . It describes , to begin with , a universal condition of humanity ; the condition ( plainly not dependent on any theory of its origin ) of " fallen-ness . " And if we ask what . fallen-ness means , we shall find the best answer in S. Paul 's words , " All have sinned , and fall short of the glory of God . " ' It is not surprising that psychologists who do not thus interpret " imperfect behaviour " in themselves or in others should find unintelligible the language of those who do . The matter is further complicated by the deterministic tendency of much modern psychology . That Behaviourism is deterministic needs no demonstration . As to other authorities , the later writings of Freud represent an advance on his earlier ones in this respect , while " Jung and Adler , abandoning determinism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , a creative chaos , with hints of individual purpose here and there , but no intelligible goal or guiding principle in the whole . " ' But it must be recognized that the philosophical assumptions of most modern psychologists are poles apart from that faith in the possibility of a glorious liberty for the children of God which is fundamental to any Christian doctrine either of redemption or of sin . Such a faith clearly involves the belief , despite the fact that " the fixity of a large part of our nature ? nay of all but the whole of it ? is a moral and spiritual necessity , " 3 that the normal . man is capable of self-conscious purpose , and that to every isolated action he brings some element , however small , of real initiation and spontaneous choice : in short , that he is made in the image of that Creative Lover who rules the universe . There can be no reconciliation between this creed and that of the man who limits the potentialities of the human psyche to its capacity , rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is not the place to justify the former hypothesis.4 Psychologists , then , tend to avoid the word " sin . " " Moral Disease , " on the other hand , they universally recognize , and we have now to notice that this phrase covers three things , commonly confused , which should be distinguished . It may mean simply that condition recognized by the doctrine of original sin : so much of any man 's sinfulness ? so much of the extent to which he falls short of the glory of God ? as is due , not to any refusal to reach that glory for which he might be reckoned personally accountable , but to the fact that he is a member of a " fallen " race . Something is wrong and awry with man qua man . His " natural , " unregenerate relationship to God , as well as Footnote  | to his fellows , is other than at his best moments he knows it ought to be and is meant to be . This awryness ? this fundamental kink ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted from parent to offspring through biological and not merely through what is called social heredity. " 5 The term " moral disease " is often used , secondly , to describe , not this universal condition , but an inborn tendency to particular moral weaknesses . It must be said , however , that the theory of " moral degeneracy " ( associated with the name of Lombroso ) is to be regarded as not proven . There is no conclusive evidence for the inheritance of a defective moral sense unrelated to other defects of the mind . Dr. Burt quotes the striking testimony of the American psychologist , Dr. William Healy , who made an intensive study of a thousand juvenile delinquents . " When we began our work , " writes Dr. Healy , " there was no point on which we expected more data . We have been constantly on the look-out for a moral imbecile ? that is , a person intact in mental powers , but devoid of moral feelings . Many cases have been brought to us as such . We have not found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Burt points out , ' some investigators report very different conclusions . But after reviewing these , together with the statistics based upon his own enquiries , he concludes that the evidence adduced to support the theory of inherited moral degeneracy is better accounted for on other grounds . Footnote  | " As in physical disorders , so in moral ? contagion is too often mistaken for heredity . The only instances where the vices of the child stand in direct and apparently hereditary relation to the vices of the parent belong to specifically limited types ? such as sex-delinquency ( by far the most frequent ) , wandering , violent temper , and perhaps impulsive theft . Of these , every one may be accounted for by a single assumption ? by supposing that certain human instincts , which by their very definition are acknowledged to be inherited , may be inherited in differing degrees of natural strength . " What is inherited in the cases in question is " a vague and more general endowment , analogous to the congenital enfeeblement that may affect temperament , intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses to which in a restricted measure we are all more or less susceptible . Such weaknesses , when excessive , may favour a moral lapse in later life ; they in no way constitute an inexorable and fatal propulsion towards it . " e Finally , " moral disease " may describe certain acquired tendencies to vice : kleptomania , alcoholism , drug-addiction are obvious examples . It is in this sense that the term is used in such a passage as this of Dr. J. A. Hadfield 's : " The man who deliberately embezzles , gets drunk , gives way to his temper , gratifies his passions , is in a different category to the kleptomaniac , the alcoholic , or the victim of perverted sexual or angry passion . As the organic and nervous diseases have similar symptoms and yet arise from quite different causes , so moral disease and sin may give rise to very similar conduct ? stealing or lying ? yet their origin is as different as in the other case . Perhaps the simplest case for illustration is that of the drunkard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both simply drunks , ' and must both be punished . Yet the former may be drunk because of a depraved and brutish nature , whereas the latter may be drunk because of a nature so sensitive that it can not bear the assaults of life . . . . It will be recognized Footnote  | that a very large number of disorders at present considered sins really come under the category of moral disease . Indeed it is probable that most evil actions of everyday life ? vanities , aggressiveness , evil obsessive thoughts , persistent habits ? which are the despair of those who have them and those who treat them , are at least partially due to moral disease , and , if this is the case , our methods of treatment , whether on the religious and moral side , or on the legal , need very radical revision . " 9 We have , then , to recognize , as Dr. Hadfield implies , that in their respective spheres the psychotherapist and the minister of religion are dealing with mixed states . We never come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin or by moral disease in the last of the three senses distinguished above . On the other hand , there is an element of sin , over and above original sin , in all cases of acquired moral disease : the present condition of the alcoholic patient , for example , for which he can not be held wholly responsible , is complicated by the past occasions on which he drank ( perhaps to drown his sorrows , or to escape into oblivion from intolerable misery ) when he was responsible . We propose now to discuss in some detail one or two of these " mixed states . " But we shall do this from one point of view only . The conditions to be described would be recognized as sinful by any instructed Christian : we shall , however , for our present purpose , ignore so far as possible their moral and religious aspects , and confine ourselves to the psychological factors likely to be concerned in producing them . I. RECIDIVISM . This problem is discussed ( not very helpfully ) by Aristotle in the seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms by S. Paul in Romans vii . " Not what I would , that do I practise ; what I hate , that I do . . . . For the good which I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I practise . But if what I would Footnote  | not , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwelleth in me . " S. Augustine 's statement of the problem is as follows : " Whence is this monstrousness ? and to what end ? The mind commands the body , and it obeys instantly : the mind commands itself , and is resisted . The mind commands the hand to be moved ; and such readiness is there , that command is scarce distinct from obedience . Yet the mind is mind , the hand is body . The mind commands the mind , its own self , to will , and yet it doth not . Whence this monstrousness ? and to what end ? It commands itself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it willed , and what it commands is not done . But it willeth not entirely : therefore doth it not command entirely . For so far forth it commandeth , as it willeth ; and , so far forth is the thing commanded not done , as it willeth not . For the will cornmandeth that there be a will ; not another , but itself . But it doth not command entirely , therefore what it commandeth , is not . For were the will entire , it would not even command it to be , because it would already be . It is therefore no monstrousness partly to will , partly to nill , but a disease of the mind , that it doth not wholly rise , by truth upborne , borne down by custom . And therefore are there two wills , for that one of them is not entire : and what the one lacketh , the other hath . " 10 Every priest is familiar with this phenomenon in his dealings with penitents . Again and again a man falls into sins which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole soul detests . No : not with his whole soul ; that is the problem . S .. Paul said that it was " sin " in him ? to be distinguished , as it were , from his real self ? that produced the paradoxical result that " the evil which I would not , thatI do " : " if what I would not , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwelleth in me . " And this is part of the truth ; the recidivist , like the rest of us , is affected by " original sin , " that " inherited inferiority of will " which we have already discussed . But there is more to it than this . The recidivist 's will ? that is to say , the man himself ? is divided : Footnote  | the struggle is not between what he wants and what he does , but between what he wants with one part of him and what he wants with the rest of him . Circumstances are indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repents , in the presence of God , because ? with his whole soul ? he wants to : and he sins , in the presence of temptation , because ? with his whole soul ? he wants to . ( We are not in this chapter concerned with the problem of how to reinforce the weaker , God-ward side of his will ; nor are we discussing those types of recidivism ( e.g. , alcoholism ) in which the chief aetiological factors are to be found in physical and chemical degeneration of the organism ? physiological recidivism , as it may be called to distinguish it from psychological recidivism , in which the casual factors are chiefly mental . ) It is useful to distinguish between two types of psychological recidivism , the mild and the acute . In the latter case ? kleptomania is a good example ? the sinner is truly in bonds , as much as the physiological recidivist : he is powerless to escape by any efforts of his own , though his trouble is likely to respond ( and his spiritual adviser should know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , is not so bound . His trouble is that he is extremely suggestible : that is why he responds as readily to temptation as he does , at another moment , to circumstances evoking the idea of repentance . He does not seek temptation , but is powerless to resist it when it comes . His suggestibility accounts , further , for his mind being obsessed by the thought of his sin : this obsession , in turn , produces a fearful certainty that his sin has taken such a hold on him that he will never be able to overcome it , and that when next the temptation to it occurs he will , in spite of his previous prayers and good resolves , be helpless in its toils . A further distinction may usefully be drawn between recidivism which arises from evil habits and recidivism arising from wrong sentiments . In the former case , what is  | involved is an habitual , careless tendency to yield to the suggestions of environment in regard to a particular class of actions . Very often it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a man who , believing that gambling is wrong in principle , nevertheless succumbs to the annual temptation to take part in the Derby sweepstake organized in his office or club . " Sentiment-recidivism , " on the other hand ? especially when considered from the point of view of treatment ? presents , as we shall see in a later chapter , a more serious problem . It occurs when some evil thing has become a magnet to which an individual is irresistibly and invariably drawn . The " habitual " ' drunkard ( wrongly so called , if the distinction we here maintain is justified ) is a case in point . The difference between the two types is important . The " habit-recidivist , " though he succumbs in nine cases out of ten , succumbs because he does not trouble to resist ; not because , at the moment of temptation , he has not sufficient self-control to resist . The " sentiment-recidivist , " on the other hand , can not resist : he is the victim of " moral disease " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestibility is liability to dissociation . In the case of the recidivist , this means that his besetting sin , with all the impulses and desires connected with it , tends to form a watertight compartment functioning in practical separation from the rest of his personality . It is for this reason that the recidivist ( who is in most cases an extravert ) can generally , at the moment of temptation ; find excuses : he will convince himself , either that this particular thing is so unlike his real self that it is not his real self that is going to do it ; or that as he did not seek the temptation he can not be blamed for succumbing to it ; or that this is positively the last time that he will commit this sin ; or that it is foolish and dangerous to be fussily scrupulous . Indeed , it is certain that at the moment of committing the act the recidivist 's sense of the wrongness of the sin is at a very low level : this is true of the " mild type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extreme cases of recidivism are instances of alternating personality . There are men and women who , at more or less regular intervals , seem impelled to courses of action entirely out of harmony with their real character and desires . Thus , a man devoted to his wife and children , and normally living ( without any difficulty or unreality ) on terms of the deepest affection with them , may suffer from periodical and inexplicable " bouts , " during which he behaves brutally to his family and may even be troubled by impulses to murder them . Or a pious woman ( as in a case known to us ) may , at intervals lasting for a week or more , give herself up to promiscuous sexual relationships with any men she can seduce . Such cases bear an obvious resemblance to some of the classical cases of dual or multiple personality . These make a psychological study as fascinating as it is difficult.11 We quote one famous case . " Mary Reynolds , the daughter of a prominent Baptist , is said to have been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seems to have been naturally endowed with an uncommonly well-balanced organization , physical , mental and moral . ' She had , in short , displayed no peculiarities of a striking kind , but remained a somewhat commonplace , unadventurous girl , until , when eighteen years of age , she became subject to occasional attacks of fits . ' In the following year she one day took a book to read in a meadow and was found there insensible . These facts suffice to show that she was an hysterical subject , one liable to dissociative accidents . Three months after this episode , when she seemed to have nearly recovered her usual health , she continued one morning to lie abed in a profound sleep from which she could not be roused . She awakened spontaneously after some hours and then , as far as all acquired knowledge was concerned , her condition was precisely that of a new-born infant , ' except that she pronounced a few words . But she differed from an infant in this , that her faculty of acquiring knowledge was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote  | capable of dealing at once with the facts of existence . She therefore rapidly acquired a knowledge of the world . ' After five weeks in this condition , she woke again in her former state , knowing nothing of her life in the intervening five weeks . After a few weeks she again , after an unusually profound and prolonged sleep , woke in the second state and took up her second life and process of learning from the point at which the second state had disappeared . She continued for many years to alternate between these two states ; in each state she was amnesic for the events of the other state , but had normally a good memory for the events of previous periods of the same state ; that is to say there was reciprocal amnesia as between the alternating states . " If the two states had differed only in respect of their memories , it might seem inappropriate to describe the case as one of alternating personalities . But there was another great difference between them : namely a difference of character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , a somewhat commonplace person . In the secondary state she was extremely adventurous : she would take long rides alone through the forests , and was in many ways more lively and enterprising . The second state gradually increased in duration relatively to the first ; and towards the later part of a moderately long life , the primary state remained latent or absent . In this late period she sometimes seemed to have dim dreamlike memories of her life in the first state . And once , when in this second state , she dreamed of a sister who had died before the second state appeared : the sister so dreamed of was identified by her relatives from her description . " 12 Such cases are of different kinds . The one quoted is an instance of " reciprocal amnesia " : that is to say , neither phase remembers what happens in the other phase . In other cases there is amnesia of one phase for the other ( or others ) , but not of the latter for the former ; in a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same train of memory seems to serve both ( or all ) the dissociated elements . The most intelligible account of these extraordinary phenomena seems to us to be that of Professor McDougall . Footnote  | He suggests that the " master-sentiment , " the " sentiment of self-regard , " " undergoes actual disruption . Its two fundamental dispositions , that of self-assertion and that of submission , become divorced ; and each forms the nucleus of a partial , one-sided personality . . . . The hierarchy of sentiments , no longer held together in one system , becomes divided between the two partial personalities , and perhaps even the instinctive dispositions themselves , or some of them , go wholly over to one or the other side . " 13 2 . SCRUPULOSITY . This consists of grossly exaggerated anxiety about trifles : not infrequently it takes the form of acute perplexity as to whether this or that act or habit , which has a particular attraction for the subject , is or is not sinful . In extreme cases , this may be carried to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter upon any course of action , lest it may be sinful , or may become an occasion of sin . A few illustrations within the present writers ' experience may be given . An able undergraduate worked himself into such a pitch of uncertainty as to his " vocation " that for three years after leaving the University he could settle down to nothing whatever , being quite unable to make up his mind which ( if any ) of the various jobs that turned up was really God 's will for him . A young woman was haunted by the recollection of a sexual peccadillo at the age of twelve . A married man wished to make his confession daily , principally in order to discuss with his director the degree of sinfulness attaching to his conduct during the Footnote  | previous twenty-four hours . As this course did not approve itself to the priest concerned , the penitent wrote him daily letters of portentous length , all dealing with his scruples . The conscience of a youth of twenty-five became obsessed with the recollection of having cheated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught another how to do so : this suggested the question , whether or not it was his duty to start a raging , tearing campaign among his associates against card-playing . A common scruple among penitents is that of having concealed something in a previous confession , or of not having performed the penance given . Scruples are symptoms ; that is the thing to remember : and they are symptoms , in the vast majority of cases , which , once interpreted , reveal some repression . The " complex " repressed may be one of intense egoismi4 of a moral or spiritual kind : then the scruple will mean , " See what a saint I am , when such a trifle can trouble me so much . " Or it may be that some gross moral offence , driven from consciousness because the facing of it would be too painful , too obviously incompatible with the individual 's self-regarding sentiment , or with the estimation in which he is held by others , is hiding itself behind the scruple.15 In such a case the penitent may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the man referred to above , for example , could not say positively whether he had ever actually cheated at cards or not ; there were times when he was sure the recollection of having done so was a delusion . There is an obvious similarity between scruples and certain phobias , in which the patient suffers from intense fear in the presence of certain objects or situations : fear Footnote  | of open spaces ( agoraphobia ) or of closed spaces ( claustrophobia ) are typical examples . McDougall says of this class of phobias : " In each case the phobia clears up rapidly as soon as the patient has been led to recollect the original incident , and to understand its etiological significance . In each case there is a ground or motive for repression of the memory of the incident over and above the fear , a motive arising within the sentiment of self-regard , in accordance with the general law of repression , that is to say , the incident is of such a nature as to evoke in the subject self-reproach or shame or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phobia , in the special sense of the word illustrated by these cases , is not formed without this last factor ; that fear alone does not produce a phobia. " 16 The last point is of very great importance : it is borne out by cases within our experience . A typical phobia is quoted by McDougall : " A man of fifty-five years had suffered since early boyhood a fear of being seized from behind . When on the street he was impelled frequently to look back over his shoulder ; and , when indoors , he preferred to sit with his back against the wall . In his fifty-fifth year he returned to the home of his childhood , and incidentally paid a visit to the neighbour who had kept the same grocery store since the patient 's childhood . In the course of reminiscing the grocer said You used to go by this store on errands , and when you passed you often took a handful of peanuts from the stand in front . One day I saw you coming and hid behind a barrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peanuts I jumped out and grabbed you from behind . You screamed and fell fainting on the sidewalk . ' The incident , we are told , was then recollected by the patient , and the phobia , after a period of readjustment , disappeared . ' " 17 It is quite unnecessary to accept Freud 's pan-sexual theory of the aetiology of all phobias . But upon one kind of fear he has thrown considerable light : upon , namely , that Footnote  | not uncommon form of anxiety which is general , vague , " floating , " not requiring particular objects or situations to arouse it . It may express itself in various ways : in unreasonable fear of cancer , or consumption , or insanity ; in unwarranted nervousness about one 's business or profession or health ; in uncontrollable suspicions that one has left the engine of the car running , or forgotten to lock up for the night , or to post one 's letters . ( Such vague dread may or may not be accompanied by symptoms such as sweating , palpitations and breathlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very frequently the result of an accumulation of sexual tension the adequate discharge of which is frustrated . Coitus interruptus is one of the commonest causes.18 " Innumerable examples , " says Freud , " show that the anxiety-neurosis vanishes when the sexual malpractice is given up . " 19 3 . PATHOLOGICAL LYING . By this term is meant useless and senseless , apparently motiveless , lying . It occurs more often in children than in adults , and is particularly common in pubescent girls . It tends to be habitual rather than sporadic . It frequently takes the form of selfaccusation : when another person is accused , it is likely to be of some sexual misdemeanour ? more often than not , of interference with the liar herself . The most aggravated cases of pathological lying are those in which the subject is either of a definitely hysterical type , or abnormally introverted , his phantasies and day-dreams having reached such proportions that he has become incapable of distinguishing between fact and fancy . How far such self-deception can go may be illustrated by two cases within our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doubtless complicated by the woman concerned having recently suffered the loss of her Footnote  | husband ? a widow of thirty told completely unfounded stories of two married priests having attempted to kiss her : the charges were made " in the strictest confidence " to several people , all of whom knew the clergy in question . In the second case , a lady , on opening the door of her house , found her ( only ) domestic servant lying unconscious just inside . She rushed to the gate and fetched a policeman . Together they brought her round . Her first words were : " Where is the man ? He has gone upstairs ; he has got the coat . " On being asked who the man was , she described how she had been to the door and taken a visiting card from a caller , and then how a parcel of books had been brought by a young man . She had closed the door , and was carrying the parcel of books to the hall-stand , when she had been knocked over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her . After knocking her over , he had gone into a room on the left , at the foot of the stairs . He then went to the hall-stand and took a new overcoat from it . She picked herself up , and caught hold of the coat . They had a tussle with it ; she was knocked down again , and after this remembered nothing more . In due course detectives arrived , and the girl repeated her story . She was cross-questioned , and in reply she described the face of the man , and the clothes he was wearing . She was unable , however , to say why the visiting card was not crumpled , why the coat was still hanging on the stand with no signs of the conflict upon it , and why she herself was not bruised . The detectives finally came to the conclusion that the story could not possibly be a true one , which a priori it was unlikely to be , seeing that all these things were alleged to have happened in broad daylight . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day had been taken up by an examination of the case that she finally admitted , in response to the suggestion of the detectives and the doctor , that she must have imagined it all . It transpired that she had had  | hysterical fits before . The face she described turned out to be that of the person who had brought the books . There is no doubt at all , however , that she firmly believed that she was speaking the truth , until she had been made to see the inconsistencies in her story . Both these cases , it may be noted in passing , serve to indicate how completely such pathological liars have their victims at their mercy . There can be little doubt that many " clerical scandals " would turn out to be mere mare'snests , if the accusers were subjected to a competent psychological examination . Burt points out that subjects of this type are invariably endowed with " an over active imagination " and " an overflowing facility in the use of words . " 20 There are further considerations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been proved up to the hilt by modern psychological investigation that many children 's lies ( as well as petty dishonesty of other kinds ) are the outcome of thwarted sexual curiosity . The lie , or the theft , would seem to be a sort of compensation for unattainable knowledge.21 The second consideration is simple : it is that lies of this kind are nearly always expressions , more or less disguised , of desires which the conscious mind will not acknowledge . The " pathological " lies of adolescents , when they are not the outcome of repressed sex , betray a hidden conviction of the liars ' importance and superiority.22 In the case of young children we have to remember the difficulty under which they labour , some of them in a marked degree , of distinguishing , in a coldly critical and Footnote  | grown-up way , between real persons and things , and creatures of their own imagination . The present writers once knew a small boy in whose life " Michael 's friend " was a very " real " person indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb trees , trudge to the end of the garden , or mount the stairs into the attics ; for the friend 's hearing he would sing and tell stories ; to please the friend , he would be brave and fearless if he hurt himself ; in the friend 's company he knew no fear of the dark . Yet it would have been ridiculous to call Michael a pathological liar 123 4 . MASTURBATION . Modern discussions of this topic are a good example of the swing of the pendulum . Medical works of half-a-century ago devoted a special section to " masturbatory insanity " ; to-day a specialist in medical psychology can write that masturbation " is almost a normal phase of sexual development in adolescence , and that no physical or mental injury need accrue in the absence of great excess and the fears that may be implanted from outside sources . . . . Unless this practice is carried on to an inordinate degree and is prolonged into adult years , the term perversion ' is not scientifically applicable . " 24 The truth probably lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am there 's always Pooh , There 's always Pooh and Me , " What would I do ? " I said to Pooh , " If it was n't for you , " and Pooh said : " True , It is n't much fun for One , but Two Can stick together , " says Pooh , says he . " That 's bow it is , " says Pooh . ( A. A. Milne . ) Footnote  | extremes . We are not here concerned with the neurasthenic conditions which are the commonest consequences of " great excess " ; or with the moral and spiritual aspects of the vice ? though we may quote a psychologist of the first rank in virtual support of the Christian view that masturbation is essentially selfishness , and therefore is , precisely , a " perversion " of God-given powers , a defiance of the Divine will : " Physically , masturbation is self-stimulation of orgasm . Psychologically , it is incitement of genital sensations without the psychic accompaniment of love . " 25 The first factor to be taken account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concomitant of interior conflict . This conflict is the result of repression ? inevitable in a community that condemns solitary sexindulgence as strongly as the conventions of modern civilization do ; and it constitutes the real peril . It is possible , we suppose , that masturbation , practised in moderation , would be free from any observable ill effects whatever , mental or physical , in the case of a savage , or of a civilized person quite untroubled by conscientious scruples.25 But we are not dealing with either of these classes : and ninetenths of the danger of the habit in the case of a modern English youth or girl lies in the conflict generated by sexual desire , its furtive gratification , fear of detection ( some subjects convince themselves that " people guess " what is the matter with them ) , 27 and the pressure of remorse after each act of self-indulgence . A vicious circle is thus set up , and the unhappy victim passes through desire , struggle , gratification , remorse , to renewed desire and the Footnote  | repetition of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of two obsessions , both of them the outcome of repression . Either the patient is convinced that self-abuse is the sin against the Holy Ghost , " which hath never forgiveness " 28 : or he is sure that he is becoming , or is likely to become , insane ? a suspicion in which he is sedulously nursed by the authors of quack literature and the purveyors of quack medicines . No wonder that neurasthenia is often the result . The sheer force of the sexual impulse is , of course , the prime factor in solitary vice , which takes this form because its " normal " outlet is forbidden . But contributory factors are nearly always involved . We have known cases in which the habit was certainly a compensation for unpopularity , for lack of success at games , for a position in the family or in the community which the subject felt to be disproportionate to his real worth : in such cases the unconscious motive would seem to be self-assertiveness , a determination to utilise frustrated power . This is perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fourteen and fifteen masturbation may be hardly more than frank experimentation with new powers , though here again it is very often complicated by sex-knowledge acquired in undesirable ways . Among older people the habit will often be found to represent an unconscious regression to stages of development which ought to have been left behind . It may , for example , express the choked and perverted sex-impulses of a man suffering from an unconscious " mother-fixation , " which disables him from being emotionally attracted by other women.29 There is , as we have seen , an element of " disease " in Footnote  | all sin . That is why some knowledge of psychology is essential in pastoral work . In some cases it will be necessary to refer an individual to a psychologist for treatment . But it must be remembered that " the proclamation of forgiveness . . . is the first and greatest need of those who are involved in moral distress . " And that " psychology , for all its outward appearance of charity , knows no forgiveness. " 30 We may therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological plane ? on the subject of forgiveness . In psychoanalysis ? and to a less clearly-recognized extent in all psychotherapeutic treatment ? the factor on which success finally depends is that known as " positive transference , " the personal attitude of the patient to his physician . As a consequence of this attitude of confidence and affection , the patient is able to " transfer , " and so to get rid of , his burden of depression and conflict and fear . In the hands of an inexpert or unscrupulous analyst the transference is obviously capable of abuse : it should be his task to " resolve " it by getting the patient to recognize that the strong attachment which he is experiencing is abnormal and temporary , due to the fact that his emotions have now been released from the objects to which they were previously riveted ( in the neurotic state ) , and must , so to speak , find an immediate resting-place somewhere else : as the treatment proceeds , these emotions and attachments will find new and natural satisfactions in the activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of guilt , stain , sin . Psychologically speaking , the assurance of forgiveness comes when God Himself is the object of a transference , based ( as in analysis , though at a higher level ) on the sinner 's faith and love . No victim of moral disease ? of drug-addiction , for example , or uncontrollable impulses of cruelty , or sexual perversion ? will be easily persuaded that Footnote  | he is personally blameless ; and the less easily , as he has " the mind of Christ . " The " disease " elements in his troubled state will be " transferred " to whomsoever treats him psychologically . But the " sin " element remains ? till it is transferred to Him who alone knows the sinner and his sin as they really are , and still loves him , and who , at the supremest cost to Himself , has made forgiveness possible : not forgiveness understood as meaning that " it does n't matter , " but forgiveness which includes the fullest recognition of the utter hatefulness to God of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance of pardon and the promise of new power to overcome .  | PART IV PASTORAL METHODS  | INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT WE shall deal with the problem of individual treatment only along the lines of broad principles . To enter into detail a whole treatise would be required for this part of our subject alone . At the same time , it must be emphasized that we are concerned with the problem of individual treatment by the pastor . It is this which is so intensely important , and which , only too frequently , is far to seek . It must be firmly grasped that problems such as those raised by the recidivist or the masturbator , for example , will not be solved by the most assiduous attendance at a P.S.A . nor by " sitting under " the most eloquent of preachers regularly for years on end . It is only by skilled , individual treatment that anything will be accomplished in such cases . In other words , there is need in these matters of a true priestcraft , despite all that prejudice may have to say against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such cases may be handed over to " the modern substitute for the priest , " the psychotherapist . The best psychotherapists , indeed , fully recognize the limitations of their powers , and the need in their therapy of the compelling force of the Ideal fully and freely embraced . This force , as they well know , is something which they can not themselves supply . The whole raison d'etre of the pastor , however , is to provide it . But if the clergy are to rise to meet their responsibilities in this respect , they must be more than well-intentioned amateurs , and they must make a careful and scientific study of the problems of the soul . Ih some instances , it is to be  | hoped , they will have the time and the opportunity to become real experts in this matter , so as to be competent to deal with the more difficult cases , and even to carry out a thoroughgoing analysis . There is no objection to an expert priest undertaking these tasks , provided that he works in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough examination on the physical side . The majority of clergy , it is clear , will never be able to become experts in this sense . Nevertheless , they should have sufficient knowledge to be acquainted with the dangers of amateur analysis , on the one hand , and to recognize definitely pathological cases when they see them , on the other , so as to be able to pass them on to the expert for treatment . Unfortunately , there are almost as few facilities for access to an expert medical psychologist at the present time as there are for access to clergy who have skilled knowledge in these matters . It is to be hoped , however , that before another generation is past every town of considerable size in this country may have at least one expert medical psychotherapist , and one expert priest capable of handling cases of moral and spiritual disease , the number of which is far greater than those with no experience in these matters would suppose . Let the Church , at any rate , see that her share in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lags behind , as at present it is doing . Indeed , to judge by the almost negligible amount of attention which is given to psychological medicine in the six years ' course of training required of medical students , the outlook is far from hopeful in this direction . There are still dark clouds of prejudice to be dispersed . The day , however , will inevitably dawn , when psychological medicine will come to its own . That will be a proud day for the Church , if she has been the pioneer in this reform , and , perhaps , her work here will be regarded as an act of reparation for her somewhat reactionary influence upon the growth of scientific , non-psychological medicine .  | Our intention in the present chapter is to lay down some fundamental principles underlying the technique of individual treatment in the hope that many clergy ( especially young clergy ) may be given sufficient insight into the subject to assist them in dealing with the simpler cases which they meet , l and ( more important still ) may be stimulated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may gradually become worthy of the honourable title , physicians of souls . We have to consider three different sets of problems : Sin , Moral Disease , and Physical Disease , on its psychological side . For convenience we shall take these separately , though , of course , in practice they are often closely interconnected . Sin . We have seen in a previous chapter that sin consists essentially in a voluntary perversion on the part of the individual of one or more of the primary instincts , i.e. , in a direction of them to unworthy ends , with the resulting creation of evil sentiments . Descriptive psychology , as such , takes no account of sin , involving as it does moral and spiritual factors . Indeed , modern psychologists are inclined from their point of view to be impatient with it . It can undoubtedly be shown that some teaching about sin ( e.g. , crude teaching given to children about Hell fire ) is psychologically harmful and endangers the balance of the mind . But we may not on this account leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed outworn , " as some psychotherapists and others would have us do . There are one or two important considerations which have to be borne in mind in this connexion . First , the psychotherapist does not deal in his consulting room with sinners , as such ; he is concerned with them only as sick men and women . As Professor Grensted has said , Footnote  | the psychologist never has to deal with the open and wilful sinner , as such , and " it must be remembered that he only sees our failures and not the immense company of those whom ( our ) preaching has brought through shame to peace . " 2 Secondly , even psychotherapists require an ideal for successful therapy , and sin is essentially a rejection of the ideal . Their very science , therefore , runs up directly into theology . Our standpoint is precisely the double one which embraces not only psychology but theology as well . In other words , we are concerned with sin in its psychological aspect . Broadly speaking , there are two methods of dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments which we call sins . The first is the method of self-control . Repression is harmful , we are continually told . This is beyond question true , so long as we very carefully define repression in such a way as to distinguish it from selfcontrol . Popularly the word " repression " is used in such a loose way as to be practically indistinguishable from it . Such a confusion is most unfortunate . In order to make this distinction perfectly clear , we can not do better than cite the following quotation from Dr. McDougall : " Of all misinterpretations ( of Freud 's teaching ) , that of the dangers and evil consequences of repression ' is most widely accepted , just because it seems to give licence to unrestrained indulgence , to excuse us from all efforts at selfcontrol . And so we hear much nonsense about living out our nature , and about free self-expression and about our rights , and especially about women 's rights , to happiness and experience and what not ; and much scornful comment on old fashioned conventions and restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious psycho-analyst countenances the popular deductions to which I refer . They recognize rather that ( to put it in the epigrammatic form of one such psycho-analyst ) repression is civilization . Without repression in the wide and general sense of the word , without restraint , without self-control , without deliberate choice Footnote  | between good and evil , between the greater and the lesser good , without laws and without conventions , there can be nothing but chaos and savagery in the worst sense ... . Repression in the technical sense , the repression that undermines our self-control and threatens the integrity of our personality , is that which consists in disguising from ourselves the nature of our emotional stirrings and impulses. " 3 A firm grasp of this distinction is of great importance for the priest . He must endeavour to strengthen the power of self-control in the sinner , and on no account to say anything which may suggest that there is no need for it , and , still less , that there is any danger in it . It is , in fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts before us in his celebrated list.4 Perhaps the fact that it comes last is not altogether accidental , but may be taken to suggest that it is in some sense the crown of them all . The second method of treatment is that which is commonly known as sublimation , or , to use a better word , deflection . Although self-control is necessary , the great danger of repression must be avoided , and this can only be by means of a greater or lesser degree of deflection of instinctive energy from the sinful sentiment or sentiments into good sentiments . This truth has always been subconsciously divined by the great spiritual directors who have constantly asserted that sin can never be rooted out , but only crowded out . This principle found classical expression in the famous phrase of Dr. Chalmers , " the expulsive power of a new affection . " Ultimately , this is the only satisfactory method of dealing with sin . The instincts , as such , are good and not evil . Just as dirt has been described as matter in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdirected psychic energy . " Thus the old idea of sin as apap-ria , or missing the mark , finds a fresh application . The crucial problem , however , is , How is this deflection Footnote  | to be achieved ? The sinner can not by an act of " will " redirect his instinctive energy . We can not love or hate to order , even when we order ourselves . The sinner can not simply say to himself , I am going to deflect my psychic energy from S. , the evil sentiment ( which is the object of his attraction ) to G. , such and such a good object . Even if he wants to do so , he can not ; and the trouble is that only too often he does not want . What , then , is to be done ? A power external to himself is required , or , to vary the phrase of Chalmers , the redirective " power of a new affection . " It is the Christian 's belief that such a power exists in the Cross of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete self-oblation . " I , if I be lifted up , will draw all men unto me . " This is the essential psychological truth underlying the doctrine of justification by faith ; we are not concerned now to discuss the precise relation of it to sanctification . The point is that man has no power of himself to help himself . Yet we must not overlook the fact that there is danger of overemphasis here . The fire must indeed descend from above ; this fire , we would maintain , constitutes the essence of forgiveness . It is that fire of love which alone can save . We shall return to this later . Meanwhile we have to notice that the sinner must prepare the sacrifice and lay the wood in order before the fire from heaven can fall . Consequently , the task of the priest is two-fold . Not only has he the supreme function of mediating the divine fire in absolution , 5 but it is also his duty and privilege to help the penitent to prepare the sacrifice . This all-important task seems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must assist the sinner to tackle the question of the removal of occasions of sin . A full treatment of this problem will be found in any competent text-book of moral theology . It is , therefore , unnecessary to enter into a Footnote  | detailed discussion of it here . All that we are concerned to do now is to emphasize its psychological significance . There are four main types of occasions of sin , known respectively as free and necessary , proximate and remote . A " free " occasion of sin is a set of circumstances which conduces to sin , but which we are at liberty to abandon if we choose . A " necessary " occasion is constituted by similar circumstances to which we are tied . Psychology does not throw any further light on these , but it can do something to reveal the full significance of the other two varieties ? proximate and remote . A " proximate " occasion is one which almost inevitably causes us to fall ; a " remote " occasion is one which is , generally speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology , an occasion of sin is a stimulus to an evil sentiment , or to an evil habit . It is because no two individuals have exactly the same evil sentiments , or the same evil habits , that the same objective set of circumstances may be a proximate occasion , or stimulus , to one person , and remote to another . For example , in the case of a person who has a gambling sentiment , a racecourse is a proximate stimulus . But if a person has no such sentiment , it is a remote stimulus ; if he has a hate-sentiment for gambling , it is a still more remote stimulus . A knowledge of a person 's sentiments , therefore , is indispensable for obtaining a right estimate of what are for him occasions of sin . The most acute problem which arises in connexion with the removal of occasions of sin is how to advise a person who is faced by an occasion which is both proximate and necessary . For instance , such would be the case of a married man , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and who earned his living by working as a barman . To give up his job might mean starvation for his wife and family ; to remain , would be to run the appalling risk of becoming a hopeless drunkard . Can  | psychology give any assistance in advising such a person how to act , if it is inevitable that he should remain in the job ? The answer dictated by psychology would be something like this . Although the sin in this case is based on an evil sentiment , and is not merely a habit , the man should be urged to make a complete and sudden break . " Tapering off " is impossible in the case of sins arising from occasions which are both proximate and necessary . This is an exception to the general rule of dealing with sentiments as contrasted with habits.6 It should be pointed out to the man that his sentiment will gradually weaken if it is not stimulated by drink , and it will greatly assist him if he makes the resolution to abstain in the first instance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man should be shown the value of faith , and should be taught how to make acts of faith in God , to the effect that He will surely give him the victory . But , above all , he must be shown the great importance of stimulating his good sentiments , which in the case before us , are especially those of love for his wife and children . This brings us to the next element in the priest 's task in assisting the penitent . In the second place , the priest will seek to put before the sinner occasions of virtue . In some ways this is even more important , for whereas there are some occasions of sin which are " necessary " and therefore not removable , there are no circumstances whatever which exclude occasions of virtue , whereby the good sentiments of the penitent may be stimulated . And fortunately there are no sinners , however bad , who are without some good sentiments . The wise selection of such occasions of virtue is a task of first rate importance , demanding much skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein every priest must feel himself to be thrown back completely upon God . Even while he is listening to the penitent 's confession he Footnote  | will be pouring forth an unceasing petition for divine illumination . These occasions of virtue may be otherwise described as occasions of sublimation , whereby the fundamental energies of the penitent may be deflected from evil channels into good . The choice of such " occasions " plainly requires some knowledge of the main interests of the person concerned . In cases where the confession itself does not reveal them , the priest should , if necessary , not hesitate to elicit them by questioning . For without this knowledge ( however it may be obtained ) it is plainly impossible to give the right kind of counsel . Thirdly , and in close association with the foregoing , the priest will put before the penitent as persuasively as he can the Ideal , which is something with which even the agnostic psychotherapist can not dispense . Thus will be enkindled in the penitent 's heart an increasing desire for God . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inseparably bound up with devotion to the person who thus mediates the Ideal . In those cases in which there has been any degree of repression this is what is technically known as the " transference . " Freud , who first isolated and named this phenomenon , has sought to maintain that it is essentially a sexual relationship . The evidence , however , does not warrant this view , which is not generally accepted by other psychologists . A simple and adequate theory is to regard it merely as a species of suggestion . Such , for instance , is the opinion of Dr. William Brown.8 The transference comes into operation in proportion to the degree of sympathy and mutual understanding which exists between the penitent and the priest , who not without good reason is called " Father . " And it is here that the crucial task arises of " resolving " the transference , or , in other words , of directing the liberated emotion from the person of the pastor on to the Ideal , Footnote  | which , in the case of the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire should descend from heaven ; in other words , at this point the penitent is ready for absolution , the significance of which should be carefully explained to him . It is far from being generally understood , even among the devout . This is both the climax of forgiveness and also the culmination of the work of the true pastor on behalf of the sinner . In the English Church it is the task and privilege specially singled out for mention in the solemn words of ordination to the priesthood . It is , therefore , somewhat strange that there are so many Anglican priests who appear to exercise this privilege hardly at all . We are far from suggesting that pressure should be exercised almost indiscriminately on all and sundry sinners to make use of sacramental confession . On the contrary , we hold that such a method of procedure would tend to defeat its own object , and to bring the confessional into discredit anew . This would be particularly unfortunate at a time like the present , where there are signs on all sides that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one . Nevertheless , we do not deny that we hold strongly to the opinion that his means of grace is not yet known or used nearly as extensively as it ought to be by those who are fighting a l hard battle against sin . Consequently , we have not hesitated to imply in what follows that the priest will , as a matter of course , avail himself of the help which it brings to distressed sinners in the difficult cases which we discuss below , wherever recourse to it is wisely possible . Moreover , while we are truly thankful for the fact that the value of confession is being recognized widely by nearly all sections of the English Church to-day , it is a matter of regret that there is still a good deal of unwillingness to see its full significance . It is fashionable in some quarters to assert that " the benefit of absolution " is nothing more than a declaration of God 's forgiveness , and , further , that  | the priest , as God 's minister , in no wise acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to be gravely inadequate . The fact surely is that it is precisely because the priest is a judge , and is known by the penitent to be such , that the way is made open for the full benefit of absolution . By the act of confession the penitent , who , if he is contrite , is ex hypothesi in a state of some mental uncertainty , submits his problem to the confessor . If the latter proceeds to pronounce the words of absolution , he then knows that he is , in the judgment of the priest , in a fit state to benefit by it . Apart from this knowledge , it is clear that he would receive the benefit of absolution with a doubtful mind , and consequently without faith . Let anybody who is in the habit of making use of this means of grace look into his heart and see if this is not the case . Then there follows the grace of absolution , which , put into the language of psychology , surely amounts ( as we have seen ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it up to God , through the power of the Holy Spirit , who is " comfort , life and fire of love . This is a task beyond the power of mortal man . Indeed , even in the power of God , it is more often than not a gradual rather than a sudden process . Hence we would urge the need in the majority of cases for regular and continued confession . Psychology endorses very fully the truth of the old saying , " Confession is good for the soul , " although it may , from the nature of the case , know nothing about " the benefit of absolution. " 9 Before we pass on to the consideration of moral disease , there is need to mention one important warning , which modern psychology brings very clearly before us . The forgiveness of sin is not a way of escape . On the contrary , it consists in the holding fast to reality ; it is sin itself in Footnote  | all its forms which is an attempt to escape from the facts . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evade the truth in this respect , and in one way or another to confound the fact of forgiveness with the remission of the penalty . As is well known , this was the central abuse which roused the wrath of Luther in connexion with the sale of indulgences , which remitted the temporal penalty due to be paid in purgatory . Dr. Pullan has pointed out in his Bampton Lectures10 that essentially the same mistake was made in connexion with the Methodist revival , where salvation from Hell was purchased by a specific variety of emotional experience , named " conversion . " Indeed , it is not untrue to say that the average Protestant is no better and no worse than the average Catholic in that he has been more concerned to seek escape from the consequences of his sin , than from the sin itself . Psychology has exposed this fatal error from a new angle . It has revealed the innumerable evils which result from the attempt to run away from reality , leading as they do in the more serious cases to definite forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful to teach that forgiveness is not an escape from reality , but that , on the contrary , it involves an acceptance of the truth about both oneself and God , which ultimately leads on in J some form to that sternest of all realities , the Cross . In more senses than one this is the crux of the matter for the true appreciation of the meaning of forgiveness . Moral Disease . Here the pastor may well find himself out of his depth . Nevertheless , it is a large matter if he has enough knowledge to " spot " cases , so that he may pass them on to some expert for treatment . There are , however , many cases which a well-instructed priest should be able to handle himself ; and it is the more necessary that he should have as much knowledge on these matters as possible , since the number of available experts is at Footnote  | present lamentably few . We confine our attention to those abnormalities already discussed in Chapter VI and the Additional Note to Chapter V. RECIDIVISM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place your man . Hence , the value of distinguishing between different types of recidivist , as we have already done . The physiological recidivist is usually fairly easy to recognize , although there is some danger of confusing him with the acute psychological type . In the case of the physiological type , of which dipsomania and drug taking are obvious instances ? it must be remembered that the case is by no means hopeless . Expert medical aid should be sought , and the pastor himself should endeavour to keep in touch with the patient , since moral and spiritual factors play an important part in such cases . The acute psychological type may , at first sight , look like the physiological variety , but it is , in fact , fundamentally different , in that its cause and its continued existence are due to psychological factors : Kleptomania is a good instance . Here , again , expert medical aid must be sought . Since both these types are beyond the capacity of anyone but the expert , it is a matter of prime importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable priest should be able to help , and which we have called the " mild " psychological type , which is fortunately the commonest of the three . We , therefore , repeat what was said in Chapter VI , that the distinguishing mark is whether at the moment of committing the act the sinner recognizes it as sinful . If he does not , then it belongs to the mild type . We call it " mild , " not because it is comparatively harmless ( which unfortunately it is not ) because there is here more sin than moral disease , whereas in the other types there is more moral disease than sin . In dealing with such cases , as Prummer reminds us , the priest should be mindful of the old saying , Fortiter in re suaviter in modo.I " v  | This type of recidivism may be due primarily either to evil habits , or to evil sentiments . Since the method of treatment in the two cases is somewhat different , it is worth while for the priest to try to find out which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guidance as to how to answer this question , although , of course , he does not make use of the scientific distinction between habits and sentiments . He writes : " There is generally less malice in easy rapid acts , such as interior consent to thoughts of hatred or impurity , than in exterior acts , which for the most part require more deliberate acts of will . Again , among exterior acts , there is less malice in such as are the work of a moment , relapses into sins of the tongue , blasphemies , oaths , injurious words , than in those which take more time and allow a longer space for reflection ; such as drinking to intoxication , or using the hands for an unlawful purpose ; less malice in sinning alone than with another ; in being seduced than in seducing. " 12 A consideration of the nature of the particular instance , together with a little judicious questioning , will often serve to elucidate this rather important practical distinction . In what follows , we shall , for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given case under which heading the sinful acts fall , and accordingly we shall deal separately with the . treatment of those which are due primarily to evil habits and of those which are due to evil sentiments . First , those due to evil habits . Here the rules for the breaking of habits , as put forward many years ago by William James , 13 must be borne in mind . They may be summarized as follows : ( I ) The sinner must summon all possible aids on the side of the good , so as to make , if possible , a complete break with the past . Here the personal influence of the priest is an important factor , and should be Footnote  | used to reinforce the penitent 's will . ( a ) The sinner must be shown the danger of allowing a single exception to the resolution to break the bad habit . A single exception will undo the good gained by a long period of keeping straight just as a ball of string , which it has taken a long time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few seconds . ( 3 ) In severe cases , it may be necessary to adopt the " tapering off " policy , but whenever it seems to be possible the sinner should make a complete break . In this connexion it is worth while to observe that , if the penitent is an extravert , he will be able to stand more severe treatment without " crumpling up " than if he is an introvert ; but he is more likely to backslide . If he is an introvert , on the other hand , he is less likely to backslide , but severe treatment may cause him to lose heart altogether and to give up the struggle . Secondly , we come to recidivism due to evil sentiments . Here the trouble is obviously more deeply rooted , and consequently harder to tackle . In such cases , it is vitally important to recognize the danger of employing the methods for the breaking of bad habits . This may lead to grave disaster . What is to be done ? In the first place , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the penitent will be quick to discern , at any rate subconsciously . The pastor should never allow himself to give way to the very natural temptation to be impatient with such cases . He should remember that the mere fact that the penitent comes to him at all is of immense significance , and proves that there is at any rate a considerable part of him on the side of good . The significance of his coming should also be strongly emphasized to the penitent himself . It should be pointed out to him that it is a sign of the operation of grace in his heart , and an earnest of ultimate victory . Much may depend upon a wise adoption of this point of view . Further , the priest will impress upon the penitent in connexion with this that the conquest of his sin can be carried out only by the power of God , and that his  | aim must be not so much to try harder as to trust harder . The inherent drawback in " trying " as a method of combating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil to be overcome ; consequently , it throws the sinner into the arms of his evil imaginations , in accordance with the Law of Reversed Effort . Trust in God , on the other hand , enables him to forget about the sin in the sure and certain anticipation of what , by God 's grace , he is going to be . Thus is avoided the danger which S. Paul evidently had at the back of his mind when he contrasted works unfavorably with faith . He had " tried , " and he could testify to the inadequacy of the method from bitter experience . At every step the priest must give to the penitent the impression that he is quite confident of his ultimate victory . So much for the general treatment of such cases . In addition , there are certain detailed methods to be borne in mind . ( I ) In the case of recidivists , there is often great value in short period resolutions . Gaume cites the case14 of S. Bernard in dealing with a young man who had lapsed into habitual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three days , during which he was to abstain from the sin , in honour of the Three Divine Persons of the Trinity . The penitent returned without having fallen . Then he sent him away for another three days , and then for another three days . At the end of the third period , the young man having avoided his sin , Bernard gave him absolution . This method will often be found helpful . It is a valuable instance of the " tapering off " method . ( z ) There can be no doubt that in such cases confession immediately after a fall may be the right method of treatment . In this way , the back of the sinner is stiffened . Before such a method is adopted , however , the priest should feel fairly clear in his own mind that the sinner has a sufficiently strong desire to rid himself of the sin , and to put up a Footnote  | real fight ; otherwise , the last state of things may possibly be worse than the first , since repeated failure under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) Much assistance can often be given by teaching the penitent to acquire the art of anticipating temptation , so that he can " nip it in the bud , " before it has got hold of him . A little reflection will reveal the fact that enormously strong impulses can thus be strangled at birth , whereas if they had been allowed to grow they would have overpowered their victim.15 Many recidivists fail , because they have never realized this most important point . They are continually taken by surprise in their temptation . Forewarned in such cases is forearmed . SCRUPULOSITY . We have seen that scrupulosity is a form of morbidity akin to phobias . So those gifted with true insight divined even before the days of modern psychology . Thus Jeremy Taylor wrote : " Fear is the disease " 16 in such cases . And he shows a still greater degree of insight when he remarks that a scrupulous person is like a woman who is terrified of touching a frog , although she knows perfectly well that it can not harm her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifted speculations when we say that scrupulosity is due to repression of fear ? not fear in general , but fear of one 's reputation in some form . Hence the selfrighteousness of the scrupulous penitent , and his unwillingness to listen to his confessor . As Dr. Allers has put it , " At bottom it simply means , The confessor can say what he likes ; I am right . ' " 17 Now , since the root of this trouble lies in the lower or unconscious levels of the mind , a scruple can not always be dealt with satisfactorily in the confessional . In an extreme case , a careful exploration should be undertaken by an expert in psychotherapy . The confessor should tell the Footnote  | penitent this , and , if necessary , ask leave to make the necessary arrangements . So Prummer advises . " Si causa scrupulorum est pathologica qualitas corporalis , haec mediante bono et timorato medico eliminanda est. " 18 This treatment will consist ( in the words of a famous psychotherapist ) " in clearing up the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in frank discussion and treatment of the exaggerated ambition , and lastly , in isolating the patient 's self-love from hyper-anxiety tendencies . " 19 In milder cases , however , the pastor can deal with the case himself , either in the confessional or out of it ; preferably the former , for reasons which will appear in a moment . The first thing which the priest has to bear in mind is that the scrupulous invariably belong to the introvert type . Hence their need of very careful handling . Laxity is fatal , but , on the other hand , undue severity is almost as bad , since the penitent will become still further introverted as a result ; in addition , he will probably go off to some other adviser . Broadly speaking , the remedy is to reinforce the non-fear energies of the psyche against the phobia , always remembering that the latter is a symptom of unconscious egoism . Hence the need for complete obedience . Since this depends upon authority , there is , an obvious advantage in dealing with such cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Obedience to God and to the confessor ; this is what is required to strengthen by suggestion the forces which will resolve the conflict . That is why the priest should assert ( with kindness ) and not argue . He should emphasize the need for submission . In this way he undermines the unconscious egoism of the penitent . That egoism is deep seated in such cases is plain from the fact , to which Allers draws attention , that lack of love for one 's neighbour is never a source of scruple ! In the case of those who are Footnote  | scrupulous over evil thoughts , it will sometimes relieve the situation to point out to them ( what so many penitents fail to realize ) that temptation is not the same thing as sin . Thoughts , however bad , are not sin unless we consent to them . In this connexion they may be referred to the account of our Lord 's temptations in the Gospels , wherein it is clearly seen that He was tempted with evil thoughts , yet without sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some particular point . The generally scrupulous are in a somewhat different category . As we have said in a previous chapter , we may suspect the presence of sexual causes here.20 Such persons should be encouraged to act with faith . In all cases of scrupulosity alike , we should bear in mind the wise counsel of Jeremy Taylor : " This is the right course in the matter of a scruple ; proceed to action ! ' " Solvitur ambulando is a true saying in many of these cases . This is because action leads to extraversion , which is one of the fundamental needs of the scrupulous . PATHOLOGICAL LYING . It has been already pointed out that the root of this is imagination or " phantasy " in some form . Animals do not lie because ( so far as we can judge ) they can not harbour phantasies in the waking state . When lying is deliberate it is due to the conscious expression of phantasies ; when it is the unconscious expression of phantasies , we call it pathological . The most obvious symptom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end in view ; in other words , there does not appear to be an adequate motive for it . It has been already shown that in the order of development of the child 's mind the phantasy stage precedes the " reality " stage , when it learns to grasp the nature of facts as distinct from the creations of its own mind . The transition to this E0 Especially in the case of women . They should be recommended to consult a competent physician . Footnote  | stage usually takes place more or less gradually , beginning at about the age of seven . Lying , therefore , in a young child of eight or nine years may not be a very serious matter . False statements coming from such a child can , indeed , scarcely be said to be lies at all , if they lack the voluntas falsum enuntiandi . The same , to some extent , holds good with primitive , or savage , peoples , who are slow to distinguish between fact and phantasy . Dr. McDougall relates how he has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with animals , and that he began to think that all natives were appalling liars , until it suddenly dawned upon him that the distinction between fact and fancy had scarcely arisen in their minds . In the case of civilized peoples , however , particularly with those who have been influenced by the ethical traditions of Judaism and of Christianity , such lying in adults can only be described as pathological . Extreme cases come under the heading of what is known to psychologists as " regression . " That is to say , they are an unconscious return to an infantile state of mind , due to serious conflict owing either to some specific traumatic experience in the past or to a general lack of adjustment to outward circumstances . Cases of this kind can be handled only by the expert . In milder instances , however , the pastor can do much to help . He should bear in mind two broad principles in his treatment . First , lying of this description is due to introversion ; it is a retreat from reality . Secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of life , a refusal which is more or less unconscious , according to the precise degree of introversion . This refusal , generally speaking , may spring from one of two causes . On the one hand , it may be due primarily to fear . To quote Allers again , " The first real lie is born of fear , and is almost without exception a lie to escape punishment . " 22 The remedy here is to encourage the patient by Footnote  | means of suggestion ( in conversation and otherwise ) and to point him to the source of deliverance from all fear . Especially is such encouragement vitally important in dealing with a child . For , as Burt remarks , " children , like savages , feel that frankness and confidence are precious gifts , pledges of affection . . . . Veracity , therefore , is a thing to be wooed and courted , not a thing to be ordered and enforced . " 23 On the other hand , there is another cause of pathological lying , and that is excessive desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of power . It is most important to realize that successful lying is power on the cheap . In the case of lying of this description , much sterner treatment is demanded.24 The penitent must be firmly shown the complete selfishness of such forms of activity , and gradually be brought to see the Christian ideal of self-sacrifice in its attractiveness and beauty . Further , he must be shown the futility and delusiveness of such cheaply gained power . It must be pointed out to him that there are no short cuts to any power which is really worth having . In short , he must be taught that there is no lasting power but that of God , and he may be reminded of the ancient wisdom of Gamaliel that it is merely stupid to attempt to fight against Him . A further point to be remembered in dealing with such cases generally is that it is important to warn them of the danger of day-dreaming . This is a peril from which few of us are free , although a little of it is harmless enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to an undesirable extent , and it must , at all costs , be avoided by the type of persons we are at present considering . They Footnote  | should be warned straitly against it , and urged not to spend too much time alone . Advice should also be given them concerning the substitution of good thoughts for the vain wanderings of the imagination . Here is a grand opportunity for inculcating the value and necessity of ejaculatory prayer . MASTURBATION . This is one of the most obstinate and difficult of evils to overcome . In dealing with this extreme moral nuisance ( such seems to be the best way to describe it ) the mean must be steered between two extremes . On the one hand , the pastor must avoid giving the impression that it is a very grave sin indeed ; on the other , he must equally avoid the suggestion that it is really hopeless ( and unnecessary ) for the penitent to expect to overcome it . To adopt the first extreme causes one of the most serious complications which arise in connexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and conscience . Moreover , this conflict is still further increased when the offender is told ( what is admitted by all competent authorities to be false ) that he is damaging his health by a moderate indulgence in this evil practice . To adopt the other extreme , is merely to encourage the appalling tendency to recidivism which exists in connexion with this sin . It is of the first importance to realize that some persons ? either consciously or unconsciously ? take refuge behind this evil habit to excuse themselves from the necessity of making any attempt f to progress , whether morally or spiritually . Dr. Allers quotes a striking instance of this from his own experience . " In conversing with a girl of about eighteen , who had sought advice on account of recurrent sexual offences , I chanced to mention S. Theresa . The girl admitted that one could be saintly even in these days , but , for her , being saintly meant being a great saint . To my question , and if you could break yourself of your sexual habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blushingly answered , Yes . ' " 25 The essence of right treatment here is to grasp the value Footnote  | of complete self-knowledge in this matter . A right understanding of the situation is half the battle . The offender must be shown that masturbation is not specially wicked beyond other sins , and yet he must somehow be made to see that it is quite definitely wrong , not , however , because it is sexual , but because it is selfish.26 Until he does see this , there is no hope of victory . He must also be warned here against the subtle danger of rationalization . The masturbator only too easily deceives himself by thinking that indulgence in this vice is justified on the ground that it saves him from falling into graver sexual sin , or because it is necessary to relieve the sexual tension . The truth is that the result of this indulgence is merely to inflame the sexual desires still further , and to aggravate the trouble instead of relieving it . It does nothing really to relieve the tension , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relieved automatically by nature in sleep ; he need not trouble himself about that . The psychical tension ( which is the more serious ) , when it can not find its normal outlet in married love , can be permanently relieved only by sublimation . Masturbation ? at any rate in the case of a person living in a society which disapproves it ? can do nothing to relieve it ; on the contrary , it increases it . The situation is further complicated by reason of the fact that the masturbatory act is frequently accompanied by self-centred phantasies . It is owing to the presence of these phantasies that masturbation , from the psychological point of view , is harmful . They minister to the sinner 's egoism , conscious or unconscious , and they constitute a grave moral and spiritual peril . Until the sexual impulse which gives rise to them can be sublimated , the sin can not be conquered . The essence , therefore , of any really satisfactory treatment is to enable the penitent so to order his manner of life that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be achieved . Footnote  | Having explained on the foregoing lines the essential nature of this vice , the priest will then have to decide , if possible , whether the evil in any given case is based on a sentiment or merely on a habit . In order to settle this point , he will have to question the penitent as to whether he has any phantasies during the act . If he has strong phantasies , then it may be safely assumed to be a sentiment ; if he has not ( or , if they are weak and vague ) , then it is probably nothing more than a bad habit . In the former case the trouble is very obstinate , and difficult to tackle . It may be due to a definite homosexual perversion . We must leave the consideration of this possibility on one side , until we come to deal with the question of homosexuality . It may , however , arise from self-love , or auto-erotism , in the widest sense of the phrase . If this is so , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the penitent being brought to realize this , since no treatment is likely to be successful until the root cause is removed . A right self-knowledge in the matter , accompanied by wise advice as to the circumstances conducive to sublimation , however , should by the grace of God ultimately lead to victory . It will , nevertheless , often prove a long and a bitter struggle , and , where it can be obtained , help from an expert psychotherapist will be of great assistance.27 When this vice springs merely from a bad habit , contracted almost haphazard in childhood , 28 as it is in so many instances , it is much easier to handle . In this case , the priest should boldly recommend the adoption of the methods for the breaking of habits ? a policy which in the case of masturbation arising from a sentiment would probably fail disastrously . That is to say , he should insist upon a complete and sudden break with the past . Nevertheless , because this evil , even when hardly more than a bad habit , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the resolution to break the habit , in the first instance , for a limited period ( say a week or a month ) . At the end of this time , he should come back to the priest and renew his resolution for another similar period , and so on , gradually increasing the length of these periods , until the habit is finally broken . In this way , the strain will be greatly eased , and the penitent will be prevented from losing heart , should he by any mischance have a , relapse . In this last instance , the sinner will be able to make a fresh start without feeling utterly hopeless and disgraced , as he would have been likely to do if he had made and broken the resolution never to fall into the sin again . The priest will explain as carefully as he can to the penitent the great significance of not allowing a single exception , and he will cause him to appreciate the fact that every day he holds his own brings final victory steadily nearer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise circumstances under which this temptation usually assails the penitent , and he will give him detailed guidance as to how to act under these circumstances . As Healy says , " The temptation frequently centres about some association ; it occurs at the same hour , or in the same place . The old associations should be broken up as much as possible . " 29 There are three important principles to be observed in connexion with the giving of such guidance . First , there is the possibility ( to which reference has already been made ) of nipping the strongest tendencies in the bud , if they are tackled in time . The penitent must be clearly taught the significance of this , and shown the immense value of taking whatever steps may be necessary the very instant he perceives the temptation coming upon him . Secondly , it is often of great value , in dealing with this sin , as Jeremy Taylor pointed out , to run forth into the company of others . It thrives in solitude and is apt to diminish with society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of very great value here . Along such lines as these , then , the priest will give to the penitent detailed directions as to how to act in the face of temptation.30 It is hardly necessary to add that he will constantly warn him against making the mistake ( so fatally easy for an Englishman ) of trusting , almost unconsciously it may be , in his own power . Above all , he will encourage the sinner by pointing out to him that this temptation really affords him a great spiritual opportunity . He should be encouraged to regard it as a kind of test case . If he wins a victory here , not only will this particular vice have been destroyed in him , but he will also have made considerable spiritual progress . More important still , the way will be open for still greater progress in the days to come . It is often a very great encouragement to the penitent if he can thus view his temptation against a wider background . There is a rather serious danger that , by becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose all true sense of proportion . If , however , the priest handles the case in some such way as we have suggested , the penitent 's sexual desires ( which , however difficult to control , are , it is necessary to insist , not in themselves evil ) will find that higher satisfaction , which is known to psychologists as sublimation . SEXUAL INVERSION . In dealing with this very difficult matter the greatest care must be taken to distinguish between true inversion and " bisexuality . " It is usually possible to distinguish fairly easily between a bisexual and a genuine invert by finding out if the person concerned has ever felt the faintest stirrings of sexual desire in relation to the opposite sex . If so , then we may be sure that we are dealing with a case of bisexuality ; even if not , however , we must Footnote  | not jump to the conclusion that we have a case of true inversion . It is always possible that heterosexual tendencies may reveal themselves later , especially if we are dealing with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light upon this question is that there is some evidence to suggest that among men , a strong attraction towards young boys is a characteristic of bisexuals rather than of inverts . If it should turn out that the individual with whom the priest is dealing is a bisexual , the case is , on the whole , fairly straightforward . The penitent must understand his condition , and realize that it is one which he may hope to overcome , provided that he is honest with himself . The fatal mistake for him to make is to delude himself into thinking that his romantic attachments are nothing more than deep friendships . The priest must accordingly warn him against doing anything to stimulate his homosexual tendencies . In other words , he must urge him to avoid occasions of sin , and to seek what we have called " occasions of virtue , " especially by cultivating the society of the opposite sex . If he is really anxious to get rid of his weakness , then true enlightenment , together with the grace of God , will frequently make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be warned against trusting in his own power , for the saying , " Pride comes before a fall , " is pre-eminently true here , since the very tendency to homosexuality in such cases is a form of auto-eroticism . If , however , a case proves to be stubborn , the priest should urge the person concerned to have recourse to an expert and trustworthy psychotherapist . True inversion presents a very different problem . Here it is useless to recommend a person to seek association with the opposite sex ; still more so , to urge him to get married . The first requirement in the priest is that he should show the invert that he understands his case . At all costs he should not manifest any kind of horror or repulsion towards an  | invert . Such an attitude is both un-Christian and unscientific . The invert is no more responsible for his condition than if he had been born with a club foot . The horror which is popularly felt and even expressed against inverts is largely responsible for making them ( what , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads them to run amok , on the principle that one might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . The priest , therefore , will do his utmost to prevent the invert from thinking himself a moral degenerate or a " lonely victim of some obscure disorder . " What he needs most is sympathy . It should be carefully pointed out to him that there is nothing in his condition of which he need be ashamed , and , in fact , that , until and unless God wills him to be changed , it is his vocation to be an invert . He should be shown how his peculiar temperament affords him various opportunities of service which are denied to his more normal brethren . Inverts , it has been well said , occupy a position " in the middle of the road . " This gives them a special advantage as advisers , and it is perhaps the secret of their undoubted gift of friendship which leads others naturally to turn to them for help . If the invert be a man , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of many normally constituted women . For his real privation and trial is that he must cut the possibility of marriage out of his life ; and this is the case with many normal , heterosexual women . Secondly , the invert must be taught at all costs to be honest with himself , and not to blink the facts . The question at once arises , Is he to be given to understand that his case is incurable ? This is a point on which there is some difference of opinion . But nothing but good can come from consulting a skilled and trustworthy psychotherapist . Even if his inversion remains , he will gain a deeper understanding of himself , which will greatly ease his difficulties . In most cases , however , financial considera-  | tions will rule out this possibility . Under these circumstances , the priest will have to help him and to advise him as well as he can . Like others , the invert must avoid occasions of sin , and seek opportunities which will favour sublimation . For example , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent fellow ) undertake activities which bring him into touch with large numbers of males . There is safety in numbers here . In setting down the kind of advice which should be given by the priest to the invert , we can not do better than quote again the experience of one who is himself an invert , and who has , by the grace of God , evidently found his vocation therein . Let us begin with his negative advice : " Do n't commit to writing any admissions as to your inclinations ; do n't masquerade , on any occasion whatsoever , in women 's clothes , take female parts in theatrical performances , or use make-up ; do n't be too meticulous in the matter of your own clothes , or effect extremes in colour or cut ; do n't wear conspicuous rings , watches , cuff-links or other jewellery ; do n't allow your voice or intonation to display feminine inflection ? cultivate a masculine tone and method of expression ; do n't stand with your hand on your hip , or walk mincingly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every city ; do n't let it be noticed that you are bored by female society ; do n't persuade yourself into believing that love is the same thing as friendship ; do n't become involved in marked intimacies with men who are not of your own age or set ; do n't let your enthusiasm for particular male friends make you conspicuous in their eyes , or in the eyes of society ; do n't occupy yourself with work or pastimes which are distinctly feminine ; do n't , under any circumstances , compromise yourself by word or action with strangers . " 31 His positive advice is as follows : " Hold frank conversations with suitable persons , thereby avoiding mental repression ; encourage every symptom of sexual normalization ; cultivate self-esteem ; become deeply Footnote  | engrossed in a congenial occupation or hobby ; observe discretion and practise self-restraint . " 32 The same sort of advice , mutatis mutandis , may be given to women inverts , although their condition is never so dangerous ( for obvious physical reasons ) as that of men in like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily from one of three sides , the physical , the mental , and the spiritual . The medical man 's approach is predominantly physical , the mind-curer 's is predominantly mental , the pastor 's is predominantly spiritual . In none of these cases , of course , is one method of approach necessarily exclusive of the others . Of the three , however , the most inclusive is clearly the pastor 's , since , as a rule , the other two ignore the spiritual aspect , while he not only introduces it , but ( if he knows his business ) is not unmindful of the other two also . Broadly speaking , his method is to seek the health of the body via the health of the soul , as a by-product of the latter , and thus to make men " every whit whole . " There is a good deal of evidence to show that this is ultimately the only sound method of approach for the pastor to adopt . To aim directly at bodily health is to court failure , and to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , to take a parallel case , the only sound way of securing happiness in life is to obtain it as a byproduct . To aim directly at it is to miss it . Accordingly , the pastor must aim at nothing less than leading the patient to the knowledge and love of God , who is our first beginning and our last end . Even to seek the salvation of the soul is not sufficient . We can not here discuss the difficult theoretical question as to the relation between disease and evil . We take it for granted that the pastor is right in hoping and praying for Footnote  | the recovery of his sick folk , and that there is no Christian authority for the strange statement ( based on still stranger exegesis ) in the Prayer Book that God sends sickness . He clearly allows it , but we may not say that He sends it . Accordingly , we are right to pray directly and unhesitatingly for its removal . This point of view is unconsciously adopted by everybody who sends for a doctor when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if he is not sure that it is God 's will that he should recover , what right has he to send for the doctor , lest haply he should be fighting against God ? To be consistent , if we are justified in calling in the aid of a doctor , we are also right in invoking with faith the far greater aid of the Heavenly Physician . Nor , in many cases , is this best done by merely saying , " Thy will be done . " No doubt , if we understand what we are saying , this meets the case , but the phrase has quite the wrong associations in the average person 's mind . It has almost become tantamount to the adoption of the policy of " grinning and bearing it . " It can be rightly used only when it is firmly realized that we have no ground for saying that disease is the will of God , and when men have been brought to see that all the unpleasant associations which exist in their minds regarding the will of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , is to be the pastor 's method of working ? Whatever the solution of the ultimate philosophical problem , sin and disease are clearly not unconnected . For example , recovery is obviously retarded by such sins as anxiety , discontent , or anger . The first problem of the pastor , therefore , is to put the patient right with God . In other words , as we have said , he tackles the problem from the spiritual side . He must endeavour to point out to the sick person how these sins ( and , therefore , why not others ? ) prevent him from recovering . It is a complete error to suppose that the call to repentance is harmful to the physical  | condition of the patient . The reverse is true , although , of course , some tact and common sense are required of the pastor . Once the patient is right with God , the priest has firm ground on which to plant his feet . The greatest dangers which beset " spiritual healing " 33 are obviated . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of recovery in the mind of the patient . Where such hopes are raised , and recovery does not follow , bitterness and disillusionment arise in the minds of those who have had nothing in view beyond their recovery . But in the case of those who have put union with , and knowledge of , God first , and physical health second , there is no such danger . Even where the patient does not actually rise to such heights himself , if the priest has consistently put first things first , the danger is obviated . Secondly , an opposite danger is likely to arise where health is recovered . There is the danger that the patient will forget God , and that he will be no better than he was before the illness . Indeed , in such cases , he will be worse , for he will have wasted a great spiritual opportunity . In this connexion we must remember the old adage : " The devil was sick , the devil a saint would be ; The devil was well , the devil a saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directly or indirectly the outcome of the patient 's moral failure in any form , then the importance of this method of procedure is even more obvious . Clearly , no cure can take place until this has been rectified . It is necessary that the sick person should hear the words , " Thy sins be forgiven thee , " before he can hear the command " Arise and walk . " In the case of moral disease , we have already seen that the psychotherapist realizes the Footnote  | need for what he calls readjustment with reality , which , put into terms of religion , means reconciliation with God . It is too easily forgotten that this same readjustment is a vitally important factor in more specifically physical diseases . Here the true pastor , who knows his job , has his opportunity . We have seen the importance of what is called the transference in dealing with moral disease . If we adopt the broad meaning of the transference , by which it is regarded as a species of suggestion , then it clearly has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , there is need for faith . But there is a big danger here , as in the case of moral disease . Everything depends upon the quality of the faith . There is a widespread tendency to suppose that all that really matters is its quantity . Thus , for example , some say roundly that it does not matter in what a person believes ; whether it is the power of pink pills , or the power of Aesculapius , or the power of Christ , it is all one , so long as he has enough faith . This is a profound error . Everything depends ultimately upon the object of the faith , which in turn determines its quality . In order to avoid the dangers of mere suggestion , this faith must be in the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . It is a matter of great importance to realize this . The dangers of treatment by mere suggestion are very great . In some cases , it is quite easy to see this . For example , where the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve it by direct suggestion . But if the heart is diseased , the last state may well be worse than the first . The patient , supposing himself to be better , will make too big an effort , and will suddenly collapse . The same disastrous result can sometimes be seen in the treatment of mental disease by mere suggestion . Professor Grensted cites a memorable case . A certain doctor by repeated suggestion cured a patient of the conviction that he was a dog . The cure was reported triumphantly with the appended  | note , " Unfortunately he now believes that he is a water rat . " 34 It is supremely important to realize that even in those - instances in which the ill effects of crude suggestion are not obvious , as they are in the instances we have cited , they nevertheless exist . This is the case in the spiritual realm especially , where , in fact , they are never visible or immediately obvious . It is only when the patient 's faith , far removed from its cruder varieties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill results can arise . In other words , the faith required must be an understanding faith , which does not shirk reality nor fly into the realm of selfish phantasy . It must be a faith which is grounded upon God , who is unselfish love , and which therefore itself works by selfless love . Where the pastor has to deal with an urgent case , as for example , with pneumonia , clearly he has little time at his disposal , in which to give instruction along the foregoing lines ; he will have to adopt very different methods from those which are appropriate in chronic or long drawn out illnesses . He will have to act first , and then , if the patient recovers , attempt to supply most of the teaching afterwards in the convalescent period . It is the lingering illnesses , however , which give him his greatest opportunity . He should attempt to give a systematic course of instruction in his ministrations , and so gradually to arouse in the patient the right kind of faith , which is able to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting which consists in a more or less aimless piece of Bible reading and prayer , without any definite scheme of progress in his mind . In such cases , it is quite a good plan to work through the Apostles ' Creed , for example , taking a small piece at each visit , thus giving the sick person an opportunity to think over it in between times . In this kind of way he may Footnote  | well lead up to the laying on of hands , or to Holy Unction . There is no difficulty whatever as a rule about the employment of the laying on of hands . All that is necessary is to explain to the patient how our Lord went about healing the sick , wherever He could find faith ( and , after all , even the most ignorant as a rule know something of this ) and that His power is still the same to-day as it was then . At the same time , it will be evident from what has been already said , that the priest will be at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith . He will attempt to arouse in him the desire to be a better man , and not to regard the relief of his sickness as the most important consideration of all . In bringing him to this state of mind , he will , as we have already suggested , point out to him the intimate connexion between sin and disease , and thus lead him to repentance . Once the right standpoint has been reached by the patient , then the priest can say to him , " Now I can promise you that , if you ask in faith , you will either get back your bodily health or something better , i.e. , something which you yourself will recognize as the best . " Then may follow a solemn laying on of hands . In some cases , however , especially where the sick person is a devout communicant , the laying on of hands can take place at the first visit . And , in general , where the pastor takes care to give the right kind of instruction , not only to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular course of his teaching in Church , his task is far simpler . Difficult and onerous as is the work of sick visiting , it is made infinitely harder than it need be because the clergy so seldom give clear and direct teaching on these matters in the ordinary course of their preaching.35 There can be little doubt that some persons are possessed Footnote  | of a specific gift of " healing . " 36 When such lay their hands on the sick , recovery is more rapid , and sometimes spectacular . Whatever be the ultimate explanation of this gift , it should surely be used more widely than it is . Like any other gift , it must be consecrated to God ; otherwise , it may do harm instead of good . But there is nothing to be said for burying it in the ground , nor for being afraid to use it . Any priest may make use of the laying on of hands , and , in virtue of his office as the Church 's representative , he may rely upon the co-operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a specific natural gift of healing , use it for the glory of God may expect to see still greater works . Such priests need all the more to be on their guard against stirring up a false or shallow faith . Nevertheless , they have a very precious gift , which may be productive of immense spiritual results , if only they will use it aright . Finally , a brief word may be said about the anointing of the sick . This ancient and Biblical custom , if it is properly explained , will arouse no prejudice even in the most Protestant quarters , so far as the experience of the writers goes.37 But it must be carefully prepared for by repentance and confession in some form . The most satisfactory method is for absolution following upon a general confession to be given first , where the strength of the patient ( and his prejudices ) will allow . In that way there will be secured that right and living faith which will call down the fulness of the divine response.3s Footnote  | PREACHING THERE are probably some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit in the attempt to apply psychology to the question of preaching . It will be said that a man can either preach or he can not , and there is an end of the matter . Although it is undeniably true that preaching , like many other human activities , is in some sense a gift , nevertheless the application of psychology to it has a twofold value . In the first place , it enables us to understand more fully the reasons why certain kinds of preaching are effective and others are not . In the second place , it brings within the reach of the average preacher truths which hitherto have only half-consciously been divined even by those who have been giants in the art . In what respects , then , does psychology throw light upon the practice of preaching ? First of all , let us consider the method of preaching . There are two psychological factors which may profitably be considered in this connexion , namely , suggestion and instinct . It will be convenient to deal with them separately . It would probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has the task of conversion and the task of instruction . The former of these has always been recognized as containing emotional elements , but not so the latter . One of the important truths recently brought to light by psychology is the extent to which , even in what is usually considered a purelyintellettual process , such as teaching , there is a powerful working of emotional forces also .  | Let us , then , consider these two tasks in the light of what we have learnt from modern psychology about suggestion ; and first of all let us take conversion . This was one of the first religious experiences to be studied by psychologists , but they made the mistake of selecting their examples from a narrow circle of experience ( American Protestantism ) and this tended to give the impression that it was always of a sudden and strongly emotional variety . It is now recognized that , in point of fact , conversion is never , strictly speaking , sudden . It may appear to be sudden , or it may not , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working of forces in the unconscious . When it comes , if it is worthy of the name , it involves an orientation of the whole personality towards God . This is a matter in which the unconscious plays an important part ; and there is Biblical evidence which leads us to suppose that the sphere of the operation of the Holy Spirit is perhaps normally , and at any rate frequently , the unconscious.l In short , conversion is due to suggestion . The same thing is in a large measure true of instruction , though usually this is scarcely recognized . The commonly accepted idea is that man is a reasoning animal , whose opinions are formed purely as a result of rational processes . This conception psychology has exploded . Long before we learn to think for ourselves we are forming our opinions . We receive them by suggestion , on some sort of authority ; it may be that of our parents , or our schoolmasters , or some friend . Whatever be the precise nature of the authority , it is always there . Later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for his opinions , and so we begin to think for ourselves , but more often than not it is a thinking in chains ; our reason limps lamely behind our desires ; our opinions march boldly on in the strength , not of reason , but of the emotion under the influence of which they were first formed . To change the figure , Footnote  | reason is used not to arrive at the truth , but to bolster up opinions already formed on authority . This habit of using the reason as a slave of the emotions is called by psychologists rationalization , a process to which reference has been made in previous , chapters . It explains two things . First , it explains why it is that argument is only too often a waste of time . If our opponent 's opinions ( or our own ) do not change when the reasons for them have been shown to be wrong , this is because they are not based primarily upon reason but on emotion , so that they can never be undermined by intellectual forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his emotions ) is of the same opinion still . " Secondly , it explains why it is so hard to attain a state of intellectual honesty . For example , it is fatally easy when some new factor is presented to us in the course of an argument , to attempt to find reasons against it , on the spur of the moment , instead of taking time to weigh it as dispassionately as we can . Such a practice is simply a form of intellectual dishonesty , and one which is by no means rare in the history of theological controversy . In view of this there can be little doubt that emotion has a large part to play in the matter of instruction , as well as in that of conversion . In other words , suggestion plays its part in the former no less than in the latter . It is plainly very important , therefore , that the preacher should have knowledge of the conditions underlying successful suggestion , since both the work of converting and the work of instructing are largely achieved by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion . They are ( a ) authority , ( b ) definiteness , ( c ) environment . Let us consider them . ( a ) First of all , authority . It is important to bear in mind that authority is always emotionally founded even when it appears to be entirely reasonable . " Even in rational demonstration , " writes Dr. Thouless in his Introduction to the  | Psychology of Religion , " it seems probable that the conviction with which a proposition is received owes a great deal to suggestion over and above the influence of the perceived rigidity of its proof . " 2 That is why a name works such wonders , and also why the kind of preaching which constantly uses the phrase , " the Church says , " or some such expression , seldom produces conviction ; for , in England at any rate , the idea of the Church is not one charged with strong emotional authority in the mind of the average person . Nor , as a general rule , are people inclined to accept the authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more likely to be that of a personal kind , and this is plainly a matter of emotion . Thus arises a tremendous danger which becomes greater with the outward success of the priest . It is the danger of attracting the people to himself rather than to our Lord ; the final result of this is nearly always shipwreck of one kind or another . If he is to influence the opinions of the people to whom he ministers , there must pass from him to his hearers an emotional current which can bear on its bosom the various suggestions which he has to make . But unless this stream is that which flows from the side of the living Christ it can never really satisfy their souls . When we read of our Lord that " He spoke as one having authority and not as the Scribes , " the primary meaning of this , no doubt , is that He spoke from the depths of His own experience , whereas the Scribes ' religion was only second-hand . We may , however , perhaps divine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of our Lord there was an emotional contact between His hearers and Himself , based on the fact that He loved them , and that they knew intuitively that He loved them , while the Scribes , they felt , cared nothing for their souls . Hence they accepted His teaching readily , but the utterances of the Scribes left them cold and unmoved . What psychology has to teach us on the nature of Footnote  | authority , therefore , should give the preacher furiously to think . For , in the first place , if his authority is to be really effective , people must like him . Unless , however , he can lead them past himself to the living Christ , the last state of affairs will be worse than the first . This is not to deny that in certain cases where his hearers are instructed , and understand something of the authority of the Church as the Body of Christ , much of this danger will be obviated . Yet it is never far away even then , and he will do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority will impress the clergy with a grave sense of responsibility for what they teach . They will beware of being dogmatic without good reason , and of laying down the law on uncertain points . For if it should happen that they are " found out " subsequently by their hearers to have been teaching what will not stand the test of reason , their authority will be gone for ever ; or , failing this , their hearers will stand by them rather than by the truth , which will be more disastrous still . The writers recently heard an interesting example of the latter kind of process in the case of a man who for some time had been making use of a certain quack medicine . He imagined himself to have been very considerably benefited by it , with the result that he had conceived an almost passionate affection for it , and had come to " swear by it , " as the phrase is . When the time came for it to be exposed by the Daily Mail , he was furiously angry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up the Daily Mail ! ( b ) After authority , the next factor needed to make a successful suggestion is definiteness . It is essential that the preacher should be fully aware in his own mind as to what it is that he wishes to suggest . This may sound like a truism , but as applied to preaching , unfortunately , it is not . At the conclusion of not a few sermons , it would be difficult to improve upon the celebrated remark of the yokel , who , when asked what the sermon was about , replied : " Summat about summat . " It has been said  | that , unless one can put the main burden of a sermon on the back of a postage stamp , it is not likely to leave a permanent impression . There is much truth in this remark . This does not necessitate preaching in clear-cut formulae all the time . On the contrary , we may succeed better by a roundabout method , just as it is often wiser to make a flank , rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must never fail to be absolutely certain in his own mind as to the position which he desires to capture , i.e. , what the truth is which he wishes to impart . We may here remind ourselves of the story of the student who had just finished reading his first sermon to the Principal of his theological college . He was greeted by a prolonged silence , during which he became more and more uncomfortable . " It will do , wo n't it , Princeps ? " the unfortunate man finally blurted out . " Do what ? " came back the reply . Every preacher should stand to himself in loco principis in this matter . It is also well to remember that one of the essentials of suggestion is repetition : but in public speaking it must be repetition never recognized as such by the audience . This is a truth subconsciously divined by the greatest preachers . Nor should we forget that the unconscious mind ( to which we are addressing ourselves when we make suggestions ) thinks in picture language rather than by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , however , a curious phenomenon to be noticed in this connexion , and that is the way in which certain people revel in the obscure . Such persons seem to prefer not to understand a sermon . Thus , one Yorkshireman who was a market-gardener , and who thought himself somewhat of a connoisseur of sermons , commented on a sermon preached by a clergyman known to us by saying that he heard all he said , but it was worth " nowt " ; he understood it all . He went on to say that another parson not far off was " a real good preacher , and was a grammarian  | by the big words he used . " It was presumably the same standpoint which induced fifty men and women to take a course of lectures entitled , " Where dwells the I am . " We may quote the following sentence as a specimen of these lectures : " Through involution we are carried back to the nativity or primary life through material form , which is the first expression of love through earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher will do well to avoid this method of collecting a congregation ; vox et praeterea nihil . ( c ) The third factor we have to consider is what for lack of a better term we may call environment . It is a well-known fact that when psychologists are using hypnotic methods they make the patient fix his gaze on a candle-flame or on some bright object , the effect of which is to fatigue the conscious attention and so to allow the unconscious mind to become uppermost . A condition of light hypnosis midway between the waking state and that of complete hypnosis is called the hypnoidal state . The environment of the church is , therefore , a factor not to be disregarded in thinking of the suggestible power of preaching . Probably most preachers would agree that it is easier to preach in a church than in a drill-hall . This difference is due to the influence of surroundings upon suggestibility . In this connexion Dr. Thouless writes again : " I am convinced , too , that the unintended production of the hypnoidal state is present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly recognized by writers on the psychology of religion . . . . The prestige of the preacher is increased by the wearing of distinctive clothes . ... A monotonous voice in the reading of the service , the rhythmical sound of the music , and the points of light produced by lighted candles , " 4 all tell in the same direction . But , of course , he hastens to point out that he does not imply that this is the deliberate purpose underlying the use of these things . Nevertheless , Footnote  | psychologically there can be no doubt as to their effect . This same effect is to some extent attained in Protestant worship by vigorous hymn singing and by the peculiar methods of revivals . At this point it is necessary to say something on the subject of crowd psychology ; for one of the most striking characteristics of a crowd is its suggestibility . Now , psychologically speaking , not every concourse is a crowd . As Dr. McDougall has said , there is a huge concourse of people at the Mansion House in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean by a crowd . If , however , a fire-engine were to dash suddenly through the midst , the attention of all eyes would be for a moment fixed on it , and it would to that extent become a true crowd . The characteristics of a crowd , according to McDougall , are the following : ( I ) It must have a common object of mental activity ; ( z ) it must have a common feeling-tone in regard to it ; ( 3 ) it must have some degree of reciprocal influence between the members of the group . The reasons for the increased suggestibility of a crowd are largely obscure , but of the fact itself there can be no doubt . It has been supposed that it is to some extent at least due to the telepathic communication between the members composing the crowd . This may be the case , but what we know of telepathy suggests that it takes place only between persons who are in fairly close sympathy with each other . Another theory is that a crowd has a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation unsupported by any real evidence . McDougall inclines to the view that the characteristics of crowds are due to two things . First , in a crowd a person tends to lose a sense of his personality ; in a word , to be depersonalized . Secondly , and following closely upon this , he loses a sense of his responsibility , or , perhaps one should rather say , his critical faculty of independent judgment , and this makes him more open to the influence of suggestion . It is this lessening of  | the power of the critical faculty which explains what is also undoubtedly a fact , and that is that the mental capacity of a crowd is not high . That is why the orator must rely on simple intellectual processes . To quote McDougall again , " He must rely on abuse and ridicule of opponents , or unmeasured praise of friends ; on flattery ; on the argumentum ad hominem ; on induction by simple enumeration ; on obvious and superficial analogies ; on the evocation of vivid representative imagery , on confident assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . " 5 What McDougall has said applies with more literal accuracy , no doubt , to a political crowd than to a congregation in church , but much of what he says is true of the latter also . To what extent any particular congregation exhibits the qualities of a psychological crowd will naturally vary greatly . During missions and in crowded congregations generally , especially in the evening , it will tend to approximate very closely to it ? particularly perhaps when the folk are simple and untutored . Other congregations , such as a respectable Matins congregation , will hardly resemble it at all , and that is why it is so hard for the preacher to make an impression on such occasions . It is worth noting also in this connexion that the well-worn question as to whether sermons should be read or not can , in the light of psychology , be answered in only one way . Ceteris paribus , it is plain that they lose enormously by being read . For the power of suggestion necessitates for its operation a state of rapport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be maintained only by looking at the faces of the audience . A speaker of experience will in this way be able to " sense " the unconscious minds of his hearers and make his suggestions accordingly ; while , of course , they on their side will become far more suggestible by seeing his face turned full upon them . Reading must be almost brilliant ( to say nothing of the matter read ) to make good the loss of all this . Footnote  | Before leaving the subject of suggestion , there are two other things which are worth saying . The first is , that we need to recognise the existence of contra-suggestibility . This is the state of mind in which the hearer thinks or says the exact opposite of that which is put before him . He is what is called " contrary . " Some people adopt this as a permanent attitude to life , in which case it is due to some repression . But anyone may be brought into this state of mind once we have " put his back up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is necessary in preaching , or else nothing will be achieved . The difficulty is to steer a course between being too blunt in our suggestions and so producing this attitude in our hearers ' minds , and being too vague and nebulous to suggest anything definite at all . Thus it is mere waste of time to talk of " the ministry of reconciliation " to the average congregation and expect them to receive any suggestion in favour of sacramental confession . The capacity for striking this happy mean is what is usually called " tact . " A second thing to be said is that we have to bear in mind that the danger of relying too much on mere suggestion in preaching is that it tends to make the hearers more suggestible generally . In other words , their characters will be weakened and they will tend to receive the suggestions of whatever environment may happen to dominate them at any particular moment . That is why the preacher should always try to give his suggestions a good support of solid reason , which will stiffen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the faith . This was what Socrates meant when he distinguished between true knowledge , and " right opinions . " These , he said , are like the statues of Daedalus , which , though they are very beautiful and true , run away , unless they are fastened by the tie of causes. ? In other words , even true ideas are apt to have no permanence unless we know the reasons for them , and the most that suggestion can give is " right opinions . " An almost perfect instance of Footnote  | this is presented in a recent book , entitled Ex- Jesuit . The author was a Jesuit priest for some twenty years . In this book , which is auto-biographical , he shows how his religion grew out of attachment to his mother , who was a devout Roman Catholic . That is to say , it was based almost entirely on suggestion . Although Dr. Boyd Barrett , the writer , became a scholarly man , the real basis of his religion still remained emotional . The consequence was that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ceased even to call himself a Christian . Let us now turn to the other factor which we have set ourselves to consider under the method of preaching , namely , instinct . It will be remembered that on page 46 we named the following primary instincts : hunger ( food-seeking ) , flight ( fear ) , repulsion , curiosity , pugnacity , mating , parental , gregarious , acquisition , self-assertion , submission . We have seen that suggestion works through the unconscious , lower levels of the mind because it appeals to the primitive instincts . We have also said that our nature is emotional rather than intellectual . That is only another way of saying that our instincts guide us rather than our reason in the majority of cases . The importance of all this for preaching is that instinct determines interest . It goes without saying , we suppose , that sermons must be interesting . If they do not interest people , it is impossible that they should influence them . And normally they are interesting only when in some way they can touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a great fallacy to suppose that it is novelty which primarily determines interest . There are some preachers who are ever casting round for some novelty for their sermons in order to make them interesting . It is quite unnecessary . So long as instincts are touched , novelty can go by the board . In simple proof of this we may note the popularity of the cinema theatres where the majority of the films , to judge by the advertisements , are for ever  | harping on the sex instincts . That is only one example of a principle which is widespread in its operation . There is , of course , a kind of preaching which holds the interest by reason of its brilliant originality , but even here we shall find that its real appeal is due to its contact with the instinct of curiosity . It is , indeed , possible to arouse interest by appealing to men 's sentiments rather than to their instincts , but by comparison this is a less satisfactory method , and that for two reasons . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have the same instincts , whereas their sentiments differ widely ; and secondly , in appealing to instincts we are ipso facto appealing to the sentiments which are built upon them . This appeal to the fundamental instincts will not be made most effectively , it is hardly necessary to say , if the preacher as he begins the preparation of his sermon says to himself : " Next Sunday morning I propose to deal with the instinct of self-preservation , " and then proceeds to search for a text accordingly . He may rest assured that if he preaches the Gospel the text may be allowed to look after itself in this respect . But in outlining the method by which he is proposing to present his message he will do well to enquire how far it is calculated to arouse the fundamental instincts , and to modify his plan if it seems to fall short in that respect . It is worth while in passing to analyse the nature of boredom . Boredom is a state of mind in which we are unable to express ourselves . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seem to be passive spectators , as at the theatre , we must ourselves live through the incidents of the play if we are to enjoy it . We must " enter into it " as the phrase goes . A play in which we can not do that bores us . ' In psychological language , boredom means a damming up of libido or psychic energy ; and that is why sermons which are remote from Footnote  | the springs of our being are likely to bore us , because it is difficult for us to express ourselves through them . Whenever we hear the preacher echoing the feelings of our own hearts , we are able to express ourselves in and through his words , and then it is impossible for us to become bored.8 There is , however , in all this a great danger , namely that of sentimentality , a subject to which we had occasion to allude in Chapter I. We must , however , consider it now rather more in detail . In every normal and complete action , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , a cognitive element . We recognize some object before our eyes . Then there is an affective or emotional one . We feel either pleased or sorry , even if in only a very mild kind of way . Lastly , we proceed to the action which follows from the emotional play which has taken place in our minds round the object in question . What happens with sentimental persons is this : their emotion , instead of growing into an action , sprouts on its own and runs to seed . In other words , they substitute an excess of emotion in the place of action . Now , the more we indulge our emotions in this way concerning any particular object , the harder it becomes for us to act . To use a different figure , our libido or psychic energy gets shortcircuited on the emotional plane instead of issuing in useful action . When this happens , we have become sentimentalists , and such people find it very hard to act in a sensible way . This is the reason , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have been short-circuiting their sex emotions so persistently that they can never make up their minds to take a decisive step . The application of all this to preaching is surely obvious . and of great importance . There are certain persons who find much pleasure in listening to sermons , and who tell Footnote  | the preacher how much they " enjoy " his discourses , but he can not fail to notice that they do not apply them very much to their lives . What they have been doing is to substitute the enjoyment of sermons for the activity which they enjoin.9 This is , as a rule , a quite unconscious process , but it is most common . It should warn the clergyman against stirring up too much emotion in his preaching , unless he can see that it has very obvious channels of activity in which to express itself . In this connexion we can not forebear to quote an eloquent passage from William James : " Every time a resolve or a fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing a practical fruit is worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hinder future resolutions and emotions from taking the normal path of discharge . There is no more contemptible type of human character than that of the nerveless sentimentalist and dreamer , who spends his life in a weltering sea of sensibility and emotion , but who never does a manly concrete deed . Rousseau , inflaming all the mothers of France , by his eloquence , to follow Nature and nurse their babies themselves , while he sends his own children to the foundling hospital , is the classical example of what I mean . But everyone of us in his measure , whenever , after glowing for an abstractly formulated Good , he practically ignores some actual case , among the squalid other particulars ' of which that same Good lurks disguised , treads straight on Rousseau 's path . All Goods are disguised by the vulgarity of their concomitants , in this work-a-day world ; but woe to him who can only recognize them when he thinks them in their pure and abstract form 1 The habit of excessive novel-reading and theatre-going will produce true monsters in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictitious personages in the play , while her coachman is freezing to death on his seat outside , is the sort of thing that everywhere happens on a less glaring scale . Even the habit of excessive indulgence in music , for those who are neither performers themselves nor musically gifted enough to take it in a purely Footnote  | intellectual way , has probably a relaxing effect upon the character . One becomes filled with emotions which habitually pass without prompting to any deed , and so the inertly sentimental condition is kept up . The remedy would be , never to suffer one 's self to have an emotion at a concert , without expressing it afterwards in some active way . Let the expression be the least thing in the world ? speaking genially to one 's aunt , or giving up one 's seat in a horse-car , if nothing more heroic offers ? but let it not fail to take place . " 10 Sentimentality is surely one of the greatest hindrances with which we have to contend in the work of preaching . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meted out to the woman , whom Mr. S. C. Carpenter has truly called " a sentimental sermon taster , " when she came to our Lord after He had finished speaking and said , " Blessed is the womb which bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked . " To which comes back the prompt reply : " Yea , rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it . " Moreover , we need to realize that it is not only the people in the pews who are assailed by this danger . The preacher himself is not free from it . It is quite possible for him unconsciously to allow the emotion which he himself experiences in preaching to act as a substitute for the actions which he recommends . This is not an altogether uncommon occurrence . There are two practical methods which may be adopted as a remedy against the evils of sentimentalism . The first is to arrange for the Sunday evening service to be followed by a discussion based on the subject of the sermon . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is readily accessible . It is not necessary to enlarge upon the value of discussion here since this aspect of pastoral work falls under the subject matter of the next chapter . But we note it on account of its great value as a remedy against sentimentality . If the emotion and interest aroused by the sermon find an Footnote  | outlet in this manner , no small success has been achieved ; provided , of course , that the discussion is not merely argumentation . Another practical remedy against mere emotionalism is to follow up the sermon by prayers lasting for five or ten minutes at the most ? best conducted from the pulpit by the preacher himself . In this way some at least of the emotion aroused will be turned into the useful activity of prayer . For example , if the preacher has been discoursing upon some particular sin , he might follow it up by some prayers of self-examination upon it , and petitions for protection against it . Such prayers should , it is hardly necessary to say , be carefully prepared , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon . Again , a missionary sermon might suitably be followed by intercessions for missions . There is plainly a large and important field of spiritual activity here , and one which at present has hardly begun to be exploited . There are no sermon-subjects which can not be turned into prayers in this way . At least , if there are any , there ought not to be . Let us now turn from the method of preaching to its matter . We may remind ourselves once more of its twofold purpose of conversion and instruction . To take the latter first , the matter of our teaching will , of course , be the Faith once for all delivered to the saints . It is interesting to note , therefore , how this intertwines itself with the fundamental instincts . We begin with the mystery of the Incarnation , where the parental instinct is immediately stirred . The whole of our Lord 's hard and strenuous life , with His summons to follow Him , appeals to the instinct of pugnacity . Before the Cross we feel fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfassertion.1 ' In the Church and the Saints we touch the Footnote  | gregarious instinct : in the Holy Communion , hunger and thirst ; in the sacrament of Penance , both self-abasement and self-assertion in one . And yet , in spite of all this , it is quite possible to preach these great mysteries in such a way as to make them seem remote from those very instincts with which they are really so closely connected . Some preachers . treat them in as inhuman a way as if they were discoursing upon lepidoptera ! Above all , of course , we preach Christ , who is Representative Man , as well as Incarnate Son of God , and in Him all our human instincts find their ultimate and their only satisfaction . It is necessary , however , to remind ourselves once more that these fundamental instincts of our being to which such frequent reference has been made , are not only full of possibilities for good , but are also the cause of all our sin . It is easy to see , as Dr. Kirk has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital sins has its root in a primary instinct . Hunger and thirst are the source of gluttony ; pugnacity , of anger ; self-assertion , of pride ; sex , of lust ; acquisitiveness , of avarice ; while sloth ( &Kg8ia); is the sin which results from the damming up of the emotion of any instinct . Envy alone of the root sins can not be traced to any instinct , and yet it is not difficult to see how even this can be accounted for by a fairly simple combination of them . It is plain , therefore , that the appeal to them , though , as we have seen , it is inevitable if we are to arouse interest , is fraught with much danger . The right method of dealing with them is by means of sublimation . A certain amount of emotion will , of course , always find an outlet through the normal instinctive outlet , but in many cases there will not be much scope for this , because the conditions under which we live are so very different from those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived more or less simply in accordance with instinct . The work of education and development consists very largely just in this diverting Footnote  | of emotional force from a primitive outlet into one which , if we may use an ethical term in a psychological discussion , we may call " higher . " And this sublimation is precisely what we do obtain by a simple presentation of the Faith . It does not attempt to crush out instincts , but rather it leads them to find expression in a contemplation and following of the fullest and completest way of life that we know . In the light of this it is interesting to observe how our Lord in His teaching is constantly occupied in this process of sublimating primitive instincts . In fact , if we make an attempt to group His teaching round these same instincts , we get a by no means disproportionate conception of it . Thus , in response to the instinct of hunger , we have His intimate teaching about the Holy Communion . In response to gregariousness , there arises the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-assertion and selfabasement find their meeting-place in His teaching on forgiveness , and in the crucial paradox : " Whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for My sake the same shall save it . " 13 Pugnacity is called out by the appeal to follow Him at all costs . The two sex instincts ( the parental and the mating ) find their sublimation in His tremendous claim to supersede all family relationships . There is not much insistence on the instinct of acquisitiveness , but nevertheless He did allow for it , and He sums it up in the brief saying , " Where your treasure is there will your heart be also . " While , as for curiosity , one is impressed throughout by the reserve in His teaching , which we know stirred that instinct in the disciples . The same thing is true of his thought-provoking parables ( so different from those of the Rabbis ) : these provided Him with His favourite method of teaching . It would not , we think , be inaccurate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of the primary instincts does not Footnote  | leave out any vital element in it . In the most striking way He leads on from each of the primary instincts to Himself as the only ultimate source of satisfaction for it . He sublimates them all in His own Majestic Personality . There is one other kind of preaching concerning which we have so far said hardly anything , and that is the preaching of repentance . We have spoken of the nature of authority in connexion with conversion in general , but the question of the preaching of repentance is of such first-rate importance that it is worth while to deal with it separately . It is convenient to divide the unrepentant into two classes ; those who go regularly to church , and those who do not . To begin with the type of unrepentant sinner whom we find in our churches . We must all have wondered how it can be possible for people to be regular in their reception of the sacraments , and yet for their heart and will not really to be orientated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion to be a complex of habits rather than of sentiments . They are in fact hypocrites ; for we have already seen how great a mistake it is to suppose that hypocrisy is necessarily or even usually conscious . There are two ways in which psychology throws light on these persons . In the first place , sentimentality , of which we have already spoken at length , is often at work . It is possible to sentimentalize everything in religion , even the Holy Communion itself . In like manner , we may sentimentalize the Cross instead of bearing it . We put it up in our churches ; we hang crucifixes round our necks ; we make the sign of the cross on our bodies . In each of these cases we may be mere sentimentalists . This is the psychological reason for the real danger which exists in connexion with externals in religion . But there is another reason which helps to account for the presence of unrepentant sinners among the ranks of regular communicants . It is the principle known to psychologists  | as projection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a person is guilty of a certain failing or sin , there is always a tendency for him to " project " it upon other people , and having done so to condemn it roundly . By this means he obtains ( still unconsciously of course ) the cheap satisfaction of condemning his sins without condemning himself . This is the reason for the familiar fact that we always tend to be hardest on other people for the sins which are most glaring in ourselves.14 Our Lord was pointing to this truth when He said " Judge not that ye be not judged , " since by the judgments we habitually pass upon others we are really judging ourselves . If we consider certain individuals to be found in most congregations , we shall not fail to find one or both of these principles at work , and in any attempt to bring repentance home to these people the pastor should take careful note of them . In the case of unrepentant sinners outside the Church , there is always a possibility , nay more a likelihood , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is perhaps less chance of finding a habit of sentimentality in regard to religion . This means that , if during a mission we can get them into church , the appeal of the Cross , when it is made , is less likely to fail . Of what kind then ought the preaching of repentance to be ? It is admitted , of course , that it must ultimately be the work of the Holy Spirit , but the question the pastor has to face is whether he can best prepare for His working if his appeal is addressed chiefly to the emotions or to the intellect . The popularly received idea seems to be that it ought to be primarily emotional . But we have had occasion to notice the dangers connected with the stirring of emotion ; and there is a deeper psychological objection . Attempts to awaken a strongly emotional sense of guilt are an appeal to the more primitive and infantile elements in our nature , Footnote  | and may often weaken rather than strengthen the soul and hinder its progress towards true autonomy.15 It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of our Lord in this matter . There can be no doubt that the preaching of the former must have been what is commonly called " powerful . " We read that the whole city of Jerusalem , together with the whole countryside , went forth to hear him . Everyone accounted him as a. prophet . And yet the effect of his preaching , so far as we can judge , was for the most part transitory . In marked contrast with this was the method of our Lord . In every case He shunned crowds and emotional displays . His chief work He evidently believed to lie in the quiet education of the Twelve . But he was not unconscious that in His Divine Cross there would be a supreme emotional appeal . " I , if I be lifted up , will draw all men unto Me . " We may perhaps conclude from all this that there is a place for definitely emotional preaching of repentance , but there can be little doubt that from the point of view of psychology there is a great need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under these circumstances , with due observance of the right principles of successful teaching , we shall be gradually turning men 's hearts towards the truth without incurring the very real dangers of encouraging a sentimental habit of mind , or of provoking the reaction which is apt to follow upon emotional preaching . By the aid of the Holy Spirit we shall gradually bring men to repentance by leading them to Him in whom all the desires of our being find their ultimate satisfaction . There can be no doubt , however , that the sermon , like any other form of public speech , is gravely inadequate as a means of instruction , unless it is accompanied by other methods . There is a wealth of truth in the familiar story of the visiting preacher who delivered himself of an eloquent discourse to a country congregation on the proofs of the Footnote  | existence of God . At the close of the service , one of the churchwardens said to him , " That was a fine sermon , Mister , but for all you say I still believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meaning is unfortunately by no means a rare phenomenon . And even where there is some considerable measure of understanding , it frequently happens that the sermon is interpreted in flatly contradictory ways by different persons present . Professor E. J. Swift records an interesting example of this . A friend of his gave a lecture on mind-cures . The lecture was purely descriptive , giving the positions and beliefs of various schools of thought on the subject . At its close , a New Thought advocate , a metaphysical healer , and a Christian Scientist went to the platform to express their pleasure at finding the lecturer in their ranks . Yet , so far as he had expressed any opinion at all , his intention had been to show that suggestion was the common factor and operating cause in all mind-cures.18 The reason for this strange phenomenon is that we naturally tend to hear that which we desire to hear ; this desire , therefore , must be disciplined by serious study and thought . Our Lord was well aware of this when He said , " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in one respect " hearing " of sermons is likely to have an advantage over the " hearing " of lectures , and the " hearing " of discussions . There is perhaps less danger of the hearer being in an " unspiritual " frame of mind in Church than in a lecture-room , for we must not forget , as Professor A. E. Taylor has recently reminded us , that " it is as easy to hear or read unspiritually as it is to receive a sacrament unspiritually. " 17 Even accurate hearing , therefore , is not enough for the perception of spiritual truth . Footnote  | It is a necessary conclusion from the considerations which have been brought before us in this chapter that , if the clergy are to be effective in teaching the Faith , they must not rely solely upon their preaching , however good it may be ; they must supplement it by other methods . To some of these methods we now turn our attention in the next chapter .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
