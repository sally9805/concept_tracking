Momentous to every mistress in France last week was an unexpected decision by the country 's highest court , La Cour de Cassation . Its sprightly old men , who would be considered insipid and absurd if they did not keep their own quota of mistresses , found on their calendar in a single day three cases of the same type : a master has died in an accident , and his wife and children and mistress are seeking justice . The mistress produces to the court letters from her late master , rent receipts , paid grocery bills and other evidence establishing that she is by no means a " loose or promiscuous " woman as those terms are understood in France but an unswerving , faithful mistress . <P> Hitherto French courts have held that such an exemplary mistress , whether or not her master was also married , had a juridical right to share modestly with the relatives of her man in whatever is collected from the person to blame for the accident which killed him . Mistresses mourned , wives exulted in France this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day three mistresses try to prove themselves admirable , handed down the blanket decision that henceforth any woman upon the sudden death by accident of her man shall " have right to damages only if united to the victim by the legal bonds of matrimony.
