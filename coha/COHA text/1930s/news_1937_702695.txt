txt Letters to the Sports Editor ARE OUTFIELDERS OUT ? Big League Managers Come From Infield , Reader Claims To Sports Editor of The New York Times : After reading in THE TIMES about what became of some major league baseball players after their active days were over , I listed the present managers of the major league ball clubs as follows : NATIONAL LEAGUE New York Terry infielder Chicago Grimm .. infielder St. Louis Frisch infielder Pittsburgh Traynor infielder Boston .. infielder Cincinnati Dressen infielder Philadelphia ... WiIson catcher Brooklyn Grimes pitcher AMERICAN LEAGUE New York McCarthy .... infielder Chicago Dykes infielder I Washington . ... Harris infielder St. Louis . Hornsby infielder IBoston Cronin infielder Philadelphia ... Mack catcher Detroit Cochrane catcher Cleveland O'Neil catcher Glancing over this list you perhaps will be struck by the same thought that impels me to put this down on paper . Why are outfielders out of the running as far as managing a major league baseball club is concerned ? Is it because the infielders and catchers and pitchers know more inside baseball ? Is it because infield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or is it , as I believe it is , because infielders and catchers have that extra something that makes for good managers ? But why should that be predominantly so ? F. J. B. New York , N. Y. , June 28 , 1937 . Editorial Note : Outfielders are not barred as managers . Among the outfielders who became big league managers were Fred Clarke , Fielder Jones , Tris Speaker and Ty Cobb . There may be more in the next wave . Something New About a Crew To Sports Editor of The New York Times ; I believe I have started a new attraction in the sports world by choosing an all-star crew . Some of these selections probably will be debated by those who are better on the subject of rowing than I am . My all-star crew follows : I Bow , Schultz , Navy ; 2 , Day , Washington ; 3 , Geer , Yale ; 4 , Swift , Princeton ; 5 , Otis , Syracuse ; 6 , Rogers , Cornell ; 7 , Schutz , Yale ; stroke , Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. FARRELL . Old Greenwich , Conn. , June 28 , 1937 . Wants Full Records Kept To Spot Is Editor of The New York Times : In the interest of justice and fair play I believe the rules committee should legalize batting and fielding records in incomplete and tied baseball games . That is to say , if a game has run three and a half or four innings , or less , and is then called off because of rain , the fielding and batting records of those innings should count in the official averages . A striking illustration of the injustice of the present system is shown in the recently played second game of a double-header between Washington and Cleveland . In the second or third inning of that contest , with three men on bases , Outfielder Simmons of the Senators hit a home run and drove in four runs . A little later rain washed out the ball game and this batting feat went to waste as far as official recognition was concerned . The same thing applies to tied games , which , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as fielding or pitching averages are concerned . It might prove interesting to hear the n opinios of other fans on this subject . AL WINFIELD . New York , N. Y. , June 27 , 1937 : Editorial Note : The fans may be in favor of including such statistics , but the official ruling is that the records are based on the performances of the players in championship games , and a contest that does not go at least four and a half innings is not a championship game . The statistics of tie games ( five innings or more ) are included in the official averages . A MATTER OF TIMING Offers System by Which Close Finishes Can Be Figured To Sports Editor of The New York Times : There has been some comment on the timing of the mile race at Princeton 's invitation track meet . In this race the winner , San Romani , and the second man , Lash , both were timed at 4:07.2 . The third man , Cunningham , was timed at 4:07.4 . The argument has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race two or three yards behind the winner and have his time announced only two-tenths of a second slower than his conqueror . This was a reference to Cunningham . Cunningham Clocked Correctly The matter resolves itself into the question of approximately how fast a runner is moving or how much ground is covered by him in one second and in one-tenth of a second in the final stages of a mile race . It can be demonstrated that Cunningham could have been beaten by two or three yards and could be , and was , timed in but two-tenths of a second longer time . Take a sheet of white paper , start at the left-hand side and draw four equally spaced vertical lines , allowing the spaces between the lines to represent 25.4376 inches ( the average distance covered by Lash per one-tenth second ) , and label these lines , from left to right , 4:07.4 , 4:07.3 , 4:07.2 and 4:07.1 . Marks Show Position Then with a cross mark indicate the probable positions of the runners , and you will see that Cunningham could easily have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space or a total of 76.3128 inches ( 2.119 yards ) back of the winner and still be but twotenths of a second longer time . There are many more details which might be brought into this sort of discussion , but they are sufficient to fill not only a letter but a very long letter , indeed . THOMAS F. LENNON . New York , N. Y. , June 29 , 1937 . Editorial Note : The Princeton timers were experienced veterans who could have stood on their records for accuracy but this mathematical demonstration " for the groundlings " doubtless will be appreciated by them . Idea for Adoption To Sports Editor of The New York Times : A former New Yorker , I am now transplanted in California and have been here almost long enough to qualify as a " native son . " While in New York I never saw much track , having watched football , baseball and basketball . During my years in the East I witnessed some very fine football games . But none of these could compare with the gridiron battles I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years the University of Southern California has set aside a section for public season ticket holders , and we are assured of a good seat for every game . A few years ago the public season ticket holders formed an organization known as " The Trojaneers . " At present Harold Lloyd , the movie actor , is our president . As a result of all this we manage to keep right up to date with college life . HOWARD A. YOUNG . Los Angeles , Calif. , June 21 , 1937 . Speedster Slowed Down To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Referring to John Kieran 's column in THE TIMES in which he queried about Lord Howe participating in the Vanderbilt Cup race , I want to state that Earl Howe wo n't compete at the Roosevelt Raceway because he busted a hip hitting a wall  --  I think it was in Tripoli . He 's ' president of the British Race Drivers Club and had much to do with developing the efficient ERA ( not Emergency Relief Administration , but English Racing Association ) cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , June 30 , 1937 . IN THIS CORNER -- Critic Disagrees With Statement of How Louis Can Be Beaten To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Ivo De Capet 's letter in THE TIMES struck me as very foolish in parts . He said that , according to the records , Negro boxers are weak in the solar plexus . He also said that Louis can be beaten by such a punch . Well , for that matter , any human being can be knocked breathless by that blow , because the solar plexus is the most important part of the nervous system . It is sometimes called the abdominal brain . He said , too , that Louis is easy to hit with a right-hand blow , but I e.ay that all fighters can be hit and any punch may be the knockout wallop . Louis is as accurate as any other fighter and remember , the other man is not a statue . Mr. De Capet states that white fighters are weak around the head . That is as absurd as his remark that colored fighters are vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still is in an early stage in his career . I think he will ' eliminate his faults as he goes along . As for a man to beat Louis , let 's take a look at the record : Corbett , boxer , beat Sullivan , puncher ; Fitzsimmons outboxed Corbett ; Johnson , boxer , beat Jeffries , puncher ; Tunney , boxer , twice beat Dempsey , puncher . Louis , who is a natural puncher , rapidly is becoming a masterful boxer . As for the fight experts , let us call them by their right name ? sports writers . ERIC . New York , N. Y. , June 28 , 1937 . Editorial Note : Fitzsimmons outboxed Corbett ! This belated report of the proceedings at Carson City will cause many of those who saw the bout to throw up their hands in horror .  - -  And in This One To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Ivo De Capet has my idea exactly as to how to stop Joe Louis . Joe is pretty free with those lefts to the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and hard hitter could duck under and let him have it with a right in his ribs . I do n't think Joe can " take it " very well . P. B. JOHNSON . Springfield , Ohio , June 29 , 1937 . Editorial Note : This may bs another way to defeat Joe Louis , but the one time Louis lost a professional fight was when Max Schmeling knocked him out with repeated blows to the head . Likes Schmeling Best To Sports Edito , of The New York Times : The comments made by John Kieran in THE TIMES in his column about the Braddock-Louis fight were , to me , a great laugh . In the first place , how can Louis be champion when he was knocked out by Schmeling ? Schmeling , in my opinion , is the one heavyweight who is a champion . And if I were he I would make Louis and his managers wait forever before they got me into a ring . Braddock , according to some newspaper observers , was going to slaughter the Brown Bomber , socalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first round . Where do they get that title , Heavyweight Champion of the World ? Perhaps you know and can enlighten me . Mr. Braddock , according to his record , lost twentyone bouts , which is more than any other prizefighter lost who aspired to the championship . Yet Mr. Kieran makes fun of Messrs . Doyle , Harvey and Foord by suggesting that they go in a group against Louis . Well , why not include Braddock in that outfit ? We certainly have nothing to brag about when it comes to the heavyweight competition , and I still insist that the German is the best man in the bunch . ED W. BENSE . Elmira , N. Y. , June 27 , 1937.
