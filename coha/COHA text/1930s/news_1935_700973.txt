txt Speaking as Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh 's lawyer , friend and adviser , Colonel Henry Breckinridge , former Assistant Secretary of War , gave Dr. John F. Condon , the " Jafsie " of the ransom negotiations , a clean bill of health in court here this afternoon . He testified on the seventh day of the trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann for the murder of the Lindbergh baby . Dr. Condon , completing his testimony early in the afternoon , stood up under a long and rigorous crossexamination without breaking down or changing his story in its , essential points . He repelled all ihsinuations in questions of defense counsel apparently designed to lay the groundwork for an effort later on to connect him with the kidnapping as a " master mind " of a conspiracy between an underworld gang and servants in the Lindbergh and Morrow households . Hauptmann Writing in Evidence . Late in the afternoon the State introduced samples of Hauptmann 's handwriting in evidence , including his applications for automobile drivers ' and owners ' licenses for several years , and specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York last September , containing words that had been used in the ransom notes . The ransom notes are already in evidence , and the State will produce handwriting experts tomorrow in its effort to prove that Hauptmann and the writer of the ransom notes were the same person . Colonel Breckinridge , a tall , thin man with gray hair , a high forehead , black eyebrows , a tanned complexion and a loud , clear voice , testified that he was responsible , as Colonel Lindbergh 's adviser , for the entire conduct of the ransom negotiations . He asserted that everything done by Dr. Condon and by Al Reich , his ex-pugilist friend , was carried out in accordance with his ( Colonel Breckinridge 's ) suggestions and with his approval . The witness disclosed that he had lived in Dr. Condon 's house in the Bronx from March 10 , 1932 , the day after the educator received his first letter from the kidnapper , until May 12 , the day the baby 's body was found . During that period , he declared , he directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper advertisements whereby communication with the kidnapper was maintained , and was present when the doctor received the various letters from the kidnapper , including . the package containing the baby 's sleeping suit . Authorized Condon 's Acts . Colonel Breckinridge said that he had authorized all Dr. Condon 's movements in connection with the two trips on which Dr. Condon made contact with the kidnapper , including the night of April 2 , when he paid the ransom money in a Bronx cemetery . In all cases , the witness added , Dr. Condon followed his suggestions closely . The witness corroborated Dr. Condon 's statement that the reason the money was taken to the Condon house the afternoon of April 2 , some hours before the note arrived designating the route to follow to make the ransom payment , was that a previous note from the kidnapper had directed that the money be made ready , and that he ( Colo- nel Breckinridge ) had caused the publication of a newspaper advertisement , signed " Jafsie , " on that same Saturday , saying that thie order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged Colonel Lindbergh not to pay the ransom until the baby was returned , and that neither Dr. Condon nor his friend Reich had ever asked for or received any money for the time and energy they spent in trying to recover the child . Everything that Reich , as well as Dr. Condon , did , the witness added , was with his consent . Attorney General David T. Wilentz introduced this testimony to offset the attack made by Edward J. Reilly , chief defense counsel , upon Dr. Condon in his long crossexamination yesterday and today . Keeping the 74-year-old schoolmaster on the stand for two and onehalf hours this morning , after yesterday 's two-hour cross-examination , Mr. Reilly tried to show that Dr. Condon himself had guilty knowledge of the kidnapping . He sought to show that Dr. Condon knew the symbol signature on the ransom notes before he opened the first letter which he received containing it and before it was published in the newspapers , and that he told various persons early in the case that he knew that a gang of four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Reilly confronted Dr. Condon with a woman witness for the defense , Mrs. Hermione Koeran of Astoria , and caused Dr. Condon to admit from the witness stand that she and a Mrs. Bush of Flemington had called at his Bronx home in March , 1932 , after he was publicly known as the " Jafsie " of the ransom negotiations , and had discussed the case with him . Dr. Condon admitted that he had given two letters to Mrs. Bush , but denied telling her that they were in the kidnapper 's handwriting . He said that he could not recall telling her that there were four kidnappers , but would not say that he had not told her that . The letters were admitted in evidence after Mr. Reilly announced that he intended to call Mrs. Koeran to testify to her recollection of the conVersation with Dr. Condon . Under further cross-examination , Dr. Condon said that he could not recall telling his neighbors at City Island , where he has a " shack , " that the kidnapping was done by a gang of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidnappers . He did not recall telling a New York newspaperman that the baby 's body . had been moved from the place where it was killed to the hillside four and one-half miles from the Lindbergh home where it was found . Shown Picture of Fisch . Shown a picture of the late Isidor Fisch , who died in Germany after the kidnapping , and from whom Hauptmann told the police he obtained the $15,000 ransom bills found in his garage , Dr. Condon said that he could not recall ever having seen him . He denied that Fisch was the man to whom he paid the ransom . Dr. Condon admitted that he did not take the names of any witnesses or the number of the bus or bus driver , or of the date , on the occasion when , according to his testimony yesterday , he was riding on a bus in the Bronx last August , the month before Hauptmann 's arrest , and saw Hauptmann walking in the street . The defense attorney also caused Dr. Condon to admit that he did not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in which the $50,000 was handed to the kidnapper . On re-direct examination , Attorney General Wilentz caused Dr. Condon to swear that he never saw the symbol signature used on the ransom notes until the night of March 9 , 1932 , when he received a letter from the kidnapper in answer to an offer by Dr. Condon , published in The Bronx Home News the previous day , to act as go-between for Colonel Lindbergh and the kidnapper . Dr. Condon said that It was an error when he testified yesterday that he did not open the first letter he received containing the symbol until after he had taken it to Colonel Lindbergh 's home at Hopewell early the morning of March 10 . He cleared this point up by saying that after he telephoned to Colonel Lindbergh he had received a note purporting to be from the kidnapper , with an enclosure addressed to the Colonel . He was told to open the enclosure and read it over the telephone . When he did so , and described the identifying symbol which appeared as its signature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Johnson . The witness also testified that he erred yesterday when he said that he knew the night of the kidnapping that Henry ( Red ) Johnson , former deckhand on Thomas W. Lamont 's yacht , now in Norway and once a suspect in the case , had telephoned to Miss Betty Gow , the Lindbergh 's nursemaid , at Hopewell that night . He explained that he had meant to say that he knew at a later date , after the information became publicly known , that Johnson had telephoned to Miss Gow that particular night . Dr. Condon explained for the Attorney General that the reason he did not bring about Hauptmann 's arrest last August , when he saw him in the Bronx , was that the bus driver did not stop promptly when he asked him to do so , and that when he did stop , Hauptmann had disappeared in some woods near by . He asserted that he reported seeing the man , whom he then knew only as John , . to the authorities , but that this information was never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave the name of the wood carver who made the money box to the authorities in 1932 , but could not recall it now . Dr. Condon denied that he had told anybody that the child 's body had been removed from another place to the spot where it was found . A discrepancy appeared between the testimony of Dr. Condon and that of Colonel Breckinridge as to whether one or two notes accompanied the baby 's sleeping suit which was mailed to the Condon home during the ' ransom negotiations . Colonel Breckinridge testified that he saw only one letter , while Dr. Condon insisted there were two . Dr. Condon 's testimony on this point was supported by his daughter , Mrs , Myra Hacker of West Englewood , wife of Ralph Hacker , an architect . An attractive young woman with brown hair , fair complexion and soft voice . she said that there were two notes , to the best of her recollection . All three witnesses agreed , however , that no matter whether one or two notes were contained in the package with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Lindbergh when he arrived at the Condon home two hours after its receipt . Colonel Lindbergh may be recalled to the stand to clear this up . Mr. Reilly showed a picture of Fisch to Mrs. Hacker and asked whether she could identify it as that of the messenger who delivered the note at the Condon house on the night of April 2 , directing Dr. Condon to proceed with the ransom money to an appointed place in the Bronx . She described the man as 5 feet 6 or 7 , very dark , and-very slim , and said she had given his description to the authorities at the time . Colonel Breckinridge and Mrs. Hacker admitted that nothing was done to apprehend the messenger . When Mr. Reilly demanded of Colonel Breckinridge whether he did not know it was his duty as a lawyer to help capture a man who might be able to give some clue leading to the arrest of the kidnappers , he replied that he felt that he was serving a higher duty in trying to help the Lindberghs recover their child . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and that both Colonel Breckinridge and Dr. Condon followed Colonel Lindbergh 's orders , which were to concentrate on the safe recovery of the child rather than on the arrest . of the kidnapper . When Dr. Condon was recalled to the stand at the opening of court this morning , he looked tired as a result of his five-hour examination yesterday . At the end of his testimony this afternoon his face , which was smooth and unlined yesterday morning , appeared drawn with fatigue , which also showed in his voice and carriage . All told , he had been on the witness stand eight hours , of which about five hours were consumed by Mr. Reilly 's relentless cross-examination . Condon More Reserved . Dr. Condon testified , as on his first day on the- stand , somewhat in the manner of a school teacher or lecturer addressing his classroom or audience , but he was not nearly so garrulous as yesterday . Then he had rambled on after answering almost every question , giving extraneous ' information which included his own philosophical observations on life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various processes and methods . Today be cut his answers short a large part of the time , simply answering the question and then stopping abruptly . Once in a while , however , he slipped back into his customary loquacious delivery . He would be running along nicely , giving short answers , when suddenly he would plainly show that he wanted to say something more but was holding himself in check . He would continue to display this air until finally some question would break the darn and a flood of words ensue . Mr. Reilly , evidently eager for the witness to talk in as garralbus a manner as possible in the hope that the result would be to tangle himself up and minimize his value as a witness in the eyes of the jury , let the witness proceed without trying to stop him , but the Attorney General always stepped in with a warning to the witness to content himself with answering the specific question . On each reproof of this kind , Dr. Condon would make a grimace , nod his head at the prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also cautioned- the witness several times against arguing with the cross-examiner . This was after Dr. Condon had corrected Mr. Reilly in the use of the English language , and had cautioned him to be more precise in his questions , especially with respect to exact time and place . On one occa , sion , Dr. Condon virtually reversed the relations of himself and Mr. Reilly . Like a cross-examiner himself , he ordered Mr. Reilly to turn around , face a certain direction and swing his arm around to the left . At that time Mr. Reilly was seeking to find out just how Dr. Condon orientated himself the night he found a note at a closed frankfurter stand In the Bronx and followed its directions to the entrance gate of Woodlawn Cemetery . Although he did not show as much fight as yesterday , when he glowered , frowned , shouted and shook his finger at Mr. Reilly , Dr. Condon held his own with the lawyer and stood on his own rights . Once , when Mr. Reilly , his red face growing purple , bellowed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted right back at him : . " Do n't shout at me . I 'm not deaf . I can hear you . " Dr. Condon revealed for the first ' time today that , on the night of March 12 , 1932 , after he had talked with the man he knew as " John , " whom he yesterday identified as Hauptmann , for an hour on a bench in Van Cortlandt Park , he went back to Woodlawn Cemetery and talked with the cemetery guard whose approach earlier had frightened " John " into climbing the nine-foot cemetery fence and running away from Dr. Condon . Dr. Condon said that he planned the making of the money box in which the ransom was delivered , and selected five different kinds of wood for its construction so that he could identify it if he ever saw it again . Colonel Breckinridge testified that he was present in Dr. Condon 's house when the sleeping suit was delivered ; when Joseph Perrone , a taxicab driver , arrived with one of the ransom notes which led to Dr. Condon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown messenger brought the note the night of the payment . He said that $70,000 was taken to the Condon home from the house of a banker downtown on the afternoon of April 2 . Colonel Lindbergh and Reich took $50,000 in one automobile and Colonel Breckinridge in another car took $20,000 . The original ransom demand of $50,000 was raised to $70,000 after Colonel Lindbergh notified the police , and reduced to $50,000 again when Dr. Condon , the night of April 2 , told the kidnapper that Colonel Lindbergh was not as rich as was generally believed . On the night of the ransom payment , when Colonel Lindbergh and Dr. Condon drove off with the money , Colonel Breckinridge said , he and Reich remained in the Condon home until the other two returned with the final note , which purported to tell where the baby
