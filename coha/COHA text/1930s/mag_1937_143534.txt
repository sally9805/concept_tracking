Pope Pius XI once referred to God as the " Principal Newsmaker , " but few churchmen conceive of the Deity as a Great Editor . In England , however , a number of members of the Oxford Group of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman last summer enlisted God 's aid in a journalistic venture . In their " quiet times " every morning they took pencil &; paper , jotted down what they believed to be divine instructions on problems of makeup , caption-writing and layout for a one-shot picture magazine to be called Rising Tide . The result was published in an . edition of 300,000 copies in England last month . On U. S. newsstands this week is the U. S. Rising Tide ( 10 ) , similarly God-guided .

Fortified with $50,000 donated not only by rich , anonymous friends , of whom the Oxford Group has plenty , but also by less well-to-do Groupers-in all 5,000 contributors-its editors hoped to break even on the venture . Said Rev. Samuel Moor ( " Sam " ) Shoemaker , chief U. S. lieutenant of Dr. Buchman : " It will have every American talking about God by Christmas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
