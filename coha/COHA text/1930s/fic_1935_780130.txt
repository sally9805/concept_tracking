 | II . INTERIM PRELUDE TO THE DANCE " I NOTICE , doctor , said Byron Peirce , turning over several of my typewritten sheets , that the next section deals with questions concerning the War , relevant , I suppose , for those of your subjects who were in the service . I was not ; and it would seem like wisecracking to say that I got into the War a long time after it was over . But war is a state of mind as well as a matter of guys , ammunition , and soldiers ; like a Mississippi flood , it reaches to distant bayous far out of the main current . The shot ' ' heard ' round the world now goes ' round the world and hits a Chinaman on the other side . Warrentown in 1914 was a college town of eight thousand inhabitants and three thousand students of the State University . Administration Hall , built in 1888 , a brick building covered with ivy , Harrison Hall , the Chapel , and one dormitory were the only signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set in a rigid parallelogram , were glaringly new . The smell of varnish and plaster still lingered in the gymnasium , Science Hall , the School of Forestry , Agriculture Hall , and others of the structures devoted to the higher reaches of learning . That was before the glorification of football had brought a stadium seating thirty thousand fans , before there was an enrollment of six thousand students and a Chair of Advertising and Salesmanship . Undergraduate life was raw , but it was earnest . The Adelphi Debating Society , with generally conservative gravity , discussed woman suffrage , restriction of immigration , the right of labor to organize , and the direct election of Senators . In the more adventurous Philomathian Literary Society a smuggled copy of Mrs. Warren 's Profession and T one Bungay were read eagerly , along with the works of the Irish Literary Revival .  | By the campus , however , the literary group was regarded with suspicion . There was a Socialist Club of a dozen members , the pariahs of the institution . Raymond Hassburger was a sophomore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second year classes , it was he who introduced me to the Philomathian circle . I had been rushed by two fraternities whose membership included boys from Culverton and for a time I was carried away by their flattering attentions and invitations ; but the revelation that I chose to frequent the company of " barbarians " congealed their interest in me . ' I'hc usual rigmarole of frat life , with its solemn antics and pretentious code , I was happily spared . I was let alone , free to remain a queer duck . After a year of working with my hands in the daily companionship of illiterate , inarticulate , and phlegmatic carpenters , this entrance into an atmosphere of fervent if restricted sensibility acted as a tonic to my imagination , kindling warm enthusiasms , stimulating brief flights of poetry , and whetting my appetite for such thermal poets as Swinburne and D'Annunzio . An outlet for my aspirations and ideals came through a correspondence with Dorothy Hardicut which continued intermittently during the three years at Warrentown . In all that time we saw little of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as a Christmas present in 1914 . My holidays were spent at Agropolis with my father and Clyde , and my summer vacations were occupied with jobs wherever I could find them . Dorothy wrote to me from summer resorts , enclosing snapshots of herself with descriptive titles scribbled on the back : " Canoe trip to Indian Island . Do n't we look like Indians ? ? Corn roast by the shore . Denis Coon has a weenie in his mouth. ? Mother and I in our launch . Do I look happy ? Nix ! " Because of Mrs. Hardicut 's real or fancied opposition , our letter-writing was carried on with the circumspection of a romantic intrigue . Mrs. Hardicut , indeed , loomed ominously behind the fair portrait of her daughter . Immense in bulk and terrifying in energy , she was the arbiter of Culverton society , president  | of its leading women 's club , entertainer of visiting lecturers , itinerant authors , stray politicians , and social notables from Agropolis or the East ; she was also the directing genius of an espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Holliday , wife of the president of the First National Bank , danced somewhat too closely with Attorney Harvey Moss at the monthly country club dance , Mrs. Hardicut was reporting the event within twenty-four hours . When Messrs . Weeks and Biggers senior rolled unsteadily from Hanrahan 's Saloon at a late hour on Saturday night , mental telepathy or a scout brought the information to the redoubtable lady 's ears and it was soon public property . As for the goings-on among the high school set , her acuteness of detection was simply uncanny . The lifting of a skirt rustled in her subconscious , and the rustling , through her busy tongue , became the sound of a whirlwind . It was she who always spoke for purity and propriety in all things . Mr. Hardicut was a small , mild man and a good lawyer ; he rarely opened his mouth except in court . Toward the middle of the summer of 1915 , I made a rash decision . I would run up to lake Winnepeka , where the Hardicuts had taken a cottage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and find the opportunity to bask in the warmth which Dorothy 's recent letters had expressed . I had not seen her all year except for a brief hour during the preceding Christmas holidays . For this extravagant venture I planned to spend fifteen dollars , the most I could spare from my slender earnings as a night clerk at the Warrentown telegraph office . It was necessary , I decided , to add to my meager wardrobe and I purchased , not without misgivings , a pair of light trousers for three dollars and a new tie with red stripes for fifty cents . Examined not too critically , the ensemble was summery and debonair , though it was the second season for my straw hat . The journey was longer and the round-trip fare more than I had anticipated , but I comforted myself with the thought that I should be able to look into Dorothy 's eyes as I quoted , with deep emotion , the lines :  | Leave go my hands , let me catch breath and see ; Let the dew-fall drench either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seen sidelong like a blossom in the tree ; Ah God , ah God , that day should be so soon . Idly I wondered whether there was a heavy dew-fall at Lake Winnepeka to point the lines . Moon ? Yes , by good luck a full one was assured , that is , unless it rained . I was even resigned to the yelping pack of urchins who raced up and down the aisle of the day coach , scattering orange peels and peanut shells . The baggage man at the end of the line was not wholly reassuring . " You say your friends are at Lindhaven ? The steamer 'll take you right to the hotel . It ai n't so expensive , not more'n four or five dollars a day . . . . No , it 's the only one down that end of the lake . Nice quiet place , for folks getting on in years . If you want something lively , stay at this end , Woodland Inn or The Birches , they 're ten miles nearer and lots of young folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I boarded the steamer . Blue shield , chastened with wind-etched ripples , embossed with pineclad islands , and cinctured with a wandering shore of sloping green where cottages lurked coyly ; cool air , savorous of pine and placid water ; pendant smoke trailing our chuffing craft that turned a creamy furrow as it plowed along ; and on our narrow deck baggage from Chicago , Detroit , Kalamazoo , Standing at the bow of the little steamer , I felt a sense of release and freedom . " Only one single room left , " said the clerk haughtily , eyeing my worn valise . " Five dollars . " " Is that the best you have ? " I murmured feebly . " It is all we have ! " he replied with condescension . " I shall be staying three days , " I said , glumly peeling off three bills . Still , I thought , for once to enjoy being in the swim , among the elite ! The elite , as I observed them later , sitting heavily or moving stodgily about the hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoy the ardent spirits of youth .  | The Hardicut cottage was on a point a half mile from the hotel by water and a mile by land . I elected to walk . As I tramped along the sandy road through the pinewoods I reflected that my hotel was the sort of place Max would like . He got on well with affluent , middle-aged ladies and their tetired husbands ; in any environment muffled from the harsher sounds of the world , he expanded , and the punctilios of knee-service pleased him . As for Clyde , I could not picture that journeyman printer remaining for a single night in such an establishment as the Lindhaven . He had written to me that he liked his job , " every part of it , from composing to locking up and proof reading . Yes , I would rather smell printer 's ink than the finest perfume on a pretty girl ! Sometimes when I am filling in a stick of type it comes to me what a power there is in these little pieces of metal . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war over there is a good part the result of type . Often when I have a breathing spell I amuse myself by setting up a paragraph of words that have dynamite in them and imagine to myself that hundreds of thousands of copies will be run off and distributed . " At night school he was studying mathematics , physics , chemistry , " just for the fun of it . " Never mentioned girls , probably did n't have any . His most frequent expressions were , " do n't fool yourself ; I was only fooling myself ; that sort of thing fools you . " Through the smooth , dark columns of white pine I caught a glimpse of a boathouse , a beach beyond ; there was a sound of voices , splashing , the plop of a diver . This must be the place . My heart quickened as I thought how I would stroll around the end of the boathouse and say , nonchalantly , " Hello , I ) ot ! Just dropped in for a little visit . " And her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh Byron ! This is just like you ! " I reached the boathouse and as the rear door was open , I stepped inside . A young man in white ducks was taking down a pair of paddles from a rack . " Is this the Hardicut place ? " I asked .  | " Yes , " he said , inspecting me with evident disfavor , " but I do n't think they need anyone ; there are two fellows working here now . " " I want to speak to Miss Hardicut . " " Are you acquainted with her ? " " Friend of hers . Stopping at the Lindhaven . " " Oh ! I beg your pardon ! I thought you She 's on the dock . I 'll take you right down . " The group on the dock , young people of my own age , were all in swimming togs . Girls in bathing suits were a novelty to me and I gazed with pleasurable surprise at the display of arms bare almost to the shoulders , and generously revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three of the girls were holding parasols to protect their complexions , but Dorothy was daringly exposed to the bright afternoon sun and she seemed boldly indifferent to the fact that one of her stockings had slipped down below her knee . The young man called to her and she turned . Her greeting , though surprised , was not so cordial as I had expected . " Byron Peirce ! Of all people ! How did you get here ? " " Just thought I 'd run up for a breathing spell . I 'm at the Lindhaven . " " Really ? How nice ! " Her relief was evident ; perhaps she thought I had intended to be a self-invited guest . " Will you be there long ? " " A day or so is all . I 've got to get back to my job . " " Oh , then , I 'll see you before you go . Let me introduce you. , , She presented me to her friends : college men , probably from big Eastern universities . Families had money ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cars , servants . I was not in their class and they knew it , but because of Dot they were agreeable , the girls more so than the men . Still , I was stopping at the Lindhaven and for the moment was glad of it . " When , " I managed to say to Dorothy after a few minutes , " am I going to see you ? "  | " Let 's see . . . . Oh dear , how things crowd in ! I 've got to run up right now and dress for a tea at the Buxtons . Then tonight there 's a dance over on Crane Island at the Fairchilds . Tomorrow , what are we doing tomorrow , Bob ? " " Canoe trip down to the outlet , do n't you remember ? " " That 's too bad . It means we wo n't be home until pretty late and mother is expecting me to help her entertain some house guests who are coming on the afternoon train . And we 've promised to take them around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bob , was n't there something that night ? " " The Lindhaven is giving a dance for the cottagers . We made a date for it if your mother okays the program . " " Mother , " Dorothy explained , " is so particular about the chaperons at these dances , but I 'm sure it will be all right at the Lindhaven . I 'll tell you , Bob , if you do n't mind , we 'll all go to the dance together , and Byron can bring me home . We have n't seen each other in ages and I have a lot of Culverton gossip for him . You know us home-towners ! " Bob , the young man in ducks and white sweater , was amenable to the arrangement ; it was plain that he looked upon me as a home-towner , one of those persons to be tolerated for the moment for old times ' sake . And as I returned through the wood , sun-shafted with amber light that lay warm-russet on needle carpets , I reflected that Dorothy had adroitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do for her mother to become suspicious . Let those who are in favour with their stars Of public honour and proud titles boast , Whilst I , whom fortune of such triumph bars , Unlook 'd for joy in that I honour most ... . On the veranda of the hotel sat the usual collection of armchair commentators on the war . Would this Austro-German drive finally smash the Russian armies ? The Russians were cattle ; had to be driven to battle by officers ; the Germans were  | fine soldiers , even if a hit pigheaded ; England had no right to coerce neutrals on the high seas ; France ... . Opinion was divided . The argument waxed bitter until two dowagers related their experience of the horrors of war ; they had lost their baggage , getting out of Switzerland . In general , throughout the state sentiment was anti-British , anti-Russian , and strongly pacifist . The scions of pioneer families had read in their school histories that Uncle Sam , that Truehearted Yankee , had twice licked John Bull , the Domineering Brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquities practiced upon the fair Emerald Isle . Those of German stock had a sentimental regard for the Vaterland , its beer , Rhine wine , schnitzel , kuchen , respect for authority , cleanliness , and order , music , poetry , philosophy , science  --  land of true kultur . The President , thank God , would keep us out of war ! To the music of one-step and waltz ( such barbarities as the turkey-trot were banned at the Lindhaven ) we danced , I not too gracefully and having to be reminded ? " You do n't have to hold me as if I were drowning ! " " It 's great to be here with you ! " " That arm again ! If anyone tells mother ! " " Why does n't she like me ? " " Thinks you and your family are dangerous  --  is n't it a joke ? But she 's heard of the Baker girl and the school teacher . " " What school teacher ? " " Emily or Aimily or something . " " Amelie Duchand ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a kid ! " How did Mrs. Hardicut know about her ? It occurred to me that once I had confided my great thwarted passion to Willis Brandt . Willis used to play his violin at the Hardicuts . " Anyway , Dot , I 'm different now . I only want to love you , and " How is your architecture getting on ? " " Pretty good . When Dean Corbett saw some of my drawings , he let me take the historical courses , classical , Gothic , and  | Renaissance , even though I did n't have the prerequisites . It 's great stuff ! I like best of all the Romanesque and Early ( ; othic . " " Please ! Not so tight ! I.et 's swing around toward Bob . I le 's waiting for the next one . He 's Cornell , ' 16 , varsity track and a lot of things , besides coaching the annual play . Eric is Purdue and Dan is Northwestern . They 're big men at both those places . I think college shows the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is going to succeed or just be a nobody . I do hope you make your mark at Warrentown , Byron . Why do n't you go out for editor of the campus daily ? That 's an honor . " " Mostly politics . The frats fight over all those positions and I 'm not a frat man . I like the bunch in the Philomathian , they 're serious , like Raymond Hassburger . " " Raymond Hassburger ! I do n't see how you can stand him ! Do n't talk to me about people like him ! Why , mother would n't have Mrs. Hassburger in our house ! . . . Bob , shall we get an ice before we dance ? " Promptly at eleven o'clock the piano and violin orchestra played " Home Sweet Home " and I secured Dorothy for the last dance . After two days of idling about the hotel and paddling by myself along the shore , I was determined to venture upon a more complete understanding with Dorothy . " Listen , Dot . Let me paddle you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushions and everything and " " Mother does n't like to have me out on the water after dark . " " But there 's no danger . It 's perfectly calm and a swell moon and I know how to handle a boat . I can get you home in a quarter of an hour . It 's my last night ! " My pleading prevailed . It was such a night as I had dreamed of hopefully : full moon , breathless stillness , dewy grass . Dorothy said her slippers were getting soaked but she did n't mind . Some cottagers were leaving the dock in a launch . Its sputterings smote harshly on the silence as it bore away , leaving a wake of concentric , everwidening arcs of silver . The further shores were clothed in a fine mist that gave them an imponderable look ; they might  | have been curtains of silk , hung between sky and water . Cushioned against the canoe , Dorothy lay back dreamily , her face upturned to the round disc above us , while my paddle dipped lingeringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought appropriate to such a situation somehow failed to come off ; possibly the authors had written them in stuffy rooms far from the source of their inspiration . Silence was better . We had covered perhaps half the distance when Dorothy suddenly raised her head and looked about . " That 's very odd , " she said , " the shores have almost disap-peared ! " It was true . The mist had thickened stealthily until only the faint outlines of the pine woods were visible . " It 's a beautiful effect , " I said . " Rather mysterious and unreal . Makes me think of Dowson 's lines : Beyond the need of weeping , Beyond the reach of hands , May she be quietly sleeping , In what dim nebulous lands ? Ah , she who understands ! " " It had better make you think of getting to land as quick as you can ! " she said severely . " Sometimes the mist comes down like that and you ca n't see a yard ahead . Last week some people in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hurry , Byron , it 's really getting frightfully thick ! " The moon had shrunk to a wizened and pallid globe ; even as she spoke , the sense of material things , of a solid universe left us ; we were floating in a soundless , stagnant , immeasurable space of nothingness . " You 'd better turn back to the shore , Byron , " Dorothy said anxiously . " Do n't try to keep on toward the point . If we miss it , we 'll be out on the big part of the lake and goodness knows where we 'll land ! " I swung the canoe at right angles and headed toward the nearest land , only a short distance away , paddling with vigor . The prow of the boat entered a gray enfolding wall that was without substance , and closing behind us ; the moon , now , was  | gone . Except for the steady slap of the blade striking at the side of the canoe , the gurgle of water as it slid through the stroke , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensation both mystifying and a little alarming . After some minutes of steady paddling , I lifted the paddle and held it poised ; no sound , no breath of air , no fragrance of near pines . I moistened my finger and held it up ; the dead air was unstirring . " We ought to have hit the beach by this time , " I hazarded . " I 'll turn a little more to the right . That would bring us . to the dock , then we can beach the canoe and walk back . " I spoke with an assurance that I hardly felt . This time I paddled in earnest , counting . . . one , two , three , four . . . about forty strokes to the minute . . . a yard to the stroke . . . four hundred strokes , ten minutes , should bring us to shore from any part of Lindhaven Bay . I counted five hundred and stopped . " Well ? " said Dorothy in a constrained voice . " Where are we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a circle . Do you want me to shout ? " " Oh dear no ! Not yet ! It would cause all kinds of excitement , even if you could be heard . I 'd never hear the last of it from mother . Besides , I do n't think you could be heard . There 's only the hotel and our cottage on this side . Voices do n't carry far through a fog like this . " " Are you frightened ? " " No , but I 'm annoyed . And I 'm getting wet . " Her voice was plaintive . I passed over my coat and lit a cigarette ; I suddenly wanted to put my arm about her and take her hand ; not in a canoe , I thought ; that 's the way accidents happen . " May I have a smoke , please ? " I apologized . Under other circumstances her smoking would have seemed adventurous ; now it was a natural gesture to relieve tension . Our conversation lapsed ; she was silent so long  | that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low monotone , as though talking to herself : " War . . . over there . . . millions ! ... Women , children , babies , men  --  ghastly ! They are fighting over there , and here we are just drifting . . . they are dying and starving , we 're worried about our comfort . Strange , is n't it ? " " Pretty awful ; but then , maybe we do n't know how bad it is for lots of people here with no war  --  I mean , poverty and disease . If we stopped to think , we 'd go crazy , I suppose . Or else get mad . Or try to do something about it , like dad . " " It 's all right to be sympathetic , " she said dryly , " but we do n't have to be cranks ! " " It 's the cranks , maybe , that finally make the changes in things ; John Brown , William Lloyd Garrison , Walt Whitman ? people like them , who are spit upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ! " I was thinking of Swansen . The last time I saw Clyde he told me the whole story . The trip out had been a hard one , snow and ice on the grade trail and having to find a free bunk at the camps every night after a twenty-mile hike . The last night on the trail he got into the section camp after sundown and every bunk was filled , two hundred men in one bunkhouse all babbling strange tongues and not a word of English to be heard . He flung his packsack down by the red-hot sheet iron stove and prepared to sit there on a bench for the night with his feet in sawdust thick with spittle and tobacco quids . Then from the far end of the log shack a big strapping bohunk came toward him , jerked with his thumb , grinning . Clyde followed him back ; the fellow lifted his duffle from the top of a threetier bunk and motioned for Clyde to climb up ; he did so , and the bohunk squeezed in with another hunkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; they were all pretty tough there , and yet things like that happened frequently . " Do you believe in God , Byron ? " Dorothy asked , interrupting my reverie . " I do n't know . I 'm not much interested , one way or the other . "  | " You ca n't get along without some belief to help you out of trouble . " " Maybe so . " Our low voices sank into the gray and silent vastness like pebbles dropped into a deep well . I must have fallen into a momentary doze ; there was my mother , young , and acting kittenish as I remembered her in the earliest days before we went to Agropolis . She offered me her breast to suck but I turned away , making a face . " Oh ! my baby is a little man ! " she laughed . " Byron ! " I jerked wide awake at the sharp cry . " My Lord ! " said Dorothy . " You almost dumped us ! Keep awake ! " " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a match and looked at my watch . " Ten after twelve ! " " Mother will be simply paralyzed ! " I sniffed ; a rich , aromatic fragrance of wet pine needles and ground pine . " We 're near shore ! " A large gray shape loomed close by . With a few strokes I brought the canoe in beside a huge rock , riven squarely down the middle . " Split Rock ! " cried Dorothy . " We 're on the other side of the point , not more than a hundred feet from our dock ! " In another moment the shore itself was visible , pines towering like dark jinn through the murk . Keeping close to the beach , I paddled to the Hardicut landing . " I hope you wo n't catch it from your mother , Dot ! " " I do n't care . It was quite an adventure . When shall I be seeing you ? " " I have to leave early tomorrow . Perhaps I 'll get down to Culverton at Thanksgiving . " " Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your letters are so interesting . " " Of course , and you write too . " She reached down and gave my hand a quick , friendly clasp .  | " Good-bye , Byron ! " a little softer , I thought . " Good-bye , Dot ! " " Keep close to shore ! " " You bet ! " I was a long time working cautiously around the point and back on the inside of the bay , following the shore line at a canoe-length distance from it . I was not exactly cheerful for I had the presentiment that she would not write and I would not write , and that it was a closed chapter . And yet , out there in that void , we had come close to something . . . . If the canoe had tipped over  --  I drove my paddle viciously through the water . I would work and study like hell . Girls were only a distraction . Yes ! I would work day and night and think less about poetry and forget romance , and perhaps some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye as perfectly formed pines . I felt I had passed into the world of reality . MARTIAL MUSIC DURING the school year of 1916-17 I roomed with Raymond Hassburger , an arrangement that suited me for two reasons . I was able to live in much better quarters than I could have afforded alone , as he assumed the heavier share of the expenses , claiming that it was really an economy to have a roommate and that there was no one else who would be so little disturbing . Furthermore , his company , which was never obtrusive , served my mood of isolation and intensive study . While we talked little and rarely intimately , his cool , factual mind , seeking always a clue to causation , fitted in with my growing conviction that the universe was governed by physical laws , the discovery of which would solve all earthly problems . With this sweeping generalization , however , Raymond did not agree . " Protoplasm , " he said on one occasion , " has been analyzed  | but not produced synthetically . There is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a chemical engineer . Next year at Boston Tech , then into the lab of some big corporation . It 's a straight program  --  if it does n't hit a snag . But we may all hit snags within six months . " " What do you mean ? 1 ) o you think we 'll get into the war ? " " A month ago Wilson was re-elected on a slogan . We Americans fall for slogans and they 're nearly always meaningless . Now we may go to war for another slogan ; we 'll fight , yelling some slogan , and if we win , we 'll have another pat slogan ready to plant in the cemeteries . " " Would you volunteer ? " " Certainly ! " he said promptly . " Right off the bat ! Are n't I an officer of the Cadet Corps ? " " You have never struck me as being such a hot patriot ! " " I 'm not a patriot at all . " " Then , why ? " " Curiosity , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would do to me , and to the rest . Well , and there 's another reason . I 'm a Jew , not good enough for their damn silly frats . So I went into the student corps and made myself into a good officer , in spite of plenty of jealousy and dirty work . Same way , I 'd go into the service . Pride , I suppose . " " Hassie , " I said , " I think that kind of pride is the only dumb thing about you . " " Maybe so , old cock , maybe so . But there it is , and I might as well accept it . Know what pop did when the Culverton Masons turned him down for their lodge ? Gave the town the land for Hamilton Park on condition that they put up that tablet : Given by a Jew for the pleasure of all . ' The city council balked but the Masons pushed it through . They had bought a couple of lots in there for the new temple and did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs in the family . " " I do n't see how your pride can enter into it , if you think of being blown to hell . Where 's your pride , then ? " " Supposing you get cracked up in an auto smash or die of cancer ? The difference in war is only a matter of numbers .  | You ca n't add up human suffering to get a grand total . The grand total is no more than any individual has to stand . War as a physical thing is a contemptible performance . But intellectual war  --  the struggle for the domination of intellect over stupidity  --  is a magnificent concept ! " It was my introduction to the philosophy of Nietzsche . I had reason to remember my twenty-first birthday . Just a week before , the ! ' resident had signed the Congressional resolution declaring that a state of war existed with Germany , and on the day when I received from father three neckties with a birthday greeting , the Warrentown campus was astir with young marching feet . Six new companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion . The sound of the fife and drum corps playing with more than ordinary lest , the snappy commands uttered by student and the rhythmical thud of wheeling files of underpenetrated to the tranquil recesses of the university where I was reading Pater 's Studies in the History of snaisiance , savoring with relish his unimpassioned cadences . n what was taking part out there , both the physical response and the community of ardent enthusiasm , I had no share . During my sophomore year I had been excused from the required military drill on medical grounds , and in my junior year the medical department , even against pressure by the military , had refused to certify to my fitness ; just what the matter was , beyond general lack of tone , the examiner could not say . He recommended a blood tonic . To the surge of intense , vehement , and intoxicating spirit of self-immolation on the altar of patriotism that swept the campus with an even fiercer glow than Warrentown itself , I had , in all honesty , to confess a strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , of the account of the zealots in India who used to throw themselves under the car of Juggernaut , to be crushed by its divine wheels . Dinner that night at the Commons , where the bulk of the students dined , turned into a rally . Some one started singing  | The Star-Spangled Banner and they all stood up and joined in , although with some uncertainty about the words . It was interrupted by vociferous shouts  --  - " t 1p ! Stand up ! " ? and soon three hundred voices bellowed " Stand up ! " without exactly knowing who the traitors were . It appeared later that a pair of socialist club members had remained seated . They were roughly handled and hustled from the hall . I saw Raymond Iassburger , in his lieutenant 's uniform , working his way toward my table . As he came nearer I noticed that his eyes were blazing with a fanatical light . " Listen , old cock ! " he cried drunkenly . " There 's big doings tonight ! Going to burn all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effigy ! You want to come along ! " " Old Doc Hasenpfeffer ! What are you raving about ? What 's he done ? " " Said Germany takes the lead in culture .

" Listen , bud , do n't  --  for God 's sake  --  spill anything like that again ! Keep your ideas to yourself ! No more Hasenpfeffer  --  he 's an enemy alien , and we 're quitting all our German classes ! " Professor Grossmuller , head of the German department , for years had been known affectionately as " Doc Hasenpfeffer .

" " Well , " I said , " you burn all your books you want , but leave mine alone ! " Before commencement Raymond Hassburger had volunteered . In that last brief period he acted like one who has happily resigned himself to the irrational . At our parting it  | was I who felt coldly practical ; I had been drafted and I proposed to wait until my turn came . " Old cock , " he said as we stood waiting for his train , " do n't forget that the world belongs to the strong . And when you sell my books , send the cash to my sister . Pop is pretty tight with her spending money . " " Good luck ! " I said . " And I hope you have some fun in Paris ! " It sounded foolish , but what is the right thing to say when soldiers go to war ?

McLaughlin , medical director at the University , was a tall , spare , fierce-looking man with a bristling black Van Dyke , whose gruff , professional manner hid a sensitive , music-loving soul . A few days after I had said good-bye to Raymond Hassburger I met the doctor hurrying across the campus . " Hello , Peirce ! " he said , as I fell in with his long strides . " How 's the constitution ? Getting into fighting trim ? " " Yes , except that I seem to sleep pretty poorly , hot part of the time , and then cold sweats . " " H 'm . . . come on to the office and let me give you the onceover . That tonic should have braced you up by now . " In the immaculate , white-enameled examination room of the infirmary he wasted no time . " Here ! While I 'm climbing into my work clothes , just stick that tube in your mouth . We 'll see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his coat and vest and put on a white smock , then he removed the thermometer from my mouth and glanced at the reading . " So ! Now , Peirce , strip to the waist for a little thumping . " When I had done so , he began to tap , with a movement of the middle finger fulcrumed from the wrist , which reminded me of a woodpecker working on a hollow log , beginning high up under the shoulder blades and moving gradually about my torso . Once he went back and tapped again on the right-hand side toward the collar-bone.  | " Breathe deep ! Say , Ho ! ' Cough ! " He placed his ear against my chest and listened , took a stethoscope from among the gleaming instruments on his table , and applied the tube to the parts of my anatomy that seemed most to interest him . After five minutes of this 1 began to have a feeling of growing uneasiness ; he suddenly said , " That 's all ! Show up tomorrow at ten for an x ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor ? " I stammered . " Do you want it straight from the shoulder ? Of course ! Well , you 're not so good . Temperature 97.6 , which may not mean anything unless it stays that way . But there 's a rough spot in the breathing . We 'll have to see what the picture shows . And that 's the best I can promise you . " By the end of the week I knew the verdict : pulmonary tuberculosis ; local infection , incipient stage . " Peirce , " said Dr. McLaughlin , " your general physique is first-rate . A little care ought to clear this thing up . My advice is , sanitarium at Albuquerque for a few months , then stay down in that New Mexico climate for a full year . " " How soon will I be able to work ? " " That depends . If you take it easy for three or four months , you might be good for an outdoor job after that . It 's too bad , " he added sardonically , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " There was a hurried packing up ; the wire sent to father about financial arrangements ; the trip back to Agropolis for an unexpected reunion  --  father , Max , Clyde , and I meeting again only to separate . Max held a lieutenant 's commission in the Illinois State Militia and was expecting a call to the national service at any moment . Our dinner together was hardly a cheerful affair . Max , who was a paying teller at a Chicago bank , had seen father only once since the unfortunate affair of the divorce ; even in his civilian clothes , which had a certain sober elegance , he already had the air of a military man . He sat stiffly at the table and spoke in clipped sentences , as though practicing for the part he was soon to play .  | Clyde , by contrast , in a wrinkled brown suit and gray flannel shirt , hunching bulkily in his chair , would have passed for what he was  --  a member of Typographical Local 24 ? with an exceptionally thoughtful forehead and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years younger ; the declaration of war had stirred him to passionate opposition and it was evident that at some of Max 's remarks he restrained himself with an effort . We were discussing my case and the medical document in my pocket , which was to be presented to the local draft board . " Are you sure , " said Max , turning to me , " that this medico is on the level , not just trying to keep you out of service ? " At my look of amazement he went on , " There are a lot of people you ca n't trust in time of war ! " " I guess it 's not up to you to raise that question ! " I said tartly . " I 'll leave the report in the hands of the proper authorities . " " As soon as the spot is healed , " he said , " you ought to report for service . " " I 'll look after my own reporting ! " My caustic tone silenced him but after a moment he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you soon will be . They 're bound to extend the age limits . Why do n't you show your mettle by enlisting right away ? " " I 'd have to ask father 's consent , " Clyde answered ironically , " and he might not give it , eh , dad ? " " You can do whatever you think is right , " said father between compressed lips . " As I intend to do ! " " What I intend to do , " said Clyde negligently , " is some thing I 've been wanting to do for a long time  --  go down to Texas and follow the wheat harvesting up to Minnesota . " Max turned red . " You ca n't  --  you would n't run away ! " " There 's nobody to stop me , is there ? I 'm free , white , and not in the draft . If you like this war business , go on into it 1 As for me , I say , to hell with it ! When they want me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Max rose from his chair . For a moment I thought he was going to strike his brother . " Sit down , Max ! " said father . " I wo n't sit with a traitor ! " " Sit down , " I said , " and do n't be a damn ass ! As dad has said , it 's up to us . You 've decided . I do n't have to make a decision , and Clyde has made up his mind to follow a different course . After all , the army has got to live on wheat ! Besides , Clyde is not in the draft and the war may be over before he is . So let 's call it off ! " Max sat down . The rest of the meal yielded a constrained and desultory conversation , chiefly concerning the details of the journey in which Clyde would join me for a good part of the way .

They raped Ireland , bloodied India , screwed the Boers , and frigged every land they could lay their dirty fists on ! " Under pressure he recanted , protesting tearfully that he had been misquoted . He agreed to eat a platter of hamburger and sauerkraut under the name of " liberty steak with American sour cabbage . "  | The Rev.

All other ministers agreed that it was God 's war and conscientious objectors should expect no mercy from God or the Government . The Home Defenders unearthed a plot , communicated anonymously by telephone , to blow up the wire-nail factory , which had a government contract for barbed wire . Another anonymous message connected the name of Carl Liebermann with this conspiracy . The Home Defenders thereupon arranged to have all telephone conversations to and from the Culverton House reported by the operators . No further evidence of the plot was revealed , only some illuminating information concerning the private lives of certain citizens . Though unverified , the imputation of guilt remained , and a silent boycott reduced the number of guests to a scant handful . Len Scobey , proprietor of the Culverton Travelers Hotel near the Big Four Station , was especially active in warning incoming visitors against stopping at that " German-owned , German-run , and pro-German hotel on the Square . " One night a mob of masked and armed men invaded the Culverton House , dragged Carl Liebermann and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traitor , executed damage to the extent of ten thousand dollars before the tardy arrival of the police dispersed them . Judge Fisher made a vigorous but vain attempt to secure the indictment of the culprits . The two local papers chided the " impetuous patroits " for " their perhaps too ardent zeal in the cause of loyalty " and reminded them that the law of the land still functioned . H. Preservation of the State . The trial at Agropolis of Charles Worden Peirce , editor of the Rational Advocate , and the entire staff of that periodical ,  | consisting of the notorious Mrs. Gamsby and a stenographer , for " conspiring to obstruct the Draft " held a place second only to the war news in the state papers during the spring of 1918 . At the outset , from the . tenor of Mr. Peirce 's editorials defending the right of conscience to decide in all matters , it seemed that his conviction was a foregone conclusion . It was also believed that Mrs. Gamsby would suffer for her distribution of the pamphlet War is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conceded that Miss Tillie Brown , the stenographer , might escape punishment , particularly if she turned state 's evidence . To the surprise of everyone Judge Fisher offered to defend the accused . Since his retirement from the county bench to private practice , the elderly lawyer rarely appeared to plead in person . His failure , however , to secure indictments against the leaders of the hotel-wrecking patriots had aroused his conservative instincts , which belonged with an earlier school of jurisprudence ; he viewed with distrust the swift and arbitrary assumption of absolute authority lodged in the party of his political opponents . It was a long and stubbornly contested trial . But what actually moved the jury to acquittal was Judge Fisher 's impassioned reference to " Captain Max Peirce , the son whom this accused father has yielded gladly to the service of his country and who is now fighting in France ! The father , who was himself cited for gallantry under fire during the Spanish-American War ! " III . Treason in Minnesota .

Signed , Roscoe Biddle , sheriff Manitou , Minn. , April 15 , 1918 . " " That 's the answer ! " he said , swiveling on his chair to face his deputy , Chet Newcomb . " That will finish them off ! They ca n't bring their speakers down from St. Paul and they ca n't meet to nominate for primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ? " " What I was starting to tell you , Ros , " said Chet , fidgeting uneasily under his superior 's belligerent gaze , " was that while you was out for lunch , I got a ring from the organizer . " " Well ! And what did he have to say for himself ? " demanded the sheriff . " I le 's getting ready to skedaddle , I guess ! " " No , Ros , not exactly . Said he was calling a League picnic for two weeks from today at Linden Grove , and invited us to come around ! " " The nerve of the damn pup ! Picnic , eh ? Wants us to come around ! We 'll come all right ! Yep ! With fifty deputies ! " As Chet maintained an uncomfortable silence , the sheriff repeated , " Fifty deputies  --  with shotguns ! What d' you say to that ? " " I 'd say , Ros , " the deputy began slowly , " I 'd say , go a little slow on this proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county two months ago , there was n't half a dozen farmers would allow they was League members ; now there 's maybe five hundred , maybe a thousand signed up and open about it .

" The farmers must have been hiding him in a hay barn ! Anyhow , the damage is done ; and it ai n't so far till primaries that we can afford to stir up a hornets ' nest . Even in the towns by now the vote ai n't cinched for us !

If some of the Leaguers get beat up by patriotic citizens , you can tell ' em they had fair warning of what this sort of radicalism leads to ! Same time , you can express sympathy for the families . " The sheriff eyed his incrusted spittoon reflectively and , having shot a spurt of juice into its depths , said , " You 're right , Chet ! You 've got the right idea ! It 's time for us to use a little stragety . Give ' em rope and they 'll hang theirselves ! If a riot does develop  --  and it would n't surprise me if it did ? " he winked at his assistant ? " we'l I pull in the Peirce whippersnapper for inciting to violence ! Let 's see . . . if the picnic is going to be at Linden Grove , they'l I have to go through Deerhead , coming and going . You and me , Chet , will go with ' em to the barbecue , stay long enough to shake hands all around and have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boys at Deerhead , with a little help from Manitou , will do the rest ! " He rose and clapped the deputy on the back . " Bully ! That 's the notion ! Stragety ! " The barbecue at Linden Grove was a great success . From every part of Blue Gum County the farmers and their wives and children raised the dust with their cars on all the roads leading to the Grove . Sons and grandsons of Minnesota pioneers who had turned the stubborn sod of the prairie , the Leaguers were glad to take a holiday from the spring planting , made the harder this year by the scarcity of young men . Most of the older farmers had sons in the army . With interest on mortgages to meet , the residents of rural districts in Blue Gum County had filled their quotas in the Red Cross and Liberty Loan drives ahead of the towns . In Manitou , the county seat , the deficit had been made up by the banks . Throughout the grounds the farm women were unpacking lunches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups to talk crops and politics . Clyde Peirce , the  | organizer , passed from one knot of League members to another , calling out familiar greetings to the men he knew by name . Sent down from St. Paul into what was known as one of the " bloody " counties , he had proved to be a popular representative of the farmer-labor political organization . While on his rounds talking the program of the League , he would stop to help in the milking and potato-planting , or he would take a turn with the seeder and harrow . Not a few of the men who had " joined up " did so because through this youth they could express their deep-seated , troubled resentment against the distant power that had called their sons from the soil to fight overseas . War fever mounts on the shoulders of crowds ; to people isolated on lonely farms it comes in the guise of a harsh summons from the nearby townsmen whose contempt for their rural neighbors has always been manifest and outspoken . The sacrifice is not mitigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common knowledge that although the Blue Gum farms had been stripped of youth , the pool rooms and billiard parlors in Manitou and other towns did not lack the patronage of young men of draft age who , somehow , enjoyed exemption . For the first of May the day was unusually warm . The florid faces of the men tending the fiery pits , above which hung whole sides of beef and pork , grew even redder . " Hi , young feller ! " one of them called to Clyde . " Fetch us the sheriff and we 'll hang him up and do him to a turn ! " " Reckon , " said another , " we could render a tub of lard out of his hide ! " " Who , Biddle ? " said Clyde derisively . " He would n't render out no more'n an angle worm ! Ai n't nothing inside his skin but hot air ! " This brought a guffaw . Part of his success was due to the ease with which he adopted their idiom and to his understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at an outdoor meeting when he said , " The State House with the Old Gang in it is like a cow without a bag . You can get ii with calf , but it 's a golden one , and she wo n't milk ! " A  | when the laughter had died down he added , " It 's the farmers that get milked  --  every time ! " There were horseshoe pitching , one-legged races , children 's contests , and other diversions ; an enormous consumption of victuals , and speech-making that lasted through the remainder . ' of the sultry afternoon . " Then they began to pack up and move out of the grounds , for it would be milking time before they got home . Horns honked , children screeched , neighbors bawled good-bye , cars bumped over ruts until they reached the main road running through 1eerhead . The Leaguers were exultant ; they had held their picnic and neither sheriff nor deputies had showed up . In the town 's main street a number of the cars halted while their owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and supplies to take home . Deerhead , a town of two thousand inhabitants , was proud of being " right up to the minute in everything ! " It had electric lights , a fire pressure system , and a chamber of commerce . Without manufactures , it lived on the trade of the countryside , from which , however , it held disdainfully aloof . When farmers came to either of its two banks to renew loans or take out new ones , they were received as poor pensioners by the white-collared gentry behind the wickets , who inquired sternly their reasons for buying machinery and fertilizers ; the local stores , however , knew that the rural credit accounts , swelled by monthly interest charges , were better risks than those of their own townsmen . At five o'clock on this warm May afternoon , except for the open cars of the Leaguers scattered up and down the street , filled with tired picnickers , the town had the appearance of placid torpor , which was its customary state on all days save Saturdays . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loafers had been considerably augmented . At a quarter past five the whole thoroughfare was the scene of indescribable confusion and sanguinary conflict . Clyde Peirce , who had lingered at the Grove to see that the fires were extinguished and the last of the debris gathered up , drove into Deerhead at the moment when the surprise attack of the villagers was reaching its culmination . The ambush had  | been as effective as a sudden descent of Sioux warriors on an unsuspecting wagon train . The farmers were outnumbered five to one by the citizenry armed with axes , staves , crowbars , pitchforks , shotguns and assorted weapons from the hardware store . Cut off and surrounded , they were fighting with bare fists a yelling mob of anti-Leaguers , some of whom were hacking tires , mauling the women , and ripping the tops of cars , while others , having coupled up the fire hose to the hydrants along the street , held the nozzles toward the screaming occupants as they delivered high-pressure streams of icy water into faces blinded by the deluge . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , he saw before him an aged farmer , on his knees , being beaten with barrel staves . He jammed on the brake , yelling over his shoulder at his two companions , " Dump that back seat and hand me a monkey wrench ! " A thump , followed by a clatter of tools . The three leaped out . Clyde 's face was that of a maniac . " Now you goddamned sons of bitches ! " The county papers duly reported the event as UNPROVOKED ATTACK OF LEAGUE RADICALS ON PEACEFUL HAMLET ! RED LEADER JAILED AS SHERIFF CLAMPS DOWN LID ! DEERHEAD AFFRAY A LESSON TO ALL TRAITORS ! LEAGUE DISCREDITED BY ITS VIOLENT TACTICS ! NO NOMINATIONS LIKELY ! Nevertheless , the League candidates in Blue Gum County carried the primaries by a comfortable majority . SUPRAMUNDANE DOCTOR , said Byron Peirce , with due regard for your point of view , I have been thinking that the attempt to formulate person-  | ality as demonstrated in your statistical work , bears a resemblance , on a higher plane , of course , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe sincerely that every endeavor , every estimate of character and achievement could be stated in dollars and cents ; that for each person a balance sheet could be cast that would show a profit or loss , whether that person 's place in the general scheme constituted an asset or a liability . I do not mean to say that he precisely identified income with ability , but he had the conviction that , in the aggregate , the upper brackets deserved what they got ; the converse of this proposition was that the failures were the socially unfit , and , he would have added , undesirable . He recognized exceptions , of course , in those poets , artists , inventors , and men of genius who , from time to time , have suffered poverty and frustration ; it was merely God 's way of testing the chosen , just as God had decreed that the poor should always be with us . It was only in this respect that his religious belief was manifested  --  the wholehearted assurance that things were meant to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith was shaken until the last few weeks of his life . Certainly neither Stella Perle nor my relations with her during three months at the sanitarium would have been quite understandable to Max . He would have sized her up as " one of those women who write what nobody reads . " She was a poet from San Francisco and would have been thirty on her next birthday . She had been a grade school teacher for eight years and during that time had put a younger brother through college . When a few poems and stories had been sold , she quit teaching in the hope of being able to make a living as a writer . Iler first book of poems had scarcely been accepted by an Eastern publisher when she found that she had t.b . If she secretly resented this unkindness of nature , she did not show it . When I first met her at Dr. Osman 's Private Sanitarium I should not have taken her for either teacher or poet , or a patient , either . The sanitarium , situated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by automobile from Albuquerque , was  | built in the pueblo style of architecture , which accorded well with the harsh outlines of the mesa behind it . On my arrival I was put to bed for a week to get " acclimatized . " Then , after the usual examination , since my case did not warrant more drastic treatment , I was permitted the liberties of light exercise , sun bathing , and social intercourse , provided I observed the strict regime of rest periods and diet . On my first day out of bed I was handed a card by the interne , on which was printed : " Doctor Osman asks his family to avoid all discussion of subjects tending to disturb the tranquillity that is essential to mental health . He assumes this as a point of honor which need not be insisted upon . " I was soon to discover that mental therapy was a special hobby of the famous specialist . Love , the war , and our disease were taboo as topics of conversation . When , on the day of my release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " clad in a white woolen dressing gown , I was startled by the sound of feminine laughter , a familiar contralto chuckle rising in crescendo . Amelie Duchand had laughed that way . On the sunny side of the patio , in a deck chair , a woman was sitting wrapped in a red-and-black striped Navajo blanket . At the moment I saw only a sun-browned face above the folds of the blanket , framed in glossy black braids which gave her the appearance of an Indian , an impression heightened by the authentic buck squatting at her side . He wore neither braids nor blanket , merely loose white trousers and a " store shirt , " but by the cast of his features and the red silk filet twisted about his forehead his race was made unmistakable . She saw me and called out , " Young man ! Come here ! I want you to listen to this joke ! " It was all strange to me : the white plastered walls that met sharply the metallic blue concavity above ; patients in white or colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs ; intense , garish sunlight that picked out and threw into high relief the texture and imperfections of walls , paths , clothing , skin . But not so strange as the invitation from a charm ? ing stranger to hear a joke . As I came up and stood beside her , I saw that her face we '  | not so much Indian as oriental , especially the thin arched eyebrows , ending in a straight penciled line above eyes slightly almond-shaped . " You are Byron Peirce  --  not mind reading , just gossip about new arrivals . I am Stella Perle , spelt p , e , r , l , e . This is Sam Blue Gopher , properly , Mr. ' l'ihia Weyani . Now , Sam , be good enough to tell Mr. Peirce the joke about Earth Magician . " " It is not exactly a joke , " said Sam Blue Gopher in excellent English . " It is about the beginning of the world , as my grandfather used to tell it . Since Miss Perle finds it humorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth Magician lived in the middle of the earth , but having nothing else to look at except his own feet , he became lonely . He spit into the palm of his hand , rubbed some yellow mud into it , and cast the lumps on the ground . ' You will walk and crawl ! ' he said . So there came to be all the earth creatures . He did the same with some red mud . You will fly ! ' and there were birds . He did the same with some white mud . You will swim ! ' So there were fish . But he was not satisfied . The creatures were not perfect . He rolled up two lumps of very rare blue clay . You will talk , you will fight , you will be perfect ! ' He named them the Perfect Ones , or simply the People . It is the name of my tribe . " " Yes ! " gurgled Miss Perle . " So then how did all the other tribes and races come to be  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left of the blue clay , mixed with what was left of the other colored mud . He called them unfinished . The white race , of course , is mostly white mud . But it has enough of the other colors so that white people not only run in trains and automobiles , and swim in boats , they desire also to fly . But they are the most imperfect of all ! " " And did Earth Magician , " she asked , holding her breath , " whisper to all the little lumps about what to do so that there would be more of them , instead of having to come back to be rolled by him ? " " He did not have to tell them , " said Sam Blue Gopher solemnly ; " that was the nature of the clay ! " Miss Perle 's throat was constricted with laughter but she  | managed to exclaim , " Sam ! Sam ! Let 's you and I try to find some deep-down cave where some of that mud may have escaped Earth Magician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian replied , " The difficulty would be , Miss Perle , that just when we had found it I would remember that I am a Carlisle graduate and you would have an inspiration for one of your lyrics . Miss Perle , " he explained to me , " is almost as much of a poet as was my grandfather . And I mean that for a compliment . Some day I will sing you some of his songs . " Sam Blue Gopher was not a patient . He was Superintendent of Grounds , the grounds consisting of a barren slope of sand and rock , sparsely decorated with cactus , prickly pear , and yucca , of which the crown of sword-shaped , spine-armed leaves and tall center stalk spread into a great panicle of magenta flowers . " ln the desert country , " said Stella Perle once , gazing at a yucca plant , " there 's no blushing unseen . It 's nature being exhibitionistic . Where there 's continual drouth , sex has to display itself openly and unashamed . " By that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning into her speeches . Paths winding among rocks and mesquite had been laid out over the hillside and it was Sam Blue Gopher 's duty to superintend two indolent Mexican youths in their care of these " trails , " to remove horned toads from the vicinity of the red cedar benches where patients rested on their walks , and to watch for rattlesnakes that theoretically might be around . He seemed quite content with his occupation . After a short visit to his tribe he was satisfied to remain away from them ; he had got used to the ways of white people but not to living out of the desert . When he was not busy at his light tasks , he squatted on his haunches , enjoying converse with Miss Perle and myself . Or , with Dr. Osman 's permission , he went jack-rabbit hunting in the sagebrush plain below . Those were curious days , spent a mile above sea level , wherein time and distance were deceptive , and the sound of the world at war was wholly inaudible ; for no newspapers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | letters was quickly hushed under the ban of " mental disturbance . " Age was deceptive , too . I should not have guessed Stella Perle 's had she not told me , and neither of us knew how old our Indian friend might be , somewhere between thirty and forty , I suppose . As for me , for the first time I was treated not as a student but as a person of maturity and experience . Experience . . . yes , I had one claim to experience that she could not offer . Some slip of the tongue led to the admission that I had nothing to learn about women in one respect . She wanted to know all the details ; her curiosity was avid and childlike , but my tongue was suddenly tied . " Never mind , Byron . " We had arrived at the " Stella " and " Byron " stage . " You are a man of honor . I only want to know if it 's all it 's cracked up to be . I do n't mean marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having one man around all the time . Unutterably boring . But the splash into the pool and out again . Refreshing , perhaps ? Sometimes a bit disconcerting , if your emotions get tied up with it . Were you in love ? " " Sort of , but not really . " " We 're not supposed to talk about love here , but to hell with that old medicine man ! He 's an old Hindu , with his mental therapy and sun worship ! We have to parade around in the solarium for a quarter of an hour every day in the nude . Most of the women hate it , and I hate to look at them doing it . I 'd rather run around the country naked , yes ! and get scratched by cactus ! Some day I 'll do it , too ! We 'll run together , shall we ? I 'm not really so bad to look at . Rather underdone above the waist line , but they say that can be improved with a little massage . You 're actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be raising your temperature !

All primitives have it , but it 's just different from ours . In Africa there 's some tribe where the women wear nothing in front , but they are humiliated if they are caught without a mat over their sit-downs ! " Sam Blue Gopher came and squatted in front of us.  | " When are you going to show us one of the old song-anddance ceremonies , Sam ? " Stella asked . " Very soon , Miss Pet-1c . As my grandfather used to say , the spirit is coming upon me . These things have to be approached with a serious mind . I have been making preparations . Maybe day after tomorrow will be the right time . But you will have to get up early , before daybreak , and climb a little way . " " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Byron ? " " At midnight , if necessary , " I said . It must have been about four in the morning when I was awakened on the appointed day by the sound of pebbles rattling against my window . I dressed hastily and hurried into the courtyard , where I found Stella and the Indian . Without looking at us , in silence , he set out on the path leading up the hill back of the sanitarium . In the cold still air under a steely green-blue sky the buttes and distant mesas showed gray and violet , like the contours of a planet on which all life had long been extinct . Stella was panting . " Oh ! " she said . " This is too fast ! " The Indian paused to let her get her breath , his eyes fixed on the morning star that still glittered in the vitreous flush of the eastern sky , then he went on at a slower pace . After another hundred yards we reached a level spot which had been cleared of stones and thorn bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer sticks , topped with eagle down , set toward the four points of the compass and surrounded by a number of objects which I judged to be of ritualistic significance . T'ihia Weyani motioned for us to stand at one side . As we watched he took from a pouch a handful of meal and sprinkled it about the prayer sticks . Then , facing the east , he stood motionless for so long that the stillness of the vast earth seemed to flow up and enfold us with an alarming sense of annihilation ; I felt Stella 's cold fingers clutching mine and was relieved when Sam Blue Gopher began a slow , shuffling dance within the narrow limits of the shrine . Abruptly and almost without warning a bright rim of burning gold showed above the mesa top and at the same instant the Indian threw off his blanket and stood only in a loin cloth ,  | his lean muscular arms upraised to the sky . With this gesture he began to sing in a peculiar , vibrant falsetto a chant that was an invocation to Dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests had not banished from the pueblos . " I think he wants us to go , " Stella whispered as he finished . Her teeth were chattering and her eyes looked feverish . I took her arm as we stumbled down the path . " It was wonderful ! " she said . " But I think our Indian friend is going native ! " After that morning we did not see much of T'ihia Weyani and when we did , he spoke little and often rose in the midst of our talk and left without a word of explanation . " Really , " said Stella after one of these sudden departures , " I believe the man is visiting his shrine ! There is something on his mind . He is troubled and is trying to find an answer up there . " " To me his expression is always the same , " I said . Early in September we found out about it . He came to us one day dressed completely in " store clothes " and carrying a gunny sack that looked as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake ! You 're not leaving us ? " exclaimed Stella , visibly agitated . " I am going away , Miss Perle . " " Not for long , I hope ! " " That is beyond my knowledge . I am going into the army . " " Sam ! What do you mean ? Are you drafted ? " " No , Miss Perle . I have decided to go myself . We Indians are not citizens , you know , and we have no reason to love the Government . I went away to school and 1 lost something that was good for me . I shall never find it again , or anything to take its place , and so I want to go to the war . " " What made you decide , Sam ? " Her eyes were fixed steadily on his immobile face . " Perhaps you will think it is a joke . I have tried to find an answer to a question and finally I had to go to the gods of my people . I have done everything my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , and at last the voice of  | my spirit spoke to me . It was a Gopher spirit and it told me I must go to the war . Not for honor or glory or patriotism , but to find myself again ! " He turned abruptly and strode away . The sanitarium issued a booklet called " The Conquest of Health , " written by I ) r . Osman and beautifully illustrated with half tones of the institution , showing the pueblo-like buildings on the slopes of Tijeras Mesa , the Thermal Court , Solarium , and the other restorative facilities for " those afflicted by the blight of civilization . " Among other gratifying information was the statement that " the mortality rate for the past five years is only 1.5 per cent . " It was a fact . If a " guest " did not respond to Dr. Osman 's inducements to get well , and gave indications of tending toward the incurable or moribund state , he or she was bundled off to a hospital for those in an advanced stage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the doctor 's own phrase ) of the remainder of the guests was preserved intact . The invitation to depart was , of course , accompanied by the courteous explanation that there were certain puzzling features of the case requiring a more extensive medical analysis than could be obtained at Tijeras Mesa . The patient was sent to Albuquerque for " special observation " and never returned . Stella Perle was not doing so well . Though she made no reference to her condition , she ceased to take even the short walks about the grounds which went by the euphemism of " health constitutionals . " Wrapped in her Navajo blankets and with a bright-red woolen cap pulled over her head for protection against the autumn chill , she kept to her chair . One day I came upon her very much upset over a letter she had just received . " My brother , " she said in a rapid , impatient voice , " is trying to make the aviation corps . He thinks it 's better to drop down than to flop down ! Someone told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind they use for training , maybe he wo n't have to go overseas . The ground is as hard in America as in Europe ! " Not knowing what to reply , I said that probably the training would be done in England . " England . I was there once , on a teachers ' tour , second-class ; horrible dowdy gang along , but it 's lovely , or was . Some day  | I 'll have to go again . Let 's get rich quick , Byron , and tour the Continent together . See what they have left after the war 's over  --  if anything ! " Her laughter had a bitter ring . She laid her hand on mine and I noticed the paper-white skin of it , veined like a sallow leaf in bluish lines . " No ! " she whispered with sudden fierce vehemence . " I will not be tucked away without knowing anything ! " I did not know what she was driving at . " You know , in California we have date palms for shade trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want to be a dateless shade tree ! " She giggled hysterically . " I wish you would make a date with me , Byron ! A real good hot date . Out in the sun behind a cactus or yucca , if you like . Those yucca plants  --  they shoot up in the middle and spray out into an orgy of bloom ! I want to lie out where it is hot , unclothed with you , and look at a yucca ! And know that you are looking at me ! " " What 's the matter with you today , Stella ? " I said . " You seem to be feverish or something . " " Slightly . Just a bit feverish , I guess . Came this letter , right on top of an interview with the major domo , in which he tactfully informed me that my further presence here was undesirable . Oh , he did n't say that ; merely that it would be necessary for me to return to town for special observation . You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nevertheless , the next day she went away in the ambulance car without a good-bye . After she had gone the interne delivered a package to me  --  thirty-two poems , all on the war . The dates showed that it had never been out of her mind during the whole time ; and the contents , that she was seeing , in terms of her own life , the battlefields of Europe . I remember one stanza : Grim shadows lurch across my wall , groping and helmeted ; they fall some forward  --  sprawling ; some backward , falling toward the abyss that gathers all . Love leaves them , and they can not call  | BEFORE continuing with the questions covering Byron Peirce 's married life , we got on to the subject of his brother Clyde . " I have been anxious to see my brother , " he was saying , " though I have avoided it since the . . . recent happening . He was not at the funeral . " " He is living in New York ? " " Yes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; society on the whole looks so askance at any odd behavior or noncomformity in the individual . " I agreed that the social order , generally speaking , tends toward inertia of ideas . It resents the variability of the individual and for such mutations has invidious names  --  crank , theorist , radical , as the case may be . " However , " I added , " I am skeptical of social verdicts . After all , the words of Socrates outlived his hemlock potion and the discoveries of Galileo survived the inquisition ! " " Would you like to meet Clyde ? " Byron suggested . " Talking with him might illuminate some phases of our family history that I have not made plain . " " It would give me great pleasure , " I told him . We arranged to have dinner together the following Friday at an Italian cafe , Gianetti 's , south of Greenwich Village , where Clyde frequently dined . From the sidewalk you go down four steps to Gianetti ' ? s ; that brings you into the bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers . If you wish more privacy and the special sixty-five-cent dinner , you go upstairs to the main dining  | room , whose front windows look down upon the street , and upon the Italian fruit store and delicatessen across the way . As I passed tables filled with diners who were already in a voluble and expansive humor , I experienced a sympathetic elation and a sense of adventure , for the past five years of concentrated research had periilitted few indulgences of this kind . A waiter directed me to a little alcove where the brothers had taken a table facing the street . " Doctor Bedell , " said Clyde Peirce as soon as we were introduced , " my brother tells me you are a psychologist . Well ! For psychologists Signor ( ; ianetti has a dozen or more excellent imported wines , Chianti , Barolo , and Orvieto ; for the less analytical , some first rate native products , such as Sonoma sherry , which is very soothing to the untutored palate , my own , for instance . Which shall it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Tonight I expect to absorb , rather than analyze . " My first impression of Clyde Peirce was one of disappointment . If Byron considered his brother an unusual person , a casual inspection of the man revealed only a rather ordinary individual in his middle thirties , whose manner of accenting all syllables and of giving the full " r " sound marked him as a Westerner . Tall and large boned , his hands and feet were small . A scar over his right temple extended an inch or more toward the single furrow that creased his forehead ; a chin of more aggressive mold than those of his brothers and a wide mouth with an ironic quirk at the corners ; nose well marked , with a broad bridge and expansive nostrils ; pronounced bulge along the line of forehead above the straight dark eyebrows , giving the eyes an effect of being more deep-set than they actually were . His expression was at the same time reserved and challenging , reminding me of a well-known bridge expert who had been one of my subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But of the firebrand at twenty I saw nothing in this man of thirty-six . Was that violent nature still encased somewhere in the hard frame of maturity , broken to harness by practical necessity ? He was , he told me , associate editor of the  | Financial Outlook , a weekly journal with an established reputation for accurate business news , timely estimates , and reliable forecasts . With antipasto came the wine . It was good ; so were the minestrone , scaloppine , and the chicken cacciatora that I ordered on Clyde Peirce 's recommendation . He spoke to the waiter in Italian , with the familiarity of an old patron . " My only accomplishment in foreign languages , " he explained . " I have picked up enough Italian to get by with waiters and storekeepers . The sound of it tickles my ears like music . What a race of orators ! 1 ' . ven a radio announcer for an Italian spaghetti company speaks his lines as though they were a political harangue ! Fire , rhythm , and climax : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull palavering . " " I wonder , " said Byron Peirce , " if we are not developing a streamlined American speech , derived from the rapid-fire idiom of the radio accounts of football games and prize fights ? " " I am not sure but that a compensation operates , " I said . " And against the benumbing effects of movie and radio on the young mind we must measure the hard jolts of economic reality . " " When the revolution comes in America , " said Clyde Peirce calmly , " it will be accompanied by on-the-spot broadcasts , interspersed with the latest popular song-and-dance tunes and the advertising of standard brands ! " Byron Peirce caught my eye , a quick glance as though to intimate that the " revolution " was one of his brother 's neculiarities . But I recalled that in the dark days of the bank " holidays " I had heard that ominous word from the lips of apprehensive Wall Street brokers . Perhaps the specter of social violence still haunted those closely associated with the street of a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a revolution in America as an immediate prospect , Mr. Peirce ! " I said , smiling . " Nearer than those with much to lose would wish , and further off than many radicals desire ! " " Under what circumstances ? "  | " Another war , another era of spurious prosperity will be the immediate causes ; the inability of an unstable and complex system to provide even for the modest pursuit of happiness among the vast populations that compose it ; above all , the incurable myopia and callousness of those who control the system . " " Do you believe in force as an instrument of social justice , let us say ? " " What I believe is of little consequence , " he replied , with a touch of impatience . " The very small and acquisitive minority trusts to force to hold what it has secured . Force will have to be used to dislodge it . No dominant order yields its loot gracefully . It employs force whenever it wants to . " He touched the scar on his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 said , " how in the world you manage to hold your present position ? " He grinned . " Because they do n't know , down there , much about my past , and moreover , my chief would n't give a damn , so long as I do my job well . I learned to be a printer , then I learned to be an editor ; then , because I had experienced the lash end of the whip , I wanted to see who held the handle . I wanted to know ? " he held up his left hand where the index finger was missing ? " what made the machinery go ' round that had caught that finger in one of its cogs ! For two years I worked for a statistical agency in Wall Street . I pored over thousands of figures ; plowed through books on the statistical method , business indexes and cycles , literature of the Department of Commerce  --  I ca n't tell you what dreary stuff ! Mathematics always came easy to me and I was n't bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I felt I had the dope under my hat , I went to the Financial Outlook and saw D. F. Perry ? Damn-Fool Perry we call him with due affection  --  told him my story , and cracked a quart of synthetic rye with him . I got the job of make-up editor . Perry is a tough guy . He 's never been buffaloed by Wall Street . He knows his oats , and though they hate his guts , they all buy our sheet . In the January , 1929 , issue he predicted the crash and was within three weeks of being  | right about the date . In January , 1930 , when they were still calling it the slump ' and talking of a healthy liquidation of inflated values , ' he set the upturn as close to five years off . They thought he was nuts and our circulation dropped twenty-five per cent ! That 's Perry ! 1 would not have stayed so long with any one else . " Byron Peirce had finished his second glass of wine ; his eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A more spacious plan . Light and air for all , and lines that please the eye . Pericles . That was his cure for unemployment  --  rebuild Athens ! " " He did it with the funds of his allies which had been earmarked for naval defense , " Clyde Peirce remarked dryly . " Besides , there 's the overhead of speculative prices , rake-off to politicians , and the contractors ' big slice . Remember your new State House project and what happened to it ? Well , that 's the story ! " " Some day , doctor , I 'll tell you about the State House , " said Byron Peirce . " You might hang it in your office . Lost opportunity . It 's in the attic , wrapped neatly in brown paper . A brain child , still-born . " " There are the housing projects , " I suggested . " Opportunity for good domestic architecture . " " Stop-gaps ! " he murmured gloomily . At the other tables talk and laughter crackled like fire on a hearth . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , chattered and gesticulated , not seeming to pay the least attention to each other 's words . Another party of earnest souls was debating tensely . I caught the phrase , " . . . right deviation ; he should be read out of the Party ! " Clyde Peirce jerked a thumb in their direction : " Communists , orthodox . Priests of the new order , chastising their heretics ! Talking the lingo of Moscow ! They will have to burrow deeper before they take root here . And the socialists  --  apologizing to the Church and lifting their hats to respectability ! " " And the liberals ? " I queried . " Well intentioned , but without guts . " We were getting to the bottom of our second bottle . " Rosa ,  | bella mia , " Clyde Peirce was saying , " be good enough to tell our waiter that we crave another quart ! " " Really ! " I protested . " I do n't think " A dark pretty face floated before my eyes , over Clyde Peirce 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he paid no more attention than if she were a kitten . " Miss Gianetti , Rosa , the pride of the bar ! " he said , with a wave of the hand toward us . " You know my brother , Rosa , and this is a learned doctor , who is now about to cast off the impediments of caution and restraint ! Come , doc , indulge ! In vino veritas ! Have you ever strayed , doc ? Have you ever nibbled at the illicit ? Have you ever done a little agreeable wallowing ? " He was suddenly looking flushed and satyric . I le unwound the arms and pushed the girl away . " The waiter , darling , for the love of God ! " He poured the last of the wine into my glass . " Medicine for the medico ! Yours is a dull business , same as mine . The search for mathematical verities . A hundred examples prove nothing , a thousand give you an approximation , a million lead to something like certainty ! And when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the exception ! " Byron Peirce was leaning over the table on his elbows , swaying slowly . " When we know the composition of the atom and the nature of the sid  --  what is the name ? ? sidereal universe , shall we know all about ourselves ? Or what makes a woman seem beautiful to us ? A high powered microscope makes a mountain out of a mole . I offer you the fact , doctor , that a blemish may heighten beauty . The Greeks understood that principle and applied it . They would not have sanctioned the streamlined car without a dent or so . Absolutely not ! " One of the Russian girls was staring at me ; she was not pretty but her face with its high cheekbones had a warm inviting quality . " Do you know those Russians ? " I said to Clyde Peirce . " They look interesting . I have never had any Russian patients and " " You want to meet them . I have n't been introduced but I  | have often seen them here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to our table . The Russians are a fascinating people . They are so disorganized internally that they worship organization . They are so unmethodical and spontaneous that they revere the precision of the machine . They are so emotional that they submit to the most passionless of dictators . Reverse all those terms and you get an American ! " The wine came . Clyde snatched the bottle from the waiter and , holding it up high , shouted to the Russians , " Come to our table ! We need you ! We are getting solemn over here ! " The Russian men glanced at him without interest , continuing to talk as rapidly as before , but two of the girls shook their heads , smiling , and the one who had looked at me turned away . " Well ! " said Clyde boisterously . " They think we 're cockeyed  --  a manifest absurdity ! " Ile filled our glasses and hastily emptied his own . Pouring another , he cried loudly , " Here 's to the Russians  --  superb fanatics ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " To hell with you ! I am speaking of temperament , not politics ! " He swung around to face their table . " Do n't abolish temperament , my friends ! Allow for the vagaries of self-ex-pression ! " The communist who had spoken before leaned toward us to say with vehement emphasis , " You are a bourgeois esthete ! You are an artist and an individualist . You do n't understand the materialistic and scientific basis of society . Read Lenin and Marx ! " Clyde Peirce laughed uproariously . " An artist ! An esthete ! That 's good , comrade ! That 's keen observation ! " He stood up , his shoulders sloping at an angle because of his game leg . " Say , you ! When you were debating points of doctrine at your party meetings I was being chased through the rice fields of California by a posse of Native Sons ! I was fighting cops in San Francisco while you were arguing about what constituted a deviation ! I was being treated with a rubber hose in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin ! " He reached down and shook the other 's hand . " After the revolution is the time  | to disagree ! Where 's Rosa ? Where 's the flower of the I , Gianetti ? " And , weaving his way between the tables whose occur pants stared at him with mild amusement , he passed through the room and clumped down the stairway . Byron Peirce was drawing on the tablecloth something that looked like the ground plan of a house . " I have been thinking , " he said , " of the first house I ever designed . " VIEW O PURGATORY AT the time when my brother Clyde left Minnesota for the Coast , where he later became involved in what he calls the Golden Terror against radicalism , I was still in New Mexico . After six months of the insulated existence at the sanitarium on Tijeras Mesa , the last of the monthly examinations proved to be a certificate of discharge . " Young man , " said the head of the establishment on my final appearance before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our treatment has been no less than exceptional . The latest x-ray shows the foci completely absorbed and scar tissue forming about the area of infection . Now , " he went on pontifically , " if this were a strictly commercial enterprise , we would hang on to you until you were good for nothing but living in a bathrobe . But since we have an eye to your future , we say , Get out ! Run along ! Take yourself off  --  and behave ! However , this is not saying you are free to go back to that scandalous eastern climate , just yet . You ought to have a good two years out here , to get thoroughly healed . However , if you 're a good lad and take care of yourself , with your sound constitution you may risk a comeback in another six months . But no monkeyshines ! Have you ever done manual work ? " " I was a carpenter for a year , Doctor Osman , and I have done a good deal of farm work at other times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce , what with the hell-brew on the other side . You ought to be able to get work that is n't too hard at first . Let me see . . . . " He was rummaging in his filing cabinet . " I sometimes place my graduates out here , to keep them from skipping the climate before they 're ready . Ha ! This looks good ! The Briscoe ranch up in the Culebra Range country . Belongs to the Briscoes of Pueblo , Colorado . Elevation , 7,500 feet ; the grandest park lands and canyons you 've ever laid eyes on ! You might ride the fences or if they are putting up any buildings , take a crack at carpentering . Want to try it ? " That very day a wire was sent to Pueblo , and the following day the answer came : " Arrangement satisfactory can use carpenter and general hand at forty and found stop have wired foreman to expect arrival . " On the high tableland , looking toward the Culebra Range and monumental Purgatory Peak , stood the Briscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first laid in 1888 . There were half-wild cattle out on the nearby ranges , wilder horses in the corral , Mexican hands , and Cameron , the foreman , who remembered Crook 's campaign against Geronimo and had tales to tell of Billy the Kid . Mail from the outside world arrived whenever anyone had the time ( which was not often ) to ride down twenty-five miles to the nearest post-office . During the first month I fed and watered the stock , learned to make biscuits and do other simple cooking , cut brush from around the springs and water holes , and renewed the supply of pinon firewood . As my strength increased , I tried my hand at riding and was promptly thrown ; in time I learned to handle the Briscoe horses with some degree of assurance . In the spring three carpenters , experts at log work , arrived to put up a log barn . To me this was a new kind of carpentry , requiring the use of adze , broad-ax , and double-bitted ax . I took keen delight in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , snaking in the logs , hewing them foursquare , and setting them in place to stand against all the blizzards the Rockies could muster for the next generation or two . I liked building something lasting and substantial , with the  | sweet smell of pinon chips and the rarefied breath of the mountains in my nostrils . Often as I worked I thought of the thousands of such structures that had been raised from one end of the country to the other , ? and I felt at one with those unnumbered anonymous log-hewers . I recalled , too , the zest with which Jed Wilcox had talked of his accomplishments with tools such as these . In a civilization of gadgets and machines something seems lost , as it was with Sam Blue Gopher at the Indian college . In May the barn was finished , down to the last peg in the joists , and early in June the owner came up to inspect it . Mart Briscoe was a man over sixty , all gristle and wiry energy , and his wife was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our blankets to the barn since the cabin had only one room used for sleeping quarters . For a millionaire coal man Mart was not a bad sort ; he had been a cowboy , Cameron said , and after he made money in coal he bought up twenty-five thousand acres of the range country he liked best " so 's he kin have elbow room when he wants it ! " The first week I saw little of him or his wife as they were off fishing . Spring in the Rockies , however , is a tricky season ; the old winter drifts of snow were looking mottled and shrunken and the bare stretches of spongy soil blazed with alpine blooms when the change came . The morning was mild and still . Across the scarred forehead of Mount Purgatory hung a tenuous veil , silken and motionless . Buck Lucy , a cowboy guide , came out and looked at it critically . " Purgatory 's puttin ' on his nightshirt ! " he announced . " Looks like weather . Reckon we wo n't stray further'n 011a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock that afternoon the party were fighting their way back to the ranchhouse in the teeth of a northwest blizzard . During the next three days we hugged the ' dobe fireplace except when we had to battle our way through drifts to the barn . In that period of confinement we got better acquainted with each other . I see that room now : lined entirely with old newspapers that  | showed the ridges of the logs behind them ; the adobe fireplace in the corner throwing nervous reflections on the walls and occasionally spurting smoke as the wind drove down the chimney . Cal Burt and Hodge Deakin were playing cribbage by the small opaque window which scarcely lit even its own side of the room . Mart Briscoe , hunched in a barrel-stave rocker , was staring into the fire . His face was like a dried lemon . On the opposite side of the hearth his wife , Goldina , in trim riding breeches and gray flannel shirt , sat with her legs crossed . A little more time and she might be definitely beyond youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls saved her from insignificance . Cal Burt told me she had been a waitress at Trinidad when Mart met her . " Anybody but Mart would of wind-broke her in no time . I le 's got horse sense enough to keep her limbered up . But how a skittish filly like her makes out with an old gamecock like him is more'n I kin figure . " One of the boys said something about the war and Mart growled , " Shut up ! We 've been about loco with it down below and we need a couple of weeks without it . " " Thank God Jimmy 's only twelve ! " said his wife . " What I 'm thinking about , " said her husband , " is after it 's over I want to do something about a place up here . " He turned to me . " It 's damn close quarters for more than two inside , and sometimes I want to bring up a fishing or hunting party . About three years ago , when we first thought of building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look over the site . Something big enough for us and a bunch of friends but not so big it makes me feel lost in a hotel , like our dump in Pueblo . ' Would you believe it , what he turned out looked like an Eyetalian villa ! Nix ! ' I says . Here 's your check and just forget it ! ' Now , young feller , you 're aiming to be an architect . What sort of a shack would you stick up here that would be fit to look old Purgatory in the eye ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " I 'm not an architect yet . But I 've helped build one house , besides other buildings , and I used to look over all the books about building in the college library . I might have an idea , if I tried . "  | " Then you go right off and try ! " said Mart . " We might work out half an idea between us . If it 's any good I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when I first set eyes on the Briscoe cabin its simple and rugged lines had strongly appealed to me , so much so that at the first opportunity , one Sunday , I had sketched the building with its background of pinons , banked in snow . If the new cabin could be as appropriate to its setting and have a like dignity in its proportions , similarly adapted to usefulness and mountain weather ... . My first sketches , done on a fresh piece of wrapping paper spread on the kitchen table , were wholly unsatisfactory . I put down the stub of pencil in disgust , listening to the storm 's orchestration , while my thoughts drifted to places distant in time and space . . . . Vany Tucker and her long tubular curls like unripened corn silk that I tried so hard , and at first so vainly , to capture in black and white . . . . The attic at Hardscrabble in the failing light of a winter afternoon ; trying this time in color , until Vany 's likeness came astonishingly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabin . . . for myself and for that unknown she whom some day I hoped . . . . I began to draw the ground plan . The large central room divided , not at the center , by a chimney-piece triangular in shape , its two outer faces affording a fireplace for both living and dining room . At one end , a step down into a beamed kitchen ; at the other end , a broad step up to guest quarters . . . something like these in the old cabin , only the kitchen turned into a bedroom , and the storeroom into another . In fact , the old cabin would make a suitable addition to the new , an L-shaped wing .... Ah , that was it ! Excitedly I turned the paper over , traced my drawing of the present ranchhouse , and rapidly laid in the longer lines and more massive proportions of the new section . Larger logs , of course , the largest that could be found up here , and window spaces to match ; deep eave-overhang to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes , hand-split ; the  | trim in red cedar and the doors , also , in upright , matched panels . I felt a hand on my shoulder . " That is simply elegant ! " exclaimed Mrs. Briscoe . " Sakes ! It 's a dream of a place ! " And snatching the sketch from me , she hurried into the other room . When I followed her , Mart Briscoe was critically examining the paper , turning it over to look at the rough outlines of the ground plan , and holding it off at arm 's length . " Not so bad ! " he said at length . " Looks like somewhere you could live in ! What 's this thing sticking out in the middle ? " " A fireplace with two sides , or rather a chimney with two faces , one side toward the dining-room and the other toward the living room . You see , there would be no partition to break up the effect of length . " " Never heard of it before . Could you make a drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I could , but it would take longer . I 'd have to work it out more in detail . " " Could you draw the whole thing to scale ? " " If I had a little equipment . " " Look here , son , " he said , with unexpected energy , " there is an idea here . It 's got to be worked out , though . Goldie and I 'll do some talking over this project before we leave . We 'll figure on the rooms and dimensions , and when we go down we 'll send back whatever you need in the way of tools . I want to have the whole thing on paper so 's I can start building soon as the war 's over . I 'll tell Cam you wo n't be needed on the outside ranch jobs . This thing is worth more than forty and found to you , son , and I do n't mean maybe ! Even if it wo n't be technical , it will be a starter for what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stammer , " It wo n't be a professional job , Mr. Briscoe . " " Professional , hell ! I can hire any good draughtsman to finish it up ! The idea is what counts , and you 've got it ! " As soon as the drifts had melted under the warm , bright sun , the Briscoes took their departure . A week later one of the Mexican hands brought a bulky package from the post-office ,  | and for the next two months I experienced the exhilaration , and occasional fits of despair , attendant upon my first ambitious architectural project . It was my five hundred dollar fee , plus three months ' wages as a ranch hand , that enabled me to venture upon marriage that fall . MARRY IN HASTE IT might be suggested that Dorothy Hardicut and I were in love with each other , and I believe that we were . But there are often factors other than emotional or biological that enter into marriage . The world to which I returned from the altitude and isolation of the Rockies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact glared from the columns of all the papers ; it was reflected in every face , and it seemed to be in the air one breathed , like a poisonous exhalation . The people I saw on the train coming East , and in the Union Station and on the streets of Agropolis , appeared to me , fresh from the high wilderness , positively insane with it . I arrived unannounced and walked to the office of the Rational Advocate through streets that appeared twice as crowded as when I had seen them a year ago . But the stairway to the loft was as dark and dusty as ever and the old building trembled with the clank of presses on the lower floor . The office had not changed , except that it looked , if possible , more cluttered , dingy , and uninviting . I had dropped my suitcases outside the door and stood there a moment peering into the dim recesses of the place which seemed deserted . Then a voice behind the old-fashioned roll-top desk asked , with tired impatience , " Well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I said . " An old subscriber ! " " Byron ! For the love of Pete ! "  | Ghostlike , my father rose from over his barricade , gaunt , his hair grown grayer , a beaming ghost , however . He scrambled around the end of the antique piece and seized my hand , saying over and over , " Gosh darn ! Well I 'll be switched ! You young devil ! " " Thought I 'd just drop right in on you . Gee whizz , the streets are full of people , and the noise just about cracks my ears ! " " Things are booming . New airplane factory . Worden outfit have some fat war contracts , trucks , ambulances , whatnot . Yes ! business is looking up ! " This with acid irony . " But never mind all that ! Gosh darn , it 's good to see you ! Martha  --  Mrs. Gamsby , you know ( So they were not married , after all ! ) 1 . will be glad to sec you , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk sense into the postmaster . We had our mailing permit revoked ; obscence matter , it was charged , because we ran an article advocating the right of physicians to impart birth-control information where domestic circumstances justified it . Previously the censor had ripped out all our comments on the war . Well ! That 's the way it goes nowadays ! Never mind , you 're home , and completely cured , I hope ? " " Entirely ! I was examined at Raton . The bug is out of my system , nothing but scar tissue to show for it . And , dad , I 've got money in my jeans , quite a lot , so I can pay back part " " Nonsense ! That 's your education money . What did you do , discover a gold mine ? " " No , a coal baron who wanted a house . I did n't write to you about it  --  I wanted to tell you . " " Great ! I must hear all about it . Martha will be interested , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mind ? unless , on your first night back " He was embarrassed . I hastened to assure him that I should be delighted to have Mrs. Gamsby with us . I said I was going to a hotel for the night and would look around for a furnished room the next day ; I would take my bags over to the hotel and meet him and Mrs. Gamsby for dinner . I saw that our meeting had deeply moved him and I wanted  | him to recover before she came in ; I felt nervous and excited myself , so strong was the impact of the city upon every sense and nerve after long months of immersion in the expanses of the West . " By the way , " father said as I fumbled with the doorknob , " I bumped into one of your old schoolmates the other day  - -  the Hardicut girl ; what 's her name ? " " Dorothy ! Is she down here ? " " Yes . Active in war work , I understand ; on all sorts of committees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He could not think of them as other than drafted men ! ) " You might want to look her up . " " Maybe I will , " I said briefly . " Ring me up at the Chapman House as soon as you decide where you want to eat . " I learned that there was a training camp in Agropolis , served by one canteen . I immediately called up to ask how late the place stayed open and a feminine voice answered , " Until twelve o'clock . Are you an enlisted man ? " " No , " I said , " but I expect to be soon . Is Miss Hardicut there ? " " She comes on at 8:30 . If you will give me your name , I 'll tell her you are calling . " " Never mind . I 'll be around . Thanks , a lot ! " The thought of seeing Dorothy again acted like wine ; in the bathroom at the end of the shabby hall I sang lustily a few of the countless verses of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came off better than I had hoped . Mrs. Gamsby was a good listener and pumped out of me very nearly a full recital of my experiences in the West , asking particularly about the plans for the Briscoe house . " As soon as the blue prints have been made , you must send for the originals . I should like to show them to Ward Monteith . He 's the best architect here , or in the whole Middle West , for that matter . If you could work under him , I 'll guarantee you'l ! learn more than any school of architecture can teach you . Agropolis does n't know how good he is , but go down and take a look at the Farmers ' Trust Company building , or the Patton house  | on Seventeenth Street . And in his office he 's got designs for buildings of the future that take your breath away . He has the reputation of being a little bit cracked  --  well , that 's a not uncommon designation for originality in this part of the country ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mimicking the bulldozing prosecuting attorney and the staid eloquence of Judge Fisher . " Yes , " said my father , beaming upon her with twinkling tenderness , " Bart was truly splendid , though of course I could not agree with his summing up , that our position was similar to the early Christians under Rome . I should have preferred to have stood squarely by our platform : war is wasteful , ineffective , and rarely waged for any principles of pure justice , and the proof is in the peace treaties that follow . " He had unconsciously raised his voice and the people at the nearby tables  --  it was a restaurant that served a fifty-cent dinner , family style  --  glared at him suspiciously . Mrs. Gamsby quickly interrupted . " Charles , tell Byron about the last letter you had from Max . He will want to hear about his brother in France , I 'm sure . " She spoke so clearly that all who wished could hear her words , and the diners , as though satisfied that no treason was intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingering gingerly the substitute wheat bread and pushing aside the sugar bowls , each with its little sign : " A patriot takes one lump . " " Max , " said my father , " is a captain in the quartermaster corps . They soon found out how good he was at figures . He has been lucky enough to be stationed in Paris most of the time ? a chance for a little diversion along with his service duties . He says the French girls  --  at least , of the sort the soldiers meet ? are too bold to suit him . Guess his mind is pretty well set on somebody back home . " " Do you know who she is ? " I asked with interest . " Well , the society column of one of our papers ran a line to the effect that Miss Bernice Worden had not let consanguinity stand in the way of a rumored engagement to her able and handsome second cousin now serving in France . Remember  | what a demure little thing she was ? She 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but tall and willowy , sweet face , nothing like her mother . We passed on the street and she nodded . Sam , of course , ignores me . Would n't testify at the trial as to my general good character , even when Bart asked him . So that 's all right ! Our accounts are square . " I glanced at the clock : almost eleven . " I guess you 'll be wanting to turn in , son , " said my father , " after your long trip . We 'll be getting together often , I hope . If only Clyde were back now " A troubled look ; Clyde , his favorite , wandering around out on the Coast ; perhaps get ? ting into scrapes through pride and independence , too proud ever to ask for help ; sound and reliable , and yet ungovernable ; would knuckle down to nobody . . . . He folded his napkin . Within ten minutes I was guiltily speeding by electric car to the canteen on Kentucky Avenue . When I arrived there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several young lieutenants and a few naval reservists , home on leave , were lounging about the main hall . They glanced at me with the superior indifference of the military toward the civilian in war-time . Among the uniformed helpers I did not recognize Dorothy , but in a moment she entered , carrying a tray of orders for the reservists . Her semi-military dress became her boyish figure and her handling of the utensils showed brisk efficiency . After the usual repartee with the young men , she came toward the counter to get hot coffee and saw me . For an instant she looked puzzled , then she exclaimed , " Byron Peirce ! Of all people ! " Her handclasp was warm and nervous . " Just got in and thought I 'd drift out to say hello . " " Oh , I 'm really glad to see you , Byron ! " she said hurriedly . " And I want to hear all about your adventures . But it 's impossible to talk here , I 'm always in such a rush . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd rather not . I 've made a practice of not going home with anyone ; otherwise , you are pestered to death . The boys , I mean always want to " She blushed . " You must come to see me . I 'm rooming with two other girls in war service , but  | it 's very private . My night off is Thursday ; they have other nights . It 's at 45 Larch Street , second floor . " " May I call next Thursday ? " " Do that ! Come for dinner . It wo n't be much . We have only a two-burner gas plate , but I 'll manage to throw something together . " " Let me bring a steak . " " That will be fine ! I must run . I see they 're signaling for their coffee , and they think , " she said , smiling , " I should n't waste time on a civilian ! Good night , Byron ! " " Good night , Dot ! " She was changed ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she had found a new self , away from that portentous figure , her mother . Virginal , unmistakably ; friendly with the men at the canteen , but cool and guarded underneath . She had not spoken as though she were keeping company with anyone . And her eagerness to have me call , I fancied , was unfeigned and a little more than casual . I felt singularly elated . Thursday was four days off and while I swallowed my impatience , I took the opportunity of reporting to the draft board for examination . The examiner found that my condition was excellent . " However , " he said , " I do n't think you will be called just yet . We are not as keen to take chances as some other boards . Let 's see what this climate does to you for a few months . If you test up first rate in November , you will be eligible for Uncle Sam 's outfit ! " Bob Crandall , the Cornell man I had met at Lake Winnepeka , had gone into aviation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before he left , he had had one long evening with Dorothy . They were " not exactly engaged , " she said ; everything was too indefinite , too hectic ; but they had been pretty intimate . . . . Ever since then , whenever she was alone with men in uniform , she got panicky . She told me that quite frankly and said further that it was a great relief to be with someone who she knew was absolutely safe . She said this on our third  | date , while I was sitting with her on the cheap rooming-house sofa with my arm about her . With her cheek pressed against mine she said , " Maybe it 's because I 'm tired and need a change from the thought of all those boys getting ready to go over ; I like better to hear about what you were doing in the West than anything . It must have been wonderful ! " l'hat remoteness from the dreadful things that go on in civilization ! " " Not everything out there is so fine and dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal town . The whole town is owned by one company and there 's a high barbed wire fence around it . No one from the outside can sell a dime 's worth of goods in it without the company 's permission and the company store charges about twenty-five percent more for everything than stores in the nearest towns . half the miners live underground with their families ; the other half live in horrible , moldering shacks . Think of that , out where the country is as wide and open as all creation , and the air the purest in the world ! " " Let 's not think about it , Byron . There are always unpleasant things happening everywhere . We ca n't do anything about them . But we can be ? " she pressed her bosom and hips close to mine ? " like this ! " Suddenly I began to kiss her , at first her lips , feeling her tongue moist against mine ; then her cheeks , her neck , under her chin , behind her ear . After a while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked being kissed so well ! I thought I had got over that ! Byron , you 're terribly husky ! " I moved away a few inches and lit a cigarette . " It 's rather warm in here , " I ventured . " I 'm glad , " she said , " you can be so composed , Byron . It is comforting to have someone you can trust , and still . . . go so far . " And then , looking fixedly at me , " Because , if you made me feel frightened , I would not let you come again . " That was the way it was , and that was the way it stayed for the next six weeks . We had dinners together and I dried the dishes for her afterward . Until that job was done our conversa-  | tion was light and casual . But we both  --  and I say we advisedly ? looked forward to the moment when , with the same casual air , we could take possession of the sofa , where we remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work the next day . Of her roommates I saw little , since the bedroom where they slept was not directly connected with the " reception room , " as they facetiously called it , and it was understood that when one of the three was entertaining , the others were to observe discretion . It was an odd rooming house , preserving an appearance of old-fashioned respectability which did not seem to weigh too heavily on the roomers , who were all young women . On several occasions I passed men in uniform on the stairs . The time came , however , when I pulled myself out of a tangle of our arms and legs , and reached for my hat and coat . " Going so soon , Byron ? " she asked , fixing her hair and closing the top of her blouse . " Yes ! Going ! " I choked out . " I ca n't stand any more of this ! I 've got to go away  --  I " Striding toward her , I took her in my arms . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to marry you , but I do n't want to keep on this way . It 's too hard ! " " Is it ? " she said , freeing herself with something like coldness . " Of course , if it 's hard for you to love me , without . . . anything else , perhaps you had better stay away . " And she crossed the small hall to the bedroom without saying good night . I kept my room at the Chapman House because it was inexpensive , and because its shabby gentility was less disturbing to my space-freshened mind than more pretentious places . Through Mrs. Gamsby I came to know Ward Monteith , the architect , who promised me a position as apprentice and assistant as soon as the war ended and building revived . Meanwhile , with characteristic generosity , he gave me several hours a week of instruction in draughting . As an immediate source of income , however , I had to take a job in a wholesale hardware store . From Mrs. Gamsby he had heard of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote to Mart about  | them . They arrived , together with a set of blue prints prepared from my sketches by a Denver firm , whose professional finish gave a style to the house lacking in my cruder drawings . Mr. Monteith spread out the plans on a long draughting table and examined them critically . He was a tall , loose-jointed , stoop-shouldered man , with a great mane of graying hair , bushy eyebrows , and a full beard which turned up slightly . In appearance he reminded me of a picture of Don Quixote I had seen somewhere . His voice was of subterranean depth and his eyes seemed always to be looking at an inward image . " They have altered your proportions , " he said , " and not for the better . The trim is too heavy and the roof too strongly accentuated by the depth of the overhang . " It was true , though I had not noticed it before . " Also , that front door has been made finicky . It does n't need an incised pattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a bit slick . But they have improved on your interior . That 's to be expected . You have n't much technique yet , but you have sound feeling for line and mass , which is the main thing . I like the way you tied the new building to the old one without damage to either . You did well not to balance the ell on the left with another at the right . Altogether , it 's a good first effort . " His praise pleased me so much that , in spite of my ultimatum , I decided to see Dorothy and show her my designs . In answer to my urgent message she wrote briefly that she had a date for the following Thursday but the one after that would be open . My spirits fell . Was then some other young man sitting with her on the sofa ? During the interval of perturbed waiting I came to the definite conclusion that I needed only to marry Dorothy Hardicut to achieve complete happiness . She did not invite me for dinner and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure . Her manner was friendly and cordial , but detached , as though a third person were present . Our conversation was constrained as we sat facing each other from a safe distance , but when I had unrolled the drawings , my eagerness overcame formality and I was soot '  | describing the details of the house , and my prospects for the future with Ward Monteith . " I am making a good salary now at a wholesale hardware store and I 've got that five hundred from Mr. Briscoe in the bank . Some day I expect to be making four cr five thousand a year , and , ) " Then you can design your own house , ca n't you ? " she said , smiling . " Will it be for a bachelor or for a big family ? " " For you ! " I wanted to say , but the words stuck in my throat . She looked so remote and inaccessible  --  the Hardicuts of Culverton ! " I do n't know , " I said . " It depends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing to leave , though it was hardly more than ten o'clock . With my coat on and my hat in my hand I stood awkwardly in the middle of the room , painfully aware of the inadequacies of speech . " Remember that night on the lake when we drifted around in the fog ? " I said . " Like floating in nothing at all ! " " And you nearly fell asleep and tipped us over ! Why did n't you try to kiss me that night ? " Her question took me aback . " I  --  well , when I wanted to , it really would have spilled us into the water , and later , it was no go . " " Lost opportunity , " she murmured . " Should never let it happen . " Words came then . " Dot ! It 's not going to happen , without a try . I want to marry you . I want to build a house for us . Would you , will you , when the war is over ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will ! " Then as I stood gawking incredulously at her , she added , " You might kiss me on that ! " So it came about that during the wild frenzy of the first Armistice Day , we went down to the city hall and got married , without even sending her parents a wire until it was all over . It was her last gesture of revolt against her mother , and her first step toward a reconciliation with that enfuriated dowager was to submit to a church ceremony later , with the full paraphernalia and trappings of a social affair , a program of which  | I knew nothing until it was all settled . The stentorian fanfare that accompanied the solemnizing of our union was disconcerting in the extreme . DOROTHY K. IIARJICUT WED TO BYRON PEIRCE . Nuptials Are Held in Floral Setting in Methodist Episcopal Church . Cousin Escorts Bride . Ceremony Marked by Attendance of Culvert on Notables . Father was present , looking thoroughly uncomfortable in his best black suit and white bow tie . He left , after kissing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters of Science and Philosophy and a silver chafing dish . RUE CAUMARTIN WITH his finger on the outside bell of the hotel meuble , Captain M. Worden Peirce hesitated . Should he say good bye to Natalya Rezinov or not ? Or , if he did pay one last visit , should he make known the fact that it was to be his last ? Although apparently satisfied with dinners , flowers , lingerie , and other petits cadeaux , she might this time bring up the distasteful subject of money . A six months ' acquaintanceship  --  he preferred to call it that ? had not precisely made him acquainted with Natalya . He knew that she had been born at Tiflis in 1895 , educated in Berlin and Paris , and that her father , a Russian engineer , had left his wife and daughter in France when war was declared . There they re , ( mained , while the engineer vanished into the murky shadows of the conflict . Madame Rezinov managed to find a precarious livelihood for the next two years , until illness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fared better ; and that was the sum total of Captain Peirce 's inform , tion save , of course , an intimate knowledge of Natalya 's ward robe and her taste in food , wine , and love-making .  | It was this last item that caused him to give the handle a vigorous pull with his gloved fingers . No sooner had the bell jangled within than the door opened and the plump concierge bobbed before him . " Bon jour , Monsieur Capitaine ! Mademoiselle vows attend ! " " Merci ! " he said gruffly , annoyed by the smile that seemed to him full of insinuation . Stalking past her , he held himself more stiffly erect than usual . On this occasion he would be the dignified lover , on duty bound , saying farewell with a touch of melancholy that would lend added passion to their parting . Evidently she was expecting him . Although it was after eleven , she would be having petit dejeuner as usual , and he could sit on the edge of the bed , observing the lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de nuit . She was not , however , having petit dejeuner in bed . When she opened the door to his brisk , firm knock , he saw the bedclothes thrown back , the faded green satin spread drooping in soft folds to the floor , and in the center of one of the lace pillows a pair of high-heeled pink slippers with large pink rosettes over the instep . Beyond the bed , near the window , stood a little carved rosewood table , on which was a silver tray displaying the remains of nibbled brioche , a cup and saucer and an urn of cafe-au-lait . The low rocking chair , whose neo-rocaille ornamentation had long offended the eyes of her American visitor , was almost hidden under the crumpled sheets of a Paris journal , its pages hopelessly disarranged . She had drawn back the heavy blue velvet curtains , one of which , caught by its silk cord , hung suspended at an odd angle from the wall bracket of the gas jet . Red chimney pots , sloping roofs , and the flattened dome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapestried couch with its two shaky legs were draped various articles of women 's wear , and an outdoor wrap hung from one side of the imitation Empire mirror . The room looked about as usual , and as usual she wore a pink-satin negligee trimmed with rabbit fur , and no slippers on her bare feet , a habit his outraged protests could not break her of .  | A Georgian blonde , her thick , fine-spun hair hung in satiny tangles to the middle of her back ; to Max Peirce she was the image of a barbarian slave in the court of a Byzantine emperor . " So ! " she said , backing sedately off as he entered . " I knew you would come , precious captain ! " " How did you know ? " he demanded , making a half-hearted attempt to kiss her . " When I wake up in the morning , before I open my eyes , I know it  --  he will come today , whether he wants to or not ! " She made a mou at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thanks ! But if you have brandy . " From a tall wardrobe whose cracked veneered panels were decorated in queer chinoiseries of red enamel she drew a carafe and two fragile glasses . As he took off his service cap and coat , and laid them , together with his swagger stick , in a neat pile on the rumpled bed , he watched her movements with keen pleasure , especially the way her white arms slid in and out of the loose gown . His distaste for her disorderly ways did not extend to her morning dishabille . " Personally I do n't believe in mental telepathy , " he said . " It is not mental telepathy ? " she struggled with the words " to know that you will come to me before you leave Paris . " " How did you know that ? " " Last night I read in the paper that your headquarters will move to the  --  how do you call it ? ? area of occupation , somewhere near the Rhine , I think . The Rhine is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you should take a pleasure trip to visit the castles . Now the war is over , you will see what a lovely place is Germany . " She removed the breakfast things from the table and pushed it toward the bed , which he had chosen as a safer seat than the couch . Drawing up her chair , she dropped into it with the careless grace with which she tossed her garments about , and began to pour the brandy in a steady , tiny trickle , like a druggist compounding a formula . This meticulous attention to details always surprised him ; she could spend a good half hour with her lipstick and another on her eyelashes and eyebrows . Her  | dressing was a matter of two full hours or more of uninterrupted preoccupation . " Yes , but granting you guessed I had to leave , how did you know I would turn up here ? " he insisted . " Because you will have to come to be a little tragic , to assure yourself I am being left a little heartbroken ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brandy , and my kisses , no ? " He shifted uncomfortably on the bed . " Natalya , if I do not believe in mental telepathy , I do believe in your gift as a mind-reader ! Only , you often attribute rather low motives to my actions . " " I do not consider them low or high ; they are what they are . Tu to tiens toujours en garde ! You are too cautious to go to the extreme . " She sipped her brandy , holding the glass beneath her small Gothic nose and inhaling the fumes , like a cat sniffing daintily at a dish . He gulped his down , and immediately hiccoughed . Without remark she filled the glass again . This time he let it stand . Her pink satin had slipped from about her knees , leaving a faint pinkish reflection on the under side of her legs . He stared , his eyes somewhat bloodshot . " You have swell legs ! " he said bluntly . She chortled , gathering up the glossy stuff about her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call it  --  hot shot ! And I think you practice making love on the football field ! " " Well , at least we 're sincere ! " he said crossly . " Not like these bowing and scraping Frenchies ! " " Sincere ? No doubt ! But there are layers of sincerity . You ? that is , I mean your countrymen  --  do not always get beyond the first layer . And very mixed in your feelings . You desire to have your wives pure , that is , inexperienced , and if others have given you some experience , you look upon them as somewhat tarnished , no ? Or if you condescend to marry the soiled one , it is to raise her to your elevation . You must have everything quick , at a gulp , to get the back-kick . All , or nothing ! The best , the  | biggest , the richest , the fastest , the noblest , the bravest , the most charitable , the swellest nation on earth ! " Captain Peirce wore an angry frown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can beat us in turning out the goods . Now you take Thomas A. Edison " Who is that Edison ? " " Why , do n't you know ? He invented the electric light , the same as Franklin discovered electricity . " " Oh ! " she said , innocently . " My father is an electrical engineer , and I thought he told me those discoveries were the results of the labors of many inventors in many countries . But come ! You arc not enjoying my Napoleon brandy . You are in a quarrelsome mood today . " " I ca n't help it . You always try to make me mad , Natalya ! " It was true ; the first hour with her usually included at least one violent altercation  --  violent on his part , that is . Sometimes he shouted at her ; he often wanted to choke her , and once he had actually yanked her hair in his rage . She knew how to get under his skin ; no one else was able to do that , not even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her , of the sort that made Bolsheviks . At the same time he took such satisfaction in her ultimate docility , a submission that was dynamic rather than passive , that he generally left the house under the impression that they had had the most amicable of assignations . " I do not try to make you angry , captain , " she protested . " It is you who find yourself that way . You trust yourself to be a superior being and it enrages you to have anyone look beneath the surface at what is there ? " " Well , what is there ? " he asked , sullenly . " A little boy who thinks too much of outsides . " " You are quite mistaken , my dear ! I value genuine ability and worth , and I respect the big men who have done big things in the world , I assure you ! " He picked up his swagger stick , tapping it against the sheet to emphasize his words . " Morgan , Rockefeller , Jim Hill , yes ! even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Ah , so ! " she reflected . " But perhaps a great many of those men are really little men who have done little things on a big scale . Did you ever hear of Mr. Debs , who is in prison in your country ? " " Where he deserves to he , the damned socialist ! " She sighed . " I fear you are going to be just another successful American , mon arm ! You face nothing within yourself you do not wish to admit , and you escape from thinking of all outside that is disagreeably real . To build a good automobile , a ship , or a railroad is needed a good engineer , but to build a million automobiles , a hundred ships , or a thousand miles of railroad needs not greatness but shrewdness . " He stared bitterly at her indolent blond beauty . Why in hell should a girl , who looked merely like something to have a good time with , have such a damnable way of analyzing things so that it was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she was all wrong but she came back at him with unexpected examples which it was difficult to dismiss . " According to your ideas , " he grumbled , " the fellows that get paid for doing a job are worth more than the man who can afford to hire fifty engineers and inventors ! " " And why not ? " she smiled at him . " Is the man who builds an opera house the equal of a Caruso or a Wagner ? " " All right ! Why not add the carpenters , the bricklayers , the plumbers , and the other mechanics ? Are they as good as their boss ? " " Possibly better . Possibly they know more useful things and are more of human beings . What an odd people , you Americans ! Always preaching democracy , but believing not a word of it ! There was a rich American who wanted to  --  how do you say it ? ? set me up . Because he had many factories where cows and pigs are made into canned meat , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I laughed at him , he tried to make trouble for me with the gendarmes . He called me a damned whore and I spat in his face ! " " I know there are awful cads , Natalya , but that is true of every race . But what you find disgusting in a fellow of that  | sort applies to the same type , whatever his nationality . Why ca n't you see any good in Americans ? " She reached for his hand and held it to her cheek . " My darling , I do ! I think on the whole they are lovely , Why do n't you take me with you to America where I may see more of them ? " He was startled . Such a thought had never occurred to him . For a fleeting instant he had a picture of himself living with this capricious , annoying , and delicious creature , who knew more about him than anyone else and dared to tell him ; who pricked him into talking and thinking about all sorts of strange things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the correct and charming hostess of the establishment he intended some day to have . Perhaps  --  once her silly notions had exploded ? she would spur him on to that great life-work of building e substantial fortune , of placing himself well above those who knew about his father 's scandals and his brother 's offences against decency ; would help him to erase the blots on the family ' scutcheon , so to speak . But the next moment he saw himself introducing her to the social circles of Culverton and Agropolis  --  foreigner , Russian , with bold manners and unruly tongue  --  no ! he could not see that . Besides , there was the engagement to Bernice Worden . . . not that he exactly loved Bernice , she was a suitable gir to marry , eminently desirable , in fact ; and the immediate ro to his prospects lay squarely through the Worden house i Woodmere Place , the city 's most exclusive residential section . Another thought obtruded itself as a corollary to the last this lightly phrased suggestion of Natalya 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to wangle a proposal out of him , something she could hold over him ? Play him along for months on the strength of her girlish frankness and then pin him down to a dollar-and-cents agreement ? Instinctively he recoiled , draw ? ing his hand from hers , as he said cautiously , " Do you mean we should get married ? " She glanced at him sharply . " Did I give you a fright , my cherub ? Oh , no , I 'm sure you would not care to marry me ,  | though I might be good for you . For I might be bad for you . I am too much of a spendthrift . Even now I am in need of a hundred francs . " He drew in his breath ; so that was it  --  mercenary ! My God , after he had made love to the creature ! He braced himself to begin , I am terribly sorry , but our warrants have been held up .... Before he could speak she said quickly , " But I beg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately I have still some jewels of my mother , besides a few securities that will be good , now the war is over . I may go myself to America , and I thought that if the demobilization came soon , we might meet there . " " Of course ! " he said heartily . " If you get over , you must drop me a line , although at present I do n't know where I shall be . It would be a great pleasure to see you again . " He found himself speaking in a formal , stilted manner . She had risen and was looking at a little clock in ormolu on the satinwood commode . " Mon dieu ! It is after twelve ! I must banish you at once , mon cher capitaine ! There is an important personage to see at one o'clock . It is most unfortunate  --  tragic , indeed  --  at our last . . . interview . Vita ! Vite !

" May n't I stay and watch you . . . dressing ? " " Non ! Not today , my dear cherub . It 's impossible ! You would distract me with those eyes boring my back ! I must hasten and you must go ; and love and war are over . " He got into his coat , with some difficulty as the sleeves were hard to find ; then he picked up the service cap and twirled it slowly . Natalya was humming a Russian folk air as she moved briskly about the room , hauling dainty things out of drawers . She stopped before him as he stood waiting . " Bon voyage , Capitaine Peirce ! As you say , the best of luck ! " He bent as if to kiss her but she slipped aside .  | " Good " Abruptly he turned , his face fiery , and rushed from the room , slamming the door behind him . NEXT OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endocarditis , only Mrs. Gamsby and I were at his bedside . After it was over , he looked , for all his sixty years , a very old man . His struggles had played him out . Ile had bought an interest in the job printing plant below his office when it became obvious after the trial that the Rational Advocate could totter along no further . There he toiled at the drudgery of editing and proof-reading copy for cheap circulars , advertising cards , and commercial pamphlets , while Mrs. Gamsby drummed up business , made out bills , and handled the bookkeeping . At times his stubborn intransigeance flared up in a caustic tract which he printed on his own press and mailed to his reduced following or distributed gratis to the unwary , a proceeding that aggravated his partners no little and led to bitter argument . Occasionally he delivered lectures before small groups of curious persons on such fantastic topics as " Cancellation of War Debts : a Christian Solution , " or " The Infamy of Versailles , " or " The World Entering Chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal was to reason and justice , he did not materially increase the number of converts to his doctrines . Max , or , as he now styled himself , " M. Worden Peirce , " came from New York for the funeral . His wife , Bernice , was with him ; a fragile , rather colorless person , chiseled in a cold sort of comeliness that seemed to have no hereditary connection with the crude vitality of her parents . They were both well dressed , and from a snapshot Max showed me of their home in Claireville , I judged that they lived well  --  on her money ; for Max at that time was only a paying teller in a large New York bank , where Sidney Worden , Bernice 's brother , was assistant cashier .  | I can not say that our greeting was cordial . Since his return from France the divergence in our points of view had become more marked ; he was positive and opinionated , very sure of himself and of his ability to get on in the world , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral arrangements , " he said , after we had exchanged the requisite civilities ; " they must be managed carefully . " " What do you mean ? " I asked , loth to discuss details that seemed so sorry and commonplace . " The expense and all ? He is to be buried next to mother , of course . " " I do n't mean that . Invitations , the funeral address , the right preacher for the j  --  for the occasion . " " That has all been settled , " I said , none too civilly . " The funeral will take place at Culverton in the Fisher house ; it 's only for the immediate family . Of course , the Wordens , if they care to attend . Old Doctor Graff , pastor of the Lutheran Church , will deliver the " Graff ! " Max interrupted . " He 's a German , is n't he ? " " He knew mother all her life , and father from the time he first came to Culverton . Whether he 's German or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Not for us veterans ! " said Max hotly . Then , with a show of magnanimity , " But Graff may not be so bad , after all . He 's a rambling old bird . No one will pay much attention to what he says . I 've seen to the right sort of obituary in the papers here . " " Thanks ! " I said dryly . The next day , while I was arranging for the last journey to Culverton , the undertaker at the funeral parlor handed me an Agropolis newspaper . " It 's a very nice and respectable notice , " he said , with the air of one accustomed to cheerfulness in small matters . " They give him a good send-off ! " I read : " Charles Worden Peirce , former Episcopal divine and more recently connected with publishing , died yesterday at his home on Thorn Street . He held the degrees of A.B. , A.M. ,  | and D.D . from Princeton Theological Seminary , and resigned from the pulpit in 1906 . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Worden , of Agropolis , and his deceased wife came of a prominent Culverton family . He leaves three sons , M. Worden Peirce , late captain , A.E.F. , son-in-law of Mr. Worden , Byron L. , and Clyde M. " ( The last two initials were gratuitous . ) There followed the announcement of the funeral services . A masterpiece of understatement ! The Fisher house ; my last visit . A few gaps in the family circle , Grandma and Grandpa Fisher gone , she two years before her ailing , senile spouse ; Judge Bart Fisher and his family living there now . Uncle Carl and Aunt Eleanore , after selling the Culverton house , had bought a pseudo-Spanish hostelry in southern California , where they appeared to be prospering . The cousins , male and female , had grown into young men and women , of varying degrees of likeableness or dullness ; a few newer , younger heads , among them ; the irrepressible twins of Uncle Art and Aunt Sophie , two gangling lads , surreptitiously pinching each other . A half dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wordens save Bernice , who went through the motions of meeting her distant relatives-in-law with frigid composure . Clyde , whom we had trouble locating in California , did not arrive until two days later . Doctor Graff , the venerable and kindly pastor , spoke for half an hour , recalling the generous and charitable deeds of my father ; his honesty and Christian forbearance and love of children and animals ; but of all he had fought for and against , during his lifetime , the worthy man said nothing . No doubt Doctor Graff preferred to close his mind to the unruly , obstinate , and even dangerous aspects of my father 's character , qualities that to me distinguished him sharply from other men . Or perhaps he felt that such distinctions are lost in the grave . Still , he was impressive . The women dabbed at their eyes , the men cleared their throats , and Dorothy pressed my arm tightly in sympathy . I was  | unmoved , and a bit angry , but at the cemetery for some reason I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mounds picnic park , while he told me of his first transgression ; tears came then , uncontrollably . Mrs. Gamsby , in deep mourning , also was shaken with sobs as the coffin was lowered . " The nerve  --  the brazen effrontery of that woman  --  showing up at the funeral ! " " She had a right to . I invited her . So drop it ! " " Very well . But what are we going to do about the will ? " " Do ? I do n't understand you ! " " Look here , Byron , do n't be an idiot ! I get fifteen hundred ; you get the same ; and Clyde gets the interest in the printing plant , which ought to be worth a lot more than our share . " " I do n't think it is . In any case , you know why father did that ; he was afraid Clyde might throw his money into something foolish , and he hoped that the job printing would hold him down to a steady profession . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what I ca n't and wo n't swallow is , two thousand going to that  --  that jezebel ! " " You 're not thinking of trying to break the will , are you ? " " Why not ? If we can prove he was of unsound mind , for which there is plenty of evidence , or that he was subjected to undue influence , which is plain enough , I can get a lawyer who 'll help us . " " Max ! Say , you 're crazy ! You 'd better not put this proposition up to Clyde . He 'll jump right down your throat ! As for me , I 'll just forget you said it . " " You 're condoning their relations ! You 're standing up for the worst kind of immorality , practically public misconduct ! " " I do n't know what their relations were , and I do n't care , but you give me an awful pain ! " " If that 's the way you feel , of course we ca n't get very far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He came to me , almost frothing , and said , " If I have to see that bastardly brother of ours again , I 'll be pinched for fratricide ! "  | FOOTPATH TO PARNASSUS DOCTOR , Byron Peirce was saying , during the last four years a question has been in the back of my mind , the answer to which I evaded until recently when I felt compelled to seek a solution : what is a man without his chosen work ? At a time such as this , when work for many millions is synonymous with the barest means of existence , the very question seems absurd . Choice ? I hear them cry derisively . Ask rather , what is a man without work ! To Max , my brother , the question would have been rhetorical . " Chosen work ? A man 's chosen work is that which puts him up in front  --  I mean the fellows with brains up in front of the rest . Gives him power , prestige , and money for solid ground to stand on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a substantial reserve ! " And he would have added , portentously , " As for the rest of them  --  the herd  --  yo know what the Bible says , by the sweat of your brow ! " In the period from the end of the war until my father 's cleat I found the road of my choice under the guidance of one wh looked upon architecture as something more than a series building plans ; to Ward Monteith it was both a fine art and signpost of civilization . " What individuals and nations think and feel , they build , he said to me once . " A warehouse or an ice-plant may be indicative as a Greek temple . The end of building is use ; t means , construction ; and the approach should be through p portion . But since buildings stand in air , against a backgroun. it is necessary to add color and texture . Color is the weight dark and light , texture the treatment of surface . That is t whole of architecture , everything else  --  is fixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad judgment , imitation , or swank . I ' rather see a good privy than a lousy skyscraper ! " Four years of the encouragement , criticism , and discipline Ward Monteith taught me many things . I worked a month ? the plan of a two-car garage , only to have him tear it up beca  | he said it looked as though I might have been thinking of fire engines . I went home to Dorothy , stricken with despondency . " I 'm no good , " I said . " I 'm not worth my twenty-five a week ! I ca n't even lay out a decent garage ! " " Well , " she said , " the trouble is , we have n't got a car . If you 'd get a car , you would begin to think about a garage . " " We ca n't afford a car so make me a pot of strong coffee ! " After four cups of coffee I had an idea . Grabbing my drawing board , I set to work . At four o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs to our bedroom . " What in the world ! " my wife murmured sleepily as I slipped in beside her . " I think I 've got that garage hog-tied ! " Ward Monteith , when he saw the sketch , said , " Now you are thinking of last year 's model . Make it next year 's ! " His cryptic comments no longer puzzled me , and at once I saw what was wrong with the design ; it was passable but not provocative . With the next draught , involving a few simple changes , I won his approval . Our client , too , was pleased . " It 's a bit out of the ordinary , " he said , " and not using a stock door will cost me a little more , but I like it . Yes , sir , that garage looks smart enough to hold my Worden cars , and say ! maybe they 're not the slick article ! " That year , 1920 , there was still surplus money in Agropolis , from the cost-plus profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . But the soldiers had come back wanting jobs , and so , too , did the workmen who had been employed in wartime factories now standing idle . Still , Ward Monteith had a full schedule of contracts for private houses , an apartment house , a motion picture theater , and a new county building . On these projects I was allowed to do detail draughting under his close supervision . My evenings were devoted to studying the books and plates in his extensive architectural library . The county project carried us through the slump of the following year when construction , the barometer of prosperity , fell off sharply . In that year 's work I gained a new insight into the meaning of Monteith 's esthetic credo and some understanding  | of the application of his theories to practical problems . By the time the last blue prints had been approved  --  not without altercations with obtuse county officials  --  I had begun to envisage architecture as the physical vestments of civilization . Then , for months our office breathed stagnation . With painful reluctance Monteith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day , about two weeks after my father 's funeral , he called me into his sanctum , where the finished elevations of the theater and the county building looked down on a desk kept always immaculately neat . " Peirce , " he said with characteristic abruptness , " you have possibilities and a wife . I have no work for you . I do n't know how soon I 'll be able to use you again . Things are dull , although there are signs of life in the East . How are you fixed for cash ? " " I 'm not broke . With care we can last a year on what I 've got . " " Good ! You 're a lot better off than the boys I had to let out . Now , I 've got a proposition for you . How would you like to go to New York ? " " I 'd like to go anywhere , so long as I can keep working . I hate to stop draughting . " " You need to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or abstractions . Here 's a chance , of a sort . It 's like this . There 's a firm of architects in New York by the name of Marvin , Tuttle , and Gans . The first two I do n't know . Ike Gans was my classmate in a school of architecture . He was a clever boy ; facile , nothing substantial , a go-getter . The firm , I understand , is highly successful ; their stuff is generally meretricious but it hits the popular taste . They specialize in motion picture theaters ; pseudo-Renaissance , gimcracks , and gingerbread ! At the present time they are trying to move up a peg , into the field of artistic respectability . They want a little veneer of genuine A-R-T worked into their gilded eyesores . Ike has a wholesome respect for my line because he does n't know what it 's about . He has just written to ask if I can send him a promising young man whom I have trained and who will be willing  | to work for a nominal salary the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater designing  --  meaning , until Marvin , Tuttle , and Gans can thoroughly debauch him ! Under ordinary circumstances I should decline the request with thanks and let them find their dilettante elsewhere . But I believe you have character enough to resist temptation and energy enough to pick up some useful tricks under those hyenas . In any case , it 's a job . He offers a thousand the first year , and will double it the next if the man conies through with the goods . Do you want it ? It wo n't offend me if you say no . " " It would be a chance to learn , " I said dubiously , weighing the offer with mixed emotions . " And New York " " New York may be either a stimulant or a narcotic ; it may brace you up or poison you . You 'll see sound works , done by capital fellows , and monstrosities by fakers and lickspittles . It 's a challenge ! " " I must talk it over with my wife , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure ! " he said . " Talk it over ! There 's no hurry . And if , in the meanwhile , anything turns up around here , I 'll put you on to it . " To be out of a job at twenty-six , with money in the bank , is no calamity ; one merely feels a little cocky about accepting the first offer . New York , on the other hand , city of great expectations ! It dazzled my imagination . To work even with a secondrate concern would be an incentive toward greater effort . I f I were not too strenuously occupied with my job , I might find time for courses at a university and perhaps collect a master 's degree . Ten years of working like hell might put me in a class with the best . I returned to Dorothy in a state of jubilation . She , however , did not share my enthusiasm when I explained that I was leaving Ward Monteith with two weeks ' advance salary in my pocket . " Why in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to one of those new apartments on Sixteenth Street with all the built-in fixtures ? " " There 's nothing doing in my line right now . Ward says that  | the pick-up in building wo n't come until after the first of the year , and that it will be slow . " " He made a lot of money , I guess he can afford to keep you on ! " she said indignantly . " He has kept me on when there was mighty little to do . Now there 's nothing . But ? " and here I could not refrain from a bit of self-gratulation  --  " he has been good enough to recommend me for a position in New York with an important firm of architects ! " " At how much ? " " Well , the first year it will be only a thousand . " " A thousand dollars ! That 's absurd ! Why , you have been making twice that ! " " I know , dear , but these people , you see , they are specialists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want someone to learn their methods , and it 's really a swell chance , and besides we have enough to make up the difference , and more . There 's eighteen hundred in the bank . If we lived on twenty-four hundred , next year I would get two thousand , and that would make another twenty-four hundred . " " It sounds to me very impractical for us to draw on our capital , Byron . I 'm sure you can do better than that . Besides , I 'm not sure I want to live in New York . All my friends are here and at Culverton . Mother could hardly stand the separation . She relies on me to cheer her up , you know . " " Yes , of course , " I said glumly , " your mother has to be considered ! " The need of Mrs. Hardicut to be cheered seemed rather less to me than her perpetual itch to retail to Dot all the spicy bul lctins of Culverton society in return for the latest tidbits from Agropolis , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was this , as much as anything else , that made me add , with more than usual firmness , " However , under the present circumstances , I do n't feel I can afford to turn down the offer without giving it careful consideration . " " In that case , " said Dorothy , sensing the edge to my statement , " you wo n't refuse to talk it over with mother ? "  | " Not if you want me to , " I conceded , " although I do n't know that she is wholly qualified to pass judgment on the situation . " " She is very well informed on everything ! " my wife retorted . " She has a practical mind and just lots of contacts ! " Her last assertion could not be denied , though its application in the present instance might be open to doubt . None too amiably I prepared for one of those family visits which I had generally managed to escape through the plea of urgent projects at the office . Before Dorothy visited Culverton , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we are penny-saving or poverty-stricken , " she explained . This time her purchases were more extensive than usual , a circumstance that led me to believe she was thinking better of the New York idea than at first . We went to Culverton via the interurban electric , since the fare was fifty cents cheaper that way . The travel time , however , was half an hour longer , and we passed through in succession Chesterton , Ware , Sylvania , Croftburg , Stanley , Fallcreek , Plainview , and Junction , the two-car train halting sometimes at a boxlike station or again in the main street of one of the towns , and in between stations rocketing through endless fields of yellowing corn ready to be cut and shocked . At some point on the journey I spoke of the time father and mother had driven in the phaeton all the way from Agropolis to Culverton . And of how father had submitted to the general decision of the family council that they should move out to the place in Hardscrabble . I said that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other people . " You have a stubborn streak the same as your father , " said Dorothy . " You begin to rise up in opposition even before any suggestions have been offered . Your father suffered for it and so has your Ward Monteith . " " Monteith ? How ? " " The last time I saw mother she said that he would have had much more of a vogue if he had n't tried to introduce novelties and fads in his work , and a whole lot of contracts have gone to Chicago architects because he would n't be politic about his ideas . If you do n't use professional tact , you do n't get very far . "  | " He 's gone as far as any architect in the country toward planning fine buildings ! " " I do n't see how you can say that when he has n't done a single skyscraper ! " " Size or height is not everything , Dot . He has projected some very grand ones , if only people out here had eyes for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maternal inflection , " I do n't know that Ward Monteith has been an awfully good influence . Of , course , he 's original and all that , but he 's full of visionary ideal and you had enough of those to start with . " " Then this New York firm ought to be good for me . War says they have n't a scrap of the qualities you have just me tioned . You may reassure your mother on that point ! " " You had better let me do the talking , Byron . You 're n always diplomatic when you 're around mother . " " I 'll keep quiet if she lays off the people I happen to thi a great deal of , like Raymond Hassburger . Such tommyrot saying that he got his citation through a fluke ! " " Mother got her information directly from a lieutenant in t same regiment . But let 's not go into that ! You do n't and stand how honest she is in her criticisms , that 's all . Whenev she hears what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing them . " I was silent , thinking , I hope to God this New York thi does n't fall through , and that we can get a long way off fr Ma Hardicut 's fact-finding ! We had barely arrived at the Hardicut front door and kissed in turn by the lady when she said , " Now that W Monteith has gone under , I suppose you 'll be setting up s in Culverton , eh , Byron ? " " No , " I said brusquely , " neither is true . " Dorothy pine me . The Hardicut establishment was favorably known in Cul ton for its artistic and cultural atmosphere . The living r afforded visible evidence of two European tours and numc trips to New York . Over the grand piano was draped a gcn  | Spanish mantilla , while the walls were decorated with colored prints of cathedrals , an Italian lake scene , a Swiss chalet , a view of Oxford , and reproductions of paintings by Velasquez , Renoir , and Monet . The bookshelves , too , radiated culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncut leaves . Cellini 's Nymph of Fontainebleau , in plaster , graced one corner and a German imitation of a large Ming vase another . The dining room shared the general elevation in taste , and was furnished Colonial style , with china and silverware to match , an oil painting of the Bay of Naples by an Italian artist and one of a basket of lobsters by an American . Mrs. Hardicut hurried us in to tea with Professor Leonard Doyle , whom she introduced as an authority on Byzantine coins , and a Mr. John Davidson , an abashed young man who , I gathered , was a peripatetic poet from Cincinnati , engaged for an evening 's entertainment at the Culverton Women 's Forum . From these ill-assorted elements our hostess deftly extracted the materials of a spirited discussion of modernism in art , French music , post-war laxity in morals , and the relation of mind to matter  --  all topics culled from the latest issue of the National Digest . Tea finished and the guests departed , my mother-in-law hastily prepared to take Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hardicut assured her , she would meet several old acquaintances . She halted only long enough to say to me , " Make yourself at home , Byron , until we return ! There 's a splendid new book on interior decorating in the library . Just the thing for you ! Before you came Mr. Davidson was telling us what happened to your friend , Willis Brandt . He got a girl into trouble and was expelled from the conservatory of music . I always thought his father , the professor , was a rake the way he ogled women 's legs ! Your cousin , Jane Esther Brennan , is going with a man of the same sort , the principal of the Hoc geville school . None of those Brennan girls have any gumption . They say the youngest made a shotgun marriage with that good-for-nothing Tate Hurley . " " While you 're out , " I said , " I 'll play the pianola ! "  | At a quarter past six Mr. Hardicut returned from his office , greeted me , offered me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening paper . However little he spoke , I always felt , that his manner conveyed a sympathetic interest . At dinner Mrs. Hardicut steered her monologue up and down the social alleys of the town , leaving few corners unsurveyed . By an effort of self-control I avoided commenting upon her animadversions . Finally , when we had retired to the living room for coffee , she said , " Before we all go over to the Forum to hear Mr. Davidson 's beautiful poetry , father and I would like to know all about what you children are planning to do next . We have been rather disappointed , Byron , I must say ? " Mr. Hardicut made a feeble gesture of denial but she continued ? " in the way you have stuck with a man whose reputation does n't go beyond Fairfield County and Agropolis . " " Excuse me ! " I began warmly . " Mr. Monteith 's reput ' tion " " Anyway , " Dorothy broke in quickly , " that 's all over , mam and now Byron has a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came for , to ask your advice and papa 's about this offe It 's a large company that builds theaters " " Designs them , " I corrected . " They wanted Mr. Monteit whom they know by reputation , to recommend a draughts= and he suggested me . " As though she had rehearsed her reply to my statement Mama Hardicut exclaimed , " New York ! I ca n't imagine a mo foolish proposal , unless the salary is very tempting ! " An impish desire to tell the worst prompted me to say , " O thousand . " " A thousand dollars a year ! " she almost shrieked . " What the world will you live on ? You know , Dorothy , your lath and I are scarcely in a position to " " No assistance will be needed , " I said . " We have enough more than carry us through the first year , and if I am sa factory , my salary will be ample after that . " Mama addressed herself to my wife . " How does Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives him t  | much assurance ? He has not put his name to a single building except a two-car garage that any carpenter could have built ! And these New Yorkers  --  they arc all slippery ! " Mr. Hardicut raised his right hand as though about to take the oath of office but before he could utter a protest she went on rapidly . " The whole scheme is hare-brained ! You will only be using up what little capital you have , and t hen you will have to fall back on us again . " ( It was true that 1 ) orothy had at first borrowed from her mother to buy clothes . ) " Besides , if anything happens , New York is a long way oil . Max , you remember , did not get to his dying father 's bedside ! With Clyde , of course , it did n't matter ; he always was utterly irresponsible ! " A slow-burning rage was mounting , it seemed , from my lower limbs to my solar plexus ; my head for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must think of a more practical plan . Your father knows a great many prominent architects . Ile once tried a case for a prominent architect in Chicago , or was it a civil engineer ? At any rate , your father will write to him , asking him to give Byron a position at a decent salary . Chicago is a much better place and no great distance for visiting . Bert , who was that famous architect you had as a client in Chicago ? " " I do n't know , " said Mr. Hardicut . " It will be easy enough to find out , Bert . You can look it up in your records , and then write to him tomorrow . You children can stay here with us until father hears from him . You will write tomorrow , wo n't you , Bert ? " " No , " said Mr. Hardicut . The vast , rolling bosom of Mama Hardicut was agitated by seismological tremors . " You mean , Bert , you will not write to your client for a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chicago architect for a client , " said Mr. 1 Iardicut . " I do n't know any Chicago architects , and I would not in any case take such a step unless I was asked to . " " You have been asked to ! I have asked you to ! " I got up , feeling suddenly light-hearted . " It will not be necessary for Mr. Hardicut to do any writing , " I said . " The question has already been settled . We just came  | up to say good-bye . Now we must be getting back to Agropolis to pack . " Dorothy sat rigid in the upholstered green plush chair ; her lips were pursed . " Are you coming , Dot ? " I said , moving toward the door . As she made no move to follow me , I went into the hall and put on my coat . Mr. Hardicut silently helped me into it , and handed me my hat and cane . After a moment Dorothy appeared , angry and tearful . " You might at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she quavered . " Nix ! " I said grimly . " Not even for that ! " " Success to you , Byron ! " said Mr. Hardicut , shaking m hand . Ile kissed his daughter and reached for her wraps . " And a pleasant trip , Dottie ! " It was then that Mama Hardicut executed a strategic flank movement . She rolled , beaming , into the hallway . " I have been thinking , children , " she announced , " of my cousins , the Ket ? terells . Sylvester Ketterell has a great deal of influence in New York .

With a connection like the Ketterells you will be in a much better position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Sylvester will know the right place to look for an apartment . . . what bank to . . .

" . . . so you will not disappoint our poet this evening he gives one such a complete sense of the infinite ; the Shelle of Cincinnati , I call him ! " We stayed for the poetry .  | DOCTOR IN BOIIEMIA SINCE the night I had been to dinner at Gianetti 's restaurant with Byron Peirce and his brother Clyde , I had twice dined there alone , attracted by its nondescript clientele and the excellence of its wines . Once again I decided to visit the place . I found it crowded to capacity , and from the fierce babble of voices understood that some meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . As I stood at the door of the long upper dining hall looking vainly for a vacant place , someone at my elbow said , " 1 kilo , doc ! " It was Clyde Peirce . His slightly saturnine grin encompassed the chattering crowd of diners . " Does n't look good tonight ! They 've come in from party policy and the world revolution , so there 's no chance for philosophy . In another hour they 'll all be shouting at each other . If you like , come over to my place where we can have a bit of grub and a bottle . I 've been wanting to talk to you . " " That 's very kind of you , " I said . " Are you sure it wo n't be a bother ? " " Not at all ! Glad to have you ! Can you stand cold cuts and a salad ? " " Certainly ! " The idea of a cold evening meal was not so alluring as the prospect of seeing for myself this eccentric bachelor 's living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man makes for himself reveals traits that are not always apparent in interviews . On the way to his apartment Clyde Peirce stopped at an Italian grocery and purchased what seemed to me an amazing quantity of green vegetables , some of which I did not recognize , cuts of odd-looking sausages , Gorgonzola cheese , olive oil , and condiments , remarking as the proprietor put the articles into a bag , " Ilsa does n't care for wop food , so I do n't keep much of it on hand . " The mention of a woman 's name was startling ; it occurred to me that Byron Peirce was unaware of Ilsa . Clyde made no  | explanation , and our only other stop was at a wine shop . The street was one of those curving lanes , fronted by antique threestory houses , which mark the remnants of the old Village . The house , with its front stoop and rusted railings , was like all the rest . Clyde 's rooms were on the top floor , up two flights of worn , creaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As our footsteps clacked on the last boards , the door was opened by a young woman who looked expectant but not surprised . It would have been h:u-d for me to say whether she were pretty or not ; her hair , done in neat plaits bound about her ears , was of an agreeable neutral shade and had the sheen of vitality which seemed to animate her whole figure , especially her wellmade , strong hands and her wholesome , warm-hued features in which were set a pair of ice-blue eyes . Her neck was thicker than is usually pleasing , but it conformed to an impression of rug ? gedness and health , of nerveless and impassive calm that mu have been inherited from a foreign peasant strain . She noddc as we came in . " Ilsa ! " said Clyde Peirce , with a casual wave of the han toward her . " Ilsa , this is Doctor Bedell , a friend of my brother . " How do you do ? " she said , jerking her head in a little bo and speaking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny kitchen that opened off the single lar room and began feeding a child , perhaps three years of a from a large yellow bowl . Like his mother , the youngst seemed to be brimming with vivid life ; he gurgled and co beating on the bare table with pudgy hands . " The Brat ! " s Clyde Peirce . " Is he , " I inquired with uneasy politeness , " yours ? " " Yep ! Tough little bastard ! " " Sit down , doctor ! If you find the chairs uncomfortabl there 's the bed . The salad will take a little time . " The room was not so much bare as devoid of unessential two straight-backed chairs , a plain , unstained table , a crib , box couch , a shelf of books , and a small table with a ha mirror suspended above it . A row of nails held some men garments and several articles of feminine apparel of the ki  | llsa was wearing , in bright-colored materials of foreign weave . These , with the couch cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stark ensemble . Clyde Peirce spread out the greens and other victuals on the table and began to mix the salad in a large wooden bowl , working with the painstaking intentness of a painter at his easel . From time to time he stopped to taste the concoction , then added a pinch of this or that , a few more drops of oil or vinegar , a shake of paprika , a dash of pepper , a pinch of salt . Toward the end of the complex operation he took a piece of stale bread and having smeared it with garlic , introduced it cautiously to the other ingredients , stirring the whole meticulously with a long-handled wooden spoon . It took him over half an hour , but the result justified the labor ; the salad was nothing short of perfection ! Salad , cold cuts , and a chunk of twisted Italian bread were served on each of our thick white plates , flanked by a glass of wine . When I wanted more , I helped myself . Remembering what Byron Peirce had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother 's choice of this room could be the direct influence of that unembellished mode of living . I attributed the spotless cleanliness to his wife or mistress , however she might be called . Busy with the child and the dishes , she took no further notice of us . When we had  --  to my amazement  --  got to the bottom of the mammoth bowl and attacked the Gorgonzola cheese , Clyde Peirce brought out a bottle of Moscatello Fino , and as we sipped it , his tongue gradually loosened . " I have been thinking lately of my brother Byron , " he said . " I 've an idea he 's in a tough spot . Not that most of us are n't in a tough spot of some sort or other . You might say that mine was , if not exactly tough , at least a bit gristly : feeding statistical data to a gang I heartily despise ! Still , as long as I can fool with galley proofs and fight with printers and have Damn Fool Perry to bawl me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Brat . " With Byron it 's different . You know , he was cut out to be  | an architect  --  and I do n't mean a second-rate one ! Remember when the new building code forced the use of the set-back ? Byron was one of the first to see its possibilities . His firm of cheap-jack architects had on hand a cloak-and-suit building project . Well ! today that 's still the best-looking structure on the west side  --  Byron 's idea ! And some day ask him to show you the design he submitted in competition for the new State House back home . It is n't built and wo n't be , for a long time to come . A worthy monument , on paper , to a corrupt state government ! " " Still , your brother has been regularly employed , I understand . ' That is better luck than most architects have had . There are plenty who have been close to starvation . " " I know ! I 'm not saying he has n't had luck . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred a year is not to be despised . Fifteen hundred ! Just about what brother Max used to spend on his car per annum . However , that 's beside the point . It 's not what has happened but what 's going to happen that is important . Ordinarily I 'm against butting into family affairs . Fact is , I have seen very little of my brothers since I 've been in New York . Curious , how close you can be in a city like this without seeing people . We 've simply moved in different levels . " " Is it , " I hazarded , " your brother 's separation from his wife and child that worries you , or the fact that he resigned from teaching ? " " He did n't resign ! " Clyde blurted out . " He quit ' em cold ! Chucked the job and his household at one fell swoop ! Nor , if my hunch is correct , do I blame him ! Sometimes a fellow get . to the point where he either has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Byron has n't gone nuts , in spite of what Dorothy , his wife , thinks ! " " Has she come to you ? " " Yes ! Broke right in on me when I was trying to put the last issue to bed with a hysterical caterwauling about the polite , having Byron penned up for observation , and what her minis thought of it all , and what would they think in Culverton  --  -y  | if Culverton mattered ! Blamed me , blamed you  --  yes , you , doe ! ? blamed some anonymous female who she thinks has led him astray ; blamed everybody but the circumstances , chief among which is Mama Hardicut , that old buzzard ! " " Is Mrs. Hardicut living in New York ? " " Yes ! Damn her bloated carcass ! There 's a case of cockeyed providence for you ! I Icr husband , a lawyer who was n't a bad sort , died in 1928 or t hereabouts , leaving her a tidy little estate , enough for her to live comfortably in Culverton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . You can guess what happened ! No , you ca n't ! She made money , made plenty of it , made bushels of it , right straight through the first ten months of 1929 . By all the laws of averages , judging by the phoney stocks she was holding , she should have been wiped out , like the rest of the country , when the beautiful bubble busted . But Mama Hardicut is a snooper and a clairvoyant ; she can smell a rotten egg without cracking the shell ! Around the middle of August she gets chicken-hearted about her stocks and sells the whole shooting match , outright , for cash ! Wrong again ! She did n't stick the loot into banks but into government bonds . Yes , she 's a resident of one of those gilded hostelries on Park Avenue . And every night she thanks God and the angels for rewarding her for a long life of Christian endeavor ! That , again , is beside the point . " " You think that Mrs. Hardicut was partially responsible for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially , yes ! She held the whip-hand over them when he could n't meet the mortgage payments on his house in Jersey , the one he planned and built himself . He tried Max , but Max turned him down . Then Dorothy , who would n't give up the place , went to her mother . That was just too bad ! It was what the old lady had been waiting and hoping for , a chance to horn in on Byron 's affairs , as adviser , mother superior , and Madonna of the Pocketbook ! Even to telling them how to raise the kid ! " Our conversation had been made increasingly difficult by the Brat 's release from his highchair . He was undertaking various noisy feats , to none of which his parents paid the slightest atten-  | tion . At length the woman , Ilsa , came in from the kitchenette and seizing the struggling youngster , plumped him down on the bed and deftly removed his garments . Pink-naked , the sturdy manikin cavorted around the room like a frisky lamb while Ilsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . " There 's the trouble , " I heard Clyde Peirce saying as he filled our glasses again with the thick amber fluid ; " no job , and Mama Hardicut pushing Dorothy on to raise hell ! No wonder he went a bit cuckoo ! " " Just what took place outside of the desertion ? " " Well , one night , so my brother intimated , there was something of a mental crisis . I do not know precisely what happened , but it appears that he suffered from a form of amnesia during which he was totally irresponsible for his actions . " I had drained my glass and was pushing back my chair . " I must go , " I said . " Notes to classify . A very satisfying meal , and a most pleasant evening . The boy is getting sleepy . I fear I have kept him up . " " Oh , he does n't mind , " said the father carelessly . " If there 's a visitor , we stick him in his cot and he drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything gets too thick about Byron " " You can count on me , " I said . CRESCENDO CON BRIO MARVIN , TUTTLE , AND GANS , architects , stood , respectively , for salesmanship , management , and inspiration . Of the three only Isaac Gans knew the difference between a corbel and a cavetto , or could distinguish a Romanesque arch from a Norman . Not that Mr. Gans devoted much attention to such academic mat. ters ; he was more likely to find cause for enthusiasm in a new idea for a projected theater in Flatbush that would reseml , lo the illegitimate child of a Turkish mosque and a Chinese p &.; goda . In person he was a middle-aged gentleman with tightly .  | curled gray hair and snapping eyes , whose voice hourly ran the gamut of all emotions , from cajolery to fury , lingering the longest on the note of divine inspiration . Mr. Marvin , a man of thirty-five , possessed the hypnotic eye , the persuasive voice , and the magnetic presence of a former insurance salesman . 1 lis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information , a storehouse of universal erudition from whose pages he culled such wisdom as would best serve the " personal approach " to his prospects . Gilbert J. ' Tuttle , treasurer of the company , was the rock upon whose massive shoulders rested the responsibility for the firm 's prosperity ; his shoulders also supported a head like the dome of St. Peter 's , its upper surface innocent of hair and so highly glazed that it caught reflections from the globes suspended over the draughting tables . 1 le was no amiable Falstaff . To him gravitated the horde of purveyors to the building trade , as well as its entrepreneurs , contact men , salesmen , and agents for building materials , all eager to learn the specifications for each new structure . They filled the small elevator of the office building ; they jostled each other in the confined space of the anteroom , leering hopefully at the shrill-voiced telephone girl behind the tiny window , a petty Cerberus guarding the door to the inner precincts ; they waited restlessly or patiently , fingering brief cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they usually had the discomfiture of watching Mr. Tuttle 's long black cigar roll like a turret gun to one side of his flexible mouth while from the other side issued an unequivocal " No ! " To which he often added the crushing supplement , " Not in a million years ! " Mr. Tuttle was likewise responsible for the low rental paid by the firm in its inconvenient location far over on the Vest Side , for floor space so restricted that the harassed draughtsmen touched elbows and had to climb around stools to reach their places , for office equipment of unquestioned obsolescence , for meager lighting , beggarly draughting materials , and , in general , for an over-worked , under-paid , and perpetually harried staff who squabbled among themselves while from behind the thin  | partitions the partners , in executive sessions , bellowed and barked an accompaniment to the tumult and confusion outside . In this atmosphere , Byron soon discovered , architecture as a fine art had little significance . This was apparent at his first interview . Still somewhat bewildered after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inexpensive apartment that would satisfy Dorothy 's notion of respectability , he found his way to the office on the third day and in the crowded foyer presented his name to the pert miss at the window . After he had cooled his heels for half an hour , the door opened and one of the members of the firm  --  it was Mr. Gans  --  entered , ushering out an individual whose appearance bespoke florid affluence ; a contractor , no doubt . " Gorgeous ! Simply stupendous ! " breathed the architect , fondling his visitor fraternally . " Vendome Theater , style adapted from Versailles , you know  --  the de luxe touch ! Best thing that 's been done for the Bronx ! It 'll tone up the whole neighborhood ! You should see the lounge ! If it was a private club it would not have more upholstery ! And the retiring room is a little dream , a place you would want to show a lady  --  n no , I 'm not thinking what you 're thinking ! " He ended with meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benignly , " Good morning , boys ! A beautiful day ! Where is o young man from the West ? " As Byron rose , " Ah , there yo are ! Comes to us from the famous Ward Monteeg , you knows a genius , eh ? " He was turning Byron around as if he were clothing model on display . " From out West he comes , to joi our family of go-getters ! Is that a fine young feller ? I shout so say ! Good-bye , Mr. Levinson ! See you soon , boys ! Come i young man ! " He was propelled into the frenzied chaos of the draughtin room . " I 'm Ike Gans . I 'll have you meet my pardners , Mr. Tuttli and Mr. Marvin . Mr. Marvin is from a Boston family th came in the Mayflower . Mr. Tuttle is from Brooklyn . Gre point , Brooklyn . This workshop is where we produce the fin movie houses in the country !

Mr. Monteeg says you are good , too . What college was it you graduated ? " " I went to the State University , " said Byron , dazed by his reception , " but I did n't graduate . I am hoping to take my degree at Columbia in spare time . " " That 's not so good , Mr. Peirce , not so good ! Mr. Tuttle insists his draughtsmen should all have degrees . But maybe we can get you one . We 'll see about that ! Night school and correspondence courses . 1 ) id you bring some of your work ? " " Yes , some of it , but I was working principally on detail under Mr. Monteith . " " Very good ! Now you will be working on detail under me ! Right in here , young man ! " I Ic opened the frosted glass door and pushed Byron in. " ( ail ! Toby ! I lere 's our Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin , Mr. Peirce . " Mr. Marvin , who had been striding up and down like an actor memorizing his lines , stopped short and shook hands . Mr. Tuttle , with the telephone receiver at his lips , grunted , " Hello ! " then spoke into the instrument : " No ! " Tell him I have n't anything for him and to get the hell out of here ! " Slamming down the receiver , he puffed angrily , " That runt from Coffin and Black ! ' Member what they did to the ceiling of the Yonkers Empire ? Paint peeled in three months ! Reptiles ! Swindlers ! " " Mr. Peirce , " said Mr. Gans , " has brought some of his work to show us . Open up , young man ! " Byron unfastened the cords of his portfolio and drew out a sheaf of blue prints and sketches in pencil : the log cabin , the garage , the lobby of the new theater in Agropolis , odd bits from other buildings . " So ! " said Mr. Gans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ! Not so worse , eh , Gil ? But it should have been more like a Swiss chalet , carved finials on the eaves , a second story , with a course of logs set vertical , and scrollwork around the windows and doors , see what I mean ? " He pawed over the  | designs , holding the lobby sketch close to his near-sighted eyes . " Now that 's got style ! Sure ! Only it needs pepping up . " He began sketching on a sheet of paper at lightning speed . " See what I mean ? Like the Pitti Palace in Florence ! " " But the style of the theater is Georgian , " Byron objected . " How should that matter , young man ? " said Mr. Gans severely . " It 's the effect you want to get , something of the recherche a la mode ! " Mr. Tuttle fingered the blue prints listlessly . " I do n't know if Mr. Peirce will work into our line , " he said . " That fellow Monteith ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a beginner . We might put him out on construction for a while , until he learns the ropes , as assistant to Newman . Herb can break him in . " Mr. Marvin , who had been lost in abstraction , suddenly came to life in a series of explosions like an engine back-firing . " Gentlemen ! An idea ! I can sell Peirce ! Yes , sir , I can put him on the map ! Take that Agropolis thing ! It 's got class ! As Ike says , a little pepping up is all it needs . Just the thing to show to those Newark people who turned down our last proposition ! Peirce can rough in a new front elevation , we 'll have it touched up , and I 'll take it to Newark tomorrow . What do you say ? " " But I ca n't do that , " said Byron . " It 's Mr. Monteith 's model ! " " Right ! " said Mr. Gans , as though profoundly shocked by his partner 's suggestion . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our article ! No ! Mr. Peirce will lay out an elevation of his own . We wo n't rush him . Meanwhile we 'll give him some field work under Herb . " With one arm across Byron 's shoulder he added paternally , " Yes ! We can use you , young man , and maybe some day we can sell you ! Come in tomorrow , nine o'clock sharp , and we 'll turn you over to Mr. Newman , our job superintendent . " As Byron made his way through the clamorous draughting room to the crowded elevator , he was tempted to go to the nearest drugstore and telephone Mr. Gans that he would not appear on the following morning nor on any morning .  | " These people , " he heard someone saying behind him , " are coming up . They 're getting bigger contracts every year . Would n't surprise me if they 'd be handling some big Broadway legit theaters pretty soon . " He pushed out into the roaring traffic of the rush hour , feeling small , feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and portentous life about him . . . . New York , city of closely packed millions , indifferent to the individual , offering at random fantastic rewards to the few chosen ones . He did not telephone . POTTED PLANTS THIS matter of adjustment , said Byron Peirce ; it seems to involve so many small details of living . For instance , it took Dorothy two seasons to find out that most of the flowers she had raised in our backyard in Agropolis would not survive in the window boxes of a top-floor , walk-up apartment . Planted in all hopefulness , they struggled to lift anemic stems in the brief hour or two of sunlight our windows enjoyed , then in a few weeks they succumbed to wind , dust , and the shadows of brick walls . There was the ice box . Built to hold a hundred-pound cake , it arrived with our other household goods and was unloaded from the van before the astonished gaze of neighbors and school children . Measurements on the spot disclosed that it was too large to be hoisted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it to an Italian for five dollars . We learned to be strangers to the other tenants for social reasons and friendly with the janitor for practical ones . We learned to buy victuals in what seemed minute quantities , to fulfill our wants within a radius of two or three blocks , to cease to be amazed at the provincialism of people we met who had never been further east than Brooklyn or further west than Hoboken.  | We found the city , and even each section of it , a complete , selfsufficing world . In the first glow of enthusiasm and curiosity we made extensive Sunday pilgrimages to all the monuments , parks , museums , and buildings of public interest ; then we abruptly ceased our travels and went nowhere unless some visitor from the Middle West , eager for sight-seeing , stirred us to a reluctant excursion : the Statue of Liberty , the Metropolitan Museum , or the Bronx Zoological Gardens . We became , in short , New Yorkers , engrossed by our own affairs and moving within the small orbit of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reiteration of Mama Hardicut 's query in her tenth letter , we paid a formal call on Cousin Sylvester Ketterell and his wife . They lived in a house of old-fashioned , funereal elegance , facing the park , a site now occupied by a mammoth apartment hotel . A more pompous , opinionated Tory than Cousin Sylvester it would be hard to find , though perhaps he was typical of his class . He was president of S. Ketterell &; Sons , a mortgage and security firm with a capital of ten millions . One of his sons , Clarence , was present at dinner , and I gathered from his talk of mergers , running into big figures , that he was more interested in the promotional side of the business . Clarence Ketterell was a man of thirty or thereabouts , a bachelor , well groomed , and with a hard , superficial polish that passed for character . He made much over Dorothy and expressed admiration for Mama Hardicut 's attainments . " Wonderful woman ! " he said . " A born manager ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . Organization , the essence of efficiency , is what 's making the world run today . If it was n't for the guiding hand and the efficiency of American business , this little old planet would be headed for bankruptcy ! Look at Russia  --  chaos ! Germany , with the mark at a million to the dollar ! England dead as a doornail ! Mussolini is the only one over there with sense . He ran the Reds to earth . We were speaking of your mother . Well , my guess is  | that she will be president of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs inside of a year or two ! What do you think , father ? " Mr. Sylvester Ketterell , clasping his hands behind his back as he stood before the Victorian mantelpiece , pondered the question as weightily as though it involved a large investment . " Though I am not familiar with the organization of the women 's clubs in your State , " he said at length , " it seems highly probable that Cousin Sarah may achieve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponderously , " is an important one today . As mot hers , as teachers , as club women and voters , they can be counted on to help materially in the suppression of social unrest and at the same time their sound common sense will reject all theories and isms . " " The women Bolshevists , " I suggested mischievously , " I have been told , are as active as the male comrades in Russia ! " He looked at me like an affronted cardinal . " They can hardly claim the name of woman ! " he boomed pontifically . " Nationalized creatures ! Pardon , my dear , the mention of such a subject ! Fanatical Jezebels ! " " What Byron meant to say , " Dorothy hastened to explain , " was that when women take part in politics , the more worldly minded ones try to exert as pernicious an influence as men of the same caliber . Certain women , you know , do go to any extremes ! " " A very good argument against universal suffrage , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have the vote , we must impute to them only the best of motives ! " Although Dorothy 's interpretation of my remark was not strictly accurate , I let it pass in the interest of harmony ; the entrance of Mrs. Ketterell with her sister , a dispirited lady in widow 's weeds , further allayed my jarring note . The table talk was concerned chiefly with the respective merits of Bar I larbor and the Thousand Islands , at one of which fesorts the Kett-et-ells expected to spend the summer . Mention was made of President Harding 's trip to Alaska . " I do hope the President returns rested ! " said Cousin Amy  | Ketterell , as though speaking of an intimate friend . " Last winter , when we were in Washington , we met many charming and brilliant members of his staff . " " A sound administration ! " commented her husband . " We can safely leave the guidance of our country in its hands . " And with a knowing smile he added , " We want no more college professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sylvester Ketterell and his son , when they referred to America and the Government , did so with an inflection suggestive of stock ownership , as though the country were a corporation in which they held a comforting block of shares and had a proprietary interest . Labor unrest , liberal doctrines and other economic heresies , on the other hand , were caustically spoken of as foreign and alien elements in the land of the Pilgrim Fathers . Perhaps Mr. Clarence Ketterell noticed a degree of apathy in my remarks at table for , when the tedious meal had drawn to its conclusion , he steered me to a corner of the drawing room and having offered me a cigar , said , " A bit slow with the old O folks . Ca n't alter their customs , you know ! Mother wo n't tolerate liquor in the house . Now you and your wife , my favorite cousin , charming girl ! must visit me at my bach quarters . I manage to keep stocked up on the real stuff , yes , straight from the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the good lines . He sees to it that I get whatever I want . Whenever a boat docks I throw a party . Come up and you 'll meet some real people . Some of them may be a help in your line . " He handed me his card . " Penthouse apartment , good view of the city , if you like views . By the way , there 's a chap of your name down at the Union Bank of Commerce , assistant cashier , and a very likable fellow . Any relation ? " " My brother , M. Worden Peirce , " I said . " Is that a fact ! Worden , a family name ? " " My father was a cousin of the Wordens of Agropolis , and Max married Bernice Worden . " Clarence Ketterell suddenly became animated . " The Worden Car family ! That 's a stroke of luck ! I 've had  | a big project in mind for some time , connected with their interests . Your brother , I suppose , is on friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he and Sidney Worden are members of the same club downtown . " " Fine ! We 'll have to get together , let 's see . . . perhaps we can make it next week . You and I , your brother and Worden , just an intimate little luncheon . All in the family , so to speak ! Ring me up at my office , and we 'll arrange it . Really , your coming here this evening begins to look providential ! " However little entertainment I personally got from the lengthy discussion of business matters at the ensuing luncheon , one outcome of that meeting was the incorporation in 1927 of Ketterell , Worden , and Peirce as a banking firm . June in New York ; Sunday , and we had a sudden longing for trees and grass . We packed lunch boxes , a drawing pad and pencil for me , and some magazines for Dorothy , and took the subway to Pelham Bay Park . There we loafed , looking at the Sound and talking about whether we could have a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the I ludson , perhaps , or down the Sound to Martha 's Vineyard and Cape Cod . " I wish , " said Dorothy restlessly , " it did n't take so long to work up in your profession ! " " Give me eight or ten years , Dot , and I 'll show you what I can do ! " " Oh , I do n't doubt your ability , Byron , only it seems that when we 're young and able to enjoy so many things , we ought to have the money to afford them . Look at your brother Max ? that lovely place at Claireville , a car , a chauffeur , three servants , and " " Bernice 's money ! Thanks ! I prefer to earn my way ! Your Cousin Clarence also has a slice of dough . I do n't begrudge it to him , but it puts him out of our class . He would n't get any fun out of sitting on the grass in the park , pulling edibles out of a  | cardboard box  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt air ' - gives me a whale of an appetite ! " 11 Dorothy got out the sandwiches while I finished sketching a prolific Bronx family surrounding a heap of victuals spread out on Sunday newspapers . " What you should do , " said Dorothy , munching a dill pickle , " is to play up to people like the Ketterells . They have connections and influence , and very likely know some of the big New York architects . I 'm sure that if you put yourself out to be nice to Clarence , he would take you around . He seems to like Max . " " Better than I like Clarence ! " I said . " Let Max do the toadying ! " " It 's not toadying , it 's just being diplomatic and agreeable ! Sometimes you act like your father used to , as if everyone should be independent in this world ! I suppose you 're so fond of that Gans person you would n't think of trying to better yourself !

It may be a small puddle and a rather dirty one , but there 's a chance of my getting to be a big frog in it . Right now we 've got a little theater in sight , one for legitimate plays , and if the backing comes through , I 'm going to work on it .

The picnickers were beginning to scurry about and gather up  | baskets , hats , papers , oranges and bananas , papa 's suspenders , baby 's ball , mama 's handbag , a baseball bat and gloves , and all the while a piercing voice screamed , " Sam-ee ! Ver iss Sammy ? " " There 's going to be it shower , " I said . " We 'd better run for it ! " " We ca n't , " said Dorothy ' . " That is , I ca n't . I do n't feel well . " " It 's the pickles and sardines , " I said , rolling up my sketches in a newspaper and fishing about for the other things . " We 'll take it easy , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's nothing bicarb will help , it 's nothing I 've swallowed , " she said with desperate flippancy . " I guess I 'm in for it !

" " Do n't scold me , Byron ! I ca n't stand it ! " " I 'm not scolding . It 's all right , honey ! Maybe it 's not too late . I 'll try that druggist down in our neighborhood . I le 's a good scout . He 'll fix you up ! There are all kinds of things  --  - " Later , in the subway , we gradually dried out , though Dorothy 's spring hat was shapeless and my trousers flapped dismally about my legs . The streets glistened and steamed . Subdued by Sunday emptiness and washed by rain , the long canyons of brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting rays through parted clouds . New York was tranquil and reassuring . The druggist , however , when I had whispered my worries in his ears , was far from optimistic . After some persuasion he produced a small unlabeled bottle . " It might work , " he said , " and again , it might not . You ca n't do much with nature ! Seems like nature was more interested in populatin ' than providin ' ! " For several days Dorothy was very sick at her stomach ; that was all . We were , indeed , in for it .  | As regards nature , said Byron Peirce with a certain grimness ' Ir of expression , there seems to be considerable waste and lack of system . We moved to a second-floor apartment in order that Dorothy might be spared the climb up four flights of stairs ; and five months later she had a miscarriage . It followed an attack of hysteria after she had seen our janitor 's child run over by a passing automobile and killed . For three weeks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following spring . Misfortune , it is said , draws people together , but such was not the case with Dorothy and me . She blamed me for living in a neighborhood where children played on the streets , instead of in private yards ; she accused me of having torn her from her family and friends ; it was true , we had few acquaintances at that time . And especially , she became obsessed with a growing sense of injury at the distance that separated her from her mother . These reproaches no doubt gathered force from Mama Hardicut 's letters , which never failed to recall her advice and warnings , and to raise doubts about my ultimate success . I , too , was irritable and impatient . The firm had taken on a large number of new projects with no increase in the staff and I was working night and day on a chain of motion picture theaters , planned to extend from Hartford to Pittsburgh . The small legitimate theater , my own particular pet , had been postponed for a year . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention was made by Mr. Tuttle or Mr. Gans of an increase in salary ; when I called the matter to their attention , they made vague references to a " probationary period , " and they referred to some phrase in their letter to Ward Monteith about a raise after the applicant " had been broken into the ropes . " In a buret of rage I threatened to quit ; they then agreed to pay me $12S a month for the next six months , and for the following six i months , $150 . This was the most I could secure in the way of a concession . In New York , I discovered , one is able to dictate terms when the necessity is no longer vital . With my capital ' reduced by doctor 's bills and other expenses , I dared not haggle further .  | That summer  --  it was in 1924 ? 1 decided that Dorothy must have a change and a thorough rest , but when I proposed a visit to her parents , she raised immediate objections . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You wo n't take care of yourself properly ! " " But I took care of myself before we were married ! " " That was different . You were n't working yourself to death . I 'm sure that you 'll be eating any old kind of food ! " " But I do n't like any old kind of food ! " " You 're trying to get rid of me , Byron ! " " Certainly ! If I do n't get rid of you for a while , we 'll be throwing dishes at each other ! Besides , your mother has been harping on a visit for the last six months . She 's beginning to intimate that you do n't love her and do n't want to see her . " " Of course I want to see her ! I 'm just crazy to see them all ! And it would be lovely at I , akc Vinncpeka .

And for the hotel dances  --  but you would n't want me to go to them , would you ? " " Why not ? Dancing 's just the thing for you ! You can be mother confessor to the college boys ! " " I do n't look that old , do I ? " she asked anxiously . " You look all of twenty-four ! " I lied . " Or twenty-two !

It was rather fun playing at being a bachelor again . My week 's vacation came in August . New York was having one of those hot spells that wilted its inhabitants like vegetables exposed to a merciless sun . The papers gave the daily number of prostrations , the last Side made sleeping quarters of roofs and fire escapes , the parks were opened to night lodgers . One stayed on the shady side of the street as long as possible and drank quantities of ice water . At this time I made my first acquaintance with speakeasies . They must have been fairly numerous by then , but I had neither the money nor the curiosity to explore them . With two of the draughtsmen in the office , Pat Maloney and Mark Levin , I occasionally ate luncheon at nearby cafeterias or lunch counters . One day when I was turning over in my mind whether I should go to some place like Long Branch for my vacation , Mark Levin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my table . " Come on , Peirce , " he said , " Pat and I are going out for chow . We 've horned in on a perfect doll of a joint . We 'll put you next , and you can go there yourself . It 's only about eight blocks down , off Ninth Avenue . " " Will we have time ? " " Sure thing ! Twenty minutes on the road and forty for eating . " He leaned over and whispered , " You can get a nip of the real stuff ! " We walked down the scorched street , carrying our coats and wiping the perspiration from our faces . Pat , who looked like an amiable drayman , had unbuttoned his shirt and stuffed his tic into his pocket . " Hell , " he said , " is like this , but with a seabreeze . I wonder can we get beer down there ? " " Betcher life ! " said Mark enthusiastically . " Spiked , but it 's all right , got a kick , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , twenty cents , and a large glass , thirty-five . " He went on to enumerate the prices of every drink , up to seventy-five cents for a gin fizz and a dollar for a genuine  | mint julep . The place was known to its privileged clientele as " Jean and Charley 's . " In a row of dismal , half-deserted tenements we stopped at a shabby doorway next to an empty shop whose grimy window still bore the legend : " faints and Hardware . " Pressing one of a row of buttons for which there were no names , Mark Levin said , " It generally takes a little time . I think they 've got a peephole through the old shop . If Jean does n't recognize you , you do n't get in . But he has a wonderful memory for faces ! " After a few moments the door gave way and we entered a long , tunnel-like hall , so dark that we had to keep our hands on a wall which felt greasy to the touch . Mark knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped on a panel . It was cautiously opened and we stepped into a tiny , dimly lit compartment . " Hello , Jean ! " said Mark cordially to the man who stood looking at us suspiciously . " You remember us , Levin , and Maloney . We were here the other day with Angelo ? ' Member ? We had rye highballs , about quarter past five . " " Okay , " he said in a surly tone . " Is this your friend ? " " Sure thing ! This is Peirce . Meet Jean , Peirce ! Swell fellow ! He 's got the goods ! We want to have the regular lunch and something to go with it , Jean . " " Okay , " said Jean . " Come in . " He opened another door , hustled us in , and locked it behind him . Instantly I became aware of light , good cheer , the clatter of glasses , and the genial babble of conversation . The bar was large and looked lavishly stocked . Beyond , through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining . The bar was crowded , the dining room had half a dozen customers scattered about at the plain wooden tables . " There are n't so many come in for the lunch , " Mark explained . " But you should see it at night ! Say , it 's a riot ! And you could get some good pick-ups . Pat and I had to leave just when the fun was starting . Cleaned out , both of us , but was we oiled ! Next pay day we 're coming to make a night of it , eh , Pat ? "  | " We are , no kidding ! Why do n't you join us , Peirce ? Your wife 's away . There 's some broads here later , boy ! " " I 'm going on my vacation , " I said . " That will take all the dough I can spare . Maybe , after I get back . " " What 'll it be , gents ? " A disheveled waiter in a spotted apron hung over us . " Regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your drinks , boys ? I 'm having a straight rye . " " Beer , " said Pat , " if you do n't put cyanide in it ! " " Small wine , " I said humbly . " Would you believe it , " said Mark , looking about appreciatively , " that you could find such a perfect doll of a place ? Charley 's the big fellow behind the bar . If I were you , I 'd spend my vacation in town . Come down here every night and find a pick-up . There were a couple of French girls in here the last time , were n't there , Pat ? And say , they were a scream ! They spoke French and nobody could parley-vous but anybody could tell what they meant ! Now , what I say is , you could come down here and pick up a jane and take her up to your apartment . A different one every night ! Would that be a vacation ? Boy ! " " What I want is a rest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air and water . " " Sure ! " said Pat . " He needs a rest , we all need a rest , working for those lousy slave-drivers ! Tell you what , I know the best place on earth for a vacation , it 's Lake Gagonarock , over in the Jersey Highlands . You ca n't do anything but rest there and you get crazy to come back to town . There 's a boarding house kept by a man named Williams where they have real oldfashioned apple dumplings ! " " If you ask me , " said Mark , tossing off his drink , " the best place in Jersey is along the Great Egg River . It 's so quiet you can hear your watch tick , and they serve wonderful fish dinners ! " The lunch was a pallid kind of spaghetti with a few sliced beets on a leaf of wilted lettuce for salad , but it seemed tasty in conjunction with the liquor . We dawdled over the food and  | had another round of drinks , then discovered that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Pat as we hurried uptown through torrid mazes of traffic , " we 'll take the freight elevator up and come in through the back , it 'll look like we had been to the can . " Our ruse , however , was unsuccessful ; as we entered nonchalantly from the rear of the draughting room , we had to undergo the lowering inspection of Mr. Isaac Gans . Later he called me into his office . " Look here , Peirce , " he said in the tone of a severely paternal schoolmaster , " I ca n't have this ! Twenty minutes late , and smelling like a wine barrel ! You were out with those loafers , Levin and Maloney . Bums , they are ! I 'm only keeping them because I 'm too easy . Pretty soon they get their tickets . But you , you 're a smart feller . You should n't associate with loafers like them ! Twenty minutes  --  it 's a crime ! " " Listen , Mr. Gans , " I said , bristling , " please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked here on an average of three nights a week , sometimes four . You can check that off against my lateness ! " " Now do n't get huffy ! " he expostulated . " I was only telling you for your own good to keep away from loafers . For myself , I would n't care if you was late three days a week , but it spoils the morale . It lowers the discipline ! It ruins the efficiency ! " Ile patted me on the back . " I know you 're a worker , not a loafer . Tell you what ! This is Wednesday . Tomorrow you start your vacation . That 'll give you eleven days . What do you think of that , eh ? " " Thanks , a lot ! " " It 's all right , my boy ! I want to see you get on . Some day we 'll have a fine big job for you here , make you one of us . What do you think of that , eh ? Before you leave tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night I looked up a time table and packed my bag for Lake Gagonarock.  | VACATION GIRL THE lake was about a mile in circumference , the shore was thickly settled with small cottages and a few boarding houses , and there was only one passable beach ; but it was water , and the hills about it were not intolerable . When I looked at the Williams ' boarding house and saw four old ladies toddling about the bumpy lawn , playing croquet , I passed on to the Lake View Hotel , which was small and inexpensive and fronted on the beach . Here in a boxlike little room , whose one window would only open a third of the way , I prepared to loaf and invite my soul . It was hot ; it was incredibly dull , and the twenty other guests did not inspire familiarity , yet by contrast with the stifling city it seemed idyllic . Before the girl in the pink jersey entered the dining room on the third evening , I thought I was going to spend ten days of restful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after only six years of married life I could look at another female with something more than passing interest . The pinkness of the jersey did not at all comport with the russet shade of her bobbed hair that darkened toward the crown to a mulberry-auburn . The new arrival took in the tables with one quick glance of lively curiosity and immediately settled down opposite me , an act quite simple in its brazen audacity . Before we had arrived at the dessert of stewed apricots and dry sponge cake , we were talking , and by twilight we were out walking together . Isabelle Murfree : stated age , eighteen  --  I believed her ; complexion , light , clear and bountifully made up ; eyes , dark brown , without subtlety ; nose , small , tendency to snub ; lips , child-like , well formed ; epidermal down in evidence about the chin and cheeks ; figure , unusually satisfactory , but not of the boyish type then highly prized . She was born in Staten Island , New York ; she was still a resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment store and read detective stories . She was amorous and not introspective or finicky about it . She was inarticulate , except about her clothes , which were in remarkably bad taste , and her toilet accessories , which were superfluous . In the water she was a fish , an eel , a dolphin . The day after I met her was Sunday , a day no different from the rest at the Lake View , save that it produced in the guests a more noticeable lethargy . Having determined to explore the summit of Locust Ridge , a kind of eminence that overlooked Lake Gagonarock , we got from the cook a half dozen sandwiches and two oranges and left the boarders rocking peacefully on the hotel verandah . Isabelle wore the pink jersey and a plaid skirt so short that her long legs seemed only halfheartedly covered by it . 1 wore knickers and carried a walking stick cut from a piece of ironwood . I told Isabelle that the tree from which it came was of the natural order Cupuliferae . " Cupiliferous is a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sounds like it came from couple  --  coupliferous , you know ! It 's a good word . I feel very coupliferous today ! " She squealed with laughter and her breasts shook visibly beneath her jersey . " My Lord , what a good name ! " We went through a gate behind the hotel and began to climb gradually through a pasture that was being invaded by sweet fern , sumac , and clumps of man-high young pines . Below us was the dapper little lake , embellished with boathouses and miniature boats , and bordered with toy cottages . The tinkle of a piano , the quavering of phonographs floated up to us . I was watching Isabelle 's amazing legs , clad in gray worsted stockings fastened in tight rolls below her knees , move vigorously among shrubby clumps or skirt boulders fringed with thistles going to seed . Large winged grasshoppers zoomed from the coarse grass on their brief flights ; otherwise the air was hot and still . " My Lord ! " cried Isabelle , stopping to look back . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ! " As I came up to her , she stuck out her chin . " Did you notice my rouge ? It 's kiss-proof ! Does n't come off with the hardest wear and tear ! "  | " But it looks odd , " I said , inspecting her lips critically . " Does n't match your complexion ! " " Oh that ! I 'm going to try a new face powder when I get back . And there 's a pore-cleanser on the market now that 's wonderful for blackheads and pimples ! " I began to feel that I had known Isabelle a long time . At a barbed-wire fence I held the strands apart but she plunged through so recklessly that she tore a hole in one of her stockings . " Dangerous business  --  barbed wire ! Better see if it scratched you . " She yanked the stocking down to her ankle . There was a faint red line but no puncture . " Never touched me ! I 'll run a thread through the rip when we get back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour of stiff climbing we reached the top and found it covered with huckleberries and blueberries . We wandered along , plucking handfuls of the small fruit that lured us from clump to clump with promise of easier picking , descended into a ferny hollow , and climbed again to a higher spur where a plantation of white birch saplings offered an insubstantial shade . She flung herself on the ground and finished the capful of berries I had gathered , cramming them into her mouth until her lips were stained a plum color . " I think nature 's wonderful ! " she exclaimed , throwing her arms behind her head . " Supplying so many good things free of charge ! The Indians must have had an easy time of it before white men came along . " She looked up at the patches of hot blue sky showing between the birch leaves . " I would like to have been a squaw ! " " You would have been in for a hard life ! " I said , and began to tell her of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me ; of how the women carried water in jars from the distant springs to the tops of the high mesas , or worked in the tiny fields , sometimes a mile or two from their homes on the towering rock summits . She lay with closed eyes , breathing contentedly , and when I finally came to an end she said , " Well ,  | it 's all in being raised to it ! I wish I had seen all the things you have , Byron , and heard stories from real Indians ! Some day I think I 'll go out West and live with a buck , to see what it 's like . " " You 'd be disappointed . The bucks are not noted for being warm-blooded . Their emotions are pretty much limited where the individual is concerned . " " Why is that , I wonder ? " she asked , turning on her side to play with feathered grass stems . " Primitives have a dozen taboos for every one of ours . " " That 's a funny idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know at the store . All they think about a girl is how they can get her to sleep with them . " It occurred to me that she had not asked whether I was married , engaged , or free . Perhaps she did not want to know . After all , this was our vacation time . just beyond us , through the white grill of birch trunks , we could see a boulder , as large as a house , a remnant of glacial drift . She was looking at it speculatively . " I want to climb up there , Byron , " she said , getting up and shaking her skirt . " Let 's see if we can . " We walked up to the rock and discovered that one face of it sloped down to shoulder height . I boosted her up and managed to scramble up after her . This elevation brought us above the birch tops , where we could see an expanse of rolling country and to the west the Poconos , bluish green and mildly mountainous . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air smells good ! I 'm going to get some sun on me . " And so saying , she sat down on the flat top and pulled the jersey over her head . " Then she began undoing her shoes . " Isabelle ! " I said nervously . " I do n't know about that . There are liable to be hikers coming along the ridge . It would n't be " " If you think so , you 'd better keep watch . " She yanked off her Oxfords , slipped her stockings down , and dropped the articles over the side of the rock .  | " I guess I 'd better stand guard ! " I said , and slid hastily down from the knob to the ground . As I did so , skirt , slip , and a filmy undergarment tumbled past me . Taking a firm grip on my stick , I began to prowl in a wide semicircle about the vicinity , feeling a sense of annoyance and uneasiness mingled with suppressed excitement . As I struck viciously at the weed stalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl on the rock , of whom I could sec no more than the white soles of two shapely feet . I fixed my thoughts on far-off things , on Stella Perle and Sam Blue Gopher ; further back , on my birthday party at Grandpa Fisher 's and Bessie Baker 's diversions . . I caught myself up ; that train of thought would n't do ; rather , recall the worn boarding-house couch upon which Dorothy and I sat clasped , palpitant and distraught . . . . Adultery : an ugly word , bearing the weight of generations of prohibitions . . . . In the Philomathian Society at the State University our circle of earnest seekers had solemnly discussed Free Love , the legitimacy of which we had vigorously affirmed in spite of the ribald comments of Raymond Hassburger . . . . My brother Max , when he returned from France , had been reticent about his Paris experiences ; more firmly than ever he stood for the fundamental soundness of the Substantial Virtues and decried the looseness of the times , as evidenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birches , snaky and elongated , traced the ground sloping toward the pinnacle . It was getting late . With brisk steps I approached the rock and called , " Isabelle ! We 've got to be moving ! They have early supper Sunday , you know . " No answer , then a drowsy voice , " Oh ! Hello ! Is that you ? I 've been having such a lovely time sunning . I 'm pink all over ! " She rose into view , a roseate nymph with tangled hair . " My God ! Pink ? I 'll say you are ! If you do n't get olive oil all over you quick , you 're going to be ruined ! Hurry up ! We 've got to make tracks . " She slid down painfully over the rough surface , crying " Ouch ! " at every foot of the descent and , as gently as possible , I caught her when she dropped , her flesh warm to the touch .  | " Snap into it ! " I commanded . " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ! " She dressed hurriedly and we stumbled down the slope , through brush and thickets , across the open pasture with a red sun in our eyes , until we reached the Lake View Hotel . Here , upon my insistence , she retired to salve her sunburn before coming in to dine . Even so , for the next three days she was pretty much hors de combat . The heat wave broke in a crackling thunderstorm ; it turned unseasonably cool and drizzled steadily the remainder of the week . Most of the guests went home . Isabelle and I played checkers , read what flimsy pulp literature the place afforded , and were out of sorts with each other . On Friday night a young man arrived for the weekend , a salesman with sleek hair and an ingratiating manner , and Isabelle promptly adopted him . When I left Lake Gagonarock by the Sunday morning train , I did not see her , as they had gone off , presumably to climb Locust Ridge . Curiously enough , on the way hack I was smitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy . Though I never tried to discover her whereabouts , my dreams were troubled for some time by a naked nymph , a figure sometimes voluptuously white and sometimes turning beefsteak red as she slowly revolved on a monstrous grid . At times , too , her face was that of Amelie Duchand . That fall , after Dorothy 's return , in blooming health and with stories to tell of cocktail parties and furious flirtations at the lake and the Culverton Country Club , we discovered that there were an increasing number of adjustments to make in our married life . She complained that I was becoming too slow , interested only in my work ; to me , on the other hand , it seemed that she was beginning to exhibit disquieting resemblances , in manner and opinions , to Mama I lardicut.  | PENTHOUSE FOR PARTYING DURING the two months that had elapsed since Byron Peirce first began the revelations of his past , I had noticed in him a perceptible change . At the start his manner and speech had given me the impression of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned back to the memories of childhood with evident relief , as an escape from the more pressing anxieties of the present , whatever they might be . At the same time , searching among the mementoes and snapshots of his younger self , he appeared to be endeavoring to find a clue to later actions , to be slowly piecing together a likeness of himself that would satisfy the sense of identity and continuity by which we recognize the psyche and the ego as one and inseparable . A man , let us say , in search of that somewhat discredited entity , the soul . Recently I had observed a distinct alteration : the inner man was untangling the twisted skein of impulses and emotions , weaving it into something of a definite color and pattern that he might call his own ; the outer , physical self was undergoing a steady deterioration . He was thinner , his clothing had begun to have the unpressed , seedy look of poverty . At the conclusion of his last recital , which had been unusually long , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stiff drink . He thanked me warmly , saying that he had been rather on the wagon because of an upset stomach . Something prompted me to offer him cheese and crackers from my cocktail-hour supplies . He ate with restrained gusto . As he rose to go I said , " I suppose , Mr. Peirce , you have located a new position ? " " No , I have n't , doctor , " he replied . " But there are several possibilities opening up . I 'm not discouraged . " And with almost hectic emphasis he added , " I 'm not licked ! No , not by any means ! " It was on my tongue to suggest the relief agencies , but I  | realized that under the circumstances , considering that he had recently resigned from a teaching job , there would be difficulties . " If you will permit me , " I said , hesitating , " I should be glad to make you an advance , on a strictly business basis , until you find " " Thanks ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not now . " He picked up his hat , his lips twisted in an ironic smile . " It is not often the doctor pays the patient ! " " Eric Finborg , " said Clyde Peirce as we again sampled Gianetti 's superlative minestrone , " a baker by trade , and a thoroughgoing s.o.b . At sixteen I lsa married him in what appears to have been one of his few moments of sobriety . He needed a young wife and a strong helper who would work fourteen hours a day without pay ; he got Ilsa ! That was nine years ago . She stuck it out for five years , without destroying a vigorous constitution . He resented her departure as it left him without a woman , and he had to pay for an assistant . During the next year he made himself a nuisance wherever she worked or boarded , showed up filthy drunk , surly , dangerous , a stinking , vicious cur ! Once she had him arrested and the cop , a good Catholic , told her it served her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Say ! That hound had a bone to gnaw on and he was n't going to let go of it !

Ile seems , however , to make moved the place to somewhere on the West Side below Fourteenth Street for Ilsa has seen him twice . The first time he did n't see her , but last Tuesday she ran into him in Sheridan Square , drunk as always . When he got abusive she scurried into the subway . So far , so good ; but the bastard is not dumb when he 's sober . He 'll figure out that she probably lives in the neighborhood .

" " How about Reno or a Mexican divorce ? " " Reno is out . I ca n't afford it . Even with one of these correspondence courses with Mexico , the other party has to accept service . He 'll fight it . As you can guess , we are at a slight disadvantage ; the State does n't promote illicit unions . In Russia all that would be necessary would be a declaration on Ilsa 's part , and if there was any row over it , he could be turned over to the police . Our country is noticeably backward in guaranteeing the pursuit of happiness ! Liberty without license ' ! Yet for those with dough they turn out a divorce every fifteen minutes , quietly , all pre-arranged by both parties . Friend John appears before the referee as witness for the plaintiff .

" " How long ago would you say that your brother and his wife began having the differences or disagreements that led to their present separation ? " " That 's hard to say . One does n't know precisely when two people , even those near to you , begin to head for the rocks .

Some  | community theater  --  it was in a swanky Westchester suburb , I believe  --  aroused a considerable amount of favorable comment . There was an article with illustrations in an important architectural magazine . The writer went on to say that Byron Peirce was one of the most promising of the younger men in his profession , and prophesied a brilliant future . I remember one paragraph in particular : Peirce in this miniature playhouse has demonstrated that size and cost do not measure excellence . The decorative restraint , purity of line , and structural harmony reveal a talent rare in t heatrical planning . His firm is to be congratulated . ' Marvin , ' I'uttle , and Gans , I heard later , were annoyed at the personal publicity for Byron and came out with a statement that the t heater was one of their routine supervised ' projects , in line with their policy of giving the public de luxe elegance . ' " It was about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party with both my brothers , Byron and Max , and their wives . Max was quite thick with a family by the name of Kettcrell , and the party was given by Sam Ketterell , the youngest of the two sons , in honor of the establishment of the banking firm of Kettcrell , Worden , and Peirce . Sam Ketterell and Percy Worden put up the capital , and Max , judging by the other two , supplied the brains . Max always was shrewd in money matters . " Sam Ketterell is one of those birds that make you wonder about the set-up of modern society . From the age of twenty-one he had received , beside his subsequent salary and emoluments , a private allowance of thirty grand a year . I suppose he did n't get more than an extra twenty grand as a member of his father 's concern . He was just an amiable guy , with an eye cocked for investments on which he invariably cashed in . His wife , Luella , went in for social entertainment and patronizing the arts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkling of stage people , if they had appeared in the news more than twice . I will say that the booze was plentiful and , for that age of romantic prohibition , pretty swell . " It was a penthouse , with paintings a la Matisse on the walls as you walked up from where the elevator stopped . At the head  | of the stairs a butler tried to squeeze your hat and coat in with a hundred other assorted wraps . Another butler handed you a cocktail . Inside was the great push , all drinking and gabbling at top speed . In the course of the evening , especially if you stayed long enough , you were likely to meet your host and hostess , and then you would be shown the Amazon Room , done in tropical style by So-and-so , the Midsummer Night 's Dream Room , decorated with long-limbed fairies in veils , the Aquarelle Room , which was like being in the Aquarium , or one of the bathrooms whose decor suggested a first-class brothel . " Luella really was n't so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brisk , with a quick , fox-like sagacity that could scamper easily from Jung and Adler to Stravinsky , O'Keefe , Rivera , and Le Corbusier . In the midst of this lavish display of the higher intelligence , Sam Ketterell wandered about , nursing an inferiority complex , and obligingly urging you to have another . " They asked me up because I was fooling around in Wall Street and was Max 's brother . They asked Byron because he had done a theater that rated a three-thousand word spread in the Architectural Trend . " Working my way through the crush , I saw Max , immaculate in evening clothes , with Bernice , his wife , and another young woman , in a combination of magenta and coral , who struck me as strange but was lovely to look at for the moment , wholly artificial and bizarre . " There are times , especially if you have had just the right amount of liquor , and not too much , when your mind is illuminated with a kind of vision of reality  --  whether it corresponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came upon my brother Max among the perfumed and perspiring guests of Sam Ketterell , I saw him , not as my near of kin and the previous occupant of my mother 's womb , but as a lad with whom I had tramped dusty roads , with whom I had spun tops and tossed jackknives at a time when five years makes all the difference in the world ; I saw him as my elder who had somehow become my junior . I swear to Christ he looked to me no older than the day when the Governor of the State made a speech  | in Courthouse Square at Culverton , and Max had the rare privilege of shaking hands with the distinguished politician who has since been convicted for various peccadillos ! " Bernice , whom I had seen only once , at the time of my father 's death , revived the impression I had of her : a statuesque person , vaguely defined as a character , and in her own estimation immeasurably superior to the common run of mankind . Max , I felt sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haloed by the Worden name and dough . " He had hooked onto Bernice , onto Worden and Kettercll , and he could forget that he was the son of my dad . As I came up , he favored me with a cordial smile . My brother , Clyde , ' he said to the exotic lady , who dabbles in Wall Street . Clyde , the Comtesse de la Vernaise ! ' " " ' Hello , Mr. Peirce , ' said the Comtesse de la Vernaise in good Chicagoese , how are you ? ' Well enough to dance , ' I said . There 's music somewhere in this establishment if we can get out of the bargain-counter jam ! ' " We wormed our way through the press to the Venetian Room , where space was reserved for a dozen couples to dance , and I found her so light on the feet that I forgot my own awkwardness . In no time I discovered that she was born Sally Pratt , had known the Wordens for fifteen years , and that her husband , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months of the year she was relieved of his not-too-welcome presence . A strange creature , airy and insubstantial , flitting with the season to the right spot  --  Newport , Palm Beach , Lake Placid , London , Deauville , the Riviera ; restless and eager for something to turn up in the way of an affair . I guessed that Percy Worden supplied the immediate demand . She was the first of that sort I had ever bumped into , and I had just enough drinks aboard to be taken with her . " ' Your brother Max tells me you are the wild one of the family , ' she said as we sailed around . " One of us had to fly over the cuckoo 's nest . ' " Out-cuckooing the cuckoo ! I adore wild men ! You remind me of a Brazilian I knew in Paris ; could n't go back because he  | had potted a government official in a revolution that blew up before it got started . Manoel was ardent . Are you ardent , Mr. Peirce ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present moment I am ! ' " Let 's stop for a drink . We ought to get well lit tonight . You do n't look as though you let yourself go very often . ' " There is rarely an occasion for it . ' " At the private bar I found Byron , looking uncomfortable in evening clothes ; he ca n't wear a dress shirt without the front popping out while his tie gets screwed around under his ear . Still , in any crowd you pick him out as somebody . A good scout ? and I say it without family feeling , which I 've never had ! He was talking to a short man with a professional look about him , an engineer for one of the big electrical companies , who was holding something in his hand that Byron wanted me to see . " Will you show that film to my brother ? ' he asked . " The engineer handed me a small strip of tightly coiled celluloid . Hold it up to the light , ' he said . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny pictures , with a dark band along one side . Sound track , ' the chap explained . Picture and sound on the same film ! The talkies are no longer an experiment ! ' " Byron was excited . It 's revolutionary ! ' he said . Upsets the whole industry ! It means I 've got to brush up on physics for the next six months . " Why ? What 's it got to do with you ? " Acoustics . We 're not building movie theaters for sound ; we should be . We must ! " Do you think you can sell the idea to Ike Gans ? ' He 'll have to see it ! I 'll make him see it ! If he does n't , I 'll quit them ! ' " Dorothy drifted over on the arm of Percy Worden . To me Percy has always been a pain in the neck . He 's a snob of the first water and views the lower orders with infinite condescension . We have never been fond of each other . This evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pleasant to me and Byron . When Percy is being natural , he 's unpalatable , but when he 's trying to be nice , he 's obnoxious . " Glad to see you , Clyde my boy ! ' he said , with a gurgle  | that was supposed to represent cordiality . Hear you 're nibbling in the Street . Going to take a flyer ? ' " ' In figures , ' I said ; not stocks ! ' " Getting to be one of those statistical birds , eh ? Well , they serve a purpose , I suppose ! Got to have some one counting the grains when the chickens are being fed ! Our dance , I believe , Countess ! ' With some satisfaction I noticed that she was borne off reluctantly . Byron had moved into a vacant corner with the engineer and Dorothy sidled over to me . In spite of her careful makeup and smart clothes  --  they must have cost Byron something  --  she showed that she was all of thirty . They had been married over eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still getting only twenty-five hundred , out of which they were paying installments on a lot in Jersey . It was plain that she resented the fact that most of the women present gave evidence of having money and servants . She had been a pretty , vivacious girl , with a circle of admirers and a reputation for mild heart-breaking ; now her face in repose was cast in lines of envy and dissatisfaction . We had a drink together . " Clyde , ' she said , I wish you would do something for me . Get Byron away from that dreadful little professor , or whatever he is ! ' " I believe , ' I said , he is known as one of the greatest electrical wizards of the country ! ' " I do n't care ! ' she pouted . There are much more important people here Byron should meet . He 's so stupid about not making the right contacts . Why , this apartment is simply oozing millions ! ' It looks it ! ' Percy Worden would take Byron around , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet Byron , and when I bring them over he gawks at them and says , How do you do ? ' as if they were just ordinary folks from back home . Please , Clyde , do something about it ! ' " Sorry , Dorothy , but I 'm against social persuasion . I 'm pulling out of here soon myself . The atmosphere is too thick . ' " ' Then I 'll see if a wife is to have no consideration from her husband ! ' And quitting me , she swooped down on the pair in the corner . A few minutes later I saw my brother being towed p 300 along through the mob toward a group of Sam Kettcrell 's pals and their dames . Byron looked gloomy and disturbed . Watch out , I thought , there lie the reefs ! " While Clyde Peirce talked , we had moved at a leisurely pace through several delectable items of Gianetti 's menu , and now had arrived at apples , Bel Paese cheese , crackers , and another bottle of wine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He grinned , sipping his wine reflectively . " That was a fantastic night , as well as I can recall it . Instead of going home , I went to Harlem . You see , I lingered at the bar , pleasantly solo , got to chinning with the butler who served the drinks , and discovered that he had once been a waiter in Tacoma . That started reminiscences , and he gave me especially good service . About two o'clock the party thinned out and I re called vaguely that I was a working man . I had the butler steer me to my belongings . Going down the stairway to the elevator I got fascinated by one of the paintings and sat down to admire it . The more I looked at it , the more I saw in it . Then a small party spilled onto the landing above , a half dozen men and women , hilariously vocal , and I heard the voice of Countess Sally : Praise God and little Jesus , here 's our adorable Mr. Peirce ! We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetheart , we 're all going to Harlem ! Where 's Connie ? Some one go get Connie ! Tell her we 've got another man ! ' Hands helped me up , protesting feebly ; I was trying to count the pas sengers in the elevator , but gave it up ; someone had a car , someone else had a car ; we got into two cars . Several people had flasks ; lights blurred outside , got smaller as we swung into Central Park ; I found myself holding a strange young woman on my lap , murmuring that she was awful nice . Perfume was sweet and stifling ; someone lowered a window ; a cold , wintry current of air revived me . " We went to a place that was crowded to suffocation , where an entertainer was doing the Black Bottom on a small dance floor , roped in from the crowd . When the entertainers did not have the floor , we milled slowly about to Blues rhythm , couple  | touching couple , feet shuffling , bodies locked together . After an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where entertainers were doing the Black Bottom with variations . Here , after much drinking and dancing , we had chitterlins and fried chicken , Southern style . " The alternating orchestras were good , so was the food ; so , too , were my dances with Countess Sally . After a time she began to get serious . " ' Clyde , ' she said as we floated on the slow beat of dirgelike Blues . I 'm a lost woman ! Do n't let that Percy Worden take me home ! 1 Ie 's destroying my character , Clyde ! You must save me from him tonight ! ' " I never did like Percy , ' I said , and any old time you want to be saved , I 'm right here to do it ! ' " You 're adorable ! A perfect wild man ! ' " You 're not so bad , yourself ! Even if you are an orchid ! ' " What 's wrong with an orchid ? ' " Parasite  --  just a beautiful , fascinating parasite ! Something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for money , Clyde ! Oh no ! I 've got plenty . Virility  --  that 's what gets me . A man who can fight for a woman ! ' " Percy Worden was of our party , and he was getting sore . He was getting sore and I was getting bellicose . It seemed to me he was trying to insult Countess Sally , and he did insult Inc . I remember overturning a chair as I made a lunge for him , fighting off three waiters and being dragged toward the cloak room . When I came to , I was in a cab with Sally , kissing her furiously . " It was an unexpected termination to a fantastic night  --  I mean , what happened after that . I hope she was satisfied . At eight o'clock in the morning I blew out of her apartment , wondering how in hell it had all come about . Good morning , sir ! ' said the doorman , a trifle sardonically . Shall I call a cab ? ' No , ' I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9:30 I was at my office desk , staring dazedly at a heap of charts : automobile production for the year 1926 ; business  | index for the past six months ; estimates on income tax returns . Morning paper ; funding agreements negotiated with all debtor governments ; war-debt payments assured ; era of unprecedented prosperity predicted . Speed-up in industry ; production unlimited , said experts , prophesying enormous increase in national wealth . Building race , new skyscrapers planned to top all previous records for height and floor space . . . newer , faster , bigger , richer , stronger . . . . New York , the world 's Gibraltar of finance ! " Yes ! It was all slightly fantastic ! "  | V. ALEMBIC VISITOU I ' ' ROM HOME A FEW weeks after the Sam Ketterells ' party Walter Simms of Daleville came to New York on his first visit . Byron Peirce had last seen him in i 92o when the old Single Taxer drove down to Agropolis to attend a horticultural exhibit and stayed a short time with Charles Worden Peirce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a look at the place where the Unearned Increment has the biggest chance to grow , you know our Great Printer once ran for mayor there and might of got it if he had n't died . I guess New York has forgotten him . Not to be a trouble to you , Byron , if you can locate a good hotel for me at one or one-fifty I will be obliged . The main thing I want to see before Death forecloses on this carcass is the Annual Flower show . Maybe there is a hotel near the depot , if so I will try it as all I need is somewhere to stretch out . " " Good lord ! " said Byron , passing the pencilled sheet to I ) orothy . " A dollar or a dollar and a half ! " " There are plenty of places ! " she snapped . " Third Avenue below Fourteenth Street or over on the West Side , Eighth and Ninth Avenues . I 've seen them . Signs in red lights : Transients , one dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't see that you have to bother about finding rooms for anyone who comes along ! " " He 's not anyone who comes along , Dot . Ile was my father 's best friend . When we were kids , he was very good to us . " " All right ! If you have the time to spare , go to it ! " " I was just thinking that we might put Walter on the daybed .... " Byron ! Are you crazy ? Have some old bore around here for heaven knows how long ! Suitcases and clothes strewn all over  | the only room where we can entertain , and making up the daybed every morning ! You know the bedclothes would have to be folded and put in the closet ! He probably smokes a pipe and sits up late ! Maybe he would need a spittoon ! Really , I do n't understand what you can be thinking of ! " " I was thinking of the fact that Walter Simms loaned father the money to pay for my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went off to the kitchen , humming a tune  --  with her an invariable sign of exasperation . In the neighborhood two blocks east Byron found a furnished room for twelve dollars a week , paid a week 's rent in advance , and made his way to the nearest telegraph office . The next evening he met Walter Simms , who was somewhat unkempt after a tiring ride in a day coach , but appeared hale and vigorous for an old man . He seemed smaller than Byron remembered him . A scant fringe of white hair hung from under his faded velour hat , and he still punctuated his remarks with short expressive jabs of his right arm . " I was arguing with a feller from Louisville , " he said , as though continuing a conversation that had not been interrupted , " about real wealth and paper values , and if he had n't got off at Pittsburgh , I 'd have had him convinced ! We 've always had enough water in stocks to keep all our feet wet , but the time 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They call me Noah in Daleville because I 'm always preaching the coming of the Flood ! " He waved away an agile porter . " No , no ! I can still tote my own bag ! " and , still protesting , yielded it to Byron . In the subway he raised his voice above the tumult of the train . " You remember the Hardscrabble road ? State highway now , one of the main trunk lines , cement clear from Culverton up through Daleville to Cleveland ! Hodgeville ? Yep ! Cut right through your Uncle Henry 's old place . That 's all Laurel Heights , new suburb . ' Course , there ai n't any laurel there and no more heights than you could jump over , but it sounds hightoned . Henry made a good thing of it , selling off in half-acre lots . They got a strip of land along Pogg 's Run they call Green-  | view Park , ball grounds , and in summer a merry-go-round . You would n't know the place ! " " And Jed Wilcox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did he make out ? " " Poorly ! " Walter Simms shouted . " Could n't keep up the payments and had to let the farm go back . Got it at a pretty stiff figure , you know . Henry 's shrewd in money matters , like your brother Max . If Jed could have held on another three or four years , he 'd have made it by selling out as a subdivision , but he was trying to make a living farming . There 's nothing to that nowdays ! He 's running a garage in Laurelton  --  Ilodgeville , that was . " " And the wife ? " " Still teaching school . Been at it twenty-five years now , I guess , and looks dragged out , with that and the kids . They got a passel of kids ! When Amelie Wilcox was younger , she was quite a figure of a woman . " " Yes ! " said Byron . " As I remember , she was ! " Dorothy received Walter Simms with a noticeable lack of warmth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mama Hardicut had given her and that she had never liked . The old man , however , was too interested in the flat 's modern conveniences to observe her lack of cordiality . During dinner he retailed the latest news of the family . Bob Brennan , Art 's boy , had become a successful building contractor and had put up most of the houses in Laurel Heights ; he had married a girl with money from Toledo , and now his mother , Sophie , stepped out in Culverton society . ( Dorothy sniffed ; she had heard from her mother of the intrusion of the unspeakable Brennans in the affairs of the Country Club , where their drinking parties were notorious ! ) Judge Fisher was very feeble ; he would n't last long . The Liebermanns were nabobs in the hotel business of Southern California . Regularly they sent folders of their resorts to members of the family . Cass Fisher had retired on a pension from the railroad . He and the judge had got over their long-standing differences , but their wives had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Agropolis ,  | and Jane Esther 's husband was a figure in party politics , in the legislature , and talked of for Senator . " A pay-off man for the corporations at the capital ! " commented Walter Simms disgustedly . " So smooth that the voters thank him for seeing to it they get fleeced ! " " You remember Sally Baker , who used to work for your Grandma Fisher , and her daughter , Bessie ? " Byron remembered them . " Well ! Bessie married a feller by the name of Lancy Hodge , one of the Hodge family that founded Hodgeville . They say he 's one of the biggest bootleggers in the state , runs a fleet of trucks from the border , but they never touch him because he 's thick with the crowd at the Capital . Supplies booze to the governor and most of the legislature . Sally drives around in a Worden limousine , with a chauffeur and a bodyguard ! Whenever they 're in Culverton , they have dinner with the mayor and his wife . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've developed an ever-bearing strawberry that 's a wonder , Byron ! I 'm calling it the Charliana , after your dad . He once named a hybrid for me , the Nectarberry , that 's been a best-seller ever since . " He rambled on , while Dorothy served an apple pie with a soggy crust , one of her rare failures . At length he thought to ask about the state of Byron 's business . " Booming , " said Byron . " This last year we 've designed structures with an aggregate value of about a million and a half ! " " What 's your salary roll ? " " Not over thirty thousand . There are eight draughtsmen and a supervising architect . " Walter Simms , his eyes glowing with the economist 's zeal , asked pertinent questions : the firm 's fees , rental and general overhead . Then he made some calculations on a scrap of paper . " Seems to me , Byron , " he said , jabbing the air with his pie fork , " your Marvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ! " " They are ! " Dorothy burst out . " And we 're trying to scrape along on twenty-five hundred ! "  | " Of course that sounds like big money to me , but I suppose things in New York are high ? " " High , and getting higher , " said Byron ruefully . " We 've had our rent raised twice . You ca n't get a half-way decent apartment for less than seventy-five . We pay ninety . Everything else in proportion ! " Walter Simms picked up his napkin and wiped his spectacles . " Seems to me you ought to figure a way to get out of ' em what you 're worth . Now your little theater has made talk , you 're not a nobody ! If they wo n't do the right thing , why do n't you give them the go-by for another firm ? " " I have no architectural degree ; been too rushed to take the courses . I ca n't risk quitting them cold without a job in prospect ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know all about me from Marvin , Tuttle , and Gans ; how good I am , how reliable , whether I did the whole theater myself ; and Ike Gans is quite capable of telling them that he made the plans and I simply draughted details . He 's done it before , with other men who quit him ! His favorite word is loyalty , ' meaning that whenever one of his staff rebels at the slave driving , he 'll give him a black eye . One of the chaps who tore out of the shop in a rage last year was tarred with the rumor that he had taken some of the firm 's equipment with him  --  as if anyone would bother with the lousy truck ! Yet that canard followed the poor devil all over town ! " " Business , " said Walter Simms , stabbing a remnant of pie crust , " yours or any other kind , ai n't going to be particular about ethics or human feelings . If they can use you , they 'll ride you ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamstring you ! Whatever ai n't crooked , shady , or rapacious in business , is grudging and close-fisted ! That 's the nature of the beast and will be , so long as the average run of humans look up to them that has grabbed the dough out of the pockets of all us suckers ! " " What I tell Byron , " Dorothy put in , " is , that he must be hardboiled too , put up a front , blow his own horn like the rest of the successful people in New York , and make them come through ! "  | " I 'm not much good at bluffing , Dot ! " " It is n't bluffing ! " she cried indignantly . " It 's just telling the world what your real value is , and getting it in hard cash ! If you would do that , we could move out of this horrible little dump and build over in Jersey ! " Byron looked at his wife 's flushed face helplessly . " I do n't know how , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the furnished room , he was thinking of various expedients for bringing Marvin , Tuttle , and Gans to terms ; but at the end of the street , beyond the dark silhouette of the Second Avenue Elevated , he saw the river haze under a February moon , swathing the monumental outlines of a gas tank , and his thoughts went straying : the possibility of adapting such grotesque structures to civic adornment ; or whether their monstrosity was not really due to obsolescence . Walter Simms spent a week divided between the Flower Show , the Botanical Museum , and the Museum of Natural History ; to him all the rest of the city was , as he expressed it , " Mostly examples of human folly , human waste , inhuman crowding and misery , and the noises of the damned ! " ACE IN THE HOLE MUCH to Byron 's surprise , a letter from Ward Monteith : " My dear Peirce , I hear good reports of you , especially the recent project which I see before me , illustrated . Well modeled , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small a scale , is admirably managed , as well as the accents in the treatment of the side elevation . Few structures lend themselves to being viewed in the round . Art has real estate to contend with . " Now let me unburden . The city of Huntersburgh , said to have the largest per capita wealth in the country , is indulging  | itself in a War Memorial for its new civic center . The project involves a monument or shaft and a small war museum , a hazardous combination . Their committee has asked me to submit a design and I am prepared to tell them bluntly that I can not . I am tied up with other works and , besides , at present I do not choose to entertain ideas on spec. , for that is what it amounts to . With you it may be different . In my youth I entered many competitions , and I say frankly that I won few of them . " Should you wish to venture rashly , I shall be happy to suggest your name , verifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability . The matter will run to some seventy-five thousand dollars . The fee will be the usual percentage . Needless to say , I shall take no offence at your refusal . " Convey to your lady my best regards ; and to your brother Clyde , who struck me as a different sort from the mob of our best citizens , my friendly greeting . " Most cordially , W. Monteith " He re-read the letter , pondering . . . " venture rashly " . . . " hazardous " . . . " on spec . " He found himself trembling ; the note paper was actually shaking in his hands . l or some reason he suddenly remembered the railroad cut back in the woods at Hardscrabble ; the bunch of red maple half way down the slope . . . the slipping , the terror of the oncoming train . . . then , later , the pleased smile of Amelie Duchand . He got up and went hurriedly to his desk and began to hunt for stationery . Mr. Marvin strode back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an admiral on the quarter-deck , his leonine head , which made Byron think of a Chow 's , hunched between his shoulders ; he was considering the proposition from the sales angle . Mr. Tuttle , wearing the expression of an illtempered camel , was also considering it from behind his desk , while Mr. Gans , a picture of inspiration struck dumb with dismay , viewed his partners gloomily . None of them looked at Byron , sitting nonchalantly on the dusty window sill . He waited .  | " It would set us back all of six hundred bucks ! " wailed Mr. Gans . " Not a cent less than six hundred and thirty ! " Mr. Tuttle averred . " Counting materials , special postage , and incidentals . Add to that his loss of time to us , another five hundred ! " ( So , thought Byron grimly , they count my time as worth five hundred for three months ; as though they were losing money on me ! ) " Say , twelve hundred  --  and on spec. ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You , or any good architect , should turn out a swell sketch in a month ! " " They wo n't accept a sketch , " said Byron , " It has to be a finished plan ! " Mr. Marvin halted , raising his head as though invoking all the powers of heaven . " What kind of cheap-skates are they , " he inquired of space , " that they wo n't give a contract on a sketch ? Where will they get architects to compete ? No first-rate man will touch it ! " " In that case , " said Byron humorlessly , " it 's a better break for me ! " " If we could write to them , " said Mr. Tuttle cautiously , " we could make a deal . A five-hundred-dollar retainer , which we forfeit if you lose . " " They wo n't consider it . They distinctly state that they will enter into no correspondence with architects ; they will merely furnish specifications . " " Tell you what ! " Mr. Marvin exclaimed , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll go up and talk to those people ! All they need is to be sold on the proposition . I 'll even take along the pictures of your theater . " " No go ! " said Byron , " I 'm going to keep the letter until you agree to my proposition : three months at full salary to work on this thing , and if I win it , a contract at five thousand a year for the next two years . If it sounds wild to you , I 'll peddle it somewhere else . " Mr. Gans turned upon him a gaze of mingled astonishment and reproach . " You mean , if we do n't risk our shirts , you are quitting ? "  | " That 's it , precisely ! " Mr. Tuttle 's lower lip drooped in cunning contemplation . Inspiration began to envelop Mr. Gans like an aura ; his eyes kindled ; he beamed . " Gentlemen ! " he cried , bringing down the palm of his hand on the desk with a resounding smack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth , I would say , do n't talk nonsense , do you think we 're crazy ? Give a man three months ' salary , take on another draughtsman , tie up our capital , maybe all for nothing ? Nix ! " His smile , frank and paternal , shone upon the stony figure at the window . " Byron , my boy , even if we talk to you like a dutch uncle , we think you 're the goods ! Gentlemen , I say , give him a chance ! If he makes it , he gets the contract . " " The contract , " said Byron , " must be signed beforehand : five thousand for the next two years , if I win ! " " Gil , " said Mr. Gans to Mr. Tuttle , " I guess we give it to him , eh ? " " It 's up to you , Ike , " said Mr. Tuttle , shrugging his shoulders of all responsibility , " if you 're satisfied to take a chance ! " In New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its grimy patches of old snow like the moth-eaten furs of a shabby prostitute ; but at Huntersburgh , where Byron alighted from the local , winter displayed an undiminished vigor . It was a bright and glistening morning ; the chains on the cars at the station crunched in the frozen snow ; Byron waved aside taxi drivers and started to walk through the town , trying with all senses alert to get the feel of it . At a lunch wagon he stopped for coffee and doughnuts , and talked with the Italian proprietor . " Me , in tha beeg war ? No ! My brudda ' was carubiniero , keeled at Caporetto . " " Where was he buried ? " " They no find . He shot to hell ! " " Do you want to go back ? " " Me ? Not on your life ! Thees good enough for me ! Cash beezness !

America , standardized , standing pat for conveniences and gadgets . If you have a product ten millions will buy , if it only costs a cent , you 're made . . . sell America ! He wandered through the residential quarter where homes like those in the restricted sections of Agropolis were set far back in snowy yards , among oaks and pines ; a moneyed town , hiding its substratum of poverty on the other side of the railway station , boasting of its per capita . The civic center : an open square showing signs of recent demolitions , facing which were the new postoffice , city hall , and two churches . He walked around and around it , viewing the plaza from every angle , broodingly , then returned to the station . A WRONGED HUSBAND THE law of averages has to take into account the exceptional instance . After having collected the data of nine hundred and ninety-nine average men without becoming involved in their personal affairs , I discovered that the circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attention ; in the first instance because of the extreme difficulties I judged were besetting him , and in the second because I had got in the habit of dining at Gianetti 's and therefore saw a great deal of Clyde  --  never , I may add , with a sense of boredom . The Russian young lady , of whom I had more than once taken notice , came there often . I had learned that her name was Katya , that she was unmarried and unattached , and she preferred to remain so ; that she had first noticed me because of a fancied resemblance to her uncle , now deceased ; and that , in lieu of vodka , she prefererd rye whiskey straight . All these discoveries , except that about the uncle , were distinctly pleasurable .  | We had reached the point where we discussed philosophy and Katya 's disagreements with young men who had designs on her virginity . She spoke of her virginity in a detached way , as though it were an abstraction quite apart from herself  --  as a bibliophile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no profane hands to touch . On the last occasion when we dined together , Clyde Peirce failed to make his appearance , and she said of virginity , " People think it is like purity , but it is something entirely different . I have never , since I can remember being a child , felt that I was pure-minded . As a child I thought of the most horrid things , the hair on my father 's legs and how my mother could stand being in bed with him , like rubbing against a house dog ! And as a girl of fifteen I was shy and bashful , not from purity but from the wish to show how well formed I was , how large and pretty my breasts were , and what a sweet navel I had ! Even then I did not treasure my virginity ; I would have given it to anyone , if they had not all been so dull and stupid and avaricious , thinking only what a prize they could snatch and despising the owner of it ! " " Where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you born ? " " In Kiev , in 1907 ; to America with my father and mot her and brothers in 1909 , and living on Second Avenue and " Thirteenth Street ever since . We are Americans ! " ' " That makes you twenty-seven years old . And why have n't you married ? " " I do n't want to marry because husbands soon stop giving their wives the benefit of their intelligence ; and the divorce laws are so perplexing ! So , if the husband and wife no longer have any reason for living together , and they are quite sure of it , they can not get a divorce unless they lie about it or go to some distant place that is expensive . " " Have you ever lived with a man ? " " Oh yes ! I lived a year with a young artist because he did not have much money and I could cook . It was very pleasant , just like brother and sister , and he never bothered in the least  | until one day I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head . That disturbed me so I moved out . " " Perhaps the young man had been suffering , " I ventured . " Suffer ! " she exclaimed scornfully . " We all suffer ! When I suffer I scream and yell and beat my head against the wall ! If he was suffering , he had a queer way of showing it ! " " What would you do if you had married a man , left him , found a lover , and your husband continued to pursue you ? " I asked , thinking of Clyde and Ilsa . She looked at me , her Tartar-shaped eyes gradually widening in venomous fury ; she extended her two hands in a savage , catlike gesture above the red-checked tablecloth . " I can not imagine such a thing , doctor ! I would try to kill him , I suppose ! " And she went on rapidly , " A long time ago , my mother told me , the women were property , like cattle . They had no rights . If a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down ! Now it is different . No woman or man is property of another . They have no rights to love , only choice . " " The law holds differently . " She tossed her head . " What is law ? It is something in books and courts that never catches up with how people think and act ! If one man oppress a dog or a horse , he can be fined . If another oppress all the workers of his factory or sweatshop , it is good business ! That is law ! " " Are you a socialist or a communist ? " I asked . She laughed . " I am a good American , like your friend , Mr. Peirce . Some day , when the time comes " She snapped her finger . " My glass is empty ! " As I summoned the waiter I saw Clyde Peirce approaching between the tables . He looked more fatigued than usual , and as he dropped into the vacant seat at our table , he merely nodded to both of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ryes , " I said to the waiter , " and another Martini ! " Clyde raised his head . " Thanks , doc ! You guessed it ! Pardon my slumping , Katya ! Putting the sheet to bed always takes it out of me . You think nothing has been left undone , you okay the last proofs , and then you discover a frightful error that  | has to be corrected in the foundry proof ! Also , there have been other upsets . " The drinks arrived . He tossed his off and continued , " The chief matter of interest down at our office is an under-cover fight for control of the sheet . The Ketterells , oddly enough , have a hand in it . Clarence is one of the directors , and his faction have been trying to stick a knife into Perry . The Chief has always stood for keeping it strictly factual and statistical ; these other birds want to make it an organ for anti-labor , anti-liberal , and anti-everything propaganda . If the Financial Outlook falls to those Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In which case I may be soap-boxing in Union Square ! Salut ! Let 's have another ! " By nine o'clock the three of us were getting a trifle high ; Katya had moved her chair around so that her head was resting on my shirt front , saying that she liked me because I was a sober gentleman who did not make unwelcome advances ; and Clyde was orating to an imaginary audience . " My friends , " he rhapsodized , " I address you as one business man to another . You are making a slight error in bookkeeping ; you ca n't rake in most of the dough and sell most of your goods ! 1 f you think you can , keep on trying , until they turn on you and empty out your vaults ! Then you 'll howl like hyenas that you 're persecuted ! I 'm addressing you , my friends  --  the two hundred thousand families that have as much as the lowest ten million families ! If you trust to the divine right of property , backed up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the lady who said , Let them eat cake ! ' Some day the forty millions will cat cake ? and you will be that cake ! " " Katya , " I said , " my arm has gone to sleep where you are leaning against it ! " " Put it about my waist , sweet , it will soon wake up ! " I did so . " Reverend preachers of the slightly mildewed Gospels , who exhort your flocks to meekness and submission , beware that they do not use your empty tabernacles for clubs and lodging houses and your altars for free lunch counters ! Most of you have long frowned upon pleas for social justice ; it may be that social jus-  | tice will light upon you , and force you to walk about in the open , without a roof , like your first Master ! " " Come , come , Peirce ! " I said . " You 're tilting against windmills ! Forget the priests ! They have to make a living , same as you ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are many things besides a living ! " " He 's just working off his suppressed grudge against Wall Street , " I explained to Katya . " It burns him up to work down there . " " Why does he , then ? " " Curiosity got him in , and now he finds it hard to get out . " The waiter came toward us in agitation . I thought he was about to remonstrate with Clyde , but he said , " Telepone , Mr. Peirce ! Very important , come quick ! " I helped him to his feet and he made his way to the telephone booth . Through the glass door I could see him bent like a reversed question mark over the receiver , one dark lock of hair hanging over his forehead , his lips moving soundlessly . The question mark straightened to an exclamation point , and the door slipped inward ; he came out , shoving me aside , blindly , and started for the stairway . " Wait a minute ! " I said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter a bill , without waiting for change , hat , or overcoat , I followed him as he plunged through the crowd downstairs toward the entrance . At the door I caught up with him and took his arm , though he seemed not to notice me . We stumbled to the curb and I hailed a cab . Pushing him in , I said , " Where is it ? Your place ? " He wrenched himself free of my grasp and tried to get out . " Let me out , God damn you ! " he growled . I twisted him around and by a violent effort shoved him into the seat . " Sit down , Peirce , and take it easy ! Where are we going ? Your place ? " I shook him . " Speak up , you fool ! Where to ? " " My place ! " he muttered .  | I leaned over and gave the address to the driver . " And do n't be too quick getting there , " I added . I offered him a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ; the bit of paper and tobacco dropped to the floor of the taxi . I lit another and held it out to him , then I lit one for myself . " You were always an irresponsible blackguard , Peirce , " I said calmly . " Who is it you 're going to murder now ? " He did not answer , simply puffed furiously , looking blankly out of the window . " If your father , Charles Worden Peirce , were in this cab , he would advise you to use your head , would n't he ? He would say , Clyde , my boy " " Shut up , for Christ ' sake ! " " Where 's Ilsa ? " I asked abruptly . To my surprise he said , quite rationally , " In the floor below , with the tenants . Climbed out of the bathroom window , carrying the kid , to the fire escape , after she locked the bathroom door . Lucky the fire escape comes past the bathroom ! " " And her husband , the baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Think fast , said a small voice within me ; think very fast ! " Look here , Peirce ! I 'll pick up a cop . House-breaking ; I 'm a witness . He can be pinched ! " " Yeah ? " he said sardonically . " Did you ever have the cops in on a case of illicit cohabitation and residence ? If it 's any little racket or gang stuff , they do n't know anything ; but if it has to do with the sacredness of the marriage vow , they 're bloodhounds ! That is , unless you 're in the money , then it 's a question of pay-off . Well , I 'm not going to pay the cops , the baker , or anyone else ! " " Suppose I go in with you  --  you 're a friend of Ilsa 's , living in the house , and I 'm a dick , see ? We can throw a good scare into him ! " " Listen ! I 'm not going to play charades ! He 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be satisfied until he 's had a look at the man she 's living with . Well , I aim to satisfy his curiosity ? once and for all ! "  | There was no turning him aside ; I saw that . At least , he haLi sobered up . We arrived at the house and while Clyde ran up the front stoop , I stopped to pay the taxi driver . " Shall I wait , boss ? " he asked . " Look here , " I said , " there will probably be one hell of a fight on the top floor of this place . " " Sounds like one already ! " he said . We heard a pounding and bellowing . Pressing a bill into his hand , I said , " A fellow 's gone crazy in there . You go on up while I phone Bellevue . I 'm a doctor . If this case goes to court , I 'll call you as a witness . " He disappeared into the doorway , yelling back , " I 'm with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put through a call to Doctor Castras , a former colleague , for an ambulance and a straitjacket . When I entered the hallway of the rooming house , I found the janitor and some of the tenants standing in an excited group ; voices on the upper landing ; heads peering over the stairway ; above , silence . " Where is the maniac ? " I asked them . " I guess they got him , " the man jabbered . " He come in here asking about a woman named Ilsa , said he was her brother . I did n't know , I said , you mean Mrs. Peirce . " I dashed past , leaving him still gabbling to the others . The door of the top-floor apartment stood open . Clyde was sitting on the edge of the bed , examining his knuckles . The taxi driver was sitting in one of the straight chairs , smoking a ciga rette ; on the floor , face down , a man lay sprawled . Close b him was a kitchen knife . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully . " Man ! You must of pasted him one ! " " He ran at me with a knife , " Clyde explained . " I hooked my knee into his solar plexus and handed him a right to the jaw . It 's an old trick . Not very decent , but effective ! " " Let 's hoist him down to the street , " I said . " The Bellevue wagon will be along any moment . " " A strong sedative , " I told the ambulance attendant who had  | been sent by Doctor Castras , " and then a few days of observation . Alcoholic hallucinosis , possibly derived from paranoid dementia . He thinks he is a wronged husband ! " " Hell ! " laughed the interne . " Iie 's just average ! " " I 'll be over to make a report on him tomorrow . " " Okay , Doctor Bedell ! ( ; ood night ! " " Say ! " said the taxi driver . " Wronged husband  --  ai n't that a laugh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child to bed ; she was more composed than Clyde . It suddenly occurred to me that Katya might be waiting at Gianetti 's and I hurried downstairs to claim the taxi again . Katya , fortunately , had not left the cafe . All told , it was a strange , and  --  as it turned out  --  rather wonderful night . THE GREATER GOOD THAT summer , said Byron Peirce , ? it was in 1() 7  --  came close to being perfection . During the month of June , while we were waiting for the decision of the committee , Dorothy and ' I just about went nuts . At the office I was run ragged by Ike ( ; : uis , who had convinced himself that my design for the war memorial was a frost . He was torn between regret for having let himself in for the idea in the first place , and for not " improving " on my original plan , an offer I had firmly rejected . The day when the finished drawings were presented to the members of the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had toiled over the plans until the moment came when I knew there was not another line to be added , then I showed them to Dorothy . She was silent for a few minutes . " It is impressive , Byron , " she said with hesitation , " but is n't it rather too simple , I mean , from the average standpoint ? People generally think of figures  --  soldiers , guns , a statue of victory ? in connection with war memorials . "  | " There have been some very simple ones , Dot . " " The building looks gloomy . It resembles a mausoleum . " " It is a mausoleum , holding the spirit and mementoes of the dead . " " What are those rough blocks , one on each side of the museum ? " " Blocks of rough granite  --  it 's a granite country up there- - each with a polished face for the inscription of names . There 's one for the army , one for the navy , one for the marines , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , and over it are outspread , drooping wings , to be cast in bronze . " " I thought they specified a single shaft ? " " They specified a shaft , monolith , or other appropriate object of a memorial character . ' After I tried a dozen designs , I found that a column did not tie in with my building . These blocks , even in the rough , do . Perhaps they wo n't like it at all ; I ca n't read the minds of the jury , but I can attempt to do an honest job . " " It 's good ! " said Dorothy . " I 'm afraid , too good ! " At the end of the day , having waited until quitting time when the draughting room would be empty , I tacked the drawings to the wall and nervously awaited the opinion of Messrs Marvin , Tuttle , and Gans . Mr. Marvin was out drumming up business . Mr. Tuttle came in from his office , surveyed the sheets with pendant lower lip , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , wiped his glasses , peered at them , one by one , and finally said despondently , " Peirce , you would do a thing like this ! " " You do n't fancy them , huh ? " " They give me the creeps ! Why should the boys fight like heroes over there , and not have something cheerful to look at ! " " The ones who are being memorialized , " I said grimly , " have n't anything cheerful to look at ! " He passed around once more , squinting . Then : " I 'm not say ing it ai n't good work . It 's swell ! It 's a superb conception ! 7'rv :  | elegant ! But they would n't take it in a million years ! " However , they did . In July I got a three weeks ' vacation ; and for the first time in our married life we had a little money to spend ; not to spend extravagantly , for Dorothy was pregnant and we were trying to get enough ahead to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped . I had heard of an island in Lake George that could be rented along with a tent and a canoe . It was a one-family islet , no larger than a merry-go-round , and just what we wanted . There we lived like beachcombers in old clothes , cooking over an open fire , and hearing at night the unrest of water about our rocky shores . From every sign it appeared that our course was fairly marked , barring unusual accidents , for we were young , hopeful , and energetic ; Dorothy was contemplating her approaching motherhood without uneasiness and I was on the threshold of professional success , with an adequate salary . " There might be setbacks , but I could foresee no real impediment to achieving the moderate recognition that meant a fair degree of independence . And when I looked at the photographs of the completed Huntersburgh War Memorial , I knew , even more than by the praise I received at its unveiling , that I had done a good thing , which is perhaps the greatest good that can happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PORTENTS WHEN Lawyer Hardicut died early in the spring of 1928 , his wife mourned dutifully , her thoughts turning to Dorothy and New York .
