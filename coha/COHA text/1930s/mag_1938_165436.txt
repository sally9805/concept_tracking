Roosevelts <P> Sirs : <P> By what authority does TIME ( Feb. 28 ) confer a Harvard diploma on James Roosevelt ? According to the latest Alumni Directory he is recorded as passing five years in college ( 1926-31 ) , but he is not credited with any degree . <P> E. W. WRIGHT <P> Cambridge , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Is n't it a fact that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not graduate from Columbia University 's Law School and was never granted a diploma from that school ? <P> E. HOWARD BENNETT <P> Boston , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> ... I write as one of the " Forgotten Men " who feels that James is the recipient of sufficient special privilege from the hands of his presidential father , and that TIME need not award him a degree from Harvard . <P> FRANCIS C. CARLETON <P> Cambridge , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> As an old subscriber I protest against placing on your cover the picture of young Roosevelt , the most obnoxious example of nepotism in my memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirs : <P> Your issue of TIME , Feb. 28 puzzles me . You imply that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not win his Phi Beta Kappa key through scholarship . Can it be that nowadays Presidents are given this honor without earning it ? My understanding is that Phi Beta Kappa is about the only organization that one can not " crash in " without true scholarship . . . . <P> MAY M. ATWATER <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> TIME 'S authorities for James Roosevelt 's Harvard degree : James Roosevelt , U. S. Congressional Directory ; for Franklin Roosevelt 's Columbia law degree : N. Y. State Legislative Manual ( 1931 ) . These authorities apparently erred . Harvard officials deny that James Roosevelt ever received a diploma from Harvard ; Columbia gave Franklin Roosevelt no law degree . <P> Franklin Roosevelt did not " win his Phi Beta Kappa key through scholarship . " Twice awarded him honoris causa , it was given by both Hobart College chapter and the Harvard College chapter in 1929 . Other famed honorary Phi Beta Kappas : John Marshall . Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge , Glenn Frank . In the past three years Phi Beta Kappa has awarded no honorary memberships. - ED . <P> Googol <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , Feb. 28 , p. 28 " . . . The googolplex is so large a number that it could not be written on a piece of paper stretching across the visible universe . . . . " <P> ( By definition , a googolplex is the number " 1 followed by a googol of zeros , " a googol being equal to 10 . ) <P> I write this number on approximately one square inch of paper as follows : <P> 2 <P> 10 <P> 10 <P> 10 <P> Why not ? <P> M. H. SWEET <P> Orange , N. J. <P> Let Reader Sweet mend his mathematics : a googol is not equal to 10 . Ten squared is simply 100 . Reader Sweet 's googolplex is not a googolplex but merely a googol squared . By using a series of ascending powers , a googolplex could be written in comparatively small space ; written straight out , it would , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Sirs : <P> Dr. Kasner 's " googol " is affording much interest and entertainment . I hereby solicit more . . . .
