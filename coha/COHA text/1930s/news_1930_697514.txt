txt Even before the Carnegie Foundation 's bulletin on college athletics was published , there had come from many , quarters a call for a leader . He was to help in restoring conditions when ( a ) the game was played for the game 's sake rather than to win ; ( b ) the players , not a professional coach , were in charge on the field , and ( c ) academic standards were not to be sacrificed in the desire to have a winning team . Alumni weeklies echoed with the call , but there were no striking responses until Dr. BUTLER of Columbia University issued his report for 1930 . In many respects he would be an ideal leader in the cause of putting college athletics back on a reasonable basis . He is the head of a great educational institution with a winning football tradition . Columbia in 1905 had the courage to abolish football for ten years . Orq the basis of per capita wealth its alumni would compare favorably with those of any other university . They are as interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . Certainly no one can doubt that , if the faculty of Columbia wanted to wink a bit , a football team could be recruited there which , at the expense of educational standards , could mow down most of the elevens it met . To the great credit of Columbia , be it noted that its recent football history has not been a series of triumphs . Dr. BUTLER 'S report offers a clue to all this . " Gate receipts and glory " have been set aside as the chief desideratum of college athletics on Morningside Heights . " If penalty it be , " Columbia will continue to pay it for " insisting upon the " primacy of intellectual ideals and " intellectual accomplishment . " If the alumni , who lead the shouts for victory and the moans for athletic defeat , will endow athletic sports , " perhaps that is the one satisfac " tory and permanent solution of " these , problems . " With the question of gate receipts to one side , glory can be kept in mind without abandoning scholary standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The altunni axe " obsessed with a passion for victory at all costs . " Sup . . pose they take on the financial cost of it themselves . , Few faculties will fail to greet Dr. BUTLER 'S remarks with satisfaction . It was realized by the teachers , before the public or even the Carnegie Foundation did so , that the prevailing hysteria over college sports , especially football , is a menace to sound college life . Without forming an " Athletic League of Nations , " a mOvement to restore common sense and the proprieties is overdue . Nor is , the feeling all with faculties . Speaking before an athletic conference , last week , W. W. ROPER , Princeton 's famous football coach , advocated shorter training periods for football and giving up its emphasis over all other college sports . If football is not treated normally by colleges , he saw the end of the game " in five years , " largely because the players themselves are weary of the overstress and the drudgery .
