Often called the greatest living diplomat is M. Alexis Lger , Secretary-General of the French Foreign Office . Wedded firmly to Paris , he never stirs abroad if he can help it , and overseas territories are to him outlandish pawns , to be played coldly in diplomacy 's great game . Last week M. Alexis Lger , much to his distaste , was obliged to quit his beloved Paris for a few days in order to coach Premier Camille Chautemps and Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos at London in the opening hands of a game for breathtakingly high stakes . Green as any card table was the big board at No. 10 Downing Street , and German diplomatic cards were dealt out by Viscount Halifax . Quietly , this lean , cadaverous British statesman laid the secret demands which Adolf Hitler and Herman Wilhelm Goring recently made to him ( TIME . Nov. 29 ) face up before the French last week , in the presence of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain . Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden , and Sir Robert Vansittart , who is in London the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaks disclosed that Halifax reported the Nazis demanding in the way of colonies that Britain and France yield " only " Togoland and the Cameroons-these being nearly worthless African territories-but that Belgium and Portugal should be forced to yield their long held rich Congo and Angola to a chartered company in which they would be " partners " with Germany , which would own the controlling interest . Hitler , in return for the above concessions , would bind Germany never to attempt to repossess the more valuable once-German colonies now held as mandates by the United Kingdom , France , the Dominions , and Japan. * <P> In laying out such cards , ostensibly only for discussion , the British were by implication asking the French to enter into what David Lloyd George was to call later last week a " thieves ' bargain . " The diplomatic finesse of M. Lger was meanwhile shown when M. Chautemps and M. Delbos blandly told Mr. Chamberlain , Mr. Eden and Sir Robert in effect that France was willing to go just as far in this matter as Britain-whereupon what had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of Germany 's scheme rapidly cooled , according to best posted London correspondents . <P> " Free Hand/ ' Other cards laid face up by Halifax reputedly exposed Hitler 's claim to a " free hand " in Austria and Czechoslovakia , that is , Der Fiihrer claims that Britain and France have no right to do other than stand aside in case Germany sees fit to use such pressure or weapons as would reduce Vienna and Prague to the status of vassals of Berlin . The British last week found the French as adamant against giving Hitler any such " free hand " as they had just proved unexpectedly agreeable to going as far into the " thieves ' bargain " over colonies as Britain may be ready to go . These tactics by M. Lger quickly brought the negotiations to an amiable pause , with Mr. Chamberlain , who is somewhat pro-German , apparently feeling that the French had been " quite reasonable , " should not be pressed too far .                 @ @ @ @
