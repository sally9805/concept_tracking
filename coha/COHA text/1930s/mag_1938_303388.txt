THE IMPREGNABLE WOMEN-Eric Link-later-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> Extravagant admirers of Britain 's skittish Eric Linklater have not hesitated to compare him to Aristophanes . Author Linklater 's picaresque , satirical novels ( Juan in America , Magnus Merriman et al. ) were full of bawdy humor and a blithe unconcern for English notions of propriety . But last week , when he published a new-fashioned novelist 's version of Aristophanes ' Lysistrata , critics concluded that the Scot was no match for the Greek on his own ground . <P> Aristophanes was sick of the Peloponnesian War when it started . Twenty years later , in 411 B.C. , he was even sicker . Athens ' allies were slipping away ; the Syracuse expedition had ended in crushing disaster . But whenever one side suggested peace , the other side was doing too well with the war to call it off . Then Aristophanes wrote Lysistrata . What if all the women of Athens united , seized the Acropolis , told the men they would live resolutely continent till the war ended ? Aristophanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lysistrata has been repeatedly revived ( most recently on Broadway in Gilbert Seldes ' version , 1930 ) because : 1 ) . it is a classic ; 2 ) it is smutty ; 3 ) it is antiwar ; 4 ) it is funny . In The Impregnable Women , Author Linklater follows his model with near-sighted intensity . Lady Scrymgeour puts a stop to the war between Great Britain and France with as much zeal and dispatch as Lysistrata put a stop to the war between Athens and Sparta . The Impregnable Women is less light-headed than either Lysistrata or Author Linklater 's earlier books . It exhibits his glib facility for treating outrageous events , but his admirers may be disconcerted to find that he possesses a moral sense . And they will agree that Aristophanes did the same thing better , with music , a long time ago .
