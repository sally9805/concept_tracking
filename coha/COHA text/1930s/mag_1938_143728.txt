The hoary , leather-faced council members and First Syndic ( president ) of the tiny 190-sq. mi. territory of Andorra , the world 's oldest republic , which nestles atop the Pyrenees between Spain and France , gathered in solemn conclave last week to decide whether to admit to their country a tough-mugged gentleman who styled himself Alex Abraham Sikorski , alias " Kid Tiger , " onetime trigger man for Gangster Al Capone . <P> Meantime , at the French border village of Bourg-Madame , Mr. Sikorski was putting on a good show : <P> He offered to build Andorra a modern sanatorium for the 5,000 inhabitants . <P> Informed by French rustics that he could not get to Andorra through the mountain roads , buried 20 feet under snow drifts , he snorted : " If I had my null der car which cost $32,000 I 'd go through these roads like a tank . " <P> By way of general manifesto , he announced : " I have lived in exile in 15 European countries in flight from the U. S. income-tax collectors . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may visit is Liechtenstein . . . . I 'm a real gangster , it 's true , but I 'm no criminal , and I want to remain what I have always been - honest . Europeans make a big mistake when they give honesty a meaning it never had . I 've never kidnapped anybody . " <P> Impressed by these displays Andorra sent back its reply , " No Admittance . " <P> However , the Spanish Leftist Government , needing good trigger men , offered Mr. Sikorski haven in Barcelona , and French gendarmes escorted him to the international bridge to Puigcerda , set him on his way . <P> Chicago police and Washington income tax sleuths said they have never heard of Alex ( " Kid Tiger " ) Sikorski . Yugoslav police believe it was he who turned up in Belgrade last year boasting he was a faithful henchman of the late John Dillinger on his way to " get " Anna Sage , the Rumanian-born " Woman in Red " who put the finger on Dillinger . In Europe it can be as much fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U. S. to be a prince .
