txt Estimates for ordinary and extraordinary government expenditures in the next fiscal year will be decided upon by President Roosevelt this week in meetings with Lewis W. Douglas , Director of the Budget , and departmental heads . These conferences will also formulate recommendations for revenue , including a whisky tax , and consider the repeal of about $20,000 , - 000 of nuisance taxes . It became known today that the President would have a complete tax program for presentation to Congress on Jan. 3 . Those in the confidence of the administration are also certain that in a message to Congress Mr. Roosevelt will outline in some detail future policy under his monetary program , if he does not make an announcement before that time . Ordinary expenditures of the government for the current fiscal year , ending June 30 , will reach about $2,500,000,000 , exclusive of interest on the debt and the processing tax payments . Heavy Interest a Factor . Comparable expenses for the next fiscal year can be kept within the same limit , it is believed , if the extraordinary expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest charges on bond issues and the administration does not restore a large amount of the 15 per cent reduction made in government salaries . Fiscal authorities find great pressure for restoration of the pay cuts and also many demands for large public works programs Should these be heeded , the President may find it necessary to increase estimates for ordinary expenses . It is felt here that 5 per cent of the 15 per cent salary cut could be restored without exceeding the ordinary expenses pf the current year . But unless extraordinary expenditures for recovery activities are held down the ordinary budget must be increased to take care of interest charges for the recovery loans . President Roosevelt indicated today that he intended to follow rigid economies and make every effort to keep ordinary expenditures 25 per cent below those in the last fiscal year of the Hoover administration . For Works If Needed . He told callers recently , however , that be would favor large appropriations for public works and civilian activities if it was apparent to him that such expenditures were necessary in the drive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public works activities could profitably expend about $3 , - 000,000,000 in addition to the $3,300. - 000,000 authorized by the last Congress . Senator La Follette and some other Progressive Republicans favor an appropriation of $10,000 , - 000,000 for public works and civilian work activities . In carrying out the public works program the administration has scaled down estimates- for post offices and other Federal buildings about 50 per cent . Of the 947 post offices recommended by the Tressmy , Secretary Ickes has allowed only 300 , and the cost of these has been reduced 50 per cent below the original estimates . Expensive construction has been eliminated and , as far as possible , local materials have been employed . The size of the buildings has been reduced , and they have ' been located on low-cost sites . President Roosevelt is said to feel that he may not be able to reach a decision on proposed additional works projects until sometime in February . If it is found then that the activities already under way are stimulating the economic pump sufficiently , there might be no necessity for-additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to commit himself to further recovery expenditures until there has been a thorough test of progress under present legislation . Therefore , the conversations on extraordinary expenditures will be chiefly " spade work " in ' preparation for recommendations that the President will submit to Congress in February or later . $750,000,000 Liquor Yield Seen . Treasury experts estimate that $430,000,000 could be raised with a $2.20 whisky tax and that the total liquor yields , including revenue from beer and taxes on other distilled spirits , would reach something like $750,000,000 . An increased yield of about $300 , - 000,000 also is expected to come from changes in the administrative features of the revenue law to prevent tax evasions . Estimates supplied to the President show an increased yield in taxes due to proposed liquor levies despite the end of the $227,000,000 in special tiaatii 1evie4 under the NRA . Them automatically expired with the rapes/ of the Eighteenth Amendment . If it is found that the liquor and beer taxes will bring in double the amount lost by repeal of the special taxes , the administration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , including those on candy and chewing gum , soft drinks , radios , refrigerators , matches , firearms and ammunition .
