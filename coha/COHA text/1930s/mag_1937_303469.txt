( See map ) Smiling broadly last week Dr. W. Reid Blair of New York 's Bronx Zoo exclaimed : <P> " Well , well , they 're starting a little early this year , are n't they ? . . . The offer of $25,000 for the Monster still stands . Of course , it must be alive , weigh two tons and be 40 feet long , and by all means it must be in good health . I do n't want any ill monsters on my hands . " <P> The Monster referred to was the dire denizen of Loch Ness , Scotland , first fabled in the world press in 1933 . Opener of its 1937 season was an announcement by the Right Rev. Sir David Oswald Hunter Blair , Bart , ( no kin to Dr. Reid Blair ) that , at the age of 83 , he was organizing an expedition to trace and trap the creature , bring it back alive . <P> " Nessie , " said Sir David , " must be thousands of years old and belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame I expect little trouble in bringing him home . In fact I have invited the boys of St. Bede 's Roman Catholic College in Manchester to join me in the monster hunt . " <P> Loch Ness , largest of Scotland 's lakes ( 22 mi. long , 1 mi. wide ) , bisects the Highlands from Inverness on the northeast to Fort Augustus- on the southwest . Near its narrow shores are many a Highland distillery , many towns and glens intimately connected with haberdashery : Inverness ( tweed capes ) , Glen Urquhart ( gents ' suitings ) , Glen Garry ( highland bonnets ) . Ben Nevis , best publicized mountain in Scotland , is only 30 mi. to the southwest . In August 1933 when workmen were blasting a new motor road along the west shore of the lake , the monster was first " seen .

Their descriptions of the beast varied in detail but agreed roughly that it was 40 to 50 ft. long with a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 m.p.h. up &; down the lake , prudently keeping at least 100 yd. from shore . On the east shore , a large pudgy " footprint " was found . Scientists entering the discussion opined that it was : 1 ) an elephant seal that had slipped through the Caledonian Canal from the North Sea ; 2 ) a giant squid ; 3 ) a hippopotamus ; 4 ) an acclimatized crocodile ; 5 ) floating debris from a Wartime German blimp . <P> Whatever the Monster was , it was a godsend to Loch Ness hotelkeepers , tourist agencies , omnibus operators . At the height of the 1934 excitement newshawks suddenly remembered the Benedictine monastery at Fort Augustus , at the southern and deepest end of the lake . There they found jovial , garrulous 83-year-old the Right Rev. Sir David Hunter Blair , Bart . Sir David is more than a British baronet . He is a onetime captain of Scottish militia , an antiquarian , author of five books of memoirs , a Benedictine monk and titular Abbot of Dunfermline .
