txt Dyckman Ferry Missed . For many years thousands of New Yorkers have availed themselves of the beauty and scenery of the Alpine section of Interstate Pafk . With the advent of the construction of the George Washington Bridge , vehicle traffic on the Dyckman Street Perry naturally declined . and this year operation of the ferry has been discontinued , This has made it impossible for the person of moderate means without an automobile to enjoy one of the few remaining outdoor scenic beauty spots within short riding distance of Manhattan . Thousands of dollars have been spent in beautifying this section of the parlc , and it is a great disappointment to many New Yorkers who look forward every week-end to an excursion in the country to find that their only means of transportation has been discontinued . It would be a great boon to the lovers of the outdoors if it were possible to continue the operation of the ferry . EDWARD H. MEYERS . New York , April 29 , 1935.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
