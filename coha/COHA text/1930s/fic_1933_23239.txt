REUNION A STORY BY VINCENT SHEEAN R. SINKINS took the money the lawyer gave him and counted it carefully . His nose quivered slightly as the smooth new banknotes flicked through his fingers , but he gave no other sign of excitement . " O.K. , " he said with an effort at nonchalance . " It all seems to be here . Well . . . Thank you very much , Mr. Barron . If you ever get out my way . . . " The words trailed off to nothing , for Mr. Sinkins was quite well aware that the resplendent Mr. Barron , a lawyer with clients , was not likely to squander his leisure upon visits to the wilderness of Brooklyn . Mr. Barron smiled vaguely , shuffled some papers , put out a plump and casual hand . " I hope you 'll get some good out of the money , " he said , already thinking of something else . " Your aunt  --  erdid n't . You should be careful how you invest it . " Mr. Sinkins adjusted his nose-glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then began a nervous collection of hat , coat , and gloves . He was thinking that Mr. Barron might well advise careful investment ; five hundred dollars was both too much and too little to invest rashly . Mr. Sinkins knew exactly how he meant to dispose of the stiff new banknotes which reprksed now in the inside pocket of his coat . He retreated through the door , still smiling with gratitude , and madehis way out through an office occupied by two indifferent stenographers . As he fell through space in the elevator of the Woolworth Building he was conscious of new reserves of serenity and confidence . Five hundred dollars was a respectable sum , a sum measurable by the purposes to which it might be devoted . It would not , for example , buy the Woolworth Building , but it would be more than enough to pay for a taxicab uptown and a luncheon at a really good restaurant . He came out on Broadway and hailed a taxicab as naturally as if he had been accustomed to doing so every day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he could not remember the name of a single good restaurant . It seemed to him that he had heard that all the best restaurants nowadays were speakeasies , to which it was necessary to have a card of admission or some form of introduction . Mr. Sinkins had never been in a speakeasy in uptown Manhattan , and very seldom in a speakeasy anywhere . There was , of course , the little bar around the corner from the office in Brooklyn , where some of the other clerks occasionally went for a glass of beer or a drink of supposed whisky . But Mr. Sinkins ' intentions were of another order altogether . He sat back in the taxicab and sighed . " Just drive uptown , " he told the driver . " When we get up on Fifth with the date-makers , and with all Avenue somewhere , above Forty-sec sudden and illicit freedoms : he became ond Street , I 'll tell you where to stop .

At least , if they were not would not comfortably extend . After young , they seemed so to Mr. Sinkins , all , he had a great many things to do and when his taxicab was stopped by with his money . He got out of the the traffic he eyed them benevolently. cab importantly , paid the man , and " Good place for young folks to make went into the establishment where- dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the advertisements window . elegant clothing could be bought ready The wildness of his own adventure made . caused him to acknowledge a kinship The establishment was large and had a great deal of stucco applied to its front . Mr. Sinkins ignored these pretensions and moved calmly through the main doors to a vast and quiet interior . Numbers of young men sprang to attention ; he was instructed  - -  almost implored  --  to take the elevator to the fourth floor . It was unreasonable to suppose that all these attendants knew of the five hundred dollars in his inside coat pocket ; he could only conclude , therefore , that their attitude indicated a general eagerness to he of service to any visitor . " Maybe they do n't sell much stuff nowadays , " he reflected ; and the notion that he , with his five hundred dollars , represented a desirable and important element in the economic situation at Lenwood 's gave him confidence . He was , in himself , very nearly what the newspapers called an upturn . In half an hour he was clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing had , for one brief moment , almost intimidated him ; but such was the cunning arrangement of the mirrors and such the restrained eloquence of Mr. Sinkins ' personal salesman that no qualms could last very long . The ensemble was completed by a gray hat which leaned somewhat raffishly over Mr. Sinkins ' right eye , giving his whole appearance a touch of worldliness and savoir faire . As the salesman had pointed out , Mr. Sinkins possessed an average figure , a very average figure ; consequently the garments fitted to perfection . Mr. Sinkins adjusted his nose-glasses , handed over a surprising number of twenty-dollar bills , and ordered his old clothes sent to his office in Brooklyn . " And , say , " he added , looking at the salesman with a tentative , conspiratorial air , the look of a wary accomplice , " you do n't happen to know of a good **25;257;TOOLONG around here , do you ? I want to go to lunch , and I 'm not very well acquainted with the town . " The salesman , pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenwood 's , engaged in consultation with a department chief , with other salesmen , with other department chiefs . Before Mr. Sinkins had quite adjusted himself into his new clothes the result of these consultations had been pressed into his hand : a small square of cardboard bearing the legend , " Ernesto and O'Malley , " with an address in Fifty-second Street . On the back of this card , which had been initialled by Ernesto or O'Malley or both , one of the department chiefs had scrawled a message : " Introducing my friend Mr. Sinkins . " Mr. Sinkins did not look particularly dangerous , even after Lenwood 's had reclothed and transformed him . The waiter who admitted him to Ernesto and O'Malley 's restaurant had no hesitation in doing so . " I thought , " said Mir . Sinkins with a sudden relapse into the old timidity , " that I 'd like to have lunch . " " Sit right here , gentlaman , sit right here , " said the waiter with enthusiasm . A girl came and got Mr. Sinkins ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a menu in front of him . He was in a long , low room in a basement ; there were brightly colored pictures on the wall , a bar at one end of the room , and two or three customers eating and drinking their lunch . The place did not look or sound in the least like the luxurious speakeasies Mr. Sinkins had heard about ; it was neither crowded nor noisy , and its general decorous routine suggested an infinite respectability . Slightly disappointed but resolute , Mr. Sinking ordered a double Martini cocktail and hors d'ceurres and a minute steak with new peas . After wavering for some time between the names presented to him on a card , he settled upon a bottle of Clos Vougeot 1918 as being the least familiar and most expensive thing to drink with his food . By the time he had finished the steak and three-quarters of the Clos Vougeot he was more than ever at peace with the world . " Look here , my friend , " he said to the waiter , speaking with a certain lordly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch whisky for ? Say half a dozen bottles . " The waiter called the manager , and after a quantity of parliamentary debate , during which Mr. Sinkins calmly finished his bottle of Clos Vougeot , it was decided that the most satisfactory thing would be to take a whole case of whisky at seventy-five dollars . " Lika that , " the waiter pointed out , " you save more than twenty dollars . " When Mr. Sinkins had bought the case of whisky and paid his seventy-five dollars for it , and had also paid a bill amounting to some twelve dollars for his lunch , the manager affably invited him to have a drink on the house . " Better take a little coffee and cognac , " he said . " Have one with me . Nothing like a little coffee and cognac for the digestion . " Mr. Sinkins had coffee and brandy . But at the conclusion of this rite his program would not allow of further delay ; he refused to take any more to drink , even at the manager 's expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the amiable bootlegger . " You know , the kind they rent out by the day a big limousine , the real thing . You call it for me , will you ? So 's I can get this case of whisky out , y'see . I 'll need the car for two days . " " I know just whatta you want , " said the manager , bustling to the telephone . " I got ta good company , junta what you want . " In another fifteen minutes Mr. Sinkins and his case of whisky had beendeposited in an interminable closed car , the kind of glossy sarcophagus he had previously seen only in films or from the inconceivable distance of the curbstone . He leaned back in cushions both firm and soft ; a glittering object beside his hand excited his curiosity and turned out to be a cigarette lighter . " Company says you 'd better make a deposit , " said the chauffeur . " It 's thirty dollars a day . O.K. ? " " O.K. , " said Mr. Sinkins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's four or five hours from here , I imagine . Up near the Vermont line . Know how to get there ? " " We make this deposit at the garage , right around the corner , " said the driver obstinately . " Then I can look it up ; no sense in getting lost . " Mr. Sinkins handed over sixty dollars and sat quietly while the chauffeur consulted his oracles . The glitter of the cigarette lighter suggested something ; for some moments Mr. Sinkins tried vainly to determine what it was . When the chauffeur returned the elusive notion asserted itself . " We 'd better stop and get a couple of boxes of cigars somewhere , " Mr. Sinkins said . " Know where I can get some really good cigars ? " " Yes , sir , " said the chauffeur . With the really good cigars and the case of whisky Mr. Sinkins rested content . His lunch , his Clos Vougeot , his new clothes , and the smooth whisper of the motor over level pavements combined to persuade him into slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little seats which let down in front of him ; for some time he snored gently into the cushions , Near Albany he woke up and addressed the chauffeur . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " Trumbull , sir , " said the driver . " How long ' ' l it be before we get to Parkinville ? " The driver , a grim-looking young man with a jaw , answered with precision . " We 'll be there at seven , " he said . " It 's four hours from New York . " " That 's good , " said Mr. Sinkins . " Well , look here , Trumbull , I wonder if you 'll do something for me . I  --  crthat is , I 'm going to see some friends up in Parkinville , and I do n't suppose the question is likely to come up , but in case anybody asks you about the car ? " " I understand , " said Trumbull . There was a suggestion of scorn in his smile ; he had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , " he specified . " Very well , sir . But I do n't think I got your name . " " You do n't have to say it 's my ear , " said Mr. Sinkins . " You do n't have to say anything . They 'll think it 's mine . My name is Henry Sinkins , and I 'm staying at the Ritz . I 've only been in New York a few days , and you are working for me while I 'm there . You got that ? " " Yes , sir . " " It 'll be worth your while , " said Mr. Sinkins grandly . " Henry Sinkins , the Ritz . Do n't forget . . .. Maybe pretty soon we could open one of these bottles of whisky when we pass a place where they have soda water . What do you say ? " " I do n't suppose one drink would hurt me , " said the grim young man . In this admirable state of collusion with circumstance Mr. Sinkins arrived at Parkinville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestically down the main street of the town . " We 're going to Parkin College , " he instructed Trumbull . " It 's right down at the end of Main Street . When we get there we turn left , on Dewitt Avenue , and we 'll come to a row of fraternity houses . I guess we 'll have to stop and ask which one is mine ; I 'm going to one called Chi Nu Rho . Go ahead until I shout . " Main Street ended at the Parkin College campus , an elm-shaded area with gray buildings rising around it . The street which bordered the campus was Dewitt Avenue ; along its one side , opposite the silent college , were the lighted and noisy chapter-houses of the fraternities . Mr. Sinkins leaned out the window of his car and addressed a scurrying young man . " Hey , buddy , " he said . " Tell me where Chi Nu Rho is ? " The boy answered without even looking up . " Third house along , number 47 , " he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number 47 . " Try to park , " said Mr. Sinkins . " There seem to be a lot of cars around . When you 've parked you 'd better lock the car , on account of the whisky . Then come up to number 47 and ask for me . I do n't know whether I 'm staying here for dinner or what . I 'll tell you when you come . " Straightening hat and tie , and breathing once deeply as if for an encounter with destiny , Mr. Sinkins walked up to the broad veranda of number 47 and rang a bell . There was a brass plate above the door with Chi Nu Rho in heavy Greek letters engraved upon it . XNP , it looked like . Mr. Sinkins allowed his eyes to dwell on it briefly ; his heart was beating with unaccustomed celerity . The door was opened by a boy no more than sixteen or so  --  a very obvious freshman . " I 'm Sinkins , class of 1909 , " said Mr. Sinkins , extending a hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sing . It 's to-night , is n't it ? " Taking the thin paw of the child in his own , he executed the fraternity grip fiercely and in detail . To his delight the freshman replied in kind ; he had not , therefore , forgotten how to give the grip . " Come in , Brother Sinkins , " said the freshman . " There are a lot of alumni here . You 'll meet a lot of your friends . We 're glad  --  we 're glad to see you . Let me take your coat . " The agonized hospitality of the freshman was succeeded by cooler welcomes . A self-possessed young man came into the hall , followed by another . " Sinkins , class of 1909 , " said Mr. Sinkins , exchanging grips with each of the young men in turn . " Thought I 'd drop around for the Sing . I suppose there are some other members of my class here . " " Glad to see you , Brother Sinkins , " said the first young man . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented or not , but I suppose it is . We 're just about to go in to dinner . You 'll have dinner with us , I hope . Come on in and meet some of the other alumni . " Two large rooms were filled with men , with talk , and with cigarette smoke . Mr. Sinkins was introduced to half a dozen men whose names he did not get , whose ages or classes he could not even guess . Not one appeared to have any recollection of him or to expect any recollection from him . They stood jovially , aimlessly , and talked . " What class are you , Brother Simpkins ? " one of them asked . " 1909 , " said Mr. Sinkins . His interlocutor , a robust fellow with swelling chest , stared down at him . " 1909 ? " he echoed . " That 's funny . I 'm 1910 myself , but I do n't remember you . I 'm Baldridge , ' 10 . " " Well , " said Mr. Sinkins , his newfound confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , y'see , my freshman year-1905-1906 . After that I  --  I did n't come back to college . But if I 'd stayed I 'd have been in the class of 1909 . " " Ah , so that 's it , " said the other man , faintly disapproving . " You'renot 1909 , then . You 're ex-1909 . There 's a difference . . . Hey , there 's Don Moffatt . He was in the class of 1909 . You 'll remember him . Hey , Don , come here and meet a classmate of yours . " A massive middle-aged gentleman approached them . " Hello , Baldridge , " he said , and stared at Sinkins . " Where 's the class-mate ? " " I 'm Sinkins , " said Mr. Sinkins with rapidly increasing terror . He saw himself driven out into the night as an impostor . " Do n't you remember me , Don ? " " Sinkins ! " said the massive gentleman . " Well , I 'll be  --  Sinkins ! I have n't seen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Sinkins ! " The massive gentleman was obviously making the strongest effort to localize , to pin down , to concentrate his memories of that nebulous figure , old Sinkins . There was some vague recollection , but it had so far escaped him . His beefy and affable countenance trembled with the effort to be friendly , but not too friendly until he had adequately identified the object . " I  --  I used to do your Trig for you , " said Mr. Sinkins desperately . " When we were initiated I got a burn on the arm . Remember ? Then I dropped out after the freshman year . " The massive gentleman began to smile without particular warmth as memory returned . " Sink ! " he said . " We called you Sink ! Well , of course I remember , you old . . . Well , what do you . . . Well , think of . . . " There was a ring at the door , and the same agonized blond freshman hastened to answer it . In a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awed . The upper-Glassman approached the group of which Mr. Sinkins formed a part . a magical quality in the circle of middle-aged gentlemen around Mr. Sinkins abandoned all effort to remember him as he had been twenty-eight years before ; the present became sufficient . The gentleman of the class of 1910 dropped his air of disapproval . The massive gentleman , Mr. Don Moffatt , football captain and class president in 1909 , put a possessive arm across old Sinking ' shoulders . " Hell , " he said , breaking the rule against profanity in the house . " Old Sink is going to stay here until the whole show 's over , are n't you , Sink ? Tell your chauffeur to go away , you old plutocrat , and stick around . The Sing wo n't be over until ten-thirty or eleven . He can come back at midnight . " Such cordiality warmed Mr. Sinkins again , restored to him something of the tranquil confidence which had been his just after lunch . " I 'll send him away , but I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want him to take a suite at the Parkin-vine Hotel for me . Later on a couple of you fellows might like to come up there for a quiet smoke . I understand the house rules . . . " Don Moffatt guffawed jovially . " Attaboy ! " he said . " Good old Sink ! Probably got a coupla pints of rye out there under the seat , eh ? Well , you tell ' im . " Mr. Sinkins slipped out to the door and gave Trumbull his instructions . " Take a good-sized sitting room for me at the Parkinville Hotel , " he said . " That 's down at the other end of Main Street , in the town . Bedroom and bath , of course , but the important thing is to get the best sitting roomthey 've got . Does n't matter about the price . " " O.K. , Mr. Sinkins , " said Trumbull , who had already begun to taste the flavor of the enterprise . " And when do I come back here for you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be leaving soon after eleven . " He went back to an altered group of brothers in the bond . Don Moffatt , the pride of the class of 1909 , was now his sponsor and his bodyguard . He made a triumphant tour of the room , introduced as " Brother Sinkins  --  call him Sink  --  the Old Plutocrat , " and was surreptitiously given swigs of very bad liquor from time to time . Such refreshment was forbidden under the fraternity house rules , and the alumni made a pretense of concealment at each new disobedience . Mr. Sinkins met four or five men he could remember , and two of them professed to remember him . Most of the men in the house were either of Mr. Sinkins ' own generation  --  the classes of 1905 to 1914 ? or else infinitely their juniors . The members of the active chapter of Chi Nu Rho , slim worried undergraduates , hovered about and tried to be polite . At a given moment they began to propel the alumni toward the dining room . Mr. Sinkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class of 1908 on the other , was urged into a place of honor near the head of the table . The meal was neither very good nor very plentiful ; everything which was supposed to be hot had grown cold , and everything which was supposed to be cold had grown warm . The ice cream had melted and the coffee was deplorable . But to Sinkin the dinner was a Lucullan feast : he tasted it with the sauces of adulation and concern . " What you been doing all these years , Sink ? " Don Moffatt had said . " Something pretty good , or you would n't be traveling around in that bus I saw outside . Come on , confess everything . " " Well , " said Mr. Sinkins , expanding , " when I left college I went down to New York for awhile and then to South America . I 've got an uncle in the export business , you know  --  manufactured steel stuff , mostly . I did pretty well down there , and then a relation died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the truth is , I 'm thinking of retiring now . I 've only been in New York a few days . " " That so , " said Don Moffatt admiringly . " Well , you 've certainly . . . Well , who 'd have thought .. . I went into the bank here after I graduated , and I 'm still here . Do n't do so badly , of course , but it 'll be many a day before I can afford a fancy wagon and a chauffeur like that . Or retire , either . Zeb Baldridge did pretty well , up to about 1929 , but he 's in the same boat with the rest of us now . Well , you 're the same old Sink anyway . I 'd have known you in a million . " " What ever happened to Frank Waters ? " Mr. Sinkins enquired . " He was a freshman with me . Smart as a whip . " " He 's here , " said Don Moffatt . " Faculty . Been here ever since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate professor . Frank 'll be at the Sing , but I guess his wife does n't let him get far away from home at dinner time . You might try getting him to come up to the hotel for that quiet smoke you were talking about , eh , Sink ? We 'll see some other people from our class at the Sing . Remember Joe Peters ? He 's a Beta , of course , but , " said Mr. Moffatt generously , " he 's a good fellow . We might ask him up if he 's not busy . " " O.K. , " said Mr. Sinkins . " I 'd like to see ' em  --  to see ' em all . We 'll have a look around at the Sing . " When the meal had touched its lamentable climax and the coffee wasupon the table Mr. Sinkins handed a cigar to each of his neighbors . " Try one of these , " he said . " From Havana . Not bad . " The senior who presided at table rose to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome the alumni to-night , " he said . " Every year the Interfraternity Sing and Reunion brings out a lot of you fellows , brothers in the bond , and andwe 're all always mighty glad to welcome you . It must be a wonderful thing to come back to old Parkin like this and find Chi Nu Rho just the same , and the chapter certainly appreciates your interest and  --  and your loyalty and your  --  er  --  interest . The House Fund has benefited by your generosity in other years , and since this is a particularly bad year we 'd be particularly  --  er ? happy to think that you 'd  --  ah  --  be interested enough to contribute whatever you think is right . We wo n't spoil the Sing by any kind of appeal for funds , but of course you fellows all know ? " He was a statuesque young man of the football category , and the effort to speak brought drops of perspiration to his somewhat heavy face . When he finished it was with the injunction to sing five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and last of these , sung standing up at the table , were the same : the immemorial , the classic , " Wherever We Go . " Mr. Sinkins felt his stature increasing , his heart stout and full , as he joined in the melancholy refrain : Chi Nu Rho , Wherever we go , In desert or in the fields of snow , We 're loyal to you , Tried and tru-u-ue , Chi-i-i Nu . A gentleman of the class of 1911 supplied a piercing tenor harmony in the last two lines , abetted by a member of the class of 1934 who could sing bass . The whole roomful of men , somewhat abashed by the profundity of sentiment thus stirred up , sat down again when the last ululation had died away . " I 'd like to get a little more harmony into that , " said the senior who presided over the table . " You remember last year the Alpha Delta put it all over everybody else on account of all those birds they had in the Glee Club . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we alI sing out maybe it 'll be all right . Let 's try Chi Nu Rho Forever , ' and make it plenty loud . " After dinner there was a resumption of the jovial and aimless talk in the two front rooms of the house ; flasks appeared from alumni pockets again , and Mr. Sinkins was plied with attentions . Towards nine o'clock the head of the active chapter marshalled his flock . " We 'd better get moving , " he said . " Any kind of formation will do until we reach the Quadrangle ; but afterwards , remember , it 's in column of fours . " They moved , a miscellaneous collection of men of all ages , shapes , and sizes , towards the majestic buildings of the campus . Mr. Sinkins had seen taller edifices , but it seemed to him that he had never seen more imposing ones than those which constituted Parkin College . He looked up at their fa  --  ades as the fraternity trickled through Parkin Gate . There was a great bronze seal , just inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . Mr. Sinkins had never been anything but a freshman at Parkin College , but he walked upon the great seal now with a feeling of emancipation . The fraternities , all of them , converged upon the area between the main buildings , known as the Quadrangle . Here some hundreds of other men had already congregated or were rapidly assembling . Each fraternity had its appointed space , and the undergraduates and alumni crowded quietly into line . The faculty sat on the steps of Administration Hall . The fraternity men occupied the four sides of the Quadrangle ; the barbarians and townspeople were wedged in at the corners to watch and listen . The hats and scarves of girls were bright in the moonlight . They all stood up to sing the Alma Mater , and then they all sat down again . Mr. Sinkins , doubled up on a grassy slope with Don Moffatt on one side and the man he knew from ' 08 on the other , was silent in sheer content . The Alpha Delta defiled , and the Dekes , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herald . Each fraternity marched with banners , singing its songs . Chi Nu Rho was not among the earliest called ; for Chi Nu Rho was not , as a matter of fact , one of the most distinguished fraternities at Parkin College . A really distinguished fraternity would not have accepted Henry Sinkins when he was a freshman , twenty-eight years ago . But such discriminations meant nothing to Mr. Sinkins now . His eyes dwelt placidly upon the gray outlines of Administration Hall and caressed the incongruous red brick of Parkin Library . The songs of all the fraternities rose in the still , moon-enchanted air . The years seemed to pee ! off Mr. Sinkins , to leave him eager and promising , a freshman awed by stone and mortar , seventeen years young . A fellow-alumnus squatting near him on the grassy slope poked him in the shoulder , offered a flask of gin . " It 's our turn now , " said Don Moffatt . " Sing out , Sink  --  plenty loud . " They got up , the whole phalanx of Chi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Quadrangle in column of fours . When they reached the center they paused , saluted the steps on which the faculty sat , and proceeded to march all around the square . When this was completed they returned to their places . While they marched they sang : Chi Nu Rho , Wherever we go , In desert or in the fields of snow , We 're loyal to you , Tried and tru-u-u-ue , Chi-i-i Nu . Mr. Sinkins trod lightly and sang loud ; for nearly thirty years of dull , relentless life had been lifted from his shoulders . When the fraternity had seated itself again in its particular area he leaned over towards Don Moffatt , his spirit mysteriously alive to the enchantment of the freshman 's moon of thirty years ago . " Gee , " he said , " that was swell . " " You said it , " said Don Moffatt . " Nothing like old Parkin . Want a drink ? " After the Interfratemity Sing had come to an end with the singing of the Alma Mater and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their various fraternity houses and bore the undergraduates for an hour or two . Mr. Sinkins , conscious of his case of whisky at the Parkinville Hotel , appealed to Don Moffatt again . " Think we could get hold of Frank Waters now ? " he asked . " And Joe Peters , or anybody from our class  --  anybody you want . You know , I 've got a coupla drinks and a box of pretty good cigars over at the hotel . " " Sure thing , " said Don Moffatt . " They 're all here . We 'll mill around a little and see who we can find . There 's Frank Waters over there . Hey , Frank ! Here 's Sink  --  you know , Sinkins  --  has n't been back in years  --  richer than Creesus now , come back to see us . You remember Sink , of course . He was asking about you at dinner . Got a coupla drinks over at the hotel ; we wondered if you would n't come up and have one . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Sinkins was still uplifted by the ceremony in which he had just participated . He put his hand on the arm of the senior who seemed to be in charge of the active chapter . " When I get back to New York , " he explained , " I 'll see just what my commitments are and what I can do for the House Fund . In the meantime , wo n't you let me give you this  --  ah -- just to make sure ? I had a swell time to-night . " He gave one of his crisp new hundred dollar bills to the startled undergraduate . " It 's nothing , " he said . " Do n't thank me . I had a swell time to-night . I wonder if I could bother you  --  will you have one of the freshmen see if my car is out there ? I 'm afraid have to be getting along to the hotel . " Don Moffatt and Frank Waters and some six or seven others accompanied him to the car , which appeared to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beta house to tell three or four members of the ela-qs of 1909 what was afoot ; and at the Alpha Delt house , and at the Psi U house . When they reached the hotel Mr. Sinkins could see that Trumbull had executed his instructions even beyond the letter ; for the suite engaged for them was the largest and best , and soda water , corkscrews , ice , glasses , sandwiches everything was there . Don Moffatt picked up his first drink and lifted it solemnly in the air . " Fellows , " he said , " I ca n't say Brothers because you do n't all have the privilege of belonging to Chi Nu Rho  --  but what I want to say is a toast , that is , to propose a toast . I say we toast old Sink , our host here to-night . He was a freshman when some of the rest of us were , and I only wish we 'd all made our mark in the world the way he has , even though he did n't go on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmate  --  the most successful member of the class of I909 ? Sinkins ! " When Mr. Sinkins reached New York on the following afternoon he tipped Trumbull at the garage . " You need n't take me on to the hotel , " he said . " I 've got things to do around here . Here 's a little something for your whiskers . " He pulled out of his pocket his last ten-dollar bill and extended it jocosely to the unsmiling chauffeur . Then he turned and walked towards the subway . At his office , now rapidly emptying for the day , he found his package of old clothes from Lenwood 's and changed into them . The familiar shine of his worn clothes , a little less neat than usual because of the packing , made the events of the past twenty-four hours seem remote in time and space . He folded up the new clothes and put them away in his locker . Some day he would be able to bring them out as having been newly bought . Now he put them away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five hundred dollars . When he emerged into the outer office of Varick and Rose , Inc. , the firm of wholesale hardware merchants for whom he exercised the functions of bookkeeper , he was againwhat he had been three days before -- the nervous , scurrying , anxious Mr. Sinkins on his way home at the end of the day 's work . He was at home before Mrs. Sinkins and sat for awhile at the window of the front room , looking at Flatbush . When she came in , her thin and harassed face quivered in surprise . " Henry Sinkins , " she said . " Where have you been ? The office said you 'd taken two days off . You know they 'll dock you ; you know we ca n't afford it . It 's hard enough to get along on forty-five dollars a week anyway , without being docked . What on earth did you do it for ? " " An old aunt of mine died , and I went to her funeral , " said Mr. Sinkins . " I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' phone . Where 's Flora ? " " She 's down at the high school ; she 's going to be in a play , " said Mrs. Sinkins , " and I do n't know how on earth we 'll pay for her costume , but anyway the poor child . . I ca n't understand what 's the matter with you , Henry Sinkins . You 've never done a thing like this before in twenty years ; they do n't understand it at the office , either . Do you feel all right ? " " I feel pretty good , " said Mr. Sinkins.
