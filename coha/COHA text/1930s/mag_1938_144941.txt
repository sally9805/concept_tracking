When the Connecticut Nutmeg reached its readers last week , it carried an enthusiastic boost for a stubby " flivver " biplane by illustrious Frank Hawks , pacemaker to U. S. commercial aviation . For his Nutmeg contribution he had been promised a year 's subscription to the paper . " Fool-proof , " wrote Frank Hawks of the Gwinn " Aircar " behind which for the last year he had been putting all his reputation and energy . " It will not spin and it will not stall . . . . With only an hour or two of instruction any average person ( even the intelligentsia ) can fly our ship . . . . A development that should go down in history as the greatest aviation contribution since the advent of the Wright Brothers . " But Frank Hawks will not get his year 's subscription : he had taken his last flight , suffered his final crash . <P> Nearly a year ago , short , sturdy , smile-flashing Frank Hawks forswore his 20 years of headlong , rough- &-tumble; aviation , became vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airports showing what the Gwinn airplane could do . But even in such a head-over-heels endorsement as his Nutmeg contribution , Hawks had felt constrained to set down one big but . " Birds , " he reminded the Nutmeg 's readers , " are the only ones who never fail to make a perfect landing . " <P> At 41 , after two decades of flying army Jennies , daredevilish barnstorming , and pushing swift racers to more than 200 flying records coast-to-coast and here-to-there in the U. S. and Europe , Frank Hawks had learned a thing or two about landings . He had cracked many a ship in those 20 years . One in 1921 had cost him $200 , one last year , $100,000 . Such mishaps he took with a grin . " If you can walk away from it , " he used to say , " it 's a good landing . " Once or twice Frank Hawks was unable to walk away-one crash in 1932 put him in the hospital for months and filled his famous smile with store teeth ; in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down . Overhead wires were Frank Hawks 's pet hate . " They ought to bury ' em all , " he used to growl . <P> Ever since 1929 Frank Hawks had been aviation 's best pal and severest critic . Then he was flying for Texaco , and every push he gave aviation meant bigger gas and oil sales . Flying coast-to-coast and point-to-point faster than men had traveled such distances before , he used to crow : " That 's the way the airlines could fly this route if they 'd take that outside plumbing off their ships . " Recent years have seen most of Frank Hawks 's speed records fall to Howard Hughes , but they have also seen the " outside plumbing " disappear from commercial aviation . By 1935 , when Frank Hawks quit flying for Texaco , the 200-mile-an-hour transport flying he predicted had been approached .
