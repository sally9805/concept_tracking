A STUDENT IN ECONOMICS A STORY BY GEORGE MILBURN LL of the boys on the third floor of Mrs. Gooch 's approved rooms for men had been posted to get Charlie Wingate up that afternoon . He had to go to see the Dean . Two or three of them forgot all about it and two or three of them had other things to do , but Eddie Barbour liked waking people up . Eddie stuck his weasel face in at Charlie 's door just as the alarm clock was giving one last feeble tap . The clock stood on the bottom of a tin washpan that was set upsidedown on a wooden chair beside the bed . The alarm had made a terrific din . Eddie had heard it far down the hall . The hands showed two o'clock . Pale needles from a December sun were piercing the limp green window shade in a hundred places . Eddie Barbour yelled , " Aw right , Charlie ! Snap out of it ! " He came into the chilly room and stood for a moment staring vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only sound was the long , regular sough of Charlie Wingate 's breathing . He had n't heard a thing . Eddie made a sudden grab for the top of the covers , stripped them back and began jouncing the sleeper by the shoulders . Charlie grunted every time the bed springs creaked , but he nuzzled his pillow and went on sleeping . Eddie went over to the study table where a large , white-enamelled water pitcher stood and he came back to the bed with the water , breathing giggles . He tipped the water pitcher a little and a few drops fell on the back of Charlie 's neck without waking him . Eddie sloshed the icy water up over the pitcher 's mouth . A whole cupful splashed on Charlie 's head . Charlie sat up quickly , batting his arms about , and Eddie Barbour whinnied with laughter . " Arise , my lord , for the day is here , " he said , going across and ceremoniously raising the crooked window shade . Charlie sat straight up among the rumpled quilts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had slept with his clothes on . He sat up in bed all dressed , in a soldier 's brown uniform , all but his shoes and roll puttees . " You got army to-day ? " Eddie asked , putting the pitcher down . Charlie looked at him for a moment and blinked . Then he said in a voice stuffy with sleep , " Naw . I had army yesterday . I got army make-up today . " He worked his mouth , making clopping noises . " What time you got army make-up , Charlie ? When you come in from class you said get you up because you had to go see the Dean at two-thirty . " " Yeah , I do have to go see the Dean at two-thirty . But I got army makeup too . I got to make up drill cuts from three till six . " All at once he flopped back down on the bed , sound asleep again . ' Hey ! " Eddie cried , jumping for-ward . " Come out of that ! Wake up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to see the Dean at two-thirty . You just about got time to make it . " He jerked him back up in bed . " Screw the Dean , " Charlie said ; " Two hours ' sleep ai n't enough . " " Is two hours all the sleep you got last night ? " " Where you get the ' last night ' ? I worked all night last night . I had classes till noon yesterday . Two hours ' sleep was all I got to-day . And darn little more yesterday or the day before . When is Sunday ? Sunday 's the first day I 'm due to get any real sleep . Two hours ' sleep is not enough sleep for a man to get . " He plumped his stockinged feet onto the cold floor and got up stiffly . He went over to the washstand , where he picked up his tooth brush and tooth paste and a bar of scap and slowly took his face towel down from beside the warped looking-glass . He came back to where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands as if he had forgotten what he meant to do with them . He dumped them on the bed , took the pan with the alarm clock on it and set it on the floor . Then he sat down on the chair and picked up one of the heavy army shoes , held it and felt it and studied it carefully be- ' fore he put it on . He put on the other shoe with equal deliberation and stood up without lacing either of them . He took his things up from the bed and started off for the bathroom , his loose shoes clogging . Eddie Barbour followed him down the drafty hall . The creosote disinfectant that Mrs. Gooch used in her bathrooms gave off a strong odor . " Dag gum bathroom smells just like a hen coop , " Charlie said thickly as he stood in front of the white-specked mirror twisting his face . He would n't need a shave for another day . He had a fairly good-lookingface , tan and thin , with ringlets of blac  --  hair tumbling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at his image with dark eyes made narrow by two purplish puffs under them , and he yawned widely . Eddie Barbour stood leaning against the jamb of the bathroom door . He said , " You ought to try and get more sleep , Charlie . " " Are you telling me ? " Charlie said , running water in the face bowl . Eddie Barbour was a freshman too . Charlie Wingate came walking al. ) ng University Boulevard toward the campus , hunched up in his army overcoat . The raw December wind whipped his face and made him feel wide awake . He passed a bunch of fraternity men pitching horseshoes in the drive beside the K.A . house . Two or three , sprucely dressed , gave him impersonal glances as he passed . They did not speak , and he walked past self-consciously , seeing them without looking toward them . When he reached the business section opposite the campus he turned in at the white-tiled front of The Wigwam . The noon rush was over and Nick was not at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sitting in the booths along the wall . Charlie walked straight back along the white-tile counter and sat down on the end stool . Red Hibbert was standing by the coffee urns reading the sports section . When Charlie sat down Red folded his newspaper slowly and came over to wait on him . Charlie sat with his cheeks resting on the heels of his hands . " How 's it , Chollie , old boy , old boy ? " Red Hibbert said . " Not bad . Give me a cup of javy without and a couple of them Grandma 's oatmeal cookies over there , Red . Where 's Nick ? " Red scooted the plate with the cookies on it down the glassy white counter top and came along with the cup of black coffee . " This is Nick 's day for Kiwanis , " he said . " It looks to me like you 'd stay home and get some sleep once in a while . You 're dyin ' on your feet . " " I am going to get some sleep Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go see the Dean this afternoon . And I got make-up drill at three o'clock . I 've got to make up some drill cuts . " " What you got to go see the Dean about ? " " I do n't know what about ; here 's all it said . " Charlie reached in his overcoat pocket and pulled out a jagged window envelope and a mimeographed postal card . He pushed the envelope across the counter along with the postal card . " I got that other in the morning mail too . " Red took the printed form from the Dean of Men 's office out of the envelope and glanced at it . Then he picked up the postal card . It was headed , FOURTH AND FINAL NOTICE You are hereby summoned to appear before the chairman of the Student Senate Committee on Freshman Activities , Urn 204 Student Union Bldg. , not later than 4 p.m. , Friday afternoon . It will be to your advantage not to ignore this summons as you have three previous ones . This is positively the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should you fail to appear this time , steps will be taken to bring you . ( signed ) J. Aubery Carson , Chrmn Com . on Frshmn Actvts . Red waggled the postal card . " What you going to do about this ? " " Tear it up like I did the others , I guess . I know what they want . They want to try and make me buy one of them damn ' freshman caps . " " Take a tip from me , Charlie : I 'd go see them . It wo n't hurt nothing , and it might be a lot easier on you in the long run . " " Hell , what can they do ? " " Plenty . They could sick the D.D.M.C. 's onto you . " " All ! The D.D.M.C. 's , that bunch of amateur ku kluekers ! " " Call ' em amateurs if you want to , Charlie , but it was n't only but last Friday night they took that little Jew-boy , Sol Lewis , out of the rooming house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty professional job on him . They used the buckle-end of a belt on him . They claim he was a stool pigeon for the University . " " Stool pigeon ! Ah , you know that guy was n't a stool pigeon , Red . " " We-ell , I 'm not saying one way or the other . Anyhow , that 's what you 're up against when you take to fooling with that Student Committee on Freshman Activities , Charlie . " " Prexy claimed in his opening address at the first of school that he had put a stop to these masked frats and all this hazing . " " Yeah , he said he had ; but how 's he going to put a stop to the D.D.M.C. 's ? He ca n't kick out all the biggest shots in the University , can he ? All the big shots on the campus are D.D.M.C. 's . Football stars and fellas like that . You wo n't see the President kicking guys like that out of the University . " " Maybe not , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a racket . That 's all it is . Damn ' if I let ' em scare me into paying a dollar for a little old sleazy green cloth cap ! " " O.K. , Charlie ; I guess you know what you want to do . " " Anyway , how could I get around to see that committee before four o'clock this afternoon , and see the Dean at two-thirty , and go to make-up drill from three till six ? I 'll be late to drill and get bawled out by the captain again . The captain 's already about to flunk me for cuts . That 's what 's getting me down  --  Military . It 's this Military that 's getting me down . " " Jees , I do n't know , Charlie ; seems like I get a bigger kick out of army than I do any other course I got . They sure learn you more in army than they do in anything else in this University . " " Yeow , you learn plenty in army , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think they ought to be allowed to make it compulsory for freshmen and sophomores . That 's just like they had it over in Germany before they got rid of the Kaiser . " The red-haired boy gave him a startled look . He frowned heavily . " Charlie , " he exclaimed , " where are you getting all these radical ideas you been spouting around here lately ? " Charlie peered at him . Red 's face was set in earnestness . " Why that 's not a radical idea , " Charlie said , pushing back his empty coffee cup . " That 's just a plain historical fact , that 's all that is . I do n't see where they got any right to make Military Training compulsory . This is supposed to be a free country . That compulsory stuff is what Mussle-leany and birds like that pull . " " But , Charlie , it 's all for your own benefit . The University is just looking out after your own interests . " How do you figure they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one thing , when the next war comes we 'll all be officers , us fellas that got this training in college . We 'll go right into the regular army as officers . There 's where we 'll have the edge on guys that never did take advantage of a college education . Person'ly , when the next war comes along , I 'm not hankerin ' after any front-line trenches . And you know darn ' well they 're not going to stick their college-trained officers into frontline trenches to get shot . So there'swhere I figure us guys in R.O.T.C. will have a hig advantage . " " Yeah , you might be right , at that , Red . But I 'm not kicking about R.O.T.C. It 's just the compulsory part I 'm kicking against . " Red perked his head and scowled impatiently . " Charlie , they got to make it compulsory . If it was n't compulsory , how many of the fellas would enroll in it ? They have to make Military compulsory in order to give the fullest benefits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellas was taking it ? " " Anyway , I know some it 's not compulsory for , " Charlie said stubbornly . " Lastnight there was a Phi Gam pledge in here bragging about how he got out of Military . He told them at the first of school he did n't want to take Military . They told him he had to takeit ? required of all able-bodied freshmen . Could n't get his degree without it . So he had to go buy his army shoes . Well , he got the shoe store to send the bill to his old man . His old man is one of these they call ' em pacifists . When his old man gets the bill for his kid 's army shoes , maybe you think he do n't get the President of this - University on long distance and tell him where to head in at . And this kid did n't have to take Military , neither . His old man 's a big shot lawyer in the City . " " Yeah , but you got to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what I mean , Red . You can get away with plenty in this University if you got the pull . " Charlie Wingate loped up the steps of the Administration Building , hurried through the revolving doors , and walked past hissing steam radiators down the long hall to the Dean of Men 's office . He was ten minutes late . Before he opened the frosted-glass door he took out a pair of amber-colored spectacles and put them on . Then he went in and handed his summons to the secretary . " The Dean will see you in a moment , " she said . " Please take a chair . " Charlie sat down and gave an amber-hued glance about the outer office . Three dejected freshmen , holding their green caps , were waiting with him . He recognized none of them , so he picked up a week-old copy of the Chrieion Science Monitor and started to read it . But the room was warm and he immediately went to sleep . He had his head propped back against the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses hid his eyes and no one could see that they were closed . He was awakened by the secretary shaking him . She was smiling and the freshmen were all snickering . " Wake up and pay for your bed , fella ! " one of the freshmen called , and everyone laughed heartily . " I sort of drowsed off . It 's so nice and warm in here , " Charlie said , apologizing to the pretty secretary . The Dean of Men got up as he entered and , with his eyes on the slip bearing Charlie 's name , said , " Ah , this is Charles Wingate , is n't it ? " He grasped Charlie 's hand as if it were an honor and pressed a button under the edge of his desk with his other hand . The secretary appeared at the door . " Miss Dunn , will you bring in Win-gate 's folder  --  Charles W-i-n-g-a-t-e . How do you like college by now , Wingate ? Eyes troubling you ? " " Pretty well , sir . Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The secretary came back with the folder and the Dean looked through it briefly . " Well , Wingate , I suppose you 're anxious to know why I sent for you . The unpleasant truth is , Wingate , you do n't seem to be doing so well in your college work . Your freshmanadviser conferred with you twice about this , and this week he turned your case over to me . My purpose , of course , is to help you . Now , to be quite frank , Wingate , you 're on the verge of flunking out . Less than a third of the semester remains , and you have a failing grade in English 101 , conditional grades in Psychology 51 and Military Training ; three hours of F and four hours of D , almost half your total number of hours . On the other hand , you have an A average in Spanish 1 and a Bin Economics 150 . Wingate , how do you account for your failing English when you are an A student in Spanish ? " " To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my written work in English , and I 've never been able to catch up . And I do n't really have to study Spanish . My father is a railway section foreman in my home town , and he 's always had a gang of Mexicans working for him . I 've been speaking Mexican ever since I was a kid . It 's not the pure , what they call Castilian , Spanish , but I probably know almost as much Spanish as my professor . " " How about this B in Economics ? That 's a fairly high grade . " " Yes , sir . Doctor Kenshaw  --  he 's my Ec professor  --  does n't give exams . Instead he gives everyone a B until he calls for our term papers . We do n't recite in his class . We just listen to him lecture . And the grade you get on your term paper is your semester grade . " " Ali ! What you students term a pipe course , eh , Wingate ? " " Not exactly , sir . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term paper . But I 'm counting on keeping that B in Ec . " " That 's fine , Wingate . But it appears to me that it 's high time you were getting busy on some of these other grades , too . Why ca n't you dig in and pull these D 's up to B 's , and this F up to at least a C ? You 've got it in you . You made an unusually high grade on your entrance exams , your record shows . Graduated from high school with honors . What 's the trouble , Wingate ? Tell me ! " " I do n't know , sir , except I work at night and ? " " Oh , I see it here on your enrollment card now . Where do you work ? " " I work nights for Nick Pappas , down at The Wigwam . " " How many hours a night do you work ? " " Ten hours , sir . From nine till seven . The Wigwam stays open all night . I eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Very interesting , Wingate . But do n't you suppose that it would be advisable to cut down a bit on this outside work and attend a little more closely to your college work ? After all , that 's what you 're here for , primarily  --  to go to college , not work in a cafe . " " I could n't work fewer hours and stay in school , sir . I just barely get by as it is I get my board at The Wigwam , and I pay my room rent , and I 've been paying out on a suit of clothes . That leaves only about a dollar a week for all the other things I have to have . " " Wingate , should n't you earn more than that , working ten hours ? " " I get the regular , first-year-man rate , sir . Twenty-five cents an hour . It 's set by the University . Nick takes out for board . " " Ca n't you arrange for a little financial support from home ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I have two brothers and two sisters at home younger than I am . It would n't be right for me to ask my father to send money out of what he makes . " " But surely you could get out and land something a little more lucrative than this all-night restaurant job , Wingate . " " No , sir . Twenty-five cents is the standard rate for working students , and I have n't found anything better . Nick says he has at least twenty men on the waiting list for this job I have . " " Well , there 's this about it , Wingate . The University is here , supported by the taxpayers of this State , for the purpose of giving the young men and women of this State educational opportunities . The University is not here for the purpose of training young men to be waiters in all-night restaurants . And , so far as I can see , that 's about all you are deriving from your University career . So it occurs to me that you should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to your college work or drop out of school altogether . We are very loath to encourage students who are entirely self-supporting . And yet , I will admit that I know any number of first-rate students who are entirely self-supporting . There 's Aubery Carson , for example . Quarterback on the football team , delegate to the Olympics , president of the Student Senate , and he 's a straight A student . Aubery Carson was telling me only last week that he has n't had any financial assistance from home since he enrolled as a freshman . Aubery is a fine example of the working student . " " Yes , sir ; but look at the job Carson has . He works for a big tobacco company , and all he has to do is hand out Treasure Trove cigarettes to other students . The tobacco company pays him a good salary for passing out samples of their cigarettes . " " Why , Wingate , you surely must be mistaken about that . I do n't believe Aubery Carson smokes . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest all-round athletes in this country . " " No , sir ; I do n't say he smokes either . But that 's the straight stuff about his job with the cigarette com-pany . They figure it 's a good advertisement to have a popular guy like Auhery Carson passing out Treasure Troves . Sort of an endorsement . " " All the same , Wingate , it does n't reflect a very good attitude on your part , criticizing the way one of your fellow students earns his college expenses . " " Oh , I did n't mean to criticize him , sir . I was only saying ? " " Yes , yes , I know ; but all this is beside the point . We 're here to discuss the state of your grades , Wingate . The fact is , you are on probation right now . As you must know , any student who is passing in less than half his work is automatically suspended from the University and must return to his home . Now one F more and out you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " I 'd hate to have to go back home like that , sir . " " Well , you 'd have to . If you flunk out , the University authorities are obliged to see that you return to your home immediately . " " I 'd hate that , sir . I 'd hate to go back home and have to live off my family , and that 's probably what I 'd have to do . I had a letter from mother yesterday , and she says that nearly all the boys who graduated from high school with me are still there , loafing on the streets and living off their old folks . I do n't like that idea . Mother 's proud of me because I 'm working my way through college . You know there arc not many jobs to be had nowadays , sir , and I 'd hate to have to go back home and loaf . " " It is a problem , I 'll confess , Wingate . But what 's the point in your coming to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flunking your class work ? Moreover , your freshman adviser reports that you make a practice of sleeping in class . Is that true ? " " Well , yes , sir . I suppose I do drop off sometimes . " " Pretty impossible situation , is n't it , Wingate ? Well , I 've given you the best advice I can . Unless you can alter your circumstances I suggest that you withdraw from the University at once . We have six thousand other students here who need our attention , and the University has to be impartial and impersonal in dealing with these problems . Unless you can find some means to avoid flunking out I suggest withdrawing beforehand . " " Withdrawal would be a disgrace to me , sir . If I withdrew and went back home now , everyone at home would say that I had been expelled . You know how small towns are . " " Ah , now , Wingate , when you begin dealing with small-town gossip , I fear you 're really getting outside my province . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I believe I 'll try to stick it through , sir . try to remove the conditional grades , and maybe I can luck through on my finals . " " I hope you can , Wingate . As long as you feel that way about it , good luck to you . " The Dean of Men stood up . Charlie stood up too . The Dean put out his hand and showed his teeth in a jovial smile and bore down hard on Charlie 's knuckles . " I 'm counting on you strong , old man , " he said , encircling Charlie 's shoulders with his left arm . " I know you have the stuff and that you 'll come through with flying colors one of these days . " " Thank you , sir , " Charlie said , grinning tearfully while the Dean gave his shoulder little pats . He edged toward the door as soon as the Dean released him , but when he reached it he hesitated and pulled the postal card out of his pocket . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot to ask you . I got this in the mail to-day . I 've been a little bothered about what to do about it . " The Dean of Men took the mimeographed card and read it quickly . " Why , I should say that you ought to go see what they want , Wingate . You should n't ignore things of this sort , you know . It 's all a part of the normal activities of college life . No reason for antagonizing your fellow-students by ignoring a request of this kind . " " All right , sir ; I 'll go see them . " " Why , to be sure , go see them ! Always keep in mind that the University is a social as well as an educational institution , Wingate . " Room 204 , Student Union Building , was a newly finished , rather barren office that smelled dankly of lime in the fresh plaster . It was fitted with a metal desk painted to imitate painted walnut , a large brass spittoon , a square metal waste-paper basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar , a huge pasteboard shipping case , and J. Aubery Carson , who had the freshman cap concession . Charlie Wingate hesitantly opened the door and saw J. Aubery Carson tilted back in a chair , his feet on the metal walnut desk , reading a copy of Ballyhoo . " Co-ome in ! Co-ome in ! " J. Aubery Carson called loudly without putting down his magazine . " All right , old timer . What 's on your mind ? " Charlie held out the mimeographed card . Carson held his magazine a moment longer before accepting the card . He shoved his hat down over one eye , turning the card , looking first at the back , then at the name on the front . " Um-m-in , " he grunted . He reached over to a drawer in the filing cabinet without taking his feet down and flipped through the cards . He looked at the name on the postal card again , pulled a card out of the file , and drew his thick lips up into a rosette . He looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at last in a severe tone , " you have been dilatory . Indeed , Wingate , I might even go so far as to say you have been remiss . At the beginning of this semester you applied for and received a refund on your student ticket fee . That signifies that you have not attended a single football game this season , and that you have no intention of honoring any of the University 's athletic spectacles with your presence this season . Also , the record discloses that you did not register at the Y.M.C.A. freshman mixer . Neither did you respond to polite solicitation for a trifling monetary pledge to the Memorial Stadium Fund . And , most heinous offense of all , Wingate , we find that you have yet to pay in one dollar for your freshman cap , prescribed by your seniors and purveyed to you on a non-profit basis by the Student Committee on Freshman Activities . And yet , Wingate , I find you duly enrolled and attending classes in this here now University . Wingate , what possible excuse do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speak up ! " Charlie said meekly , " Well , I work nights and it 's hard for me to get here in the daytime , and I ca n't afford to buy a cap . " " What 's this ! " Carson exclaimed , jerking his legs down from the desk top and banging the desk with two flat hands . " Why , boy , this is treason ! You mean you ca n't afford not to buy a freshman cap . " " No , I just came to tell you that a dollar has to go a long way with me and that I need every cent I earn to stay in school . So I wish you 'd please excuse me from buying a freshman cap . " Carson 's lean , florid face suddenly became rigid and he stuck his jaw out with his lower teeth showing and , in spite of his marcelled taffy pompadour and his creased tailored suit , he again looked very much as he did in all the sporting section photographs . " See here , Wingate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freshman at this University . You 'll have to wait another year before you can start saying what you will do and wo n't do , see ? Now we 've been patient with you . You 've been in school here three months without putting on a freshman cap . Do you realize that over eighty-five per cent of the freshman class came in here and bought . their caps before the first week of school ended ? Now who do you think you are , Wingate  --  Mr. God ? You 're going to get you a cap , and you 're going to wear it . See ? No ifs , ands , or buts about it . And if you do n't leave this office with a green cap on your head then I do n't mind telling you that we 've got ways of getting one on you before another day passes . " " Well , if I buy one it 's going to put me in a bad hole . All the money I 've got is what I saved out to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fella , if we let horsefeathers like that go here , half the freshman class would n't be wearing freshman caps right now . Now I 've said all I 'm going to to you . Do you want your green cap now or will you wait till later ? That 's all I want to know . I do n't aim to give you any high-pressure sales talk on something that 's already been decided for you . Take it or leave it . " Carson reached over into the large pasteboard box , groped far down in it , and brought forth a small green monkey cap . He tossed it on the desk . Charlie Wingate stuck his forefinger in his watch pocket and pulled out a small pad of three carefully folded dollar bills . He unfolded them and laid one on the desk and picked up the cap . Carson put the dollar in his pocket and stood up . Charlie stood holding his cap . He scuffed the cement floor with his shoe toe and began doggedly , " The only thing is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " Carson said suavely . " No hard feelings whatsoever . " He held out a freshly opened pack of cigarettes . " Here , have a Treasure Trove on me before you go . " That night all the stools along the counter at The Wigwam were filled when Charlie Wingate came in , still dusty from the drill field . He got himself a set-up back of the counter and went into the kitchen . He moved about the steam-table , dishing up his dinner . He dragged a stool over to a zinc-covered kitchen table and sat down to eat . The kitchen was warm and steamy and the air was thick with the odors of sour chili grease and yellow soap melting in hot dishwater . Charlie 's fork slipped through his fingers , and he began nodding over his plate . Fat Kruger , the night dishwasher and short-order cook , yelled , " Hey , there , wake up and pay for your bed ! " Charlie jerked his head up and looked at the ponderous , good-humored cook with half-lidded eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a w'ile , Charlie ? " Fat said in a friendly tone . " You 're going to kill yourself if you do n't watch out , trying to go without sleep . " " Do n't worry , Fat . I can take it , " Charlie said . Almost two hours had to pass before it would he the hour for him to come on , but not time enough for him to walk back to his room and catch a nap , so he took the book on which he had to make an outside reading report in Economics 150 and went up to the last booth to study until nine o'clock . He fell asleep and he did not wake up until Red Hibbert , going off , shook him and told him that it was almost time for him to come on . He closed his book and went back to the washroom . The acrid stench of the mothballs that Nick used to deodorize the latrine cleared his head . He took down his apron and tied it on over his army breeches . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addicts came dribbling in . When the telephone rang , Charlie answered it , jotting down short orders to go . The delivery boy came in and went out and hanged off on his motorcycle with paper bags full of " red hots " and nickel hamburgers and coffee in paper cylinders . The Wigwam 's white tile shone under the inverted alabaster urns . There was a pale pink reflection in the plate-glass window as the Neon sign outside spelled and re-spelled " Wigwam Eats . Open All Night . " A party of drunken Betas came in at ten-thirty and seated themselves noisily in the last booth . They tossed Charlie 's economics book out into the aisle with a whoop , and he came and picked it up and took their orders in silence while they kidded him about his flap ears and the grease on his white coat . At eleven o'clock the last whistle at the University power house blew for the closing hour , and a couple of lingering " dates " scurried out . Finally the drunks left , after one had been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came coasting up at midnight and checked in and roared away again on his motorcycle . The long small hours began inching past . At one o'clock Charlie finished cleaning up the drunk 's mess and he had cleared off the last of the tables . The Wigwam was empty , so he opened the book he must read for Ec 150 . He had read a few lines when a bunch of girls from the Theta house down the street came charging in , giggling and talking in gasps and screams , their fur coats clutched over their sleeping pajamas . It was long after the closing hour , and they told Charlie to keep an eye out for the University night watchman . They took up the two back booths and they consulted The Wigwam 's printed menu card without failing to read aloud thelines " Nick ( Pericles ) Pappas , " " We Employ Student Help Exclusively , " and " Please Do Not Tip . A Smile Is Our Reward " with the customary shrieks . Nearly all ordered filet mignon and French fries , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered pecan waffles and coffee , which were . When he had served their orders Charlie went back to his book again , but the low buzz of their talk and their sudden spurts of laughter disturbed him and he could not read . At a quarter of two they began peering round corners of their booths . They asked Charlie in stage-whispers if the coast were clear . Charlie went to the door and looked out on the street and beckoned widely with his arm . They trooped out with their fur coats pulled tight , their fur-trimmed silken mules slapping their bare heels . Charlie went on back to clear away their dishes . They had left about thirty cents as a tip , all in cents and nickels . The coins were carefully imbedded in the cold steak grease and gluey syrup and putty-colored cigarette leavings on their plates . Charlie began stacking the plates without touching the money . He carried the dirty dishes back and set them through the opening in the kitchen wall . Fat Kruger came to the opening and Charlie went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you leavin ' this tip again ? " " You 're damn ' right , I 'm leaving it ! " Charlie said . " I can get along without their tips . They leave it that way every time . I guess they think I 'll grabble on their filthy plates to get a Iousy thirty cents . It takes a woman to think up something like that . " " Charlie , you 're too proud . I do n't see where you can afford to be so proud . The way I figure it , thirty cents is thirty cents . " " Hell , I 'm not proud , Fat . I just try to keep my self-respect . When those sorority sows come in and plant their tips in the dirt and grease of their plates , damn ' if I 'll lower myself to grub it out . " He sat down on a counter stool with the economics book before him , trying to fix his mind on it . He read a page . The print became thin blurred parallels of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he propped the muscles with his palms at his temples , trying to keep his eyes open . His head jerked forward and he caught it and began reading again . Soon his face lowered slowly through his hands and came to rest on the open book . Fat Kruger came through the kitchen swinging door and tiptoed up front . Fat stood grinning , watching Charlie sleep . Cramped over with his head on the counter , Charlie snored softly . Fat gave his head a gentle shove , and Charlie started up to catch his balance . " For God sakes , guy , you 're deadl " Fat howled . " Do n't you never get no sleep except like that ? " " What time is it ? " Charlie said , yawning and arching his back . " Half-past two . " " Jees , is that all ? " " Charlie , go back there and lay down on the kitchen table . I 'll watch the front for you . Nobody 'll be coming in for a while . " As he was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweaters , overcoats , and grizzled dewlaps , his black timeclock slung over one shoulder by a leather lanyard . Uncle Jim laid his long , nickeled flashlight carefully on the counter and eased himself onto a stool . He ordered a cup of black coffee and in a lecherous wheeze began telling dirty stories selected from his twenty years ' experience as a campus night-watchman . Fat Kruger nickered loudly after each telling , and Charlie jerked his eyes open and smiled sleepily . It was three-thirty when Uncle Jim left . Charlie opened his book again . " Charlie , I would n't put my eyes out over that damn ' book if I was you , when you 're dyin ' for sleep , " Fat said . " I 've got to get it read , Fat . It 's my outside reading in Economics and the whole semester grade depends on it . It 's the hardest book to keep your mind on you ever saw . I 've been reading on it for over a month and I 'm only half through , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I flunk Ec I flunk out of school . " " Why mess with reading it ? I know a guy over at the Masonic Dorm who 'll read it and write your report for two bucks . He writes all my English themes for me , and I 'm making a straight A in English . He only charges fifty cents for short themes and two bucks for term papers . You ought to try him . " " Hell , Fat , you get five dollars a week from home . Where am I going to get two dollars for hiring a guy to read this book ? " " Charlie , I just ca n't figure you out . You never do get any real sleep . You sure must want a college education bad . It do n't look to me like you would figure it 's worth it , " " Oh , it 's worth it It 's a big satisfaction to my folks to have me in college . And where can a man without a college degree get nowadays ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it was going to be like this when I came down here last Fall . I used to read College Humor in high school , and when fellows came home from University for the holidays , all dressed up in snappy clothes , talking about dates and football and dances , and using college slang  --  well , I had a notion I 'd be like that when I got down here . The University publicity department sent me a little booklet showing how it was easy to work your way through college . So here I am . I have n't had a date or been to a dance or seen a football game since I enrolled . And there are plenty of others just like me . I guess I 'm getting a college education , all right  --  but the only collegiate thing I 've been able to do is go to sleep in class . " " How you get by with sleeping in class , Charlie ? " " I wear those colored spectacles and prop myself , and the profs ca n't see I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy face mournfully . " Boy , it sure is tough when a man do n't get his sleep . " " Yeah , it is , " Charlie said , looking down at his book again . " I 'll get a break pretty soon , though . I 'd rather chop off a hand than to flunk out of University before I 'd even finished one semester . " The tardiest of the hundred students enrolled in Dr. Sylvester C. 0 . Kenshaw 's Economics 150 straggled into the lecture room and made their ways to alphabetically-assigned chairs with much scuffling and trampling of toes and mumbled apologies . Ec 150 , renowned as a pipe course , was always crowded . Doctor Kenshaw was the celebrated author of seven textbooks on economics , five of which his students were required to buy each semester . Doctor Kenshaw 's national reputation as an economist permitted him to be erratic about meeting his classes , but fame had never dimmed his fondness for student flattery . The only students who ever flunked Ec 150 were those who gave affront to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not laughing at his wit or by being outrageously inattentive to his lectures . Doctor Kenshaw was late that morning . Charlie Wingate sat in his chair on the back row in an agony of waiting . He had on his amber glasses and he could fall asleep as soon as Doctor Kenshaw opened his lecture . But he had to stay awake until then . There was a slow ache in the small of his back . The rest of his body was numb . He had not taken off his army shoes for twenty hours , and his feet were moist and swollen . Every time he shifted position his arms and legs were bathed in prickling fire . He kept his eyes open behind the amber lenses , watching the clock . Small noises of the classroom came to him as a low , far-off humming . When the clock on the front wall showed nine after eleven the seated class began stirring as if it were mounted on some eccentric amusement-park device . Excited whispers eddied out on the warm air of the steam-heated lecture room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not meeting this class to-day ! " " He 's got one more minute to make it ! " " Nam ; six more ! You have to wait fifteen minutes on department heads . " There was a seething argument on this point , but when the clock showed fourteen minutes after eleven a bold leader sprang up and said , " Come on , everybody ! " All but five or six especially conscientious students rose and milled after him toward the door . Charlie Wingate followed , thoroughly awakened by the chance of getting to bed so soon . The leader yanked the door open and Doctor Kenshaw stumbled in , all out of breath , his eyeglasses steamed , his pointed gray beard quivering , a vain little man in a greenish-black overcoat . " Go back to your seats ! " Doctor Kenshaw commanded sternly as soon as he could get his breath . He marched over to his lecture table and planked down his leather brief case . He took off his overcoat and began wiping the steam from his eyeglasses while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to me , " he said , his voice quavering with anger , " that it would be no more than courteous for this class to await my arrival on those rare occasions when I am delayed . Day after day you come lagging into my classes , and I have always been extremely lenient in giving credit for attendance , no matter how tardy your arrival . Certainly it is no more than my privilege to ask that you wait for me occasionally . " A few students exchanged meaning glances . They meant , " Now we 're in for it . The old boy has on one of his famous mads . " " To-day , I believe I shall forego delivering my prepared lecture , " Doctor Kenshaw went on in a more even voice , but with elaborate sarcasm , " and let you do the talking . Perhaps it would be meet to hear a few outside reading reports this morning . All of you doubtless are aware that these reports were due last week , although I had not expected to call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sufficiently with the importance of these reports . They represent to me the final result of your semester 's work in this course . The grades you receive on these reports will be your grades for the semester . Let us begin forthwith . When your name is called , you will rise and read your report to the class . " He opened his roll book . " Mr. Abbott ! " he called . Mr. Abbott stammered an excuse . Doctor Kenshaw passed coldly on to Miss Adams , making no comment . All through the A 's it was the same . But with the B 's an ashen , spectacled Miss Balleutyne stood up and begat ' reading in a droning voice her report on " The Economic Consequences of the Peace . " Obviously Doctor Kenshaw was not listening to her . His hard little eyes under craggy brows were moving up one row and down the other , eager for a victim . On the hack row , Charlie Wingate 's propped legs had given way and he had slipped far down into hisseat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Charlie they stopped moving . Someone tittered nervously and then was silent as Doctor Kenshaw jerked his head round in the direction of the noise . Miss Ballentyne droned on . When she had finished , Doctor Kenshaw said dryly , " Very good , Miss Ballentyne , very good indeed . Erah  --  would someone be kind enough to arouse the recumbent young gentleman in the last row ? " There was a murmur of laughter while everyone turned to look at Milton Weismanu nudging Charlie Wingate . Doctor Kenshaw was running down the list of names in his small record book . Milton Weismann gave Charlie another stiff poke in the ribs , and Charlie sprang up quickly . Everyone laughed loudly at that . " Mr. ? ah  --  Wingate , is n't it ? 14Ir . Wingate , your report . " " Pardon me , sir ? " " Mr. Wingate , what was the title of the book assigned to you for report in this class ? " " Theory of the Leisure Class by Veblen , sir . " " Ah , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in evolving your own theory of the leisure class . Is that right , Mr. Wingate ? You have evidently concluded that Economics 150 is the leisure class . " The class rocked with laughter . Doctor Kenshaw , pleased with his pun and flattered by the response to it , found it hard to keep his face straight . Suddenly he was back in good humor . " Mr. Wingate 's theory is quite apparently one to which the majority of this class subscribes . Now I try to be lenient with students in this class . Surely no one could describe me as a hard taskmaster . But I resent your implication that I have been too easygoing . Now these reading reports were assigned to you last September , and you have had ample time to prepare them . I 'll not call for any more of them to-day , but at the next session of this class I expect every one of these papers in . As for you , Mr. Wingate , if you 'll see me directly after class , I 'll be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make . I want most of all to be fair . I have always given every student the benefit of the doubt until a student deliberately flaunts me with his indifference . But I am capable of being quite ruthless , I assure you . " " Thank you , sir , " Charlie mumbled . He entered a slow torture , trying to keep awake until the class bell rang . He rolled his hot , red-veined eyes up with drunken precision to see the clock . Fifteen minutes had to pass before the bell would ring . When the bell rang the class arose quickly and began clumping out . Several co-eds and men , politickers and apple-polishers wangling for A 's , crowded about the lecture table . Doctor Kenshaw always remained behind after each class to accept their homage . But to-day he looked up over the heads of the eager group . He silenced their inane questions and flagrant compliments by placing his right forefinger against his thin , unsmiling lips . " Sh-h-h ! " he said . The apple-polishers turned their heads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tiptoed away . When the last had gone out , Doctor Kenshaw unscrewed his fountain pen and opened his roll book . He ran his finger down the list until he came to " Wingate , C. " and in the space opposite under " Smstr Grd " he marked a precise little F. A whiffling snore escaped Charlie Wingate in the back of the room . Doctor Kenshaw looked back across the varnished chair rows with a frown of annoyance . He took his overcoat from its hanger , slipped into it , and strapped up his brief ea .4 .. He jammed on his hat and strode out of the lecture room , slamming the door . The noise made a hollow echo in the empty room , but it did not disturb Charlie Wingate . He slept on behind his amber glasses .
