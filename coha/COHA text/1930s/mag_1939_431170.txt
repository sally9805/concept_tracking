SEVENTEEN stories above one of the busiest streets in New York City , America 's strangest livestock farm has its barns and pastures . The barns are glass jars . The pastures are mesh-inclosed cages . And , the product of this skyscraper ranch is house flies ? 5,500,000 flies a year ! The unique enterprise started ten years ago when scientists of an insecticide company wished to make exact tests of the effectiveness of their product . They needed normal , healthy flies on which to test the sprays . From this small beginning , the fly farm has grown to the mass-production activity of today . Under the direction of Dr. Alfred Weed , as many as 15,000 flies a day are turned out for a wide variety of uses . The majority end their days in spraying tests conducted in the laboratory where they are born . But others are purchased for different uses . Mrs. Norman Bel Geddes , wife of the noted industrial designer , once put in several orders for flies to feed a pet chameleon . Another New York woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toads , called the laboratory to inquire the price of a dozen houseflies a day for her pets . During the past summer , 5,000 flies a day have been supplied for one exhibit at the New York ' World 's Fair .  | All these insects grow up under exactly the same conditions . Air-conditioning apparatus keeps the humidity and temperature in the glass-inclosed fly farm the same from day to day . Ordinary flies , breeding in filth , are oftentimes troubled with mites . Insects infested with these minute parasites have reduced vitality and succumb to poison sprays more easily than healthy flies . To insure uniform results , all flies used for testing insecticides have to be free from parasites . By raising his winged livestock under carefully controlled conditions , Dr. Weed is able to produce millions of flies that meet this requirement . The adult insects , housed in mesh cages , feed upon water and milk . The eggs laid by the " breeding stock " are carefully seeded in jars filled with a mixture of bran , brewer 's yeast , malt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from egg to adult , consumes about ten days . For more than half of this time , the larvae , or maggots , feed and burrow through the mixture in the jars . Then they turn into tiny brown pupae which are collected for shipment . Mailed in cardboard tubes , they produce adult flies about three days later .  |
