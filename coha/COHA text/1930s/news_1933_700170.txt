txt A campaign to raise $4,000,000 to help the city 's family welfare agencies in providing assistance to those needy and unemployed who will not be reached by the government relief programs this Winter I will be conducted next month by a group of prominent financiers , philanthropists and welfare workers . 1 Announcement of the campaign I was made yesterday following a I meeting of the group , to be known as the family welfare committee , at the office of Thomas W. Lamont of J. P. Morgan &; Co . The family agencies which will disburse the $4,000,000 fund are I those which have cooperated in 1 past years with the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee . Last year this committee , of which I Harvey D. Gibson was chaiaman , apportioned $4,800,000 of its $15 , - 000,000 fund to the family welfare societies , which in turn used the share allotted to them for unemployment relief purposes . The Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee having ended its duties , with the work being taken over by government agencies , it is now feared that a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deprived of the allot ment which they had received from Mr. Gibson 's organization . To avoid this gap the newly formed corn-mittee Will strive to raise $4,000,000 . The regular budgets of the family1 welfare agencies in question will be raised , as heretofore , through appeals by the individual organiza- I tions . Presiding at yesterday 's meeting , ' at which the plans for the campaign were outlined , was Walter S. Gifford , president of the Charity Organization Society . Representatives of welfare agencies and State and city relief organizations attended . Among these were Frederick Dan- , iels , director of the State Temporary Emergency Relief Administration , and Frank J. Taylor , Commissioner of Public Welfare , who is chairman of the City Relief Administration . Mr. Gifford , eplaining the need which has brought about the de- cision to conduct the campaign , said that the emergency which arose in relief work during the depression had not passed sufficiently to make possible the return of welfare aotivities to normal proportions . Supporting Mr. Gifford was Mr. Gibson , who pointed out that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the essential work required of the family agencies was still great . James G. Blaine , president of the Marine Midland Trust Company , was named as chairman of the Family Welfare Committee for the campaign , which will get under way about the middle of November . Conditions Still Serious . " The decision to conduct this campaign was reached only after most careful consideration , " said a statement issued after yesterday 's meeting . " It is clear that despite the broad scale unemployment relief measures put into operation by the Federal , State and city governments , the family welfare agencies of New York City still have a responsibility far in excess of their norinal family work in order to provide depression stricken families full opportunity of fighting ' their way back to productive existence . " The task of the family Welfare societies in the recovery program is the rehabilitation and rebuilding of the American family life that has been shaken or shattered by four years of priVation and destitution . " The family welfare ' agencies in Manhattan and the Bronx which are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Condition of the Poor ( non-sectarian ) , Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York , Charity Organization Society ( non-sectarian ) and the Jewish Social Service Association .
