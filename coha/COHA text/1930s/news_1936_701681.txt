txt The Treasury Department was reported tonight to have decided on a definite plan for seeking to prevent recovery of $200,000,000 of impounded AAA processing taxes which , under the Supreme Court 's decision in the rice millers ' case , appeared destined to be turned over to processors . Refunds in a few cases have already been ordered by District Courts . The proposed method , which was said to lack Department of Justice approval and would require the ultimate sanction of President Roosevelt , is understood to call for new legislation imposing retroactive taxes #n processors . The efI1fect would be to continue the outlawed processing taxes in full force . It was learned earlier that the administration had decided to use every legal means possible to prevent the returning of the $200,000 , - 000 of impounded funds , on the ground that the full tax had already been passed on to consumers in higher commodity prices , and that processors could not demonstrate any financial loss . Reed Studies Plea to Court . Solicitor General Reed was reported as favorably considering a plan whereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues involved in the rice millers ' case on the ground that " exceptional circumstances " presented legal barriers to the recovery of the impounded funds . This stratagem was later understood to have been discarded in favor of a more direct approach , involving legislation , directing that the impounded levies be covered into the Treasury 's general fund as " exactions . " Government attorneys declared that the Supreme Court had . in the past , upheld the constitutional power of Congress to tax for general purposes even where such levies were in the nature of exactions . That some action was contemplated to prevent return of the impounded funds was first indicated by Secretary Wallace , who said at ' a press conference that he doubted that " the public would tolerate " the return to processors of something more than $1,000,000,000 of processing tax collections already disbursed to farmers in benefit payments and re-collected from consumers in high prices . Asked if this opinion was applicable to the other $200,000,000 affected by the rice millers ' decision , he replied only that both sums were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard I as intolerable the refund of either . With the administration thus aprparently determined to prevent giving full effect to the Supreme Court 's edict in the rice millers ' case , government attorneys turned their attention on other amounts considered by them to fall within the same legal category . These included an estimated $68 , - 000,000 of processing taxes collected into the Treasury between the handing down of the first lower court impounding injunction and the final decision of the highest court . There was also an estimated $200 , - 000,000 of collected taxes on floor stocks held by wholesalers , retailers or distributors who could show that they had not passed on the amount of the tax to consumers and who , consequently , could show financial losses as prerequisite to recovery . There was a growing feeling throughout administration circles , however , that , whatever the fate of smaller amounts , Congress would effectively prevent any refunds from the $1,000,000,000 of taxes already disbursed in benefit payments . One high official pointed out that even if processors were able to demonstrate a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Claims make an award , it would be up to Congress to appropriate funds for the purpose . It was thought unlikely by some that Congress would do this . Plans were going forward , meanwhile for the introduction of legislation for the " stop-gap " program under which farmers would receive cash benefits for constructive soil conservation and fertility practices as a substitute for the invalidated AAA . Senator Bankhead said that he planned to introduce Tuesday a bill calling for appropriation of $350 , - 000,000 for financing the new program . Payments would be based on the planting of soil-improving or erosion-preventing crops . Provision also would be made in other amendments to the Soil Conservation Act for payments based on the acreage devoted to extensive rather than intensive cultivation . ; slope for Action by Feb. 15 . Although Department of Agriculture officials professed to know nothing of Mr. Bankhead 's plans , the latter said his amendments would contemplate leaving it to the Secretary of Agriculture to determine how much acreage should be devoted to extensive cropping and what the basic unit of payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation for the soil conservation program should be available by Feb. 15 . The planting season for cotton is imminent . Reports of probable obstructionist tactics in the Senatet have reached administration strategists and , while these are not being too seriously considered by agricultural officials , every effort is being made to prepare for quick passage ? of needed legislation . Earlier indications that there would be a reduction in the unit amount of corn and cotton loans by the Commodity Credit Corporation under the 1936 program were borne out by Secretary Wallace . The commodity loans have always been " without recourse , " meaning that , in event the market price fell below the loan rate , the government would have to stand whatever loss was involved . It is thought that the absence of production control may be partially offset by reducing the amount lent per bushel of corn or per pound of cotton .
