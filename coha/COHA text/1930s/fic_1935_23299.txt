VIII- - 1Ih . ? ? ? ? ? ? 11. at her She opened the door a crack . Now there was a strip of light falling across her face . She wanted to shut the door again and stay quiet and hidden in the dark room . What did you do when you had n't got a room ? Did you sit down on the sidewalk and wait to be cleaned up with the garbage ? " Aw , snap out of it . Pull your socks up , sweetheart ! " The hall outside smelt furtive . She had three flights to go . On each flight were two doors facing each other . She had never seen them open . If real people lived behind them they waited till the coast was clear . The last flight had a strip of worn red carpet . But Mrs. Jessop could hear a cat walking . She could tell by the way you walked how much rent you owed . She 'd pounce out . " What d' you think I 'm running , Miss Courtney  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like a real name . And so it was . She had chosen it out of an English novel years ago  --  that time she had been given a three-line part in vaudeville and was going to storm Broadway  --  because it suited her . Mrs. Jessop understood that sort of thing . She had been a comedienne of the old school  --  the frilled drawers and custard-pie school . A real star in her day . She had put her savings in a rooming house which was to have been a home for ladies and gentlemen of the Profession . But the depression had knocked the bottom out of things . Road companies gave Omanville the pass . If you dug among the grimy creases of Ma Jessop 's face you 'd find she was scared stiff like everyone else . Not having had a square meal for a week made her clumsy . The front-door behaved like a toothless old watchdog , growling and rattling its chains . It was like a nightmare trying to get out of that damn ' house . She could hear Ma Jessop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was downthe brownstone steps and running as though she had stolen something . Nearly ran down the cop at the intersection . He stared hard at her , twirling his nightstick and she steadied up and walked firmly as though ste were really going somewhere . But she knew be did n't believe it either . " I 'm licked , " she thought . " I 'm licked . " She had always been choosey , had had her standards . But she had seen her face and she did n't kid herself . She 'd have to pick something out of the ashcan . She did n't care . She had to have the price of a ham sandwich and the room rent . Aw , what the hell ! James P. Regget asked for the best room and a bath . He inferred that the best room would be pretty bad . The reception clerk switched the guest-book round to him and tossed the key to the bell-hop . James P. Regget wrote out his name and home town and the clerk glanced at it and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It made James P. Regget madder than ever with the fog and the railroad company that had made him miss his Chicago connection . Even at the Blackstone they knew about him . They said , " Glad to see you again , Mr. Regget . " In his home town the best hotel fell over itself when he shouldered his way through the swing doors . They 'd better . He owned most of the stock . The reception clerk treated him like a stray drummer . It was a joke . But it made him mad too . He would have liked to lire that sleek pen-pusher . He asked him , " Is there anywhere one can eat ? " as though it was n't likely , and the reception clerk jerked his head to the bell-hop who goggled and said , " The grill-room 's downstairs . " Without even a " sir " to him . There was n't a soul in the grillroom . Nobody except a frowzy waiter and James P. Regget . The room was decorated with gilt-framed mirrors . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses set sharply on a thick , aggressive nose . He was somebody . Anybody could have seen that . But there was n't anybody . Only the frowzy waiter hovering disconsolately at his elbow . He did n't know about James P. Regget 's tastes and he did n't care . James P. Regget ordered clam broth and a steak and a cheese soufflee . That would keep the old fool running for a bit . James P. Regget knew by the way he was standing that his feet were sore . You did n't employ a thousand men in the Regget Smart-Shoe factory without knowing something about feet . Gosh , if there were only someone to talk to . He needed someone . He was swelling with talk . Yesterday had been the big day in his life . For twenty-five years he had been on Peter Everet 's track . ( It took a big man to have all that patience  --  a sort of Napoleon . ) Yesterday he had pounced  --  brought him down  --  smashed him . Quite cool and impersonal he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the back . He had n't shown a sign . But now he wanted someone to tell about it . When he got home there 'd be a dozen men who 'd listen . " Smart work , J.P . " ? " Say , Mr. Regget  --  better keep on the safe side of youl " They 'd better all right . There were precious few of them whose mortgages did n't lie cosily in the Regget safe-deposit box . And Anne . The big man in the mirror smiled comfortably . He could just see her face when he told her . " Poor old Everet 's made a mess of things . He 's filing his petition . " She 'd know what he meant all right . She 'd go all pinched and white and small . Clam broth . The T-bone steak . Cheese soufflee . He masticated deliberately . At the last moment he ordered coffee . He sat hack , his cigar between his teeth . His squared fistslay on the table . The big men in the mirror had swollen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their faces.shone faintly . He stood up and obediently they stood up with him . He left a dime on the plate . If you were James P. Regget you did n't have to fling money about . He saw the old fool staring down at the plate . He felt a whole lot better . It was too early to go to bed . He was restless and vaguely resentful . He had tried to start talk with a stray young man reading a newspaper in the lobby . He wanted to explain how he had missed his connection and landed in this dump . He had asked for a match , and the young man had handed out a packet , not even looking at him . The officer at the street corner twirled his nightstick . " There 's a movie on Main Street , " be said . " It 's open till eleven . " He stared at James P. Regget as though he was n't up to much good . James P. Regget reached Main Street . It was regular Main Street . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hour it would be dead . There was a woman standing on the curb . He glanced at her casually and then intently . Well  --  sure enough , there she was , the Town 's Bad Girl . He knew her at sight . And business bad too . He knew the signs . Fortyish . On the skids . Make-up all anyhow . High-heeled shoes keeling over . In daylight she 'd be a hag . Scared stiff too . Scared he would n't take notice . Pretended she did n't know he was there . But she knew all right . She just looked up and down the street and pretended to wait for the lights . But the lights changed and she did n't move . She could n't move , she was so scared . It amused him like hell to keep her teetering there on the sidewalk . Suddenly he felt at ease again ? smoothed out and full and satisfied . After a hit he sauntered up alongside . " Looking for a friend ? " She did n't even glance at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying out loud . " Sure , " she said . He took her by the arm . He flexed his powerful fingers on her arm , feeling it over , feeling her tremble , getting to know her . " Hungry ? " " Sure  --  I could eat a horse . " " Let 's go find one . " " There 's Tony 's down the block . " " Nothing doing . When I take a lady out a delicatessen is n't good enough . " " Aw , who cares ? " She did . She was ready to drop . Another minute and she would have sat down with her feet in the gutter . Now he was holding her up . He was big and strong . She had n't even seen his face . But it did n't matter . If he was big and strong maybe he 'd take care of her for a bit . She was small and humble . She would like to put her face against his coat sleeve and just snivel . She belonged to him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he held her arm like a cop . All right . If he wanted to walk her round and round looking for a swell eating joint that was n't there she 'd have to go along . He could do what he liked with her , just for the price of a ham sandwich  --  she would n't say a word about the room . He was talking about something  --  she did n't know what . Something about a connection . " Ai n't that swell ! " she said . She heard him laugh . Maybe she had n't said the right thing . She had a job keeping on her feet . They kept on going . And they came back to the delicatessen . " Looks like there is n't any choice , " he said . He sat opposite her across the marble-topped table and she tried to seewhat be looked like . But there was something wrong with her . She could n't see anything properly . His face seemed to hang suspended in a yellow fog , like a big white balloon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . They were completely hidden behind huge shining glasses . But she supposed they were looking her over . She knew that look . All right . Go ahead , Big Boy . Only for God 's sake , let 's eat . He was n't in a hurry . He ran a thick , contemptuous finger down the menu . " See here  --  we do n't want to eat a lot . Just a snack . What about blue-points ? " " We do n't stock no oysters . " " You do n't have to . But you can get them . " " Maybe . You 'll have to wait a bit . " " We can wait . Got all the time in the world . Let 's have a little drink first . Ever heard of champagne in this burg ? " He was being jovial . The big white balloon swayed a little nearer . " I like to get what I want when I want it , " he said . " Sure . " " Sometimes I 've had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " " You 're a great guy . " " You bet . But no one knows it in this hick town . I missed my connection or I would n't be here . There was n't a soul to say ' hullo ' to . If I had n't run into a nice little girl like you . . . " Well , he could call her a nice little girl if he wanted to . He could call her anything he liked . Maybe he was being funny . Maybe he was trying to be nice . She knew what she felt like . Like a wet rag . When she had had something to eat she would be able to play ball . What made him send out for bluepoints when she wanted a ham sandwich ? There was a fat brown Virginia ham under a glass case . She 'd seen it as she came in . He had only to say the word . But he did n't . He had ordered bluepoints . She was too licked even to make a peep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff that went straight to the pit of her empty stomach . " Oh , God , do n't let me be sickl " she prayed reverently . " I learned about money when I was a kid , " he said . She put her elbows on the table and braced her face between her hands . It stopped her from flopping all over the table . It hid the mess she had made of her face and made her look intent and absorbed in him . He was going to tell her the story of his life . They all did . And then when he 'd got round to the wife and kiddies he 'd lean over , all soft and blear-eyed , and pat her hand . " What about taking a look at that little nest of yours , sweetheart ? " All right . He 'd be good for the rent anyway , and maybe a bit to carry on with . Anyway she could n't stop him . She was through and he knew it . " I was the poorest kid in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His folks used to give kid parties . But they never asked me . I did n't have the right clothes and my folks kept a shoe-shining parlor . But the other kids used to tell me about that house . Well  --  it 's mine now . I just waited round till I got it . And my kid went to that school like he did . " " I bet he 's a swell kid . " " He 'll be all right when I 've finished with him . He 's got fancy notions like his mother . Wanted to be an artist . Well I did n't sweat like a horse to keep him for the rest of his life . He 's in the business now . And he 'll stay there if he knows what 's good for him . " " You get your way all right , Big Shot . " " Sure . I 've got the money . " He 'd got the money . If you had money you could buy anything . But if you had n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she have to think all the time of ham sandwiches ? She did n't like them really . " Drink it up , " he said . " It wo n't bite you . " He sat back , twirling the stem of his glass between his fingers , and watching her . She was starved  --  on her last legs . Another year or two and she 'd be in the river . Now she was like a little old circus dog , scared stiff , trying to jump through hoops . It amused him . It made up for that damned reception clerk and the cop 's insolence to have her sitting there , waiting to eat out of his hand . He had felt lost without someone who belonged to him . She did n't even know his name , but if he told her to crawl round the table on all fours she 'd do it . She 'd do anything . The champagne was stirring his sluggish repleteness to a slow , dark passion . " What 's your name , sweetheart ? " - Mildred  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon-face swam back into her vision . She saw that he was grinning . Something turned over inside her . Sure it was her name . And even if it was n't , what the hell had it to do with him ? " I 'm King George , " he said . " Just King to you , Miss Courtney . " She laughed . You had to laugh at their jokes . Sometimes it was the worst of the whole business  --  laughing . Now he was pouring some more of that stuff into her glass . " I guess King George has n't anything on me , " he said . " Does what he 's told . People do what I tell ' em . They damn well have to . I 've got a thousand men on my pay-roll . I pay ' em and they toe the line . " " I bet they do . " " Money talks plenty . If you 'd come here asking for bluepoints that greasy EVERYTHING IN ad tut L a to es ? r n't his ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he e on anyrring dark L ?

But what I want I get . " He 'd said that before . Dozens of times . She 'd believe d him the first time . She could see a thousan d men , lying side by side like the oysters on her plate  --  gr ay , uniform , faceless , speechless , waiting for him to prong them out with his fork . Maybe she was drunk to have a silly fancy like that . " Some times I 've had to wait  --  li ke I 've had to wait here . Yesterda y , for instanc e . I 'd been waiting for yesterday twenty-fi ve years . " " What about yesterd ay , King ? " " Just a little private affair . There was a chap I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my wife before I married her  --  one of those nam-by-pam by boys women fall for . She was sweet on him too . Maybe she 'd have fallen altogethe r . But he was n't making much and I 'd gone right ahead . Her people did n't have anything , and she knew where the butter was , like everyone else . So he just quit and started business up in Utica . Did nicely till the smash came . Used to send her flowers on her birthda y . Not so much as a card . But I knew  --  j ust by the way she looked ? " He stopped , his fists squared on the table . " Well , he wo n't be sending her any more , I guess . Yesterd ay I bought him up , lock , stock , and barrel . " She suppos ed she had eaten the oysters . They 'd gone anyway . They had n't done her much good . She felt hazy and frightfull y worried about somethin g . She did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't underst and . Oh , to hell with it ! He 'd get sore if she did n't listen properly . " You 're pretty smart , King . " " I know my way round . You should have seen his face . " She thought she could . It was queer how clearly she could see it  --  much clearer than the face opposite ? a deli-cate , kind face , the sort of face some women liked . She would have liked it herself ? now at this moment . She was so tired . It would be a listenin g face , and you could tell the truth that you were hungry and going to be flung out on the streets and licked generall y . And now she could see the other woman too . She was small and easily frighten ed . Most of the time she 'd been frighten ed . But on her birthda y she 'd felt like a real queen . . . . everythi ng that 's in the shop-win dow , " he was saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She nodde d earnest ly . Well , maybe she was drunk . Drunk as a lord . Somethi ng anyway . He was paying the check . Bluepoin ts and champa gne . A lot of good that had been . She had wanted a ham sandwich and he had known it . He had ordered bluepoi nts becaus e he had known . It had been a joke , filling her up with stuff she did n't want . He was grinnin g as he would do when a thousand men toed the line  --  a s he would do when the other woman ' s birthda y came round and nothing with it that mattered to her . " Well , sweeth eart , what about seeing you home ? " She stood up . To her amazem ent she found that she was immensel y tall . She towered over him . " I 'll see you in hell first , " she said quietly and clearly . She saw his face ? distinc tly for the first time . And on her last day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would feel good remembe ring it  --  agha st , flabby , all smashe d up and gaping . " You great fat slob , " she said . The cop at the corner of her street stared at her . " Say , come into a million dollars , sister ? " She tosse d invisi ble plum es at him . " Sure , " she said .
