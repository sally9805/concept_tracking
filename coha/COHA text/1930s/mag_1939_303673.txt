I have often wondered why the Germans did not make greater efforts to reduce our strength in capital ships by destroyer or submarine attacks on our bases in those early days . They possessed , in comparison with the uses for which they were required , almost a superfluity of destroyers . . . and they could not have put them to a better use than in an attack on Scapa Flow during the early months of the 1914-15 winter. - The late Admiral Earl Jellicoe . <P> What another generation of Britons wondered last week was why the defenses of Scapa Flow , notoriously weak at the beginning of World War I , could possibly have been left vulnerable to a submarine which slipped in and sank Royal Oak last fortnight . The London Times called it " grave matter for investigation by the Naval Court of Inquiry which is now sitting . " The Daily Express snorted : " ... a disgrace . . . inexcusable . " <P> First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill 's preliminary report on the disaster was remarkable for its similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill explained that , by " a remarkable exploit of professional skill and daring , " the U-boat got through net and mine barriers and " fired a salvo of torpedoes at Royal Oak , of which only one hit the bow . This muffled explosion was , at the time , attributed by Royal Oak 's officers to internal causes , and what is called the inflammable store , where the kerosene and other such materials are kept , was flooded . <P> " Twenty minutes later the U-boat fired three or four torpedoes and these , striking in quick succession , caused the ship to capsize and sink . " Final figures from the Admiralty put the dead at 810 , survivors 424 . <P> Mr. Churchill said that Scapa Flow was being searched carefully , that any U-boat hiding on the bottom must rise or perish . He insisted that the anchorage 's defenses were modern and believed impassable . <P> On the heels of Mr. Churchill 's statement , a flash came from Germany that Lieutenant Commander Gnther Prien and the boyish crew of his U-boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erich Raeder for smiting not only Royal Oak but also Repulse . A. Hitler sent his personal plane , Grenzmark , to fetch them to Berlin for an ovation in which Propaganda Minister Goebbels managed to share the spotlight . <P> Hero Prien , 31 , is a onetime Hamburg-America Line cabin boy who entered the Navy in 1933 , saw service in Spain . On the third , fourth and seventh days of World War II he sank the British merchantmen Bosnia , Rio Claro and Gartavon respectively . Adolf Hitler received him and his men at the Chancellery , hung on Prien the Ritter Cross ( oversized Iron Cross ) , the highest German military decoration today . Crowds outside yelled : " Prien , the deed was wonderful ! " That night the heroes were regaled at the Wintergarten ( vaudeville ) where Goebbels presented them each with a book of news clippings and the audience sang : " We are off to England !
