Of China 's 4,480,992 square miles , Japanese forces held : <P> This week : 625,272 <P> Week ago : 616,750 <P> Month ago : 600,000 <P> Year ago : 500,000 <P> Japan 's new strategy of trying to nip off Shanghai and the tip of the Shanghai Peninsula by means of pincer armies closing in from North and South ( TIME , Nov. 15 ) , succeeded last week in relentless , smashing style . Long-eared Japanese Commander-in-Chief General Iwane Matsui helped his infantry pincers close by turning loose Japan 's most potent naval and land artillery , hurled great projectiles screaming clear over the International Settlement to score hits on Chinese positions at as much as 7,500 yards ( about four miles ) . <P> It turned out that Shanghai 's three leading Chinese newspapers had decided the city was going to fall as much as two weeks ago , had removed their staffs and much equipment 700 miles down the Yangtze River to Hankow , where they came out with extras last week as some 12,000 Chinese troops were being asked to make a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French hastily dug trenches and strung barbed wire , exchanging shouted comments with the Chinese soldiers many of whom were for frenzied resistance while others cursed " the useless sacrifice our Government is making of us . " <P> As Japanese shelling and bombing increased , Chinese soldiers began stripping off their uniforms , some hurling their naked bodies against the French barbed wire to secure gashes and wounds , understood to be essential for admission to safety in the French Concession . Elsewhere on the Shanghai front Chinese retreated in good order , setting fire to the enormous Japanese-owned Toyoda cotton mills and popping a few Chinese shells into a $1,000,000 U. S.-owned match factory . <P> Just inside the neutral Settlement , atop an exposed tower , the London Daily Telegraph 's , ace Correspondent Philip Pembroke Stephens , who recently flew from London to Hong Kong to cover the war , watched the capture of Shanghai with seven other whites . In the ensuing lull some 20 minutes later a U. S. patrol saw blood dripping from the tower , climbed up to find Pembroke Stephens lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not believe the fighting was over and the city quiet at last after 89 days ' siege . Japanese machine gun bullets had slain Correspondent Stephens . The Japanese command soon said these had been fired at Chinese ( an impossibility , considering the terrain ) , heaved Japanese sighs at " the passing of this distinguished British journalist . " <P> Long-eared General Matsui , victorious , was asked by correspondents if he would now attempt to press Japan 's advance to capture the Chinese capital of Premier &; Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , famed Nanking , some 200 miles up the Yangtze River from Shanghai . Said General Matsui softly : " You had better ask Chiang Kai-shek about future developments . Chiang is reported to have predicted a five-year war . Well , it might last that long . We do not know whether to go on to Nanking or not . It depends on Chiang . "
