nmnfta .... JORKENS HANDLES A BIG PROPERTY A STORY BY LORD DUNSANY T A corner of our window from which we can see the spring Jorkens was standing . The seasons in London steal so veiled through the streets , so unnoticed and inconspicuous , like four royal ladies lost in a land that is strange to them , that one can not claim to see spring from every window . From a corner of ours , however , in the dining room of the Billiards Club , you can see , when you know where to look , the railings of a little enclosure ; and there the leaves of the lilac , when the downs far off are rioting with the vernal festival , push out over the top rail , young and shining , to show that they too have heard the strange call and heeded it , and that London has her part in the magic of woods . Jorkens stood there alone , while the rest of us sat at our long table , smoking cigars or whatever else seemed appropriate to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked away toward the lilac with something of the wistful expression with which a man may sometimes watch the approaching footsteps of spring , but a man thirty or forty years younger . What mood or what memories influenced that silent figure I , for one , did not know ; nor when he spoke did any of us at the time understand him . " It is something to have had one 's share in all this , " he said . He said it more to himself than to any of us ; and none of us made any comment , nor did one seem called for . We went on with the topic that some of us were discussing , the comparison of various deals in which we had been engaged , the size of properties that had passed through our hands : one had sold three large Rolls cars in a single day ; another had been the secretary of some company that had sold a hundred acres of London , and had himself signed the transfer ; and , carried away by our commercial emulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he himself joined our discussion . " I once had a pretty big property through my own hands , " said Jorkens . " What was it ? " asked one of us . " Let me explain , " he said , and came over and sat on the arm of a large chair from which he was able to look down the length of our table . " I was in New Orleans a long time ago , looking out for something to handle on a commission basis , though I scarcely thought of anything of the size of the property that I actually did handle . " " A big property , was it ? " came from somewhere along the table , like the little flick of a whip that used to stimulate carriage-horses . " Big enough , " replied Jorkens . " Well , I was taking a walk outside New Orleans one day , along a little canal that was just an unending flower-bed : large mauve-and-blue flowers lay along its water , and entirely filled it up : butterflies floated upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had found no sort of business in the town ; it had seemed too hot for it ; and I was turning things over in my mind , when all of a sudden I met the Spaniard , or whatever he may have been : Mexican Jim was his name . He was coming past the solemn gray-bearded trees ; for I had come by then to the edge of a forest growing in miles of swamp , and all the trees there are bearded with long growths of gray moss . On the lonely road he took off his great hat and , holding it still in his hand , first sought my pardon for addressing me , and , when I had assured him of that , asked me if it would be presuming too far upon our momentary acquaintance were he to ask rue to be so generous to a stranger as to give him a match with which to light his cigarro . This I did while the great trees looked down on us , as though gravely interested in our courtesies . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I said I should be delighted , as indeed I was ; for the more people I got to know in New Orleans the less hopeless should he my chance of getting the handling of some little property on a commission basis . " I turned back for the city , taking the way that he was going ; and as we talked on our walk , I began to see from a certain indirectness with which he answered questions , a certain parrying wherever information might be concerned , that he was interested in business himself . No further than that did I get before the wide avenues of New Orleans came in sight , with their large flowers flaming ; and I went to my hotel , and he to wherever he lived . But not the wide sweep of his hat as he bowed before leaving nor the really magnificent compliments that he paid me nor his thanks , that were like Southern flowers , had evidently repaid the debt he felt he owed me on account of my match ; for he arranged a meeting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we had sat on chairs on the verandah of my hotel for an hour , uttering preliminary compliments , while the frogs chirruped on and on in the cool air , he said that it would be a distinguished pleasure to him if he could obtain for me a remunerative business that would , if only partly , reward me for my kindness over the match . " We talked awhile of the river , that river that from the mountains of the north comes down through a continent and whirls round the Gulf of Mexico , and then flows on , without its banks any longer , but still a mighty current , far out to sea . And then he spoke of currents , and of certain sand-banks over which they went , and of shafts of steel that could be driven down into the sand-banks in pairs , with slots that would hold a kind of steel shutter . Perhaps every detail of the technicalities might not have been instantly clear to me had he not asked my permission to send for a large basin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with his hand , and by sheets of cardboard by which he deflected them , I learned more about the control of ocean currents than I had thought possible . " Well , Mexican Jim explained his invention to me , and there was business in it , good sound business , as it looked to me , as soon as we got my percentage right . He had suggested five per cent for me at first , and I had had to explain that that was only his joke , no such percentage being known in proper business such as we do over here ; and in the end he understood and we got it fixed at ten . " " And what was the business ? " said Terbut . " I 'll tell you , " said Jorkens . " I 'll tell you as I told Sir Rindle Briarley . I rang him up at Whitehall as soon as I got to England , and I kept on at his secretary till I got him to see I was sane , and then I gradually worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with Sir Rindle . Of course that took some doing ; it took a good deal of doing ; but then everything does in business if you 're going to do it properly . Well , I was shown in to Sir Rindle . I should have liked to go a bit slow at first , so that he would n't get scared , but there was n't time to do that , so I had to go straight to the point . I told him that I had the selling of a property that was a necessity to the nation , and that I hoped England would get it , but that it did not belong to me , and that the principal for whom I acted might sell it to one of several other countries if I could not negotiate it here . And I told him I wanted a million . " " A million ? " gasped Terbut . " Did he listen to you any more ? " " Certainly , " said Jorkens . " He began to listen then . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you begin to talk their talk that they take the least interest in you . He asked what the property was , and then I had to explain to him the method of Mexican Jim for controlling ocean currents , for diverting them , that is to say , by means of steel shutters that slanted them off from their course . And I had to explain without any basin of water , that had made it so clear to me when Mexican Jim had shown me his method that night in New Orleans . But I got him to understand that a current could be diverted , many degrees from its course , by putting the shutters down in the right place . And the moment he understood he stopped my talking ; and I saw that it would be easier to get money out of him than time . He leaned forward and looked at me , and he struck me as being likea large meat-eating fish . And he said , What exactly is it you wish to sell ? ' " And I said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a man can divert a current , especially near its source , he can send it within reason where he likes , and I wanted England to have it . He could n't have sent it down the African coast , but he could have sent it to Greenland or Iceland ; and probably could have slipped it through the Straits of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean if he made a good enough shot . It was to all our interests for England to buy it , and so I told Sir Rindle . If England bought it her climate was safe , while whatever Mexican Jim got for it would be sheer profit , as in that case he would not have to erect a single shutter , but would just leave the Gulf Stream alone . " " Blackmail , " said Terbut . " Not in the least , " said Jorkens . " And that was not the view that Sir Rindle took . The Gulf Stream is a natural commodity that has been lying about the sea for years , like whales . Anybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert it , or to use it in any way that he may . A man ca n't divert a stream on land , because others are sure to have rights in it ; but nobody has any rights in the Gulf Stream . Anyone can do what he likes with it . Sir Rindle never said a word to the contrary . Where he did disagree with me , unfortunately , was about the million . I said that it was a matter of national importance , and he agreed . But he said that the Treasury did not put up large sums merely on that account , and instanced the defenses of Scapa Flow before the War , and the struggle that there was to get dreadnoughts . I could see that he meant what he said and was not merely arguing , so I dropped the price to half , and still he would not look at it . ' Look here , ' I said , ' we are practically living on America 's bounty , and have never yet paid a penny for it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ; and where should we be without it ? No summer to speak of , no harbors open in winter ; no better off than Greenland ; and probably glad of a visit from a few whaling schooners . ' That was Mexican Jim 's argument , and he argued that an American , and especially anyone living around that Gulf , had a right to do what he liked with their own stream . I do n't say I took that view entirely . It seemed to me a bit hard to freeze us out for the sake of a business deal ; but I took that line now to encourage Sir Rindle to do business , instead of looking at me like a large well-fed fish . And Mexican Jim could have done it too ; there was no doubt of that ; and I did n't want to see Iceland cutting us out and taking our rightful place , just because the Treasury would n't put up two hundred thousand pounds ; for that is what I soon brought it down to . I was n't grasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I said , to save all our harbors from ice and to hold back a winter that will last right into April ? ' " ' Not at all , ' he said , ' but I should have to explain to ten or a dozen men what you have explained to me before I could get the Treasury to put up such a sum . And it is n't too easily explained . I understand it myself , ' he hastened to add , ' but it 's one thing to do that and quite another to convince several other people . All you 've explained to me about the slant to be given to the current I should have to pass on second hand , and to people that may or may not be as quick of comprehension as myself . ' " ' Then Iceland 's to have our climate ? ' I said . " ' I ca n't pledge the Treasury to two hundred thousand pounds , ' he answered . " And I saw that he meant it and dropped the price to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interested than I 've told you . He quite saw what it would be to sit in that office with the Thames frozen solid , and I thought I was making some headway with him ; but just then his secretary began waving his watch about a good deal , and snapping it open and shut , and I saw that my time was up . I dropped the price to fifty thousand as I got near the door , but he would n't rise to that either , and I went out of the office with the Gulf Stream still unsold . " It was n't only having the property still on my hands that worried me ; but it was the fear that if I could n't dispose of it here the Mexican might sell it somewhere else , and we should never sec spring come round to our shores again . That was what I was fighting for , as much as anything , the English spring . All very well for Browning , or whoever it was , to say ' Oh to be in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job to keep it there . There would n't have been much April left but for me . So , you see , when I watch these lilac leaves shoving out through the railings they set me remembering the past , and what a weary struggle I had to save them . It was spring in London then , a little farther on than it is now ; and all St. James 's Park , to which I turned from Whitehall , was flashing and dancing with it . I remember wondering if we should ever get another there ; knowing we never should if Mexican Jim got another customer and drove down his slanting steel shutters into the Gulf Stream . But whom should I try next ? That was the immediate question . " I passed a little man hurrying by with a bag , and knew him for a commercial traveler . I thought how easy it was for a man traveling with samples ; nothing to do but open his bag and pull one of them out ; but my sam-pies , if only I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leaves flashing , the birds nesting , the crocuses with their radiant colors below and the pale-blue sky overhead , all given us by the gentle warmth that we borrow without a thought , as we have done year after year , from the Gulf of Mexico . " Well , I sat down on a seat beside the lake , and considered hard what I should do for it . " " Do for what ? " blurted out Terbut with characteristic bluntness . " The lake , " said Jorkens . " I wanted to prevent it freezing solid- I knew pretty well what Mexican Jim would be likely to do with the Gulf Stream if I could n't get an offer for it in England . And I saw pretty soon that the people to try next would be some big firm in the City . They would n't want the kind of changes that the loss of the Gulf Stream would bring : business is too delicate for that . They did n't want polar bears ambling down Fleet Street . And these firms would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's methods , and the awful effect of them upon London if put into practice . " When I had decided on that I did n't even go home . I went straight to the nearest post office , and telephoned to a man I had once met who was the president of one of those firms that I had in mind . I got on to his secretary and asked for an interview as soon as possible ; a matter of business , I told him , worth twenty-five thousand pounds . That was good enough for the secretary . I arrived at the twenty-five thousand pounds by deciding that whenever I failed to get any definite price for the Gulf Stream from any responsible person I should have regretfully to recognize that that sum could n't be got , and start next by asking half . Sir Rindle Brindley had refused me fifty thousand pounds as I went out throughhis door , so I started with Evvans at twenty-five thousand . It was no use touting the Gulf Stream round the City at a price that I had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for that . Mexican Jim might have got impatient and sold it to Iceland or Greenland , and you 'd all be sitting huddled over the fire and wearing furs even then . Well , I got my interview for the following morning , the only crab being that Evvans appeared to be even a busier man than I wanted  --  and I wanted a fairly busy one , or he would n't be likely to touch a new thing : the more interests he had , the more likely he 'd be to take things up . But Evvans could only give me four minutes . " So next morning at the appointed time I walked in and found him sitting at his desk , a thin face and intensely bright blue eyes . I shook hands as quick as I could and sat down where he pointed . ' It 's about ocean cur-tents , ' I said , ' and a method of controlling them . How long will it take you to understand my system ? ' Rude , but there was no time for courtesies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to business . " ' A minute , ' said Evvans . " So I raced through my explanations in a minute , and sure enough he did . " ' Now , ' I said , ' my senior partner in America can twist the Gulf Stream twenty or thirty degrees out of its course , and within those limitations can send it where he likes . Is it worth twenty-five thousand pounds to England , and will your firm put up that to keep it where it is ? ' " His answer surprised me . ' It is worth fully that to England , ' he said , ' but there are other and cheaper ways of preventing your friend from tampering with the Gulf Stream . ' " I sat and looked at him , wondering what influence he wielded , whether it JORKENS HANDLES stretched as far as the Gulf of Mexico , how he meant to use it , and exactly who would approach my sharp friend in New Orleans , and what they would say or do to him ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evvans sat saying nothing further , and scarcely even smiling , unless very slightly , I saw that my time was very nearly up . " Your firm , then . . I began . " ' No , ' answered Evvans . And that was all he said . " I felt that it was no use trying to bargain with him , and , besides , there was no time . So I thanked him and walked out ; and the Gulf Stream was now below twenty-five thousand pounds . " And the next man I tried was Lord Looborough , as he is now . He was chairman of a large concern in the City , and I got an introduction and fixed up a meeting , and went into his office and halved it : I offered him the Gulf Stream for twelve thousand five hundred pounds . " He was a pleasant and even a hearty man and I think that he would have readily put up the money , for he had spent far more than that , without a murmur , on fox-hunting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't get him to understand that if you headed a current off in a certain direction that was the direction it would take ; he seemed to think that after a bit it would turn round and come home , like a carrier-pigeon or a cat . And I could n't get him to remember that he had understood how the current could be diverted by slanting screens . He understood it when I explained it , but kept on forgetting how the thing worked , and I had to explain it all again and again . I knocked off two thousand five hundred pounds to see if that would help him , but at ten thousand pounds ( which would have been nothing to his firm ) he could n't understand it any better than when 1 was asking twelve thousand five hundred pounds . I suppose I was beginning to be annoyed , but he asked me so pleasantly if I had ever been out with the North and West Middlesex , or one of those smart packs , that I somehow could n't be angry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I left with the Gulf Stream unsold at eight thousand pounds . " I began to wish I were dealing in some smaller commodity , something solid , or liquid for that matter , but more easily handled . It was n't its being liquid that I minded . Not at all . Let me see , what was I saying ? " " Waiter , " I said , and indicated what Jorkens wanted . And when he had moistened his mouth he continued his story . " I saw it was time , " he said , " to go to somebody more definitely concerned than any I had tried yet . All of us in these islands are of course concerned with the Gulf Stream , greatly concerned with it ; but I went now to people that actually saw it and sailed on it . I went to the green-funnel fine . I went to their office in Swampgate and saw Sir Edward Bant and told him about the theory of the control of currents , and he understood at once . ' Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen ? ' " ' Well , no , ' he said , thoughtfully . " ' For four thousand pounds , ' I said , ' the Gulf Stream is yours . ' " ' The trouble is , ' he said , ' and I do n't want you to pass this on to anybody ' ( and I did n't for twenty years , but they went broke years ago and sail the Gulf Stream no longer ) , ' the trouble is that we are not paying a dividend this year . That leaves us nothing at all to splash about . ' " ' Splash about ! ' I said . ' That four thousand will just save you . If the Gulf Stream goes astray you 'll be broke : " ' I know , ' he said , ' but so will a lot of other people too . It 's one thing to be caught in a universal disaster , and quite another to have people pointing you out and saying " That 's the man who 's gone bankrupt . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall bear it like men , but it 's quite another matter to be called before the committee and asked to explain to them one 's financial affairs . ' " ' I 'll let you have it for three thousand pounds , ' I said . " And he refused that too . And I saw how broke he must be ; for he clearly understood what the loss of the Gulf Stream meant . " So away I went with the property still unsold . I was getting to the end of the people I knew in the City and was wondering whom to try next ; when , oddly enough , Swinburne helped me . I was in my lodgings pondering what to do , when I idly pulled out of a shelf , low on the wall , a copy of Atalanta in Cakdon , and I had n't read two pages when , as often happens when you are worrying over anything , a word caught my eye in the book that was the very word I was thinking of . I read the word gulf-stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gulf-stream a garment for me . ' And that gave me the idea to sell the thing to a tailor . " So I went straight off to the smartest tailor I knew of , and told him that I had a property to sell . ' What kind of property ? ' of course he asked . " ' Wait a moment , ' I said . Do you want to see people going about huddled in furs and all wrapped up in old coats ; waists gone , spats gone , tail coats gone ? ' " ' What 's it all about ? ' he asked . " And then I told him . " ' And it would have that effect ? ' he asked . ' Freeze us all up ? ' " ' Ask anyone , ' I said . ' Ring up the Royal Geographical Society or merely look at a map and see what kind of countries are on our latitude when they have n't got any Gulf Stream . There are polar bears in Siberia about the same latitude as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ' he said . " ' Fifteen hundred pounds , ' I told him . ' And cheap for what it is . ' " ' You know , ' he said , ' people think that tailors make big profits . And so we do from the best of our customers . But what about those that never pay ? And where do our profits all go , those that we do make ? ' " ' Ground rents , ' I said , for I knew the line of argument . " ' Exactly , ' he said . " TII let you have it for a thousand , ' I told him . " And that was no good either . " I began to see that it was time to leave London and to get to some place that was more in touch with the Gulf Stream , Devon or Cornwall where they could feel the warmth that was sent them across the Atlantic , and probably took some pride in it . One more shop I tried before I gave up London as hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . I went in and saw one of their principal men , He had to listen to me because he did n't know but that I might be wanting some jewellery ; and before he found out that was n't , I had explained to him the method of diverting ocean currents in the shallows near to their sources . Of course he did n't see what ocean currents had to do with his business ; and I told him that the Gulf Stream , which is not many yards across , could be diverted easier than most of them . It was then that he asked me politely but rather firmly what his shop had to do with the Gulf Stream ; and I told him something of the climate that is brought north from New Orleans for us . Again the polite question : what had that to do with his firm ? But with a little more insistence this time . ' Well , ' I said , ' I never heard that trade followed the polar bear . ' And he began to see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , ' for five hundred pounds . ' " But he shook his head . " ' Unfortunately , ' he said , ' we have to show a profit on our transactions . ' " ' Oh , ' I mumbled . " ' Yes , shareholders , you see , ' he told me . " A profit ! As though the plane trees in the parks , the large beds of hyacinths , the neat swards , the azaleas , the unfrozen Serpentine , the myriads of birds , and the warm air loitering along our streets were not a profit worth millions per cent on what I was asking . But I saw his point and lowered my price to four hundred . " But he was a man with no width of imagination , no length of vision ; and I saw that he 'd never see the larger issues beyond his immediate profits . So I left him , and left London altogether , and took a train for the West country , with the Gulf Stream priced for my next customer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the railway carriage with me , the man that I hoped to be my customer for the Gulf Stream . " We were alone in the carriage together , and I got into conversation . He seemed at first sight to be quite a pleasant fellow , though you can not always tell from appearances . I drew from our conversation that he owned a small villa in Cornwall , a house he had recently bought , in sight of the sea . He seemed the ideal man for my class of business . I began to speak of the warm Cornish climate , of the rare flowers and ferns that grew there , and the sea glistening in April with a brightness little less than the smiles of the Mediterranean . I had never seen it then , but I had read the advertise ments . He agreed with all I said , and indeed seemed so keen on Cornwall that I was a little doubtful if he would allow any credit to a Mexican stream like the one I was interested in . But he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked on the Gulf Stream as a natural part of Cornwall  --  which of course it is in a way ; it had been lulling that coast and nurturing all its flowers since Cornwall was first inhabited . So I said , ' What if icebergs should come that way , drifting by in sight of your villa ? ' And he said they could n't . And I said , ' What if the coast froze solid for half a mile out ? ' And he said I did n't know the Cornish coast . " And then I explained to him the method for diverting the Gulf Stream in the shallows near to its source , and told him the icebergs would come all right , and that he 'd probably be able to feed polar bears from his window ; but that for two hundred pounds I 'd sell him the Gulf Stream and he could keep Cornwall just as it was . " Do you know , there are all kinds of men in the world , though some of them you hardly expect to meet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life I do n't know , or what he supposed was at the back of my perfectly straight offer ; but he sat thinking a moment without speaking and then stood up with his hand stretched upward and said , ' Any more of it , and I 'll pulI the communication cord . ' " Well , you ca n't do business with a man who behaves like that , and I changed my carriage at the next station , and the Gulf Stream was still unsold . " Somebody a bit more responsible for his actions was what I was looking for now . " So I decided to get in touch with municipal authority ; and this is what I did as soon as we got in , after taking a walk along the beach to pick up local color ; for if you know nothing of a man 's chief interests you usually ca n't do business with him . " Well I went and saw the Town Clerk ; I wo n't say of what town , for I did n't get on very well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't want to get into correspondence with him about that after all these years if my words leak out . " And Jorkens looked sidelong at me . " I said to him , ' This is the English Riviera . You have a coastline unrivalled by foreign watering places , and matchless for beauty and perfection . ' Their kind of talk you know . " He agreed that this was so . Then I explained to him the theory of ocean currents , as told me by Mexican Jim . And I thought that I had got him to understand it . " ' I am asking one hundred pounds for the Gulf Stream , " I said . " Well , either he had n't understood it at all or he refused to believe from my merely verbal credentials that I was the appointed representative of Mexican Jim . " Best be brief : he was rude . I lost my temper . I lost my temper and was I think more insulting than I have ever been before or since , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' You 've got funny little holes in the cliff , ' I said , ' just by Tregantle . ' " ' Rabbit-holes , ' he said hurriedly . As though rabbits would live in a sheer cliff , and square holes at that . " I ought n't to have said it , and I have regretted it ever since ; but I had utterly lost my temper . ' Harbor lights , ' I answered . " You know there is some story , and I 'm afraid it 's true , of Cornish people luring ships to the rocks by putting harbor lights in a sheer cliff . And as a matter of fact that 's what those holes were for . Well , I need hardly say we did no business after that . I was shown out ; that is the word for it ; and the Gulf Stream was still unsold . " With the Gulf Stream , as one may say , still in my pocket , I went next to a big hotel and asked to see the manager . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' is without rival for excellence ; superbly placed as it is in a commanding position , it successfully challenges all claims from continental resorts to provide those conveniences and refinements that the recherches rightly demand . ' " ' Yes , that is so , ' he said thoughtfully . " ' And where would you be without the Gulf Stream ? ' I asked . " And then I explained to him Mexican Jim 's theory and told him that I was his accredited representative , and it was n't long before he understood the whole business , and I offered him the Gulf Stream for fifty pounds . " Yes , he understood all right , but he countered with a point that I had n't thought of . " ' We 've central heating in my hotel , ' he said . ' As good a system as there is on the market . And if it comes to freezing , there 's no hotel in these parts that will be able to compete with us . ' " ' But they wo n't come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to catch walruses . ' " ' Do n't you think it , ' he answered . ' It 's the fashion to come here in the winter , and if you think icebergs will stop that , you do n't know what fashion is . ' " I dropped it to forty then , but he would n't take it ; and lower than that I told him he could not have it , as I would n't cheapen the Gulf Stream . " But the thing was still on my hands , and as it did n't seem to fetch forty pounds , I had to cheapen it at the next place , another hotel . This was a much smaller affair , and when I said to the man who was running it that I had come in the interests of the hotels of the English Riviera he did n't seem very keen , telling me that the hotel I had just left got all the business , and that anything done in support of the tourist trade ought to be done by them . Weil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and offered him the Gulf Stream at twenty pounds . It was n't that he did n't understand , but he told me that the climate was not what they worked it on ; they advertised , and when that was properly done it brought visitors just as well whether there was bright sunshine or whether they only had icebergs drifting through fog . Well 1 had to admit that he was right about that , so it was no use bargaining , and without cheapening the Gulf Stream any further , I set out once more on my long hunt for a customer . " And as I went I saw a man with a large bag covered with labels , who hailed me as soon as he saw me , calling out across the street , ' Say , can you tell me any little old place where I can get a lodging ? ' " ' Stranger , ' I said , ' I sure can . ' " He came across the street to me . ' I 'm sure grateful , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' The name of it , ' I said . ' Now that 's what I ca n't remember ; these lodging houses have such odd names , but I 'll show you just where it is . It 's the best lodging house on this coast . ' " Well he thanked me and we went on , and I did what I could for him , which was n't too easy , as I 'd never been near the place before . But I had a good enough instinct for the part of the town where the lodging houses would be ; it was just where I was going myself . And when I got there I chose , as far as one could choose by exteriors , the one that looked the nicest . ' There it is , ' I said . ' The Laburnums . ' " We went up the steps and I rang the bell , and a maid with large blue eyes that should have been looking after sheep appeared out of the dinginess as she opened the door . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? Mrs. Smerkit ? ' she asked . " ' Yes , ' I said . ' This gentleman would like to see her best rooms if she 'd kindly come . ' " Away ran the maid and called her ; and out came Mrs. Smerkit in her sequins and black dress , the perfect seaside lodging-house-keeper , showing that one can judge a whole house by exteriors . Well , she showed us over the rooms , nice rooms looking out over that happy sea that was still being tended and protected from ice and fog by the Gulf Stream , and I took the first opportunity of drawing Mrs. Smerkit aside , while her prospective guest was gazing out at the view . " ' And the price ? ' I asked . " ' Three pounds a week , ' she said hesitatingly . " ' You do n't understand , ' I said , ' and there 's not time to explain . But say five pounds . ' " A moment 's look of surprise , and then she said it ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful to me , for they really were nice rooms , went to get the rest of his luggage , and I was alone with Mrs. Smerkit . Briefly then I told her what the climate meant to that sunny English coast , instancing the arrival of this new guest from the other side of the Atlantic , and carefully explaining to her the theory of the control of ocean currents , and told . her alI about my friend who was waiting for me in New Orleans . " ' Now , ' I said , ' I am this Mexican gentleman 's authorized agent , and we can let you have the Gulf Stream for ten pounds . ' " She had a real laburnum in her garden and I pointed to it as I spoke , and waved my hand along that sunny coastline . The laburnum 's buds were just yellowing , and she seemed to sec more clearly than any of the men I had spoken to what the Gulf Stream meant to that laburnum of hers and to the whole of our coast . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , but stood there with her arms lightly folded , considering , as I have so often seen one of them considering some question of tariff that a lodger of theirs may have put to her . And in the end the good sensible woman took it . Yes , she saw what it meant to the whole of the tourist traffic , and backed her judgment with ten pounds of her money ; and so I sold the Gulf Stream . " Do n't look at the price of it ; look at the size of the property that I handled ; look at the value to England of having the Gulf Stream left where that staunch old landlady left it , when the Government of the country and some of the biggest financial houses would do nothing at all in the matter . " And a few months later I was back again in New Orleans , in connection with another type of business . And I strolled out every morning to the edge of the forest that stood in the swamp , with its trees gray-bearded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't gone there more than two or three times when I saw the hidalgo-like figure of Mexican Jim coming along under his great hat . When his elaborate courtesies were over and we came down to mere business , I apologized for the short-sightedness of some of my countrymen , and told him that fifty dollars had been all I could get for his Gulf Stream . Mexican Jim was delighted . Possibly his busy mind had forgotten about it altogether ; possibly he had not expected to find an English purchaser , who saved him the time and trouble of moving the GuIf Stream at all , so that that ten pounds was sheer profit , small though it was , with no expenses except my ten per cent commission which he paid me there and then . And many a larger sum I 've had paid me with less grace ; but the receipt of the trivial amount that I had from Mexican Jim is a mellow memory with me yet . " And there on that road , under the bearded trees , with a sweep of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where words ended , we parted for the last time .

But Jorkens had gone back to that window again , and was watching the leaves of the lilac pushing out through those railings , with what almost looked to me like an air of paternal benevolence.
