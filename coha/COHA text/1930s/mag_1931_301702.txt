Before a hillside altar at French Lick , Ind . last week , kneeling while Bishop John A. Floersh of Louisville celebrated a solemn pontifical field Mass , were 550 delegates to the 49th annual convention of the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus . Representing 61 State councils , 2,565 subordinate councils and more than 600,000 members , the Supreme Council meets annually , reports on the year 's work . Ever proud of its charitable doings , it told how it had maintained an employment bureau in its home city , New Haven , Conn. , recording 43,128 placements during the last year . In three drought-ridden areas-Kentucky , Missouri , Montana-it had aided both members and nonmembers . Biennially the convention elects Supreme officers ; last week it re-elected the entire Supreme Council , including ( for the third successive term ) Supreme Knight Martin Henry Carmody. 59 , a lawyer of Grand Rapids , Mich . <P> Founded with eleven members in New Haven in 1882 , K. of C. calls itself a " fraternal benefit society . " Any good Catholic may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Jacob Raskob , Senators Thomas James Walsh of Montana and David Ignatius Walsh of Massachusetts , Manhattan Contractor William F. Kenny , great &; good friend of " Al " Smith . Insurance at low rates is available to every Knight . The order has an elaborate system of initiations , demands a certain secrecy " unless the interests of State or Church demand " otherwise . Because of this , many ignorant people hate and fear the K. of C. as a subversive organization , believe implicitly in a famed , tingling " great and fake oath " which , they think , binds the Knights to battle Protestantism . In reality the order is mild and charitable : its meetings , with baseball games , dancing , parades , are no more noxious than those of any other U.S. fraternal order . <P> Pre-eminent American . Next year 's convention will be held in Washington . D.C. to celebrate K. of C. 's 50th anniversary . How to give color to such a ceremony ? Always a good way is to unveil something . K. of C. has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington ( as well as getting his birthday observed ) . On its Golden Anniversary , announced Supreme Knight Carmody last week , K. of C. will honor , because of his " preeminence as a great American , " the late great James Cardinal Gibbons . In the Manhattan Studio of Sculptor Leo Lentelli now stands a model of a projected statue of the Cardinal , first public monument to be made of him . <P> Unquestionably the greatest of U. S. churchmen , Cardinal Gibbons was a Renaissance scholar-statesman-priest in a U.S. pioneer background . Born in Baltimore in 1834 , he was chaplain to Federal troops during the Civil War . In 1868 he was appointed Missionary Bishop to the new Vicariate Apostolic of North Carolina , never forgot his welcome in Wilmington : a torchlight procession of drunken negroes , exulting in their new freedom . Youngest Bishop in his church at the Vatican Council of 1870 , he became Archbishop of Baltimore in 1877 , Cardinal in 1886.                  @ @ @
