When Germany swallowed Austria last year , the Bank of England played ball with the Nazis , obligingly turned over to them the gold it held in the name of the Austrian banks . Later , British owners of Austrian bonds had trouble getting their money . When last March the Germans goose-stepped into Czecho-Slovakia , the British Government quickly rushed through Parliament a bill forbidding British banks to transfer former Czech gold and credits ( estimated as high as $100,000,000 ) to the new masters of Prague . Devised to protect British creditors , this measure pleased Britons more as a means of preventing the criminal from profiting by his crime . <P> Last week Britons were chagrined to learn that the Nazis had in part sidestepped this restriction , had taken over $30,000,000 of Czech gold held in London in the name of the Bank for International Settlements . The Czech National Bank had a $30,000,000 credit with the B.I.S . The " World Bank , " a Swiss corporation owned and operated by the central banks of the powers and a consortium of U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basle , instead maintains deposits with the member banks , one of them the privately operated Bank of England . Goateed Montagu Norman , Governor of the Bank of England and a director of the B.I.S. , had no other course than to return the gold to the B.I.S . Presumably the Czech National Bank 's management will have no course other than to do its Nazi masters ' bidding , call home the gold from the B.I.S . <P> Parliament howled long &; loud last month when it first got wind of this transaction . Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon , to silence the outcry , promised to see what could be done to squelch the deal . Sir John , reporting to Parliament last week , produced no squelcher . Banking ethics , said he , require that a customer 's demand for his money be honored without question . <P> In getting its hands on the Czechs ' $30,000,000 , the Reich would receive enough gold to offset one or even two months ' unfavorable trade balance .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
