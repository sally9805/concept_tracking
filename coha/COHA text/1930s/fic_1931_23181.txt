BIG-FOOT SAL A STORY BY WALTER D. EDMONDS T HE twilight behind the old boat had faded from the water and the sky with a last shimmer of green on the heart of the clouds . Ahead , except for the dim shapes of the mules and the driver , the country was deserted . Twice lights in farmhouses were passed ; but they showed only as dim slits under window curtains ; and the houses and barns were no more than blurred bulks against the darkness of night and approaching snow . In all the tong flat stretch of farm land , the bow-lantern was the only discernible moving object . The clop of the mules ' hoofs in the half-frozen mud made a close sound that only the driver heard . He walked hunched over , with his hat on the back of his head , the broad brim protecting his neck . A gleam of white forelock showed over his eyes . He plodded heavily , step for step with the mules . He did not bother to look at them , but their reek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hands were in his pockets , and the lash of the long whip , which he clasped under one arm , trailed behind him through the mud . The hock-deep prints of the mules ' hoofs were all that he was aware of  --  an endless procession coming back to his own feet . The towline dipped in the interval between each heave of the mules , and the bull-head bow of the old boat cuddled a ripple . It made no sound , but the ripple slanting to the bank set the dry grass stirring and whispering . Thick curtains were drawn over the cabin windows . The smoke , snatched from the stovepipe by the wind , was evidence of at least one warm spot on the Long Level . The steersman was standing beside the sweep , one shoulder hunched against the wind , his gaze fixed on the water 's edge , along which the bow-lantern cast a running yellow gleam . Occasionally , though , his eyes wandered to the cabin door at the foot of the steps just to his left , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . Then he turned his attention again to steering . He could make out nothing of the land beyond the towpath except when a tree or shrub floated into the lantern-light . He could see the towline pointing toward the team ; and he could just follow the moving shape of Alice , the gray mule . The black one was quite invisible . Once the gray shape vanished into even deeper shadow , and the driver 's voice came floating back hoarsely , " Bridge ! " The steersman answered him , " Bridge , " and swung his boat three feet into the canal to clear the abutment . As the boat passed under , the lantern lighted the stringers overhead , and he heard the water lapping against the wood sides of the towpath . The captured light gave a brief glimpse of him also . He was a big fellow , with a young brown beard ; his eyes were bright and restless , and his face looked white . As the bridge cut off the wind for an instant he heard plainly a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in the open , he glanced right and left , seeking a light . But there was none . Snow began to fall , a flake at a time , passing through the zone of lantern-light . He had no hope now of seeing a darkened house even if it stood beside the towpath . He would have to listen for the echo of a footfall against the wooden walls , to be alert for a slackening of wind if they hauled through the lea of a barn . He yelled ahead to the driver . " Ben ! " There was no answer . He cupped his hands and roared , " Ben ! " The mules went on , dragging the boat . But in an instant the light passed over the knees of the driver , showing his pants stuffed into muddy boots . " Hey George ! " " Ben . Keep watching and listening for a house . " " Getting bad ? " asked the hoarse voice . " A bit worse , I think . " There was a hectic note in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to stop . I can hear all right but I ca n't holler back against this wind . " The steersman watched the muddy boots clumping hurriedly back through the light , leaving him alone again in the wind . They were hauling on the Long Level from Salina to Rome . Thank God , he did n't have to haul any farther . If he 'd had any idea that Opal was going to have it so soon he 'd have tied by in Syracuse and never have accepted this load . There was work there on the railroad for a man and team . But the Canal was holding open for another week ; they had time , Opal thought , for this haul ; and after Rome they could move light into Utica , and Opal could stay with Lucy Cash-dollar till the business was over . Lucy took care of her girls that way . She 'd told him when he hired Opal that she would . But neither he nor Opal had had any idea it would come so soon . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished now they had got married in the first place  --  they liked each other well enough . If she should die . .. He felt a cold sweat between his shoulders where the wind reached him . It seemed to him that they had been hauling through a week of darkness since they cleared fifty-four . He 'd asked the lock-tender 's wife in , and she said they 'd better wait . But they had thought better . Now he could n't sec a light anywhere . And the old Ohio seemed to be the last boat hauling the Long Level . The wind was easing perceptibly , but the snow was falling more heavily every minute . It made a close pattern of large flakes that swam in and out of the lantern-light , feathering the deck and making dapples in the dark mud of the towpath . As it gained weight upon the earth , the night became quieter . There came spots in the wind when the steersman could not hear it at all . In one of these lulls he heard plainly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , oh , George ! " For a few breaths he was a great hulk bending over with parted lips to listen , refusing to believe . He had teased himself into believing that they would make Rome . " George ! Please , George ! " He straightened up . He would have to face it . He could n't just go on , leaving her down below . " Ben ! ? His voice cracked . The driver , catching the urgency , scrabbled back . " Eh , George ? " " We got to tie up . " " Coming bad , are they ? " " Sounds so . " " Put her in right here , then . The mules just got to a pair of posts . " The steersman swung the boat in , straightened her out , and she drifted slantingly against the bank . The light of the bow-lantern picked out two posts rising a foot above the towpath about ninety feet apart . " Whoa ! " screamed the driver . The towline dipped , fell dead . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud , shivered , and lay still . The steersman , coming to life suddenly , tossed ashore a rope and ran to the bow . There he found another which he flung to the driver . He ran back along the gangway , his pounding feet leaving black tracks in the snow . He jumped down the narrow stairs and flung open the cabin door . Watching from the hank , the driver saw a burst of light , of warm air that turned to steam , a deep view of falling snow extending skyward , and then he was left in the darkness . His mittened fingers were clumsy in throwing the hitches . When he was through he went ahead for the mules , unhooked them from the towline and led them into the lea of a slight rise of ground . On top of the rise were some small spruces , so he climbed among them and squatted down . Feeling stiffly through his pockets , he found a plug , cut off a chew , and wedged it into his jaws . " The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay here . If it 's all night , we might as well get aboard . " He addressed the mules . One of them sighed and coughed . The other was shaking its withers to loose the sticky collar . The driver shivered . It was blasted cold . " He do n't know nothing , " he said aloud contemptuously and spat down at the mules . " Now if I was running this rigging , I 'd have a woman with me , or I would n't come at all . Anyway I would n't leave a driver die of cold . " This made him feel better . He derided to go back to the boat and find out how matters stood . He climbed down stiffly and once more approached the boat . There was no sign of George . He jumped , caught the four-inch rail and climbed the bolts . The snow hit his face sharply , and he turned his head to shield it , and went stumbling for the cabin steps . He opened the door quietly and slipped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked round as he luxuriously absorbed the warmth . It was n't much of a boat . He ought to have known better than to hire on to a young pair like this . The girl just knew how to cook , and there were enough blankets ; but beyond that it was pretty simple . Two chairs and a box , and the same old hinged table that had been put into the boat at the beginning of time . Two sides of the cabin had had two coats of yellow paint , but the other side was only one-coated , and the green showed through . There had n't been money enough for more paint . Well , they were just starting in ; it was a good thing there was one experienced head on the boat . He blew upon his fingers . Then his head bobbed out of his hands to look at the curtains . She was making a fuss all right  --  first one . Imagine having a baby before you 'd learned to read and write . Just imagine . His ratty face looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had one geranium slip in the boat , and they 'd left it right beside the pane . He took it down and set it behind the stove . It was lucky there was one person could keep his head all right , or that plant would n't have looked like much by morning . He sat down before the stove and opened the double oven doors and put his feet inside . He was pretty comfortable like this ; but his shiny black eyes kept jumping to the curtains of the sleeping cuddy . When the steersman had entered the cabin he paused to turn up the lamp , throw a couple of sticks into the stove , and glance at the clock . Eight-past eight . That was a funny time to read . He had never read it before . He stood looking gawkily at the dock . He was over six feet tall and , with his hat on , except in the middle of the cabin , he had to stoop . His soft dark beard was mussed with the wind , and melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamplight . Then his worried eyes swung on the curtains of the sleeping cuddy at the back as the voice cried , " George ! " He threw his hat into the corner , pulled the curtains , and bent down low over the double bunk . It was dark in there , with no light but what came from the cabin ; but she had wanted it dark . She was a little thing . When she stood on the deck beside him she did n't come to his shoulder . The wind always mussed her hair  --  it was the fine kind of dust-colored hair that never looked neat  --  and if she managed to get it in place , he enjoyed nothing better than mussing it with one sweep of his hand . It always made her blush near to bursting . He could hardly recognize her now , lying there , getting up her nerve to open her eyes , and then turning her head . She 'd been crying . She did not know her own age , but Lucy Cashdollar that ran the agency guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair . He put out his big hand tentatively toward her forehead , but she seemed to feel it coming . " Do n't touch me ! " His hand jerked as if it had been struck . She lay quite still , drawing a deep breath . Suddenly she heaved under the blankets , her breath caught . He tried shutting her cry out of his ears , but it did n't work . The sweat broke out on his face . He reached up and opened the ventilator over the bunk . She caught his other hand . " George ! I wish you 'd get me someone to stay with me . Could n't you ? " His voice shook . " I 've been looking for a farm all along . There ai n't a one . " He looked down . " I 'd ought to have stopped by the lock . " " It 's all right , George . It was my fault . " " I 'd ought to have known . Is it too bad ? " She managed a little square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were silent . He listened to her breathing . Outside the wall of the boat he heard a rat working the mud of the bank . " George ! " she cried . " Get me a woman to stay with me . Do n't be mean , George . Please . " She was squeezing his hand again . He tried praying to himself . He could n't think of anything to do . " Oh , please , George . " " I 'll find someone , " he said desperately . " Do n't go way . You wo n't leave me , George ? " " But I 've got to find someone . " " No . No . You can fix the sheets now . " They had bought a pair of sheets in Syracuse . It was a luxury , but they had felt nice about it . He got them from the shelf and , under her directions , began putting them on one side of the bed . It was a cramped place to work in , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , wrinkled though they were , she smiled . " They feel so nice , George . " Then in the same breath she was crying for him to find someone , anyone . " Honey , honey , " he said . " I will . " He burst out of the cuddy into the cabin and stood there , swinging his hands and staring round desperately . The sharp face of the little driver was staring up at him over one shoulder . " Well , George , it 's kind of tough . How about them mules ? If we ai n't going on , we might as well bring them in . It 's pretty cold . " " Damn the mules . " " Sure , " said Ben with a dollar-aweek wise look . " The first one 's always tough . " " What had I ought to do for her ? " Ben jumped . " Cripus ! How do I know ? I 've never been bothered that way . " George stared at him wildly , hopelessly inefficient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't leave her . You get out and find a woman . You get out . Go on . Quick . And if you come back without anybody , I 'll harrow you proper . " " What ? " whined Ben . " Make me go out in that cold ? Me an old man . " George stepped towards him . He was ugly . " Get out . " " There ai n't no farm . " He saw the great fist close . " All right , all right . I 'm going , George . " He caught his hat and scurried out . Left alone , the steersman looked round him hopelessly . He had been brought up on a farm . He racked his brains , trying to find some expedient he could apply to the girl 's case . She was quiet for the moment , and he moved softly to the stove , from the stove to the china cupboard , from the cupboard to the table , from the table to the water butt , and back again tothe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time his slow mind kept running back  --  to the time he had run from home and hired on as driver  --  to the time when he had saved enough money to buy the old Ohio and this team of mules  --  to the stop he had made in Utica when he had dropped in on Bentley 's Bar and gone upstairs to Mrs. Cashdollar 's Cooks ' Agency for Bach eller Boaters . He could see the old woman as plainly as if she were in front of him , sitting before her Franklin stove , warming her stocking feet , sipping her rum noggin , smoking her pipe , pulling her red wig back into place , and regarding him shrewdly out of a pair of fine blue eyes . " Want a cook , eh ? " her very words . " Kind and gentle ? No , no , T mean you . I fix things . Well , you look so . Young , ai n't you ? Well , when you get in trouble bring her back to me . She 's a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you 're patient to her she 'll make you the best kind of a woman . " And she had called in Opal . Little timid figure in the door of the back room , sweet mouth , big eyes looking him over , and him blushing and squeezing his hat . Right then he had seen the change creeping up all over her . First he had seen it in her waist and then her eyes ; and then there was the devil in her very actions , and then her eyes lowered , and she was just what she had been . But he had learned all about her during the long spring and summer , hauling pretty good now . Some day he would have saved enough money to fix her up the way he wanted , so anybody could see what a dandy she was . And yet it had been a comfortable feeling to be aware that he was the only one who knew . He had taken the news of the baby pretty eesily  --  it had n't meant much to a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He jammed another stick in the stove . Please God , send them a woman ! And then he heard Ben pounding down along the gang , a shout , " Here 's a boat coming west , George ! " He rushed into the euddy , stooped and kissed Opal , and she managed him a smile . Then he was out on the deck , bareheaded , with the snow drifting into the curls in his hair , Ben grabbing him by the arm and pointing a mitten to the east . " Must be a bridge it 's back of now . It 's a-coming , all right . Do n't you be scared , George . " All at once George realized that the driver must have been scared , too . Then he saw it , several hundred yards away , the bow-lantern of a boat , coming towards them , very slowly . " Will they stop , do you guess ? " " Yes , " said George . " How'Il you get ' em acrosst ? " " Easy . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward with the deliberation of a drifting leaf . It was still over a hundred feet away when the two eanallers made out the team . " Horses , " whispered Ben . He could tell by the tread . " Hey ! " The team passed them . " Hey there 1 " roared George . " Stop ! " Ben , with more presence of mind , suddenly shrieked " Whoa ! " The team stopped dead ; and their driver , totally numbed by the cold , bumped into the horse 's rump , started , and looked up . " Hello ? " George shouted across the canal , " Is there a woman on board ? " " What say ? " " Got a woman ? " The man came back . They could just make him out , cupping an ear . " What say ? " " Got a lady on your boat ? " " No . " George 's heart sank . But then the other boat came drifting in , and a tremendous voice demanded , " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to see if you had a woman with you . " " Well , I have . " " Can she come over ? My girl 's in trouble . " " What is it ? " " Baby . " " Damn my luck , " bellowed the voice . As he spoke , the cabin door opened in front of him , sending out a blaze of light , and George and Ben saw that he was a little man , bent and old as a gnome . Before he could say anything further , a gin-soaked voice that seemed to come from the bottom of the world asked shrilly , " Cooney ? Did he say a baby ? " " Yeanh . " " I 'm coming ! " " Thank God ! " cried George . The little man threw a rope ashore . " Tie up , Pete , " he directed . " Sal 's gone and got it again , and we got to stay . " He turned enraged eyes to George . " How are you going to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " " Cold work . " He seemed resigned . George did not hesitate . He jumped into the water and started wading . The bottom was muddy , but he did not sink deep . The water came to his armpits . By the time he reached the other towpath his breath came fast with the cold . But his heart was lifting . He would have someone for the girl after all , someone who could carry the horror and responsibility . A broad , squat figure was stumping along the towpath . As she came into the zone of light , George saw a middle-aged woman with hair of indeterminate color straggling from under her shawl , and the biggest feet he had ever seen . Her eyes were bleary and her breath whistled ; but she looked like an angel , and she asked kindly , " How is the dearie ? First one ? " George nodded . " You 're a fine strong boy . Cheer up . do the whole thing . " " Thank you , main . " He stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straddle of his neck and grabbed his hair . " All right , Boy . Am I too heavy ? " He shook his head . " Do n't do that again . I ca n't abide cold water , Boy . " It took all his nerve to keep from hurrying , but he got her safely over at last and followed her into the Ohio 's cabin . There he had a good look at her , a sodden old wreck . But her loose mouth smiled kindly . " Take a drink of something , quick , Boy . Where is it ? " He pointed to the euddy . " Not her . You first . She 'll keep . " She made him take some whiskey and took some herself . " No , " she said , her lips trembling , " you get back to Cooney . It 's wet , but he 'll fix you . tend everything here . I wo n't be bothered by no boys . Get along . " She waddled after him to the stairs . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cuddy and her voice saying , " All right , dearie . " He felt better . He and Ben put the team aboard , and then he carried him over to the other boat . There they already had their horses fixed for a stay . The little man was waiting for them on the deck . " Come down , " he shouted . He led them down into a comfortable cabin with many shelves for bottles and a great stove . It smelled strongly of cheese and ham , " Take your clothes off , " he roared . " Have a snort . Sal do n't look so good , but she 's the best damned cook on the Erie Canal . When you get as old as me , you do n't care how they look so long as they keep you comfortable . Bar her taste for gin , she 's all right . " He brought a towel for George and saw him rub down . The young man 's body , straight , white and steaming , towered over the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You give me a scare , " he said to the driver . Cooney said , " He did n't mean to do it . He 's deef and goes to sleep walking . " " Yeanh , " said the driver , pulling his boots off . Ben said to him , " Do you like horses ? " " I do . " " Me , I like mules . " " That 's all right , " said the other patronizingly . Cooney was shaking his white head at George . " I do n't blame you for being worried , Boy . I 've never been troubled that way . Sal 's never had one . " A little clock behind them struck eleven . The little clock struck two . George got up from his chair and looked through the window . The three older men were playing cards . Cooney said , " Mine again , boys . " George turned round . The deaf driver wore his habitual expression of disgust ; Ben looked dismayed . Only old Cooney was chuckling as he counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ben , " does it always happen this way on this lousy boat ? " Cooney grinned , showing misshapen teeth . " Boy , Boy . You need to learn the game . But do n't begrudge me any fun . I 'm going to have a bad time soon . " He gathered up his winnings and offered drinks all round . " When the old girl gets back she 's going to have a spell . Always does when she sees a baby horned . Expects me to fix it for her . " He sighed . " A week of rotten eats for us , and the old girl shedding tears . She 's always wanted a baby . Funny thing , here she is forty-four years old and every year she wants it worse . There would n't nobody else hire her on . Takes too much to keep her in likker , for one thing , and there 's her feet for another  --  Big-Foot Sal . " He named her with a certain pride . " Except she 's sleeping the last one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by a bar , ai n't it , Henry ? " he turned to the driver . The driver nodded . " Well , well . " He called to George , " See anything doing ? " George could see only the bow-lantern of the old Ohio , a glint from one window , which the old woman must have opened , the falling snow , and the dim white shore . For an instant the stillness of the whole night came in upon the boat , bringing out the smells . " Carrying potatoes , " observed Ben . Cooney nodded . " Syracuse . " From the window George said , " No . " Cooney nodded again . " It takes a time , the first one , generally . Never mind , Boy . You 'll have plenty more . You 'll get used to it . How 'd you come to get caught this way ? " George did not answer , and Ben explained dramatically , particularly emphasizing his own cold waiting on the bank , and taking credit for spotting the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the other driver cynically . " You was n't , " said Cooney . The driver ignored him . He began pulling on his boots . Ben got into an argument with him about the best kind of hobs . Cooney got up and felt George 's clothes . " They 're about dry , son . Put ' em on and we 'll go on deck . " George dropped his blanket and obeyed swiftly . They went out together , leaving the drivers in an altercation about the shape of the earth . Ben said it was flat and that the canal 's Long Level proved it . Henry had a volume of geography . But the canal was n't in the pictures . Outside it was clearing . The stars were big and cold , the wind had died , and all the world seemed sleeping under the snow . They could see smoke and steam coming from the Ohio 's stovepipe . The ripple had died on the canal . George had an odd feeling of music far off . Cooney chuckled at the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other 's elbow . George concentrated and heard it . A thin little stifled , squeaky cry . He realized all at once that it was n't Opal , that he had not heard Opal . " What is it ? " " Listen , " said Cooney once more . This time the cry was hushed by a woman singing . Her wheezy voice went up and down on three notes monotonously . George understood . He sprang to the side of the boat . But Cooney was before him . " I got to get right back , " cried George . The little man put up a hand against his chest . George suddenly saw his eyes glaring . " That 's all right , mister . Just a minute . We stopped here to help you out . It 's going to play billy-hubs with Sal 's works . Let her alone for a few minutes . It ai n't much to listen to , but it 's her idea of a tune . Let her finish it . " George pushed forward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's drunk away everything else in her , but she 's got that . Give her a chance . " And George waited . The tune went on and on , over and over , until at last it was done . Then Cooney called for Henry , and the drivers emerged . He shook hands with George . " Luck , Boy . " " Thanks . " " It 's all right . " " You can see by the stars it 's so , " Henry said to Ben . " Look at that watter , " Ben replied . George grabbed him and carried him over . " Get the mules out , " he ordered . Ben grunted something about a loon and education , and went forward . When George entered the cabin of the Ohio , the old woman was just carrying the baby in to the cuddy . She came out in a minute and said , " It was one of the easiest I ever see . It 's a nice pretty boy . " She stood quite still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he was in the cuddy , bending over Opal . She was all right . She looked tired , half gone , but she was all right . And she gave him a smile andopened the blankets . He saw it and bent over , dripping as he was , and kissed both of them . He looked round . Everything was to rights . He lingered . When he re-entered the cabin the old woman had finished fixing things . This time he saw her  --  dumpy body , shawl-wrapped , square face and loose cheeks and trembling mouth and big feet , and something shy in her eyes . Then the red lids seemed to swell and tears came . She put out her arms and kissed him . " Quick , " she said . " Fetch me home to Cooney . " He said nothing . But all the way over he felt her crying . Cooney took her without a word . The horses were ready . Before George was back on the Ohio the other boat had slipped off . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was gone . He went below for dry clothes , still tasting the gin . It was all still and peaceful there . He went into the cuddy and looked down as he stripped . It was all still and peaceful : like a gift that Big-Foot Sal had left . He felt his throat closing . Outside the mules were tramping over the gang . He had to get on deck .
