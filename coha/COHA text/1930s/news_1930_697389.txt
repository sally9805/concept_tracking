txt Utilization of the corporate surplus as a business stimulant was urged by Kenneth C. Hogate , vice president and general manager of Dow . Jones it . Co .. at a luncheon marking the opening of the new quarters of the Cleveland Stock Exchange . Declaring that " the fetish of a corporation surplus today stands in the way of a revival of prosperity , " Mr. Hogate pointed to the billions of cash , accumulated by prosperous corporations , which are " passively at work , but have no velocity . " He emphasized the influence upon business through increased buying power that would follow substantial distributions of surplus cash to stockholders . The new quarters of the Stock Exchange are on the twentieth floor of the Union Trust Building . Dedicatory ceremonies , started Thursday . will continue for four days . The opening was formally observed at the luncheon in the ballroom of the Hollanden Hotel , at which M. C. Harvey , of Otis &; Co .. president of the Exchange . presided . There were about 200 present , Including members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Frozen Inventories to Frozen Cash Mr. Hogate 's remarks upon the subject " Frozen Cash " follow : There has been such a reaction from the period of frozen inventories in 1920-1921 as to work a transformation in finance , the significance of which is very little appreciated . You will all recall those days of ten years ago when millions of earmuffs lay crated on the docks of Patagonia and icebags by the gross were crying for buyers in Alaska . There was a great deal of doubt about whether the banks or the manufacturers owned these earmuffs and icebags . But there was no doubt that the manufacturers owed more on them than was convenient and that the banks owned more of them than they wished . There was also no doubt that nobody wanted to buy them . Just at this time . it appears , the average Industrialist vowed that if he could ever get out of his dilemma never again would he be so foolish . Painfully the process of liquidation progreased. inventories were converted to cash and a new start made . Lesson Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1921 . In nine years we have traveled the long road from frozen inventories to frozen cash . From being on their knees to the banks In 1921 , American corporations have reached the point where they condescend to hear the supplications of the banker for the deposit of a share of thriir surplus money . In the Federal Reserve report of brokers ' loans , it is shown that " others " last fall lent 54.000.000.000 or half of the total . Unquestionably most of this S4.000.000.000 came from corporations . They placed it on call at 15 and 20 , -c when stocks were booming and vanished with it at the crash . But the money is still there . Most of it is surplus . We hear that it reinforces the position of the corporation : that it is the backlog for an emergency ; that it strengthens the stockholder 's equity . On the contrary , the fetish of a corporation surplus today stands in the way of a revival of prosperity . The nightmare of 1921 has so permeated management that in many cases corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own sake the first consideration by which management is gauged . Is n't it true that anyone ? at least for a time  --  can run a corporation if given four to five times as much money as is necessary for the conduct of the business ? Forget Money Belongs to Stockholder It is also extremely doubtful if such an abundance of cash items works to the benefit of the stockholder . Ignored is the fact that the inarticulate stockholder scattered over the country is the real owner of this surplus . He buys the stock of a corporation in good times and quite likely pays a premium because that corporation is rich in cash assets . In periods of declining business these corporations forget that this money belongs to the stockholder . When earnings recede they cut and pass their d.vidends quite as frequently as their poorer cousins When times are booming they use this surplus to lend for exorbitant rates or tend to careless expansion of productive facilities which often soon prove superfluous . Exorbitant surpluses intensify the peak of speculation whether it be in stocks , labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? in other words , when stock prices and productive facilities have reached the point when they are clearly in excess of consumptive ability  --  there ensues a tumble . That part of corporation surplus which has been lent at call is called . Stocks tumble further . Business is upset . We begin to hear about overproduction and underconsumption ; but there rests the sacred corporation surplus intact , static , but a source of joy to those managers of business whose pleasure it is to scan their balance sheets . Surpluses Are Quiescent As to the claim that such surplus is the backlog for an emergency , the answer is that we have been and perhaps still are in an emergency . Meantime these great surpluses lie quiescent . They are not actively working for the early return of prosperity . When 1 say that these surpluses are quiescent and not actively working Inc the early return of prosperity , you will not of course envisone . $4.000,600.01.10 in currency Lied in sta. - ks and gathering dust in bank vaults The money is passively at work but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watchfu , and scientific supervision of eyes whose concern it is that it shall be safeguarded and increased . Its dollars are not actively passing , dozens of times a day , from purchaser to seller . This money is in a stalemate when a few major moves on the chessboard of finance would bring fluidity into the ' whole situation . It can only doubtfully be maintained that the existence of a large cash surplus reinforces the position of a corporation . Conspicuous among the large cash balances of 1921 are those of companies which have made little or no money since .

The corporation has no wants It does not " err " in making pleasure-giving purchases ; it will not use a surplus for expansion at a time when the world is already overbuilt . It is so seldom as to be almost never that it pays Out an unearned dollar to a stockholder . It may be argued that if the corporations were to disburse a major part of their surpluses it would in some instances place them in a position where at times they might again have to seek bank credit . The bankers nere will agree with me when I reply to that by asking  --  Well . what of it ? Certainly the banker did not tools with composure on the withdrawal of deposits last year and the lending of those deposits in the call market In competition with his own institution . Because of this situation the bankera lost control of the call market . But nevertheless they had to step in and assume the burden in the period of emergency .

" There is nothing that an impersonal corporation wants in times like the present which transcends in importance the upbuilding of a surplus . I suppose there is no man so wealthy but what he or his wife have scheduled purchaseswhich they intend to make at the proper moment . I believe that it is easy to make a personal test of the correctness of this theory .

Much money was so spent and undoubtedly the national welfare was promoted . The difficulty is that , beyond a certain point , it is neither good business nor good national economy to maintain or build when plants are already sufficient for . more than existing demand .

If the corporations of this country would disgorge themselves of their surplus cash and pay it to its rightful owners  --  the stockholders ? a sum which might approach $4,000,000,000 would flow into the channels of trade and frozen cash would be put to work for the alleviation of unemployment and the stimulation of business .
