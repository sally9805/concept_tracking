MR . WITT AMONG THE REBELS-Ramon J. Sender-Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) . <P> At the southeast tip of Spain the city of Cartagena lies against the base of great treeless hills , facing its superb harbor , its two great forts and the Mediterranean . There in July 1873 , in the fifth month of the first Spanish Republic , a group of revolutionaries hoisted the red flag . Because they could not find a pure red one they used the flag of Turkey , with its crescent stained out in blood . The frigates lying in port joined the revolt . From Madrid the central Republican Government , run by high-minded incompetents , badgered by conspiracies Right &; Left , sent troops against the city . Six months later Cartagena fell , before it could get its socialist experiments running or , as one of its leaders proposed , declare its allegiance to the U. S. But suppressing it turned out to be too much for the staggering Republic , which fell soon after . <P> Laid against this background of Spanish disorder , Mr. Witt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be read as a political study , as a love story about a discreet Englishman and an elemental Spanish girl , or as a cool satire on liberals . When the revolution broke out , Mr. Witt was a consulting engineer in the naval arsenal , a cultured , book-collecting , slightly bald Victorian gentleman of 53 , whose one adventurous act had been to marry Milagritos , 18 years younger than himself . Warm-blooded and grey-eyed , Milagritos was a lovely puzzle for Mr. Witt . At once serene and violent , free in her manner but irreproachable in her conduct , she was indolent , simple , with a streak of exuberance and humor that could be disconcerting to a prudent husband . They had been married for 15 years and , except for the fact that each blamed the other because they had no children , they were content . <P> But as the revolution changed from a matter of singing in the streets to a grim and hopeless siege , a subtle change came over them . Mr. Witt , who stayed in his shaded study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched the shells exploding in the blue waters of the bay , grew mysteriously old , suspicious , weary . Milagritos , who prepared bandages , went with the rebel fleet on its biggest battle , seemed to grow younger , prettier , less communicative . When Milagritos ' cousin was sentenced to be shot , Mr. Witt raced to save him , although he had always been mildly disturbed by Milagritos ' affection for the boy . But when he finally had the power to stop the execution , he remembered little ambiguous remarks Milagritos had made , wondered if her cousin was her lover . A terrible creeping apathy left Mr. Witt sitting by , inert , trembling , preoccupied , while the cousin went to his death . Then , to square himself with his conscience , Mr. Witt had to believe that Milagritos had betrayed him . At last this upright , self-respecting gentleman spent his nights prowling like a baffled thief around his own house , rummaging through his wife 's papers for evidence of her guilt , while the shells fell on the doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
