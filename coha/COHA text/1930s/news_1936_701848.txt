txt With wheat prices up some 10 cents a bushel from early April lows , largely as a result of new evidences of deterioration of the crop In the Southwest , attention in the trade is about to turn to the Norhwest as well . Spring wheat seeding should be under way in-full blast this week , about three weeks later than in the average season . In parts of South Dakota , where the ground was not too frozen , seeding already has been started . Winter wheat deterioration , by causing the price advance , itself has become a factor in calculations of probabilities in the Northwest . For it provides an incentive to plant Spring wheat , to which has been added the Government 's recently announced willingness to lend 4.000,000 bushels of seed wheat at very reasonable rates . Greater Than Expected The deterioration of Winter wheat appears to have been greater in the past two weeks than the Government counted on when it made its April crop estimate . Putting the amount at 493,166,000 bushels , it took into consideration probable damage after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal ' Southwestern correspondents indicate additional spoilage . Assuming the reliability of the private crop estimates , which estimated end-March conditions strictly on that basis without allowance for future damage looming ahead , the April 1 prospect was for 536,000,000 bushels . The government 's forecast , thus , deducted 43,000,000 bushels on the assumption that future influences on the crop would be more unfavorable than on the average . That the federal weather forecast was conservative is indicated in reports received Saturday from the Southwest , . marking down that section 's crop 50,000,000 to 60,000,000 bushels . On that basis and assuming no further cut in the Ohio Valley 's crop , it would be reasonable to show a present prospect of but 481,000.000 bushels , with every sign pointing to further deterioration unless adequate moisture comes before May 1 . There are , however , also some prospects of a recovery with good early precipitation . Soft Winter Wheat Doubtless there has been some slight deterioration in the Ohio Valley soft red Winter wheat district since April 1 . However , the federal report of that date made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , Indiana and Missouri , of but 111,000,000 bushels , against 121,000,000 a year ago , while figuring Kansas for 129,000,000 , compared with 59,000.000 last Summer . That should pretty thoroughly discount modest damage recently in soft Winter wheat states through Hessian fly in Missouri and chinch bugs in Illinois . In this state . about 80% as many bugs are in hibernation as were in the Spring of 1934 . There are enough to cause serious damage should late Spring weather be dry , however . The Ohio Valley is better off in the way of moisture than the Southwest , although Spring rains will be needed here . The official weather forecast for the week is none too optimistic for general . generous precipitation , suggesting moisture around the Great Lakes area the latter half of this period . The Great Plains area of the Southwest shows little prospect for rain . although relief from hot weather there is es-pectedIn March , Northwest farmers reported intentions " to plant 22,440.000 acres to Spring wheat , the most since 1919 . These " intentions " are always variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural federal programs and weather . Since the price has risen , the Government has indicated its willingness to loan its available 4.000,000 bushels of seed wheat supplies at very reasonable figures , and moisture does not figure as a major Spring wheat problem until after seeding has been started , indications are that a good acreage will be planted . Yield Per Acre Problem The big question mark in the Northwest , of course , is the ultimate yield per acre . Since seeding hardly has begun , actual estimates at this time would be foolhardy . However , for the record , an acreage of the size intended , granted the extreme maximum of average 1928-32 yields , would produce ** bushels , the largest since the bumper 1928 output of 335.113,000 . In view of general countrywide drought conditions , it would not seem that the Northwest could escape with whole akin . Thus , figuring equally conservatively that yields produce no better than last Summer , when in addition to drought there was black stem rust there , a Spring crop of 201,960,000 bushels would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be drawn to the fact that with the exception of 1931 , the Northwest never has had a yield that low . Thus , based on conditions prevailing , total wheat crop prospects loom for a maximum of roughly 760.000,000 bushels , with weather indicating chances favoring more nearly the approximate lower figure of 680,000.000. addition to these supplies , there should be a July 1 carryover of roughly 160,000.000 bushels . Aft domestic requirements are but 630,000.000 bushels , indications point to a 1936 surplus over home needs ranging from 210.000,000 to 290. - 000,000 bushels , dependent upon the turnout of the new crop . The rub in this surplus reassurance with its potential signal of a return to an export basis is that most of the 160,000.000-bushel surplus is low grade wheat . Thus , unless our new crop does turn out over 700,000,000 bushels , chances of our reversion to a world export level seem slight .
