EXPRESS TO MIAMI A STORY BY HELEN STANSBURY S HE stood facing me in the bus , a skinny overdressed child at her side . I 'd have bet money she was in some floor show or movie-house chorus and that they lived in a walk-up apartment in the forties or fifties west of Broadway . As they stood there looking for seats , something struck me as curious about their eyes . The child 's were experienced , old ; the woman 's blank as a baby 's . Of course one look at the rest of their faces , their brows and lashes for instance , should have killed this idea . The child 's were like a child 's . Scant , natural , sandy , to match her hair . The woman 's lashes must have been an inch long and stood out like lacquered wires . Her brows were just dark lines pointing to her hair , which was an off-white . As I say , one look at these things should have set me straight . Only it did n't . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman like a soft innocent baby in masquerade clothes . She saw the empty seat beside me , the only one in the bus , and came and sat down in it . The little girl stood beside her sullenly . Presently she said , " I 'm tired " and began climbing into the woman 's lap . The woman pushed her off . " No , ya do n't , " she said . " You 're too damn heavy . " The child scowled . " Aw , can'tcha wait ? Th ' driver 'll letcha sit up with him if ya behave . " The child looked at the driver in his seat and realized that the woman was lying to her . She looked back at her stonily and said , " There ai n't room " and started climbing on her lap again . " Get off , I tell ya . " The woman pushed harder this time and the little girl stumbled into the aisle . An old man seated across from us , who had been watching them too , caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's better off here , " he said quietly to the woman . " Okay , " she said . The old man bent forward and said gently to the child on his lap , " Going a long way ? " The little girl pulled as far away from him as she could without falling off his lap and stared out the window . The driver came round to punch tickets . When he had finished he lowered himself in his seat , pulled the door shut , and drove west . At Eighth Avenue we turned south . The air in the bus was beginning to warm up . I smelled something penetrating . It was on the woman next to me . I had smelled cheap perfumes before but this was the worst . There was no use raising the window . It was cold outside . I should have to wait till we got to Philadelphia . I amused myself looking round the bus , trying to decide whose seat I would grab when we got out for lunch . She caught my eye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her blank eyes raked me slowly . " I do n't know , " I said . I unfolded my paper . Without actually moving she came closer to me . " You a drummer ? " " No , " I said and went on trying to read . " Feelin ' low , ai nt cha ? " I could feel her blank eyes through my paper . I did n't answer her . She was quiet for a time and except for that awful scent I forgot about her . The bus lurched . She fell across my knees  --  well , not quite . I used my arm to brace her . She was heavy though and was pushing hard against me . The bus was riding as sedately as a hearse now . " Try sitting up , " I said . She waited a moment , probably to make sure I meant it . She was straightening herself when I heard giggles behind us . She must have heard them too , and did n't bother me any more all the way to Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus I found a seat with someone and opened a magazine . After we had started I was surprised to find myself looking round for the woman and child . The child was hunched up in a seat , alone , drawing on the windowpane with her finger . A safe distance away , the woman sat talking to a man . She was making headway all right . I decided not to stay over in Washing . ton . I wanted to see what riding all night in a bus was like . I had the woman 's number by now and did n't expect to see her , the child , or the man again . I was sorry for the youngster . The engine was running and the door shut when there was a rap on the glass . The driver opened the door and the woman and child got on . There was n't the smallest trace of emotion about her as far as I could see , though she had caught the bus by a hair's-breadth . The child looked all in and was whimpering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . I could n't conceive of a woman , even this one , leaving a child for the night under the circumstances . But she did . I watched her stuff a coat in the corner of a seat and order the child to lie down with her head on it . The child hesitated , dazed with sleep . The woman threatened her with her hand and , whimpering , the child obeyed her . The seat was much too short for her but she folded up with a practiced air . The woman told her to shut up or she 'd crown her . Then she left her and sat down beside me . " Gain ' t ' Florida ? " she said , settling herself against me . Well , anyway , her perfume had died down a little . " Yes , " I said . " Now if you do n't mind In going to sleep . " She took off her hat , tossed it on the shelf above us , and sat back again . " I ai n't a bit sleepy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sorry . " I pulled my hat over my eyes . " God , I hate kids , " she burst out . " That 's easy to see , " I said . " Hope the kid you have with you is n't yours . " " Hell , no . I 'm gettin ' th ' trip free f'r bringin ' her down to her ma in Miami . I wish we was there now . " The driver switched off the lights inside . " I bought me fi ' bathin ' suits . You c 'd put ' em all in your eye an ' still see good . " Her mouth was very close to mine . " Why bother with any ? " I tried to sound half asleep . Even in the dark I knew she was annoyed . " What ? " " Nothing . " I yawned . Her mouth clamped down over mine . It felt just the way it looked  --  soft and sticky . She got kissed a couple of times . Then I turned over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crick in my neck . She was leaning against me , dead to the world , snoring a little . Once my hand touched her face and her lashes felt like bristles . It got colder toward morning so it was n't such a bad idea having her there . We kept each other warm . The three of us had breakfast together . Marie , that was the child 's name , looked older than ever . There were blue rings under her eyes . Veronica looked even softer than the day before and more like a drowsy baby . She had left off some of her make-up and I saw she had a fine skin . When we had eaten we still had thirteen minutes before the bus left . The air was sharp but it was warmer than it had been in New York . I coaxed Marie to run round the block with me . At first she did n't seem to know what to do with her legs . But by the time we were racing back to the bus she was really covering ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd trust you with a paper napkin , but you could n't expect much else . There were two single seats left . Veronica sat behind me and talked in my ear . She kept her voice low , so it did n't matter . And Marie , on my lap , was used to her . After lunch Veronica and I sat together and Marie sat in front of us eating popcorn . I opened the window . It was beginning to feel like early spring . Veronica was telling me the story of her life . " It 's funny , " she was saying . " 1 didn ' wan na make a livin ' like ma sister was doin ' . I wanned t ' be a dancer . I was gettin ' on swell too till th ' ol ' man found out Ma was payin ' f'r lessons . Sis woulda helped on'y she do n't make much , see ? She ai n't so hot lookin ' . An ' y'gotta keep buyin ' clothes , see ? So I quit dancin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuthin ' like that . I was lousy in school . " She looked at me , I thought defiantly . " They said I was dumb . But I know better . I was sleepy . I used to wait up all hours f'r Sis . If she did n't bring nobody home I c 'd sleep with her , see ? B'what th ' hell ? She ai n't never alone hardly . " I step ' on a lousy or sofa in th ' parlor . You know . " She showed me with her hands . " One a them sofas about so wide with a hump down th ' middle . A cat could n't a stuck on . " One night I meet a guy at a dance , see ? He says t ' me , ' Baby , waddaya want ? Th ' sky 's th ' limit . ' I do n't givehim time t ' change his mind , see ? ' Big Boy , ' I says , ' gim me a bed . Th ' sweilest bed in N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " Four years . I was fifteen . I look old f'r my age , see ? I walked out on him in a coupla weeks . He was a rat . " The bus stopped for ten minutes . Marie , her hands and face smeared with popcorn , asked Veronica to take her out . Veronica told her she was old enough to find the ladies ' room herself . The child screwed up her dirty face . " If you do n't take her , I will , " I said . About the time it was getting dark I saw we were coming to Jacksonville . " We 'll be in Jacksonville in half an hour , " I said to Veronica . I caught sight of Marie 's face . " You 're not going to take that kid to Miami to-night , are you ? She 's all in . " " Say , di ' sooner she 's off my hands , th ' better I 'll like it , see ? She 's tough , ain'tcha , kid ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " One night on a bus is enough for me . I 'm staying over in Jacksonville . But if I know that kid 's on this bus to-night  --  well , she 's not going to be . If you have n't enough money I 'll get you a room at my hotel . How 's that ? " I asked Marie . The child was too tired to know what I was saying . She looked at me vacantly . " I got ta bellyache , " she said . " You should have . Well , what 'll it be ? " I said to Veronica . " Okay . We 'll go with you , " she said . We were crossing the lobby of the hotel when Veronica said : " It 'd be cheaper if we was all t'bunk t'gether . " I wanted to laugh . Then it occurred to me I might be wrong . I stood still to look at her , trying to read her thoughts . It was a waste of time . " I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie while I register . " In the elevator I wondered how often Veronica had stayed at a hotel with a man . More times than she could remember probably . They had given us connecting rooms , though we were n't registered as man and wife . I was sorry but was too tired to do anything about it . " Can you two be ready in fifteen minutes for dinner ? " They said they could . In about fifteen minutes she walked into my room . She had changed her dress . This one was sleeveless and cut very low in front . Voluptuous described her as well as anything . " Where 's Marie ? " I said . " Asleep . I ca n't get her up . " " She 's better off where she is . We 'll bring her back some crackers and milk . " We ate downstairs . Everything we ordered was good . After a few drinks I began to wake up . I lectured Veronica for being so rotten to Marie . I felt Like talking and she pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last I said , " Let 's get out of here . We can go to a movie or see the town . " We walked around and sat in the square that was strung with colored tights . We stopped at a delicatessen on the way home for milk and crackers . Marie was still asleep , so we undressed her and put her to bed . Then I said good-night to Veronica and started for my room . She followed me . In the doorway I turned round . She stood there like a passive little animal . " Look here , Veronica , I did n't ask you to stay over because I wanted you with me to-night Maybe I 'm goofy but I meant what I said about Marie . You better hit the hay yourself . The bus leaves at 9:30 . " Then Veronica said good-night to me . She was holding the door open . She 'd got round to saying there must be something wrong with me or did I work for the Salvation Army or something , when I pried her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the bus the next morning I saw that Marie was sitting with Veronica . Well , that 's something , I thought . Marie said , " Hi . C'm on over here . " Veronica pretended not to see me . The bus stopped to take on a passenger . He sat with me . Inside of ten minutes I knew his name , where he was from , his business , how much he generally made a month , and that he was divorced . We were talking about Florida when he interrupted himself . " Say , that kid over there 's signalin ' to ya . " I looked over . Veronica was staring straight ahead . Marie was forming words across her with her Iips . " I want to sit with you and she wo n't let me . " I was motioning to her to stay where she was when Veronica turned and saw me . She drew Marie to her and put her arm round her . The child certainly looked startled . But she kept her poise at thatl Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's one swell looker with that kid , " he said , " Know her ? " " Oh , the way you get to know everybody on a long trip , " I said . " Y'know , " he said , " it gives me a kick t ' see a girl with a kid . My mother had me when she was sixteen . We was real pals till she died . She 'd play catch in th ' yard with me an ' make candy an ' take me t ' shows . A girl 's better off with a kid any day . Keeps her happy an ' outs trouble . " Now you take th ' girl I married . She would n't have no kid . Hell , no . She had to be steppin ' out ev'ry minute . She got so she 'd do it while I was away . First thing you know she 's in trouble . I forgave her but she did n't change . No more'n / turned my back she was steppin ' out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for we 'd be married right now . " I agreed with him . I did n't disillusion him about Veronica . He divided his time until Iunch between talking to me and watching Veronica . I had a sandwich at the drugstore and a walk along the beach . On my way back I met Higgins coming out of a lunchroom with Veronica and Marie . He was holding the door open for them with a great show of deference . Marie saw me and ran over and took my hand . Veronica 's smile wobbled , recovered it-self , came out again in full force . She even waved to me as Higgins waited to help her on the bus . Higgins and Marie automatically and gratefully changed places . I gave Marie my scat by the window and occasionally , when I was n't answering her questions , I stole a look at Veronica and Higgins . At first Veronica 's voice was shrill and there were spots of red in her cheeks . But gradually she quieted down . She was n't leaning against him either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We made our last stop . Higgins caught up with me outside the men 's room . " Say , man , " he exclaimed . " I know how t ' pick ' em now . She 's ahunnerd per cent . That ai n't her kid , but she says she 's wanted ' em ever since she played with dolls . She 's one sweet little woman , all right . Guys do n't get fresh with her kind . She 's right up my alley . " When the bus was emptying at Miami I watched Veronica take Marie 's coat from Higgins and put it on her herself . When she was sure he was looking she stooped and kissed the child . Higgins ' fat face beamed . He would n't let the porter lilt down her bags . He took them down himself . And as he helped her on with her coat I saw him squeeze her hand . Then he herded his little family off the bus . MIST IN AIR BY MILDRED BOIE T HE immigrant fog pushed on , Sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . A moving hand of white , It washed its earthlings in unearthliness ; Even the ugly school across the street It wreathed in mist and veils ; Even the children ran in beauty there The dark white shapes of children blunting through the mist ; Even the black-robed sisters , standing at the door With drums and faces stern It wreathed in gentleness ; Even the shouldering truth : The Irish rule the Commonwealth : everywhere A Celtic mist blurs the cold New England air .
