txt This writer , having Just purchased a terrestrial globe fig three inquisitive youngsters , finds himself irresistibly moved to attack Gerhard Mercator , Flemish geographer , whose real name was Kremer , who lived 1512-1504 , and who gave his ' name to Mercator 's Projection . The urge to attack Is the more embarrassing since this space should undoubtedly be filled with an account of the monopoly hearing which nas occupied most of the writer 's time for a fortnight . But Mv . Kremer , alias Mercator , has waited three centuries too long for a proper newspaper expos ? , and not another minute can be lost . The plain fact is that Mr. Kremer-Mercator and his followers are responsible for a good deal of North America 's misconception of South America , which finds a focus just now in colloquial discussion of the Lima Conference . And though what follows need not be taken in too grim earnest , still it is a matter worth observing . The Mercator Projection has hung In nearly every schoolhouse of the Nation ' for a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed the same idea of the earth , correct or otherwise , from it . It is perhaps not altogether the fault of Mr. Kremer-Mercator ; but at any rate the globe in shown In two flat hemispheres , with the NeW World nicely , Isolated in one , and Europa , Asia , Africa and what not , in the other . Shoe . Is on Other Foot From earliest schooldays the American child Is brought up by the most subtle kind of propaggnda to believe that North and Sout# America are a geographic entity , Isolated by . " Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , until the United States is geographically married to Its Latin neighbor . Now the adult need only look at Junior 's globe to And the truth of the matter . Americans frequently laugh at miSconceptions of visiting Europeans over their country and its distances , but it is doubtful if there is a broader mass delusion of geography In the wide world today than that of the American himself to the relationship of the Southern Hemisphere , Draw a line between North Polo and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which side of It would Chile , on Latin America 's , Pacille coast , fall ? Nine out of 10 Amerieans , I venture to believe , think of Chile as west of that line , just as California ' is west of Now York . Actually It has to the east . The Meridian passing through New York goes through Lima , Peru , though the latter is on the Pacific coast , Let us try again , It Is high noon In New York , What time is it in Brazil 's Rio de ** BeCtilltie Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . both cities are on the Atlantic , and because of Mr. Mercator 's insidious work , most Americans probably suppose ft is about the same hour in each spot . Nothing of the soli ! Rio is so much to the east of New York that when it IS noon in the former It is 2 p. m. in the latter ; two whole time zones nearer the rising sun ! As a contrast there is only one time zone between New . York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , or about , the distance between New York and Bismarck , N. D. Tpere art other tricky questions that might he asked , as for instance which direction the traveler goes in passing through the Panama Canal , from the Allende side , He does not go west , he goes cast . This , however , is a " catch " question , and relatively unimportant , But did you know that half the people in South America do not speak Spanish ? That is because about 44,000,000 of the 88,000,000 live in Brazil where Portugeso is spoken . how Far to Africa ? Let us conic back to vital geographical matters in connection with the Little , Conference , This theory of South America as next-door neighbor to the United States is hard to down , Yet It is a fact that the eastern bulge of South America is only 1505 miles from Africa , : that Argentina  --  most powerful nation or South America , with a city , Btlenos Aires , only second in also to New York and Olticago  --  is two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Berlin nib service to Buenos Aires is faster than New York alr service ; that portions of South AMerica are , in short , closer to the Old World and much closer to Africa , than to the United States , If the world is to be divided into two flat circles , according to ' Mr. Mercator 's Projection , there would be about as much reason , on a strictly geographical basis , to include South America with Africa , as to lump It with the United States , One wonders where the Monroe Doctrine Would be today if five generations of American schoolchildren had unconsciously imbibed their , ideas of geography from that view pointi whir ? not recommending any such proposal , It Is at least a counter-balancing thought . Only in recent years  --  months almost  --  has America taken a personalized interest in world politics , From now on that interest is likely to Increase . A German colony on West Africa  --  say Portuguese Guinea  --  would ' be only . about 2,000 miles from big German settlements In Brazil , Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Portuguese Guinea has even been proposed . This is only one of the points where study of the globe , rather than the map , will illuminate American thinking . It may not bother the man in the street as yet , But it is bothering Secretary Hull 's State Department today more than they care to admit . Richard L.
