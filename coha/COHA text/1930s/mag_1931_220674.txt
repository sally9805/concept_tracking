Squawks from U. S. Senators in Washington greeted last week the budget speech to Canada 's House of Commons made by Richard Bedford Bennett , rich &; pious Dominion Premier &; Finance Minister . At the last election Canadians gave Mr. Bennett a mandate to up their tariffs in Uncle Sam 's face . Last week Conservative Bennett upped high , upped quick . <P> Nothing in the World is quicker than a British budget . In London , in Cape Town , in Canberra or in Ottawa all that the responsible minister has to do is to state that on item of revenue , tax or tariff is changed and it is changed . New revenue rates are automatically effective unless the budget is rejected by Parliament-which almost never happens . Therefore when Hon. Mr. Bennett rose to speak in Ottawa last week he held in his hand the fiscal fate of Canada . Bang-he upped letter postage between Canadian cities from 2 to 3 ! Bang-up went the Canadian basic income tax from 8% to 10% ! Bang-the sales tax quadrupled from i% to 4% ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Finance Minister 's power . <P> " Reprisals ? " On the tariff side of Hon. Mr. Bennett 's budget speech-and to hear U. S. squawks last week one might have thought there was no other side-the Canadian Premier made courteous pretense that he was not offering " reprisals " to the U. S. Hawley-Smoot Tariff upping ( TIME , June 2 , 1930 ) . Mr. Bennett said that Canada 's depressed " infant industries " and her unemployed workers were uppermost in his mind . By protecting industries he would make jobs . Indeed , two days after his speech Premier Bennett proudly explained just exactly why he raised the tariff on wire netting ( from 30% to 35% ) and reduced that on steel and iron tubing ( from 30% to 7 % ) . His reasons were first that a group of rich men have promised to open a wire netting plant in Hamilton , Ont. if protected by a high duty ; second that another group have promised Premier Bennett to build a factory at Windsor , Ont. , and make things in it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these at reduced duty . <P> Out of 800 classifications on Canada 's tariff list 174 were upped . Also , one embargo was laid . Totally excluded from the Dominion by this embargo are all secondhand automobiles except those brought in by " tourists " or " settlers . " <P> New motor cars have been classified for some time in Canadian tariff acts under three heads . Cars selling for $1,200 or less will continue to pay the old 27 % tariff . But the Bennett Budget ups the tariff on cars selling between $1,200 and $2,100 from 27 % to 30% , ups the tariff on " luxury cars " ( above $2,100 ) to 40% . <P> In her own plants the Dominion now makes Canadian Fords , General Motors cars , Chryslers , Dodges , Studebakers , Willys-Overlands and Durants.
