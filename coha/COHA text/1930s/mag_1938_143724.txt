White-haired but exuberant and bouncing Ella Reeve Bloor , 75 . " Mother " of U. S. Communism returned last fortnight from three months in the Soviet Union . Now the No. i female member of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party , with a record of twelve grandchildren and 36 arrests . Mother Bloor last week gave her impressions of Communism in Russia : <P> Living Conditions . " I was never to so many operas and plays in my life ! I spent most of my time in Russia in one of the nicest hotels I 've ever been in . I heard Madame Butterfly sung in Russian - in the finest presentation I have ever seen . . . . Russia today is safe , secure : there is no worry there , no fear . I did n't go hungry . I ate almost better than I ever have ! I do n't speak Russian . The people really have free speech . If they wanted to , the Russian people could get rid of their present leaders , but they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but that is due to a shortage of workers ! " <P> Executions of Old Bolsheviks were explained to Mother Bloor by showing her photographs of letters by Lenin . As translated by her interpreters these disparaged <P> Old Bolsheviks now executed . Said she : " When they arrest someone in Russia , he 's sure to be guilty , for in the Soviet Union they always investigate carefully beforehand . " She heard a Czech Communist ask venerable Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin , Soviet President , " Was the Red Army weakened by the execution of its leaders ? " President Kalinin asked : " What do you think ? Would it weaken any army to remove those who are confessedly guilty of weakening the faith of the army in itself ? What do you think ? " <P> Elections . " There was only one candidate for an office , " beamed Mother Bloor triumphantly , " because the nominations were made by such large groups-groups that represented everyone-that he was a unanimous choice ! The election was the most democratic in the world . We can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get America on the path of Democracy ! The reason I did not want to stay in Russia , which I love so well , is that I wanted to come home to make America better ! We have everything . We should be happy ! "
