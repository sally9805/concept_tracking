Sharp-witted Amster Spiro , city editor of William Randolph Hearst 's New York Journal-American , knows little about playing parlor games , including bridge , but he does know a good thing when he sees it . Over a year ago , when he read that " Monopoly " was selling by millions , his newspaper mind envied such profitable circulation . Forthwith he devised a newspaper game , " Flash News . " It was too complicated to sell much more than 10,000 sets ( at $2.50 ) and is presently being simplified . From " Flash News " Editor Spiro did learn , however , that there is money in games-if you do n't play them . Soon he secured rights to solitaire " Auto bridge " ( a British invention ) and organized a production company with himself holding the fattest share . Now his sideline has become a thriving business with several hundred employes occupying a spacious loft building in Manhattan . <P> Last week Amster Spiro plunged deeper into the game business . He bought two-thirds interest in Bridge World ( circ. 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expert Ely Culbertson . Mr. Culbertson , who started both magazines , remains as part owner and editor , but Hearstman Spiro announced a new policy . Henceforth Bridge World , instead of being Mr. Culbertson 's private forum , will invite other experts to debate their views in its pages . Whatever Mr. Spiro 's policy , he will have difficulty matching the frankness of the final Bridge World editorial while under Culbertson ownership : " Every bridge writer with the facilities to do so is even now working on some sort of book , any sort of book , about five-suit contract . There will be a quick sale for it . The public can discover its unsoundness later , when the money is already in the till . Naturally , the editors of the Bridge World are in the thick of it , getting their own book on five-suit bridge printed and on sale . "
