AL L this high-powered fight stuff need n't give you the idea that I was neglecting the theatrical end of my private saga . Even in the middle of preparations for the Corbett Sullivan fight I was battling to break in on Broadway as a real top-flight manager . Things like After Dark had already made me well known on the circuit of Iow-priced melodrama theaters that started on the Bowery and covered the whole country east of the Mississippi . But what I wanted now was to move uptown  --  to Union Square and beyond  --  and sit down alongside the seats of the mighty . Nowadays , anybody 's bank roll and anybody 's production stand as good , or as bad . a chalice as anybody else 's in the American theater . You never know whether it 's a Wall Street broker , or a Dutch Schultz , or a big movie company that 's hacking a show . But forty years ago , the uptown  --  and also upstage  --  world of people like Augustin Daly and A. M. Palmer and Waltack looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting and melodrama . It was extremely unhandy . When I tried to persuade Mrs. Pat Campbell to come to America , years before anybody else succeeded , she only smiled and shook her head and said : " But . I hear you handle pugs , Mr. Brady . " When I was put up for the Lambs , I was blackballed because some members were afraid I might bring Jim Corbett . the prize fighter , into the club . Years later , when Corbett himself was put up for the Lambs , he had more favorable comments after-his name than anybody in the history of the organization . But meanwhile we were in the doghouse . A Roman Emperor on Broadway M Y FIRST effort at crashing Broadway suggests that I was trying to get out of the doghouse by way of the menagerie . Niblo 's Garden , the old theater at Broadway and Houston , where The Black Crook had first appeared , had a play called Nero , in which Wilton Lackaye , as star , divided attention with a troupe of performing lions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in due time , I bought the whole production for very little from its disgusted managers . It was partly the lions . Lions were a novelty on the stage then . It was also partly my eagerness to have a play , any old play , on Broadway , and partly the fact that buying Nero would let me put . a girl named Marie Rene into the female lead . When I first met her , she was a " transformation dancer " ? did a turn in which she shed one costume after another . Irish one minute , Scotch the next , French the next , and so forth , with dances to match . a popular stunt then , even if it did make the poor girl go on stage wearing as many clothes as a Chinaman off for a six months ' trip . She afterward became the first Mrs. William A. Brady and mother of Alice Brady . But Nero was a sad thing at best , and not even the lions could save it . Being stuck for an attraction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , sight unseen . When he got a look at what he 'd bought , the night we opened it , he came out into the lobby as the audience left and addressed them as follows : " Ladies and gentlemen , " he said , " this play is a fraud . I have it here for a week . I hope nobody will come and see it . " Then in Holmes ' Theater , Brooklyn , the liveliest of the lions got us an extremely dangerous reputation by coming within half an inch of jumping the spiked barrier out into the audience . Add that I did n't get on well with Lackaye and you can see why I was n't too heartbroken when Nero folded up on me . But I still had a fancy for the lions , so I put Keller , the magician , on the same bill and started out to see what would happen with the double attraction of lions in cages and rabbits coming out of hats . They were German lions from Hagenbeek 's Hamburg zoo , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainspring of the outfit was Darling 's dog , a Great Dane whose job it was , whenever the cats were feeling nasty , to jump in front of his master and snarl them into submission . lie could have licked them all at once , if necessary . On one occasion , when Darling got into a row with some roughs in a saloon , the dog cleaned out the whole joint in thirty seconds . That Brooklyn audience did n't need to get so scared when they saw the lion jumping for them . Those cats were so harmless that once , when Darling was not in condition to go on , I volunteered to substitute for him in the cage . But he would n't hear of it , protesting angrily that . that would disillusion his public . It was n't bravery on my part . Why , the German boy who cleaned the cages had n't been on the job ten days when he was waltzing right in among the cats and sweeping them round the cage along with the dirt as if they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , one of the lions got nasty and would n't get into the little portable cage we used for transferring the livestock into our cirrus wagon , which was backed up against . the stage door . Ordinarily we lassoed him from the outside and dragged him in by the neck . But this brute , the biggest and the only one that ever showed any spirit at afl , hacked off into a corner of the storage box and refused to budge . The theater was empty and darkish , and I must say that he looked pretty tough , bark there in his corner , braced against the rope and swearing cat fashion . But the German boy , who must . have wanted to get home to bed , grabb0 a broom and walked right into the cage . It was n't more than four feet high , so he had to stoop way over . He marched up to the lion and whacked him across the nose with the broom handle . The lion roared , short and nasty . The boy broke the broom handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally the boy lost patience and hauled off and socked the lion right in the jaw : " Schweinhund ! " he says . reached over , got a grip on the lion 's mane back of his ears and walked him across the cage like a sheep-killing dog . Then , as the king of beasts slunk through the door into the portable cage , he got . a good boot behind for good measure . I 've never been much on the king-of-beasts business from that moment on . When business got so had that we could n't get any more theaters to book us , I abandoned the lions , having accomplished no more than another item in my dubious-sounding history . And there was also an unfortunate flavor to our adventures in the great Chicago World 's Fair of 1893 . There was a big German restaurant at the fair , with a swimming pool attached . The restaurant was n't doing badly . but the swimming pool was a flop . And the S. H. 0 . business we were doing with Corbett on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor the pool over , install seats and a stage , and let us put on a pugilistic-athletic exhibit instead . The staider citizenry of Chicago protested violently against seeing their beautiful fair . the apple of their civic eye . polluted by a prize fighter . But , as is usual . with World 's Fairs , this one was n't doing well the first couple of months , and we were allowed in to see what . we could do . An Opponent From Down Under feature of our show was to be Jim Daly , Cork ) hetes sparring partner , boxing with a kangaroo , who had turned up from Australia at just the right moment . The original idea was to have Corbett box the Australian , but , on second thought. , the possibility of his getting damaged ruled that out . It was just as well . Daly said he did n't mind taking the beast on  --  would n't even bother with rehearsal . He 'd just carry the poor animal along for a while to give the house its money 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring . You may have seen them in circuses since , boxing naturally with their dinky little forelegs . But they also have a natural habit of tipping hack on their tails and letting fly with a tremendous hind leg  --  a kick that can tear a man wide open . We found out about that the first time Daly put up his hands with the gentleman from down under . After a little feinting , he slapped the kangaroo one in the jaw to see how he liked it . lie did n't like it . lie reared hack , unwound a hind leg and knocked Daly clean across the ring . The audience howled with delight . Daly 's expresiion us be picked himself up and saw the kangaroo waiting for him , head up and front paws cocked , was something to see . A Knockout Not in the Books W. fix this long-legged devil , " he said , and waded 1 in . The Australian did n't have a chance at another kick . It was clip , clip , clip , as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laid out cold . It was all of a week before he 'd recovered , and in the meantime the feature of the show was gone when we needed it most . For business was terrible . That did n't matter much , since we were all having a good time Corbett particularly . bean , handsome , magnetic , he had only one rival in attracting female attention from the lady visitors . That was a Sti &nese.; an item in the weird collection of nationalities  --  South Sea Islanders , African cannibals . Eskimos , Siberians , and such  --  which was on exhibit along with farm implements and dynamos and cowl ) dancing . Ile also was tall and slender , with the finest eyes I ever saw in a. human head , long black hair oiled up to the nines , a profile like a Greek coin , and a chocolaty-velvet skin which was perfectly set off by a kind of milk-while toga he wore . Presently Corbett had picked out one special girl  --  a red-headed colleen from the Irish exhibit . And presently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pretty nice . l le did n't say a word to her ; just mooned round and struck and the Irish girl were sitting and speak to the girl . Corbett leaped up . raging in English ; the Sudanese answered back in his own language , which sounded quite adequate for the purpose . A knife flashed like a striking snake and Corbett 's hand went to his shoulder  --  the Sudanese Adonis had taken a slice out of him . All over the room , weapons were flashing into sight , every variety of dagger , dirk , yataghan , creese , stiletto and clasp knife known to the science of cold steel . In a split second the crowd had divided into opposing camps  --  all Europeans and Americans behind Corbett , all Malays and Chinamen and odd racial pickings behind the other fellow  --  and it , was mostly the latter who had knives . But no knife was quicker than Corbett 's left . One punch on the chin put the Sudanese out like a light , and then we turned and shoved our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. Enemies Around a Throne E fair authorities hushed that . up pretty well . I lie t they also requested us to pack up and clear out , to avoid more trouble . The whole non-white contingent was going armed , we heard , aiming to settle with Corbett on sight , so he did n't even reappear at the fairgrounds . When we returned to New York headquarters . we found plenty of other people looking for us with knives , figuratively speaking . The pugilistic world was still sore because Corbett had stepped in ahead and nailed the Sullivan fight . Four or five crack boxers were announcing that they could have licked John I , . as soon or sooner , and no doubt some of them were right , at that . All we heard on all sides was untuetful remarks to the effect that ( a ) Sullivan had been a pushover  --  before the fight , the same wise guys had bet he would make Corlagt jump out of the ring  --  and ( b ) that Corbett was just a dancing master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he take on somebody who could lick him ? That question had to be answered pretty quick . The worst of it was that all these potential challengers were the kind least suited to Corbett 's style . There 's no telling when a wild slugger will batter down the most expert defense and land one crushing blow to put a fine sparrer out of business , There was the new Irishman , Peter Maher . a rugged , ugly , **28;974;TOOLONG fighter ; Frank Slavin , a better boxer of the same type ; and Bob Fitzsimmons , whose star was steadily rising all the while , the huge-bodied , skinny-legged freak , with murder in both blacksmith 's arms and appalling amounts of fighting sense and courage in his scraggy red head . That array of battering rams , all able to take punishment like sandbags and all packing punches , were plenty of justification for Corbett 's getting ring fear  --  the shyness about defending the title which hits almost all champions , once they 're at the top . It is n't , really fear ; certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just the result of the grim realization that luck plays its part in boxing too . The challenger has everything to gain in a fight .. The champion has everything to lose . And then Charley Mitchell , the gamest little cockney who ever put up his dukes , returned from England to add the final complication . If anybody should have had our place in the ring with Sullivan , Mitchell was the man . He 'd already fought John L. twice  --  once to a draw in thirty-odd rounds at Chantilly , France , which ended up with both men in jail ; once in New York to no decision . And he came loaded for bear , bringing with him a man he was handling , Jim Hall , an Australian heavyweight who had beaten Fitzsimmons in Australia , and a certain Squire Abingdon Baird , a sporting gent with half the Bank of England in his pocket to back Mitchell with . They wanted a Mitchell-Corbett fight and a Hall-Fitzsimmons fight . They got both . A week after Fitz licked Hall in New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten cents in his pocket . In the meantime , however . Mitchell 's tongue , which could take off the hair at fifty yards , and Baird 's money had got Corbett where they wanted him . We could hear nothing but what Mitchell was saying about Corbett , behind his back and to his face , too , for that matter . In those times , a fighter trying to get a match would often accost his man in a barroom and say : " Listen , you thus-and-such ; I 'm tired of chasing you round . Come on down in the cellar , lock the door and throw away the key , and we 'll see who 's the better man right here and now . " Shouted out in the right place , with every customer listening hard , that was an impressive stunt . And Mitchell was the only man I ever saw who really meant it . If Corbett had said yes , Charley would have been down the cellar stairs in two shakes . But Corbett , still cool enough to let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson . the doughty Australian Negro , when a fellow invited him to go down cellar and throw away the key : " Mister , " said Jackson solemnly , " I do n't know how you feel about it , but I 'd rather get some money when I fight . That 's my business . " Calling a Challenger 's Bluff Mitchell had the answer to that too . Baird and he announced that they would post $50,000 with the New York World as a side bet for a Corbett match . An unheard-of sum for all times , and pretty certainly a bluff , but a bluff that had to be called . I told Corbett so . " Bill , " he said , " I do n't like this man . After what he 's said and done to me , I 'm afraid of what might happen if I get into the ring with him . " But I insisted and he gave in . Raising our end was encouragingly simple . I did n't have to put up a cent . I just dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mitchell was betting $50,000 on himself at even money against the champion . " I 'll take any part of it " was the invariable answer . I could have got $200,000 just as easy . The next day we met . Baird and Mitchell at the World office . Mitchell slapped down $50,000 on the table with a defiant flourish , expecting us to be taken aback by his actually coming through with such a fortune . When I slapped down $50,000 on top of it and sang out , " The match is made , " his bluff was called for fair . So he got busy , oiled up his tongue and started abusing Corbett in language that crisped the papers on the table and made the very ink blush . Corbett . went white , gritted his teeth and leaped across the room at the little cockney . I got in between in a hurry . " A fine champion you are , " says Mitchell , " letting little Brady protect you . " Corbett threw me aside and went after him hammer and tongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out then and there . By the time we got them quieted down , the office was a total wreck , and Mitchell 's purpose was completely accomplished . Corbett and I were so frantic with rage that we 'd have fought for nothing . The First , Jack Dempsey By imposing one impossible condition after another , they got the side het whittled down to $5000 without our ever knowing how they did it .. I even bet Mitchell 2 to 1 in thousands that he would n't dare get into the ring . When he skipped through the ropes at Jacksonville , I had the pleasure of paying him $2000 . But I don't. grudge it . Since the fight was on a winner-takeall basis , he never got another penny out of it . And if he 'd only hollered , he could have had anything up to half the purse on the quiet to keep him happy . Jacksonville , Florida . made us the best offer for the fight .. The Floridians were starting the build-up which culminated in the late-lamented boom in those parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anybody got . Mitchell trained at St. Augustine ; we trained at Mayport . Croquet was the favorite sport in our camp , earnestly played by Corbett and Jack Dempsey  --  not the present popular restan rateur , but the old Nonpareil , th , middleweight. wonder who had taken such a terrific beating from Fitzsimmons three years before . We 'd hired him as a sparring partner , half out of charity . But he earned his way and to spare at the fight , when , in a great emergency , his punch-drunk wits worked faster than anybody else 's . All the while we were training , Mitchell kept firing hot shots at Corbett to keep him in a rage . Charley was always ready with a grin and a scornful crack . During a. record-breaking thunderstorm , he cocked his ear at the crashing thunder : " Listen to that , " he said to the reporters . " That . must be that . Yankee dude punching the bag at Mayport .. Just ' ear him ! " I got my share too . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd take me aside and say , with a great show of seriousness : " I sye , Brady : you 'll want a doctor in the dude 's corner , y'know . " That was a favorite of Max Baer 's , but Mitchell invented it . Or else he 'd kid me about . that thousand-dollar bet  --  and his kidding was about as gentle as a hurricane . He was working the same psychological game on us that we 'd worked on Sullivan , but he was smart and there was n't much to do about it . The prominent citizens of Jacksonville had invited us there , and we // ? should have got treated right . But the governor of Florida , like the citizens of Chicago , was aghast at the notion of prize fighters breathing the respectable air of his community . The state had no anti-prize-fighting law , but that was n't going to hold him back . He said no . So Jacksonville , equally bent on having the fight , took the matter to court and fought it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor summoned the militia and camped them round the arena  --  a young army with the sole purpose of keeping the fair name of Florida from being besmirched by boxing . When it looked as if we might take the fight into Georgia , Ihe governor of Georgia lined the border with his own militia and announced that no bruisers would be allowed to pollute the holy soil of Gawjuh , suh ! We were about as popular as a colony of lepers trying to register at an Atlantic City hotel , in spite of everything our Jacksonville sponsors could do . The night before the fight , the Supreme Court of Florida gave us the verdict , and we could laugh at the governor . But it was too late to save the fight from financial disaster . For weeks the papers all over the country had played up our gubernatorial troubles , and the light fans had naturally decided it was no use traveling all the way from New York and Chicago when there probably would n't lw any tight . When the gong rang , the arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it would have been more dismal if the militia , who had stuck around regardless , had n't crashed the gate , all armed with rifles and bayonets . and hogged all the best seats . We could n't throw them out . There was no police , no nothing . We had to sink or swim on our own . The Brink of Defeat Back of Mitchell 's corner sat Bat Masterson , the famous Western man-Alter , and another gun fighter named Converse , to look after itchell 's interests in case of fire . We had our own artillery back of Corbett 's corner . There was no need for their services , as it happened , but there well might have been . Only a few nights before the ight , Corbett 's collie dog had flushed an intruder on the porch of the trainlig quarters and , when Corbett had fired into the dark , he had been tired Pack at . Just to make sure the fight was nonsense , our referee was Honest John Kelly . a baseball umpire new to boxing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at that time he knew less about the Queensberry rules than half the men in the arena . A good thing from Corbett 's point of view . If Kelly had known his stuff , Mitchell would have walked out of the ring with the title . Now that he had Corbett where he wanted him , Mitchell put . the grand finale on his campaign . He kept us waiting in the ring for ten minutes , with Corbett 's mental ' temperature rising every minute . When he finally arrived in the ring , he saluted Corbett with a string of his sharpest-cornered epithets as he crossed to his corner . And when the fight began , he drew first blood  --  a lucky left that started a little claret out of Corbett 's nose . First blood meant a lot in boxing psychology forty years ago . Ile never stopped talking . A stream of beautifully calculated insults flowed smoothly from his mouth all the while he was within hearing distance . During the first . round , Corbett 's flush got darker and darker . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Mitchell  --  Jim Corbett could hit with both hands as well as outspar anybody in the world  --  and clubbed the little fellow to his knees . At the count of four , Mitchell got up . only to go down on his knees again without being struck  --  just to get another ten counts to ride Corbett . with . There he knelt , cocky and saucy , snarling lurid comment on Corbett 's ancestry and past , present and future . A wooden Indian could n't have stood it . Corbett shoved the referee aside and soaked Mitchell while he was on his knees  --  a rank , unmistakable foul . Both sets of gunmen were instantly on their feet with revolvers drawn . The crowd was screeching and howling like a mass ten times its size . It was old Jack Dempsey who saved the day . He leaped into the ring , with me after him , faced ( ' orbett. , slapped him violently in the face and drove him away from Mitchell . Our entering the ring was another foul . Mitchell 's seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title indisputably . But they missed their opportunity . Perhaps Mitchell refused to take the fight that- way , being sure he could win more satisfactorily by following up his own tactics . Anyway , instead of following the rules . Kelly merely chased me and Dempsey out of the ring and told the fighters to go on . By that time everything was jake . Dempsey 's slap had snaptied Corbett out of it , and from then on Mitchell 's jabberings had no effect . In fact , Mitchell fouled ( ' orbett at the end of the second by hitting him after the bell , lie kept on rushing the champion , game as a bantam rooster , but in due time ( ' orbett stretched him on the ropes and it was all over . A near thing , though , and no mistake . We got . Jacksonville 's $25,000 purse and the $5000 side bet . Nobody else got , anything . since Kelly declared all individual bets off . Just a measly $30,000 , a tenth of what modernheavyweights have occasionally got . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said to me : " Bill , we were just thirty years before our time . " Still we 'd successfully defended the title and could go back to the business of cleaning up in the theater , where the combination of the public excitement about boxing and the contemporary public taste for matinee idols was just our dish . That matinee-idol racket went out when the movies arrived to install the Dustin Farnums and Wallace Reids and Rudolph Valentinos in the same spot . But it certainly came in handy for Gentleman Jim . J7 Bowery Ballad I can remember when it began , back when , I was a kid on the Bowery , with the appearance of a young actor named Henry J. Montague at Wallack ' s Theater in New York . The words " matinee idol " were coined to suit his case ; hundreds of women used to collect at the stage door every day , just to see Harry Montague come out and enter his carriage . We Bowery boys used to hang round Wallack 's about that time and outrage Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of our lungs : I was rendering that last line one afternoon at the theater when an elderly lady ? Montague 's fans were of all ages , if only one sex  --  whaled me across the ear with an old-fashioned whalebone umbrella and put me out of commission for a whole day . That bit , of doggerel went all over the country . It was such magnificent publicity that it . was impossible not to suspect Montague 's management of having had something to do with fostering it . The technique used was invented by the great Commodore Joseph II . Tooker , the fellow who introduced the American public to females wearing tights in The Black ( ' rook and made such an artificial row about it that the echoes persist to this day . When Montague 's popularity was at its height . Tooker gave another exhibition of his virtuosity by bringing over an egregiously good-looking English actor named George Rignold to play Henry V and compete with Montague . As soon as Rignold opened , he began to receive the richest , lushest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man with a profile had to read . Rignold knew nothing at all about the actual source of the things  --  that Tooker was having them written to order . When the newspapers got hold of some of the weirder specimens of correspondence and published them  --  with Tooker 's invisible connivance ? Rignold began running Montague neck and neck . Then Tooker followed through with billing his new females ' delight ' . to play a special matinee of Romeo and Juliet  --  for Tooker 's own benefit , by the way  --  with seven different . Juliets , one for each scene , including suchillustrious actresses as Adelaide Neilson , Fanny Davenport and Marie Wainwright . It worked just a little too well , on the whole . Mrs. Rignold , waiting for her husband in England , saw some of the published letters , took the next boat and struck New York breathing fire and slaughter on her innocent husband . threatening to divorce him on ' account of these ladies who had clogged his mail with undying devotion . There 's nothing new under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star can arrange with an agency to have himself written 50 , - 000 fan letters in three months is just an adaptation of the commodore 's tine Italian method . If Corbett had needed the build-up of phony fan mail , I 'd have supplied it . But he did n't . It came of itself . Still the public took a lot of educating before it really felt at home with the idea of a champion prize fighter being a gentleman Adonis on the side , or vice versa , if you like . We never did get the idea over to the English , who are the most conservative race on earth . Gentleman Jack , Corbett 's starring play , roused more hollering in London than anything since the Declaration of Independence , for the English opinion of a prize tighter was even lower than the American . At the National Sporting Club in London , the scene of all big boxing contests , the professional tighter was allowed to come and see the fun if invited , but he and his likes had to sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred corral  --  apart from the gentlemen members who paid the freight . Corbel I refused his invitation unless he could be on the same footing as the members . And it was n't till the American press raised a big row about seeing their champion snubbed that the club managed to make an exception in his favor . The London Invasion So you can see why London could hardly believe its ears when it was announced that we had taken Drury Lane Theater. the Parthenon of the English drama , for Gentleman Jack , starring James J. Corbett , champion of the world . It was like chartering Westminster Abbey for a dance hall . Sir Augustus Harris , the poker-stiff and Brit.ishly conservative lessee of Drury Lane , was practically startled into swallowing his eyeglass when I proposed it to him . But he was just as flat as he was stiff . and my offer of a ? 1000 advance brought him round in a hurry .

The press spoofed him with skits called The Play 's the Ring and cartoons showing him taking down the bust of Edmund Kean from over the door of Drury Lane and putting a bust of Corbett in its place . And all the time we were readying the production . he fretted round in the back of the house like an unemployed ghost . I was building a permanent half funnel of seats against the back and side walls of the stage , leaving plenty of space in the middle for the ring in the championship fight scene . There was room for a thousand stage spectators in that layout , but I hired only sixty professional supers . When Ilarris saw that mere handful , meagerly spotted around on the seats , being rehearsed in yelling and 60 THE SHTURDAY EVENING POST February 22 , 1934 ( Continued from Page 57 ) cheering and fighting with each other , he thought I was off my trolley for sure .

I wanted a spontaneous effect in my crowd , not an artificial regimented effect , and I got . it by a method that disrupted that whole end of London . The first-row seats were reserved for great sporting figures , people who had already met and liked Corbett. , such as the Duke of Teck , father of the Dowager Queen Many , the Earl of Lonsdale , Lord Hay and the old Marquis of Queensberry , father of the modern boxing code . To fill the nine hundred odd places remaining , I flooded town with tickets stating : THE BEARER IS INVITED BY THE MANAGEMENT TO BE AT THE STAGE DOOR OF DRURY LANE THEATER AT 10 O'CLOCK ANY PERFORMANCE NIGHT TO WITNESS , FREE OF CHARGE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE WORLD , AND PROFESSOR JOHN DONALDSON , TIRE EMMENT AMERICAN BOXING INSTRUCTOR .

Shall I send for Scotland Yard , sir ? " I said we would n't need Scotland Yard . For two solid hours , all the while we were unrolling the prelinsi ,  - -  nary acts of Gentleman Jack , I let them wait and howl . Then , as the entr'acte before the fight scene began , I posted Connie McVey and Jim Daly . Corbett 's two gigantic sparring partners , on either side of the stage door inside , planted myself in the middle , not without . misgivings , and told the doorman to open up . When the onstage seats were full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties as a fight crowd . " This wo n't be an exhibition , " I told them . " It 's three-quarters of a real fight . I 'm to referee .

My sixty real supes were already letter-perfect in bits of naturalistic business , starting fights , making bets , bobbing up and down . Then 1 ran through the whole fight for them in dumb show , playing referee . Donaldson and Corbett , all at one and the same time  --  which is something to do , but I was young then and could take punishment . That way they saw the hand signals in action . But I did n't let them yell yet. , and any stray noise they made was covered by the orchestra out front .

Then , when everything was set and the whole sporting peerage of England was in the front row , Corbett and Donaldson entered the ring and started fighting . We raised the curtain , my hand went up and I. let them yell . Lordy , how they yelled ! That curtain rose on a boiling , roaring surge of mad excitement , with the fighters whirling and punching in the middle  --  the fittest stage effect I ever got in forty years ' trying . The stage knockout at the end of the fourth round was the final touch . " Knockout " is the word . Corbett woke me up with the morning papers . next . day  --  all raves . Clement Scott , dramatic critic of the London Daily Telegraph , a man with the prestige of George Bernard Shaw and William Lyon Phelps rolled into one , wrote of that fight scene : " The greatest things in unison effect yet done pale before this extraordinary bit of life transferred to the stage . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Kean and Salvini and the famous Saxe-Meiningen company , which had been in London shortly before , and went on : " Whoever stage-managed that prize fight is certainly a master of his art .. " I had no objection to taking credit for teaehing one thousand deadheads to do what they had really done naturally . But then the story of how the mob was picked and rehearsed leaked out  --  and the laugh was on Scott . It was fine publicity both ways . We all thought we 'd run a year at Drury Lane . Harris came to the same conclusion . when the reports reached him in . Belgium . He leaped back across the Channel and , the second night , came poking on stage as I was breaking in my mob , nodding approvingly , whispering hi my ear and working hard to give the effect that . I was his hired man , carrying out his ideas . Corbett had to take him firmly by the arm and lead him off . with instructions to stay away from then on . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five weeks , with a net loss of ? 1500 . The English public would stand round and gape when Corbett appeared on the street as blatantly as any yokels at an Iowa railroad station . But they would n't pay money to see him . We toured all England and Scotland , and did respectable business only in Glasgow and Liverpool , where American seamen had broken the inhabitants in to American ideas . Even in Birmingham , the nerve center of English boxing , we got only a measly ? 300 in eight performances . But then , Corbett was in Birmingham 's black books because he had disgustedly refused the special . entertainment provided for him  --  a trip to a rat pit where a champion dog was to kill a thousand rats in a hundred minutes . Paris was the only place where we made any money . We were a complete novelty , because there was no boxing in France those times . Hitting a man with your fist automatically meant a long term in the cooler , the only sure thing in French law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at the Folies-Berge 're , sparring in the blazing lights against the black-velvet draperies specially installed for Loie Fuller 's dances , we cleaned up $10,000 in ten days  --  getting 50 per cent of the gross above $1500 a night. , I seem to remember . And we all went and had a bottle of champagne . We were always having a bottle of champagne . ClarenceMackay , then a young fellow enjoying himself abroad , had been instructed by his father , John W. Mackay , in whose bank Corbett had worked in San Francisco , to show the American boxer a good time . He put his heart in the job . Young Mackay did far better by us than Charley Mitchell , although Charley worked overtime to be nice to us  --  our presence in the pub run by his father-in-law , the famous Pony Moore , meant money in Charley 's pocket . But . we could n't afford to hang round with him much , for he was a bad actor and unhandy company . One of his playful little habits was socking policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . The policeman usually recognized the great . fighter and merely touched his hat and said : Thank you , Charley . " But once Mitchell hit a bobby so hard he hurt him badly , and spent fourteen months on the treadmill at Barnwell in consequence . Crashing the Gate at Windsor He did , however , give us a look at the Prince of Wales in a characteristic pose . Late one evening , Corbett and he and I came up a theater stage door and saw an elegantly whiskered gentleman , just a shadow in a silk hat , half hidden in the doorway . Mitchell evidently knew who be was and went up to him , taking Corbett along . " Good evening . Your ' Ighness , " he said . " This is Mr. Corbett . the Yankee who licked me in the States . " The Prince shook hands with Corbett very cordially . I also arranged to get . a look at Queen Victoria . I heard that . the Covent Garden Opera Company  --  also under Sir Augustus Harris ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gounod 's Faust at Windsor . So I told Harris I 'd like to go along in the chorus and see the fun . By that time he was sure I was mad , so he humored me and fixed it up , and here I was , diked out as a villager , in a green hat with a feather in it , and red tights , caroling away for the queen . I could fake singing all right , as most actors can , and look round in the meantime . We played in one end of a big hall in the castle . Queen and court were at the other end , the queen seated in the middle , a solemn old lady in a big chair . We had figured that , since Corbett was Irish and the Irish like fighting , Dublin would be a good spot for us . The Dubliners met us at the railroad station 10,000 strong , so intent on taking the horses out of Corbett 's carriage and dragging him to the hotel themselves that , by mistake , they unharnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked so big and formidable , they figured one of the pair must be Corbett . But when it came time for the performance at the Queen 's Theater , all our potential customers preferred to stand on the sidewalk opposite the theater and watch Corbett drive by , instead of paying money to see him inside . I heard them telling one another reverently that he made thousands of pounds out of this tour , and then learned from the box office that there was only twenty pounds in the ho use . The Man With Corbett We consoled ourselves for this fiasco by journeying  --  at our own expense  --  to Tuam , a little back-country town where Corbett 's uncle , Father John Corbett , one of the founders of the Irish Land League , was parish priest . We were to give a benefit to raise money for a new parish church . It was like landing on another planet . We must have been the biggest event in the town 's history until Amelia Ear-hart landed near there and gave them something else to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole parish church for Tuam , which should give you an idea of the size of the place . In Parliament. , shortly after , John Redmond , the great Irish statesman , said that action of Corbett 's was one of the finest things he had ever heard of . My connection with Gentleman Jim and Gentleman Jack did get in my way as a young fellow with Broadway ambitions . But it had compensations , and not all of them financial . I lapped up being pointed out everywhere as the man behind the champion , because that was something to be . One evening in Canton , I remember , Corbett . had been upstairs in the hotel having a chat with William McKinley , then governor of Ohio and a candidate for the presidency . Presently , as the pair of them came downstairs to join me : " Hey , Pete , " says an out-of-town drummer next to me , punching his companion in the ribs . " Looky there on the stairs I That 's Jim Corbett , the champeen ! " " Gosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And then , after staring a moment : " Who 's the little fellow with him ? " " I du n no , " says the drummer . " Maybe it 's his sparring partner . " I was as proud of that as if it had been me instead of Corbett .
