txt Henry Ford described the nation today as prosperous , despite high prices , but unable to realize its good fortune . The manufacturer predicted another term for President Hoover . He cautioned the government not to enter business through utility ownership . He said appreciation of present good times will not come until the people understand the cause of the business depression which he said was the mental dishonesty of a speculating public . Mr. Ford declared that so-called prosperity of the inflated values period preceding the 1929 stock market slump would probably not return . " These really are good times , but only a few know it , " he said . " The only thing I see for a general enjoyment of conditions is price reduction and a realization of the cause and extent of the depression . " To prove his point he said a dollar will now buy from 50 to 75 per cent more than it would before the market crash . " The average man , however , wo n't really do a day 's work unless he is caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of work to do if people would do it . " So many of us want to brush the dust off of old stuff on the shelves , the merchandise bought at a high price level and sell it without changing the price marks to meet altered conditions . " Dishonesty Caused Depression . " " Dishonesty caused the so-called depression . People inflate stocks ? that 's dishonest . People buy inflated stocks with the hope of getting rich at the expense of some one else . That 's also dishonest . Persons of that type are too gullible . They can not understand . They need experience . " The question of wage adjustment to meet present-day living demand is a hard problem to solve from a national standpoint , the manufacturer said . He has had no difficulty in his own plant , he added . " We have had no wage cuts , " he pointed out , " with more than 80,000 men employed . " Mr. Ford viewed prohibition as a success , but said big business and not the government eventually will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help if it is to survive , and the real enforcement will come from industry . The government is working hard toward enforcement , but it must be backstopped for complete control . " Manufacturing booze is as destructive and as dangerous to industry as war . The same fellows profit out of both , and war Vrofiteers , booze profiteers and the sellers of inflated stocks are cast in the same mold . " " What do you think of the Wickersham report ? " he was asked . " It was in favor of a dry nation , was n't it ? That 's all that is neces-1 sary to say . " " Are you familiar with the Raskob plan for State liquor control ? " " No , there 's no use to go into it . The Volstead act went through Congress and must be enforced . " 1 The thing for the government to do , the manufacturer said , is to enforce prohibition instead of attempting government ownership of such properties as Muscle Shoals . " Let the government stick to the strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them let business alone . What is everybody 's business is nobody 's business . " Muscle Shoals should be , and eventually will be , the property of privately owned electrical companies , in Mr. Ford 's opinion . As far as a financial interest in the property is conc. ' z-ned , Mr. Ford is only a sidelincz spectator . He is ' interested but not participating . He praised the Hoover Administration for the President 's efforts " to conduct an administration and not a business . " " President Hoover is only in for eight years , " he said laughingly as he predicted another term for the Chief Executive . " And we should give him every support we can . It 's a big job , with an institution of the greatest magnitude . " If the head of a great private industry did not get more support than the President has had in the past , his business would be a failure . " Mr. Hoover is doing the best he can to make the government an administrative force . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done its part , but the natural trend eventually will compel participation .
