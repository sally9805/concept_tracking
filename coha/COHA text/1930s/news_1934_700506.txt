F. of L. union . As a result of the " repeated flouting " of Section 7a of the Recovery Act by the automobile companies , the union men said , the entire Detroit area " was almost like a tinder box , " with tens of thousands of employes waiting to go on strike if the National Labor Board fails to obtain compliance with the law .
