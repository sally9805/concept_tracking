In Washington last week President Roosevelt remarked at a press conference that he hoped for quick action in Congress on Secretary Wallace 's cherished " Joseph " plan for insuring farmers against lean years by storing away part of each bumper crop ( TIME , March 1 ) . The President spoke day after the Federal Crop Reporting Board , having added up June 1 data from 40,000 farmers and field agents , released its estimates of the principal U. S. crops for 1937. * Most accurate to be had , the figures seemed to suggest that a cycle two years shorter than the Biblical one had entered its second phase and the time had come to apply the " Joseph " plan . After five lean years , U. S. husbandmen were assured not only of the biggest wheat crop since 1931 but of an export surplus in wheat . <P> In Texas , where harvest hands are already beginning to drift north after the first threshings , the Board estimated winter wheat production at about 39,000,000 bu. compared to 17,000,000 bu. last year . In Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 142,264,000 bu. of hard winter wheat compared to 120,000,000 bu. last year . Winter wheat production for the country as a whole will be about 649,000,000 bu. , nearly twice that of the drought year , 1933 , and 130,000,000 bu. over 1936 . Since this is roughly the amount of wheat that goes annually into the U. S. breadbasket , it leaves the equivalent of the entire spring wheat for export - according to the Board 's best guess , between 175,000,000 and 200,000,000 bu . Because the critical month of May had been kind to winter wheat , brokers on the Chicago Board of Trade were pretty well prepared for the Crop Reporting Board 's estimate . Next day , however , despite reports of black rust in Kansas , the price of July wheat dropped from $1.11 to $1.08 per bu . <P> Other estimates : rye , 45,974.000 bu. compared to 25,544,000 bu. in 1936 ; barley , 200,000,000 to 225,000,000 bu. against 147,452,000 bu. in 1936 ; oats , between 1,000,000,000 and 1,100,000,0co bu. - compared to 789,100,000 bu. in 1936 . <P> *Except corn and cotton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and August 1 , respectively .
