With a whinnying of trumpets and a rolling rataplan of drums , the curtains at Manhattan 's Shubert Theatre parted this week to disclose two apparently naked gods reclining on a cloud , their bare bottoms perked toward the heavens , their amorous gaze fixed on the somewhat startled audience . The bare bottoms were moulded of impersonal papier-mache , but the silver-bearded Jovian head on the left was unmistakably that of Alfred Lunt . Theatre Guild subscribers , present for the Manhattan opening of Amphitryon 38 , settled back expectantly in their seats . They realized that Jupiter Lunt 's eyes were not feasting on them but on the earthly abode of Alcmena Fontanne . And they expected that in the next hour or so something deliciously scandalous would come of it . <P> Even those who did not know the legend of Amphitryon*-whose wife Alcmena was seduced by Jupiter-expected this because they knew Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne . Spirited Aphrodisiantics , urbanely conducted infidelities are the hallmark of Lunt-Fontanne plays , which take on added zest from the well-known fact that Actors Lunt and Fontanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Play . Amphitryon 38 , adapted for the Lunts by Samuel Nathaniel Behrman from the French farce of Jean Hippolyte Giraudoux , is approximately the 38th dramatic version of the Theban legend of how all-powerful Zeus ( Roman Jupiter ) had to assume the mental as well as the physical aspects of Amphitryon before Alcmena would bed him . The Lunts studied the play , which they were quick to see contained one of their favorite situations , for several months before trying it out last June in San Francisco and Los Angeles . Later they took it to Baltimore , Washington and Cleveland , to whose critics the play seemed " mellow . . . exhilarating . . . sparkling . . . sagacious . " To provincial Lunt-Fontanne fans , Amphitryon 38 was pretty much what the doctor ordered . Broadway was not surprised when Amphitryon 38 rode into Manhattan to find first-nighters willing to pay as high as $100 for a pair of seats . <P> What first-nighters found they had paid for was a comedy written with a stylish stylus , a mort of Jovian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all but the extremely myopic soon discovered that the display of buttockry in the startling opening set was a plaster hoax , so none but the most zealous Lunt-Fontanne champions found Amphitryon 38 the perfect play . <P> Featherlight , the tale gets going when Jupiter 's bang-crash arrival on earth- he forgot the law of gravitation-brings it home to him that assuming human simplicity is going to be a very complicated process . To gain Alcmena he has to sacrifice his wistful whim to be loved for himself alone . Husbandly attention Alcmena welcomes , lover 's desire she abhors . " Desire is a half-god , " she affirms . " Let 's leave the half-gods to the adolescent girls and the casually married . " In the battle of wits and wills between the omnipotent god and the constant matron , Jupiter is charmed into a distinct loss of dignity and self-esteem as the price of his stolen night .
