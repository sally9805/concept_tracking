Texas is the only State that was ever big enough to elect a woman Governor . But Texas women are terrific . From Miriam Amanda ( " Ma " ) Ferguson to long-legged Mary ( My Heart Belongs to Daddy ) Martin , the women of the Lone Star State have been justly famed for their beauty , their temper , their incorruptibility . <P> Last week a Dallas County grand jury in Ma Ferguson 's and Mary Martin 's <P> Texas considered the exploit of 26-year-old Corinne Maddox . <P> Dressed in black , with a Cossack hat perched on her blonde head , Corinne had stationed herself in a doorway on Main Street at the hour when Dallas goes to work . There she waited until Brooks Coffman sauntered by , busily talking to a woman companion . Corinne put her hand in her purse , stepped out behind him . <P> The street , a canyon between high office buildings , was suddenly filled with a flat sound like someone beating a rug . Piercing the racket was Coffman 's shriek : " Corinne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun in her hand was empty , yanked another gun from under her coat , emptied that into the twitching , still screaming Coffman . When the racket stopped , Coffman lay still . Calmly , Corinne surrendered . <P> At police headquarters , she sat down , lighted a cigaret , told her story : Last spring she had tried to end a romance with Coffman , who was 39 , a well-known attorney , married and the father of three children . When she spurned him , refused to elope with him to California , he stabbed her with an ice pick , choked her , threw her in a mudhole beside a gravel pit and left her there for dead . <P> Picked up and taken to the hospital , she spent six weeks there , six more weeks at home recovering from wounds which had punctured both lungs . She was going to appear against Coffman as soon as she was well enough . He began hounding her . " He bothered me-called me-even followed me . I would have left Dallas but I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He constantly intercepted her on the street , slapped her . " He called me . . . and told me he would kill me if I appeared against him . " <P> Terrified , brooding , she resolved to free herself of him . The first time she aimed her old .38 revolver at him as he walked along the street , the gun would n't work . She took it to a gunsmith , had it fixed , waited for Coffman in a cafeteria . But the place was crowded . She was afraid someone else might get hit . Her third attempt was more successful . Even while she was talking , Coffman died in the hospital . <P> Said Corinne 's mother : " That man simply pestered her to death . " The Dallas County grand jury , having pondered all these things , declined to return an indictment . No one in Texas was surprised . Corinne took it well . <P> " Fine ! " she shouted . " That 's a sure cure for the rainy-day blues . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
