txt Eggs was guilty of a grave tactical Too error when he permitted his Low . American financial adviser to cut the price of beef in Addis Ababa to 3 cents a pound and eggs to 2 cents a dozen . It may please the inhabitants of the capital , but it will have the opposite effect on popular Ethiopian sentiment in the outlying provinces along the line of Italian advance . No sooner did the invaders get to Adowa and Adigrat early last month than they started to pay the natives 50 cents for a chicken against the former price of 3 cents , and eggs went up from 5 cents a dozed to 30 cents . With MussoLINI outbidding him 15 to 1 on the price of eggs , many of HAILE SELASSIE 'S subjects may be tempted to put all their eggs into one basket and carry them inside the Italian lines . It would be odd if all the nations of , the earth should refuse to sell anything to Italy , with the exception of Ethiopia  --  and our own cotton and oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the - urns ballot in New York State or were adopted by majorities - a. ranging from half a million to a million . But it is still an open question whether the things that were adopted were referenda or referendums . Webster 's New International prefers the plural in - urns , and good old democratic sentiment will back up that ruling . There is a distinctly high-hat sound to " referenda . " They are excellent food for controversy , all these plurals of the Latin neuter in - urn . We all quote data and not datums , but we all deliver ultimatums and not ultimata . Notes jotted down for future reference are memoranda , but formal diplomatic communications are memorandums . Mathematicians and statisticians make use of maxima and minima , but a public speaker discussing wages will do better if he approves or denounces maximums and minimums in wage rates . The learned may be left in undisputed possession of their addenda and their errata , but it wo n't be very many years before popular usage speaks of international conferences and their agendas . FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe earthquake , Sleety. most of the steel frames in our high buildings would stand up , but the " architecture " would drop off into the street . He says that this happened in the big Tokyo earthquake . As for the very tallest skyscrapers , if the earth shook hard enough the whole thing , steel skeleton and stone shell , would go . From the rest of Mr. WRIGHT 'S remarks it seems reasonable to infer that if loss of human life could be avoided , a good earthquake or two is what the American building industry needs most . It is this distinguished architect 's opinion that contemporary American architecture is unreal and meaningless , being devised " by refugees from reality for refugees from reality . " If it is proper to jest on a grim subject to thousands of investors and business men , a lot of American architecture in the boom era was put up by refugees from reality for refugees from reality . It would take a good-sized earthquake to rival the damage inflicted by the hurricane of 1929 on some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like Railway $150,000,000 in the next . five years on rehabiliProgram. her railroads . Thus it is more than ever apparent how set in their ways the British people are . They refuse to admit that the railroad is doomed by the remorseless march of the automobile . They are going to do on a large scale  --  for England  --  what we are doing modestly over here in the way of streamlined trains and air-conditioned coaches . The challenge to_the the motor car is all the more impressive because England is a small place . Virtually all of it is short-haul traffic as we consider mileage in this country , and it is in this field that our own losses have been greatest . The longest English run , from London to Edinburgh , is a trifle shorter than from New York to Buffalo or Montreal or the more distant New England points . The English have fewer automobiles than we have , but they manage to do a great deal of reckless driving with them , as their very high casualty lists prove . Perhaps that is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nearly 72 degrees was the hottest in the records of the Weather Bureau and is to be followed by several days of subnormal temperature . Yet this is the third year of the New Deal which was to do away with the wild fluctuations of our laissez-faire system .
