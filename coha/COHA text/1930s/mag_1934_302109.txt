In the course of his investigations of U. S. security markets , Ferdinand Pecora , counsel for the Senate Banking &; Currency Committee , last week found one for which he could say a good word . It was the San Francisco Mining Exchange , second only to the New York Stock Exchange in age . On the strength of a statement from its president , Charles E. Hudson , Inquisitor Pecora publicly acclaimed it " a very frank stock exchange . " Excerpts from the Hudson statement read to the committee : <P> " Our exchange may be termed a white chip trading rendezvous for stocks . Mining and oil stocks are naturally of a speculative character and we do not attempt to make the public think they are anything Ise . A hole in the ground today may be a mine of value tomorrow , while a mine of value today may be a hole of tremendous proportions the following day . <P> " Our stocks do not contain the immense quantity of water many of the industrials contain . In fact , our water comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized by promoters whose hydraulic pumps operate out of the Atlantic Ocean . The bankers , as a rule , do not help us because our activities inter- " ere with their game . " <P> Founded in 1862 three years after the fabulous Comstock Lode was opened in Nevada , the San Francisco Mining Exchange was the vortex of a feverish speculative mining boom that burned the land or two decades after the Civil War . During the 1870 's while the Floods , Mackays , O'Briens , et al . were plucking some $750,000,000 in gold and silver from the Comstock Lode , police guarded the portals of Mining Exchange as the public clamored to buy , buy , buy . Bodie was the favorite with Eastern investors and caused them more grief than any other stock on the mining list . Bell Isle was whirled from obscurity to $5.25 a share by the " Tuscarora Ring , " then allowed to subside to $1.25 . To West Coast octogenarians " PostWar boom " still means post-Civil War . <P> Even today almost every San Francisco businessman has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Located at No. 327 Bush Street , it is one of the few U. S. exchanges that still cling to the old custom of calling off the full stock list ' at the opening of each daily session . After that , trading in the usual manner begins . There are no posts on the floor , each broker having his booth against the wall . All sessions are open to the public and only a low railing divides the visitors ' gallery from the trading floor . <P> Now serving his fourth term as president , Broker Hudson is head of Hudson Sons Co. , a direct successor to his father 's concern which once had a firm grasp on the whole U. S. salt business . Broker Hudson went west from Ohio by easy stages , helped found the Salt Lake Stock Exchange , moved to San Francisco at the century 's turn . He claims that never in his 78 years of life did he advise a customer to buy or sell a share of stock , holding to the West Coast tradition that every man has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
