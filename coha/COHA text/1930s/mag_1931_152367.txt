A primitive Kentucky murderer , Curt Jett , 55 , became a Baptist preacher at Union City , Ky. last week . The incident recalled the fast fading culture of mountainous Kentucky . <P> The Indians called the region the " Dark and Bloody Ground " because the Cherokees and Iroquois almost wiped each other out fighting for its possession . Toward the end of the last century the primitive descendants of white settlers made it another " Dark and Bloody Ground " with their feuds . Chief feuding clans in Breathitt County were the Callahans and the Hargises . Chief killer for the Hargises was Curt Jett , a lanky , pork-eating , whiskey-drinking hothead . He became known as the " Wild Dog of the Mountains . " In 1904 Curt Jett , in behalf of James Hargis , his clan chief and uncle , shot &; killed a federal officer and a local police chief. * He was sentenced to life imprisonment . Prison tamed the " Wild Dog of the Mountains . " He had never been vicious . And when he professed religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was pardoned . Feudist times were passed ; the law had tamed the wilful mountaineers . Berea College and Lincoln Memorial University were providing them with modern culture . Curt Jett became an itinerant Methodist evangelist . He married , and entered Asbury College at Wilmore , Ky . He and his wife had trouble . They separated ; he quit college and Methodism . He remarried and began studying for the Baptist ministry . Last week as he received his ministerial license at Union City , he was a typical mountain minister : tall and sparse ; steady , piercing eyes ; a warm , friendly handclasp for everyone ; speech homely and Biblical ; a proud rumble to his Amens . <P> * Later Beech Hargis shot &; killed his father , James Hargis , was imprisoned , paroled . He broke parole , escaped the officers escorting him back to the penitentiary , has never since been heard of .
