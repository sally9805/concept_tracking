The pied piper of Hamelin was a dismal flop compared to the modern underworld radio show . One day four years ago several young matrons at the Women 's Club in suburban Maplewood , N. J. fell to talking about this problem , a great worry to many a U. S. mother who has observed the intense preoccupation of U. S. moppets with the cheap and sensational entertainment provided for them by films , newspaper strips and particularly the radio . Said brown-haired , brown-eyed Mrs. Dorothy L. McFadden , mother of James &; Jean and wife of James L. McFadden , export consultant and amateur sketcher : ' ' Why ca n't we produce decent entertainment ourselves ? " The answer was a series of children 's programs ( music , marionets , etc. ) given by Manhattan professionals . Admission : 10 . So enthusiastic was the reception that the next year Junior Programs , with Mrs. McFadden as executive director , began to send professional troupes to entertain the children of other towns . By last week Junior Programs , Inc. had played to over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five companies , performing operas , ballets and plays , are expected to reach nearly 1,000,000 more youngsters in 29 States and Canada . Junior Programs thinks that proves there is a big place for purer piping . <P> With Saul Lancourt , former assistant director of the Chautauqua Opera Association , as production manager , and with professional adult actors , dancers and singers , Junior Programs this season is producing two operas , Humperdinck 's Hansel and Gretel and Rimsky-Korsakov 's Bumble Bee Prince ; two ballets with accompanying narrative , Pinocchio and The Princess and the Swineherd , written for this project ; one play , The Reward of the Sun God , by John Louw Nelson . Junior Programs ' repertoire also includes marionets , monologists , films , musicians . By far the most popular are the ballets . <P> It costs about $20,000 a year ( met by private contributions ) to run Junior Programs , Inc . A company of artists gets from $200 to $400 for a performance . Local parent-teacher associations , boards of education or other groups sponsor the performances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this makes it possible to give children top-rank musical and dramatic shows at 10 to 25 . The companies play an average of five times a week , frequently to overflow audiences . In Gallipolis , Ohio ( pop . 7,100 ) a ballet drew 1,500 children from all the countryside . In Hartford 's ( Conn . ) Bushnell Memorial Auditorium last year 3,300 children filled every seat to hear an opera . <P> Junior Programs ties up its entertainment with school work by providing schools with materials for related art , music &; dancing activities . Elated by children 's response to her shows , Mrs. McFadden last week blamed adults for depraving their children 's taste so that when they grow up they " patronize the most inane motion pictures , vaudeville and burlesque shows . If left alone a child will instinctively enjoy beauty and good drama . It is the adult who makes a disparaging remark about the dullness of opera and makes fun of so-called ' highbrow ' music and the dance , who influences the child to adopt the same attitude .
