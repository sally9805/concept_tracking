The Littlest Rebel ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) . Cinema folk have lately been telling one another that Shirley Temple and Abraham Lincoln would make " an unbeatable combination . " Definitely un beatable , the combination is well planted in this picture . When the Great Emancipator ( Frank McGlynn Sr. ) receives in his office Virgie Carey , " The Littlest Rebel of Them All , " accompanied by her faithful black servitor , it is to plank the child on his desk , share an apple with her and hear from her the sad old story about the dashing Confederate scout ( John Boles ) who happens to be her widowed father . <P> As in The Little Colonel , The Littlest Rebel presents Shirley Temple in hoop skirts and high-button shoes , pairs her with Tap Dancer Bill Robinson . Still first-rate entertainment are the steps the two per form in a slave cabin , when they wish to distract a Yankee colonel , and again in a street when they seek to raise money to take them to see Abraham Lincoln . Miss Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Polly Wolly Doodle . She also has a new foil in the person of a plump , solemn youngster named Edward McManus , who dances the minuet with her at a children 's party , gravely pipes his apologies at being unable to bow low because his pantaloons are too tight . <P> Captain Blood ( Warner ) seems to be Warner 's answer to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's Mutiny on the Bounty . Whatever the literary merits of Rafael Sabatini 's florid novels , they make excellent cinema fare when served with the crispness and gusto of Captain Blood . <P> The story begins in the reign of James II , one of England 's best-hated kings . When a young doctor named Peter Blood ( Errol Flynn ) is found treating a wounded rebel , he is summarily convicted of treason , sent to Jamaica to be sold into slavery with a group of other James-haters . The island 's No. 1 slave-buyer is Colonel Bishop ( Lionel At will ) , a savage sugar plantation owner who runs his cumbrous mill with slave power . Peter Blood is promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gout , but he does not forget his wretched comrades . Meanwhile his insolence has earned the bitter hatred of Bishop and the affections of Bishop 's niece Arabella ( Olivia De Havilland ) . <P> When Spanish pirates cannonade and capture the town , Blood and his friends escape to the pirate craft , turn pirates themselves . With Britain at war with France and James II ousted at home by William of Orange , Blood gets a navy commission , captures a French man-of-war in a tremendous battle . That is enough for him to be appointed Jamaica 's governor , to Arabella 's delight and her uncle 's extreme discomfiture . <P> Good shot : a sailor in the battle scene with his neck pinned between the ship 's rail and a grappling hook . <P> A personable , mercurial Irishman , Errol Flynn plays a swashbuckling role without swashbuckling . Last June he married Lily Damita , whom he calls " Sweets . " When he finished school in Belfast , where his father is a biology professor , Errol Flynn got bit parts on the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fished for pearls , prospected for gold in New Guinea . Back in London he got stage parts in Othello , Another Language , The Constant Nymph . Tall ( 6 ft. 2 in. ) , brawny ( 180 lb. ) , he boxed on England 's 1928 Olympic team .
