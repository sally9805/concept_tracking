Except for world-championship fights , amateur boxing draws larger crowds than professional boxing in the U. S. Current popularity of amateur matches focuses largely on the Golden Gloves tournaments , originated in 1927 by the New York Daily News and joined by its cousin , the Chicago Tribune , the following year . <P> Started as a circulation stunt , the Golden Gloves boosted not only the number of News readers but the standard of amateur boxing as well . By dividing all the fighters who had the desire and the necessary 25 to become amateur boxers into two classes ( sub-novice and open ) , the Daily News Athletic Association did away with the common practice of matching tough but inexperienced youngsters with ring-wise opponents according to the luck of the draw . Today , almost every city in the U. S. has its Golden Gloves tournament , which stretches over a six-week period from the first neighborhood preliminaries to the city finals . <P> Last week , a crowd of 22,234-more than twice as many as turned out to see World Champion Joe Louis defend his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stadium . What they had come to see were the international matches between the Chicago Golden Glovers ( who defeated the New York Golden Glovers in the annual inter-city championships two months ago ) and a picked team of European amateurs . The Chicago team of eight ( topnotchers in each of the eight divisions of pugilism ) were the survivors of 23,000 aspirants from 26 midwestern and southern States who entered the first preliminaries four months before . The Europeans ( four Germans , one Italian , Pole , Irishman and Finn ) were the cream of the continent . They had two Olympic champions : Heavyweight Herbert Runge of Germany and Bantamweight Ulderico Sergo of Italy . <P> Sergo , a factory worker in his native Fiume , was the boxer the crowd had come chiefly to see . No. 1 amateur bantamweight of the world , his reputation of being invincible was backed up by over 100 victories in European matches in the last three years . Under Italy 's Federazione Pugilistica , Sergo , like most Fascist fighters , had received top-notch instruction , had the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where amateur boxing is even more popular than it is in the U. S. Chicago fans , remembering well the drubbing he gave their favorite , Frank Kainrath , in the international bouts last year , were hoping against hope that they would see the tables reversed this year when he faced Kainrath again . <P> Underdog Kainrath , Chicago team captain and a violinist in his spare time , did not let his townsmen down . With grim determination , he made the bantamweight match the most exciting of the evening . Ducking Sergo 's wild swings and peppering him with well-timed punches and counterpunches , Chicago 's Kainrath clearly won all three rounds . <P> Most impressive European turned out to be a tall Pole named Antoni Kolczynski , 20-year-old Warsaw welterweight , who knocked down the idol of Chicago , A. A. U. and Golden Gloves Champion Jimmy O'Malley , so many times in the first round that the referee stopped the match . Awarded the only knockout ( technical ) of the evening , Kolczynski simply shrugged his shoulders . He had knocked out 37 of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Germany , Italy , Hungary , Denmark , Finland and Eire .
