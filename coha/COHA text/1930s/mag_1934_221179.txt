THE GOODHUES OF SINKING CREEK- W. R. Burnett-Harper ( $1.50 ) . <P> Though the College of Critics last week continued to look down its collective nose at Author William Riley Burnett , readers-at-large continued to lend him their ears . Accused on the one hand of " commercializing " the Hemingway manner and hailed on the other as a story-teller who does not set himself up to be anything fancier , Author Burnett never goes behind the facts of what he has to tell , but his facts are telling . The Goodhues of Sinking Creek is only a long short story , but its rapid narrative covers as much ground as many a full-length novel . <P> Before the Civil War in the border State of Ohio feeling ran high between the Abolitionists and the Southern sympathizers . The Goodhues , who had originally come from Kentucky , were Union men but bitterly against the Abolitionists . Pa Goodhue was one of the most respected men in the neighborhood but he would have been wiser to keep his political opinions to him self . The Bristowes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence , and they had a game-warden in the family . It all started with Clay Goodhue 's arrest for snaring fish on his own father 's property . That led to a suspended sentence and two fistfights . But when officers of the law came to free the family pet , Grandma Goodhue 's caged red bird , shot guns were taken off the wall . The posse that had set out to hang Pa Goodhue lost its nerve , but that night somebody shot him in the dark . His murderer almost got away to the war scot-free ; just in time Clay found out who it was , paid the family debt and went West where there was no war , no Abolitionists.
