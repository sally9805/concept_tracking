For the past six years the Boston Symphony 's Berkshire Festival , near Stockbridge , Mass. , has provided an elegant musical salt lick amid the favorite summer grazing grounds of Boston 's contented Brahmins . Spooned delicately out by the great Dr. Serge Koussevitzky and his flawless orchestra , the Festival 's six annual programs have so far been noted more for purity than for pungency . But last week the Berkshire Festival produced an unusually big and tangy lump of salt . A brown , bosomy , 28-year-old Negro soprano named Dorothy Maynor , who went to Stockbridge to hear the music , ended up by making music for Stockbridge 's awed music makers . <P> Invited to the Festival by friends , soft-spoken Dorothy Maynor wangled a chance to sing for Koussevitzky . When her big , velvety voice swung out in a brace of difficult Lieder , ceremonious Koussevitzky threw up his hands , cried : " A native Flagstad ! " Next day , at a private picnic given by Koussevitzky to the members of the orchestra and a few hand-picked critics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coloratura , crooned deep Lieder , went to town on a Wagnerian Ho-yo-to-ho . The gilt-edged professional audience marveled at her versatility and easy form , found her rich voice one of the finest in a generation . <P> Asked how she came by her poise and cultivated musical taste ( her only previous public appearances had been as a soloist with the Negro Hampton Institute Choir ) , Soprano Maynor modestly gave all the credit to her teachers . When she had heard the last concert of the Festival , Dorothy Maynor thanked her hostess for a nice time , took the next train for Manhattan , where she lives with her mother ( a Methodist minister 's widow ) in a small upper-West Side apartment . When she got home she started practicing for her first public recital , at Town Hall in November . Said she : " My week has been so exciting I ca n't believe it 's true . "
