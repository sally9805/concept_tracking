DRAMATIC HOURS IN REVOLUTIONARY HISTORY Washington Crossing the Delaware BY HENRY FISK CARLTON Edited by CLAIRE T. ZYVE , Ph.D . Fox Meadow School , Scarsdale , New York BUREAU OF PUBLICATIONS TEACHERS COLLEGE , COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY NEW YORK CITY HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio . Possibly you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home . The persons whose voices you heard as you listened , looked just as they did when they left their homes to go to the studio , although they were taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore costumes very different from the ones we wear today . The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the microphone , each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand . Since they could not be seen , they did not act parts as in other plays , but tried to make their voices show how they felt . When you give these plays you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio if you wish . You will not need to memorize your parts ; in fact , it will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so , and , furthermore , you will not want to , since you will each have a copy of the book in your hands . All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking the part of a radio actor , that you are to read your speeches very distinctly , and that by your voice you will make your audience understand how you feel . In this way you will have the fun of living through some of the great moments of history . HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY There are some directions in this play which may be new to you , but these are necessary , for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio , talking in front of a microphone . The word ( in ) means that the character is standing close to the microphone , while ( off ) indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint . When the directions ( off , coming in ) are given , the person speaking is away from the microphone at first but gradually comes closer . The words ( mob ) or ( crowd noise ) you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in the distance . Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live , so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and women would talk . This means that sometimes the character may use what seems to you unusual English . The punctuation helps , too , to make the speeches sound like real conversation ; for example , you will find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very excitedly . Washington Crossing the Delaware CAST GENERAL WASHINGTON COLONEL REED JOHN HONEYMAN COLONEL RALL A CORPORAL A SOLDIER GENERAL KNOX COLONEL GLOVER MOB VOICE ORDERLY ANNOUNCER We take pleasure in presenting this story of Washington crossing the Delaware . The picture of that famous event is familiar to everyone , but the story of what led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history is not so well known . The fall and early winter of the year 1776 saw the fortunes of Washington 's army sink very low indeed . Beginning with the defeat on Long Island in late August , Washington and his army had met reverse after reverse . They had been forced to retire in succession from Manhattan to Fort Washington , then across the river to Fort Lee , then from Fort Lee to Hackensack . This succession of defeats and the enforced retirements had disorganized and depleted the army . But even worse than that , it had well-nigh ruined the morale of the civilian population , whose hearty support was absolutely necessary if the war was to be carried on . But now , discouraged and disheartened , the mass of the population gave Washington no help , no encouragement , no cooperation . This is the situation on the morning of November 22 , 1776 , as we begin our story . Washington is in his headquarters at Hackensack , New Jersey , when Colonel Joseph Reed , his aide , enters  --  REED Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what news ? REED Not much , I 'm afraid , sir . WASHINGTON Have we no information of the British movements yet ? REED None ! WASHINGTON What 's the matter with our intelligence service ? REED It 's completely disrupted , sir ; and we can get no help from the civilian population . WASHINGTON I know  --  they 've lost all faith in us , Colonel . Nothing but a victory can bring us again the loyalty and help of our own people ! It 's discouraging , Colonel , to think that now when we need it more than ever before , we can get no help ! REED Sir , if we could only turn and strike a quick blow , we might recapture Fort Lee . WASHINGTON Yes  --  if I only knew what force of the enemy is holding the Fort , and when Lord Howe expects to bring the rest of his army across the Hudson . REED Well , we do n't know that ! WASHINGTON And without an intelligence service we ca n't find out ! Of course if General Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee this morning , was there ? REED None , sir . WASHINGTON Oh , why does n't he answer ? Why does n't he come ? It 's been more than a week now since I ordered him to join me at once ! Have you heard any rumor about him ? Has he left Peekskill yet ? Has he crossed the Hudson ? REED I have n't heard a word . He has n't even acknowledged the last half dozen orders I 've forwarded to him . WASHINGTON That 's the most discouraging thing of all ! If the second in command wo n't obey orders , is it any wonder that the rest of the army is out of hand ? Oh , well ! We ca n't hope to do anything without Lee 's help , so there 's nothing for us to do but retreat  --  REED Again ? WASHINGTON Yes , Colonel , our small force is uselessly exposed here . We ca n't risk capture  --  that would be the end of everything ! REED Yes , sir . WASHINGTON If Lord Howe crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hackensack and the Passaic Rivers . REED I 'm afraid so , sir . WASHINGTON So  --  we 've got to begin our retreat at once . REED The troops are ready to move , sir . It should n't take us long to get out of danger with our small force . WASHINGTON Yes , yes , that 's one advantage of a small army , is n't it , Colonel ? At least we can retreat rapidly ! I suppose the force we have is even smaller today than it was yesterday ? REED I 'm afraid so , sir . The morning report showed less than five thousand present and fit for duty ! WASHINGTON If we only had Lee 's seven thousand ! But we have n't . You may order the retreat at once , Colonel . REED Yes sir , over what route ? WASHINGTON We 'll move across the Acquackonack bridge , and thence to Newark . REED Yes , sir . I 'll write the orders , sir . ( rattle of paper ) WASHINGTON Colonel John Glover with his Marblehead regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . And the advance ? WASHINGTON Knox and his artillery will lead . We must n't lose our guns  --  the few we have left . REED Yes , sir . WASHINGTON ( half to himself ) Retreat  --  retreat  --  retreat ! Is there nothing else in store for us ? REED Will you sign these , sir ? WASHINGTON Yes  --  the quill . REED Here you are , sir . WASHINGTON Thank you . ( rattle of paper ) You may send the orders at once , Colonel . REED Yes , General . ( calling ) Orderly ! VOICE Yes , sir . REED Deliver these orders at once ! VOICE Yes , sir . WASHINGTON I suppose it 's useless to send another order to Lee . REED We can send one  --  I do n't think it will have any effect . WASHINGTON He ought to be informed of where we 're going  --  yes , write him again , tell him we 're retreating to Newark  --  REED Very well , sir  --  and after Newark ? WASHINGTON Retreat again I suppose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . REED Yes sir , if we have any army left by then . WASHINGTON We have some loyal souls who will stand with us to the end . We may have to retreat to the back country of Pennsylvania ; but winter is coming , Lord Howe is not an energetic foe , and he will hardly press us after the snow falls . Then if we can fill up our depleted ranks we 'll be ready for him in the spring . REED Oh , General , if we could only make one stand against the enemy ! Make one bold stroke to put new heart into our discouraged countrymen ! WASHINGTON I know  --  I know , Colonel ! If Lee would only obey my orders ! REED Very little hope of that ! WASHINGTON I know  --  and I ca n't understand his motives ! REED Why sir , they 're perfectly plain to me  --  and to the rest of the army . WASHINGTON Indeed ? REED Certainly  --  he wants to discredit you  --  to bring about your failure  --  so that he can succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Well , if Lee can bring victory where I have failed , I 'll be only too glad to step down in his favor . REED Sir , I beg of you , you must n't even entertain such a thought , why General Lee could no more  --  ( knock ) WASHINGTON Will you see who it is , Colonel . REED Yes , sir  --  ( mumble at a distance , then out loud ) General , there 's a man here who wants to see you . WASHINGTON Who is it ? REED He refuses to give his name , and says his business is private . WASHINGTON Tell him to come in . REED Yes , sir  --  ( off ) Come on in , the General will see you . HONEYMAN Thankee  --  thankee , sir . I 'm obleeged to ye , sir . ( in ) Be ye General Washington ? WASHINGTON I am , and what can I do for you ? HONEYMAN Wal '  --  General  --  if ye do n't mind  --  er  --  er  --  WASHINGTON Yes ? HONEYMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important ! WASHINGTON Alone ? Oh , very well , Colonel  --  REED I 'll go , sir . WASHINGTON Write that letter to Lee . REED ( going ) Yes , sir . ( door closes ) WASHINGTON Now , what is it ? HONEYMAN Wal ' , here I be , General  --  WASHINGTON Yes ? HONEYMAN An ' I 've had tarnation 's own time gittin ' here  --  I cal'ate half yer army stopped me an ' wanted to know my name an ' my business  --  an ' they was n't goin ' to let me in when I would n't tell ' em . But it takes more'n that to stop John Honeyman when he gits sot on doin ' something . WASHINGTON Your name is John Honeyman ? HONEYMAN That 's me , sir , an ' I promised Marthy  --  that 's my wife , sir  --  that I 'd come to see ye  --  and I come , an ' here I be ! WASHINGTON And what can I do for you , Mr. Honeyman ? HONEYMAN Nary a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come to make ye an offer . WASHINGTON Well ? HONEYMAN I 'm in a way to find out a lot o ' things that 's goin ' on in the British Army . WASHINGTON So ? HONEYMAN Aye , ye see , I 'm a butcher . WASHINGTON Well ? HONEYMAN An ' I 've got a contract to supply the redcoats with beef . Now they think I 'm a good Tory ! But General , I ai n't ! WASHINGTON I 'm glad to hear that ! HONEYMAN An ' I figgered that mebbe I could find out things an ' tell ye about ' em  --  if we could fix things up . WASHINGTON How much do you want for your information ? HONEYMAN No ! No ! General ! I ai n't tryin ' to sell ye nothin ' ! WASHINGTON I beg your pardon , Mr. Honeyman . But I have so many insincere offers . HONEYMAN I know  --  I know ! I hear folks talk . They think I 'm a Tory ! Wal ' , sir , I want they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a-goin ' to be any use to ye , nobody must know I ai n't a rip-roarin ' all-fired Tory . WASHINGTON Certainly ! HONEYMAN An ' that 's the why I would n't tell none o ' yer men what my name er my business was . WASHINGTON Mr. Honeyman , you 've shown extraordinary good sense ! You 're exactly the man I 've been looking for ! I 'm in desperate need of reliable information . And I believe you 're the man to get it for me . HONEYMAN I cal'ate I be . WASHINGTON Have you any information now ? HONEYMAN A mite . WASHINGTON Well ? HONEYMAN Lord Cornwallis is bringin ' 15,000 men across the Hudson tonight , to git ye . WASHINGTON We 'll be gone . HONEYMAN That 's fu'st-rate ! Now I 'll be goin '  --  an ' I 'll keep ye informed when I know anything ye ought to know . WASHINGTON Just a moment , Honeyman . How are you going to get your information to me ? HONEYMAN Wal ' , I figger I might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to excite suspicion . HONEYMAN I 'd be as keerful as could be . WASHINGTON No  --  I must n't even let my own men know you 're working for me . HONEYMAN Wal '  --  ye might have me captured now an ' agin  --  tell yer men I 'm a notorious Tory  --  an ' have ' em be on the lookout fer me particular ! Then when I 've got something fer ye , I 'll put myself in the way o ' gittin ' captured . WASHINGTON Good ! That 's an excellent idea . I 'll have to give you a pretty bad name with my troops . HONEYMAN Pshaw  --  I do n't mind that , sir . WASHINGTON And I do n't know how I can reward you . HONEYMAN I do n't need no reward to help ye , General Washington , I got a duty to do that !  --  There 's only jest one thing , sir  --  WASHINGTON Yes ? HONEYMAN I 'd sorta  --  er  --  kinda like my wife an ' children protected from the  --  wal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active an ' notorious Tory . WASHINGTON Of course . HONEYMAN Ye see , I do n't mind what folks think o ' me , but Marthy  --  that 's my wife , sir  --  she an ' the young un 's might git  --  wal '  --  treated pretty shabby . WASHINGTON I understand . I 'll give you an order for them to use in case of necessity . HONEYMAN Would ye  --  er  --  sign it yerself , General ? WASHINGTON Certainly ! Here  --  I 'll write it now . ( rattle of paper ) Let 's see  --  ( slowly ) " To the Good People of New Jersey and all others it may concern : It is ordered that the wife and children of John Honeyman of  --  " Where 's your home ? HONEYMAN Grigstown , sir . WASHINGTON "  --  of Grigstown , the notorious Tory now within the British lines and probably acting the part of a British spy , should be protected from all harm and annoyances . This is no protection to Honeyman himself . " Is that satisfactory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , I 'll sign it  --  ( signing ) There you are , sir . HONEYMAN I 'm much obleeged to ye , sir . WASHINGTON No , Honeyman , I 'm the one who is your debtor . Good day , sir . HONEYMAN Good day , General Washington . Next time ye see me I 'll be yer prisoner . ANNOUNCER And John Honeyman left Washington 's camp to set about making his position secure with the British . He became one of the regular meat contractors for Cornwallis 's army , which pursued Washington across the state of New Jersey during the next month . Washington did not hurry his retreat , but he always got away . Finally about the first of December , he came to Trenton , where he halted for a week and sent men up and down the river to collect all the boats on the Delaware . He knew that he would be forced to retreat into Pennsylvania ; and he proposed to leave no means for the enemy to follow him . On December 8 , 1776 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Colonel Rall , entered Trenton ; but as usual , Washington was half a day ahead of his pursuers , and as the Hessians entered the village , the rear guard of the Americans was just entering the last of the boats , and safely pulled away to the Pennsylvania shore ! Lord Howe , who had joined Cornwallis , sent out men to look for boats , but none could be found . The weather turned cold . Lord Howe was uncomfortable ; so he decided to put his troops into winter quarters and let the pursuit go . He had done enough for one season ! He and Cornwallis arranged to scatter the troops about New Jersey to hold that territory , while they went back to New York to enjoy the winter . Trenton was left in charge of Colonel Rall and his brigade of Hessians . On December 22 , John Honeyman drove a small herd of cattle into Trenton , left them standing in front of headquarters , as he went up and knocked on the door . ( knocks ) RALL ( off ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Rall ! RALL Oh , it 's you , Honeyman ! HONEYMAN Aye , it 's me  --  an ' I got some cattle out front here fer yer Quartermaster . RALL Well , that 's good news  --  my men will be glad to see that beef ! Now we can give ' em a Christmas dinner that 'll be a Christmas dinner ! HONEYMAN All ye need now , Colonel , is a mite o ' wine , eh ? RALL Never fear , we 've got the wine ! HONEYMAN Wal ' , ye kin have a fu'st-rate Christmas then . RALL Yes sir ! With roast beef and two hogsheads of fine wine  --  we should do very well . HONEYMAN Two ? Pshaw , is that all ? RALL Why  --  what 's the matter with that ? HONEYMAN Two hogsheads wo n't go so far with a whole brigade . RALL Oh , I have n't got a whole brigade . HONEYMAN Ye ai n't ? RALL No , just a thousand men , that 's all ! Why sir , they can all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . HONEYMAN An ' like as not they will , eh , Colonel ? RALL ( chuckling ) Well , Honeyman , what do you expect o ' soldiers ? Christmas you know  --  and out here in this God-forsaken place . Let ' em get drunk , I say . There 's nothing else to do . HONEYMAN Wal ' , Colonel , I cal'ate ' tai n't often ye find a better officer than ye be ! I 'd like to serve under ye ! RALL Well , if you want  --  HONEYMAN Yes , sir . I 'd do it if I was n't helpin ' along things in my way by roundin ' up food fer the king 's men . Wal ' , mebbe ye better sign fer these critters out in front an ' I 'll be gittin ' along . I got to hike over to the next post . Er  --  by the way  --  how fer is it to the next detachment o ' troops ? RALL Oh , about six miles south . HONEYMAN Six miles , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of us . HONEYMAN Eh , nobody north ? RALL No , I 'm command of the flank . This is the last post . HONEYMAN I cal'ate that makes a lot o ' hard work fer ye , Colonel ? RALL Hard work ? HONEYMAN Sure , do n't ye have to patrol up an ' down the river , an ' sich like things ? RALL ( laughing ) What for ? HONEYMAN Wal ' , after all , there 's some o ' the enemy left , ai n't there ? RALL ( laughing ) A half-a-dozen starved ragamuffins . What could they do to my trained Hessians ? HONEYMAN ( joining in the laugh ) Not much , I cal'ate ! Ye ai n't in much danger , an ' that 's a fact ! RALL If we had some boats we 'd soon make short work of them . But confound the rascals , they made away with all the boats . HONEYMAN Ye ai n't got no boats , eh ? RALL Not a one ! HONEYMAN Ye ai n't built none , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ye want to git across the river  --  RALL Oh , we 'll get across as soon as the river freezes over . We 'll get the last o ' the rebels then . HONEYMAN Wal ' , Colonel , good luck to ye . But I hope ye wo n't be in too big a hurry to capture all the rebels ! RALL Eh , what 's that ? HONEYMAN Er  --  I 'll be out of a job ; and so 'll ye be , Colonel ! RALL Yes , that 's right too . Well , let 's have a look at your cattle and I 'll sign for ' em . HONEYMAN Come on  --  you fu'st , sir . RALL Thanks  --  hm  --  how many did you say there were ? HONEYMAN There 's twenty-two critters there  --  er , there was when I drove ' em up . RALL Hm  --  they look a little scrawny . HONEYMAN Best I could git , Colonel ! RALL ( counting ) Two  --  four  --  five  --  seven  --  ten ( etc . ) Hm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-one ? Pshaw now  --  did one o ' them critters go trapsin ' off . ( he counts ) Yes sir , that 's just what 's happened . Wall  --  sign fer the twenty-one , an ' I 'll go out lookin ' fer that other critter . RALL Here you are  --  let me have that bill  --  ( rattle of paper ) Twenty-one in good condition , signed  --  Rall . There you are . Hope you find the other one . HONEYMAN Thankee  --  where 's that road off to the left go ? RALL That  --  oh , that 's the river road . HONEYMAN I cal'ate the critter musta gone that way . RALL Better keep a sharp lookout if you go down that way . HONEYMAN Eh ? What fer ? RALL Some o ' those ragamuffin rebels might be on this side of the river . HONEYMAN Pshaw now  --  ye do n't say ! They come across the river , do they ? RALL Yes , once in a while . But they do n't dare bother us . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cal'ate I kin take keer o ' myself . I got my whip and this halter . RALL ( laughing ) That ought to be enough to scare ' em away from you ! HONEYMAN ( going ) They 'll figger I 'm the hangman come out to git ' em  --  fetchin ' my halter along ! ( he and RALL laugh ) ANNOUNCER So Honeyman started down the river road , cracking his whip and swinging his halter . A couple of miles down the road , four Continental soldiers were in hiding . They had been sent out with instructions to pick up a prisoner , if possible , and bring him into Washington 's headquarters for the purpose of securing information . As Honeyman drew near their place of hiding in the brush alongside the river road , the men heard the snapping of his whip . ( crack of whip ) CORPORAL ( low ) What 's that ? SOLDIER Do n't know , sounds funny . See anything , Corporal ? CORPORAL There , I see him ! Huh , it 's just a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him . What 's he got in his other hand ? CORPORAL Looks like a piece o ' rope . SOLDIER A halter ! Look , Corporal ! CORPORAL Yep . A halter . Well , no use stoppin ' him . Lie low . We want to get one o ' them Hessians . By George , though , I 'd like to have that whip . SOLDIER What for ? CORPORAL To use on the Hessians we 're goin ' to git ! SOLDIER You bet . Them mercenaries ought to be whipped out o ' the country ! Shootin 's too good for ' em  --  we 'd ought to  --  CORPORAL Sh ! He 's gettin ' closer . SOLDIER Say ! I know that fellow . CORPORAL Yah ? What about it ? Keep quiet , I said ! SOLDIER No ! Listen , Corporal , we got to capture him . CORPORAL Why ? SOLDIER The General issued orders about him . CORPORAL Who is he ? SOLDIER Honeyman ! CORPORAL Honeyman the Tory ? SOLDIER That 's who it is . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) We 're going to take this fellow . All right now  --  lie low  --  and when I give the signal , jump ! HONEYMAN ( off , coming in ) So-o-o , boss  --  where 's that dang critter gone to ? I cal'ate mebbe  --  CORPORAL Halt ! Get him boys ! HONEYMAN Say ! What 's the matter  --  what ye doin ' ! ALL Come on ! Grab him ! Get hold of him there ! Down with him ! ( etc . ) HONEYMAN ( at same time ) Hey , you scoundrels ! Git off me ! Leave me be ! I 'm a peaceable man , ye ai n't got no right to do this to me  --  git off me  --  git off  --  I say  --  hey , leave go my halter ! SOLDIERS Well , ai n't this nice , boys . He 's brought along a rope for us to tie him up with , now ai n't that thoughtful  --  here  --  leave go the rope . HONEYMAN Let me up  --  do n't ye tie me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stray cow ! CORPORAL Stray cow , eh ? Well , we was huntin ' a stray coward ! ( laughter ) Here give me that whip ! SOLDIER Here ye are , Corporal ! Well boys , take a look at him  --  this here 's Honeyman the Tory . ( all comment ) CORPORAL All right , throw him into the boat ! General Washington 'll be right pleased to see ye , Mister Honeyman ! Come along  --  oh , ye wo n't go , eh  --  well , fetch him , boys . HONEYMAN Leave me be ! Stop it ! The King 's men 'll make ye pay fer this . ALL Hey shut up  --  grab him Tom  --  stop that kickin ' , fetch him along . ( etc . ) ANNOUNCER Protesting and struggling , Honeyman was thrown into the boat and carried to the Pennsylvania shore of the Delaware . In the meantime , on that very afternoon of December 22 , 1776 , Washington was holding a council of war with his staff . WASHINGTON Gentlemen , I regret to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? Fled ? Left Philadelphia ? Too bad ! ( etc . ) WASHINGTON I 'm sorry ! I asked them particularly to stay there , as I feared the effect on the people of the country . But it seems that even Congress has lost faith in the army . KNOX General Washington . WASHINGTON General Knox . KNOX We 've got to do something to re-establish their faith ! ( all agree ) WASHINGTON Yes ! But what ? Charles Lee is captured  --  his army gone  --  we ca n't look for any help from that quarter . KNOX Sir , ca n't we go back across the river , suddenly  --  and strike a blow before the enemy knows what we are up to ? WASHINGTON We 'll have to ! It 's our only hope . But how , when , and where ? I had hoped that we might get information that would guide us in our plans . Well , we have n't got it ! Now , much as I hate to make any move without full and complete information , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river will be frozen over in a week or ten days . That means that the enemy can cross over and chase us whither they please ! If we are to do anything , we 've got to do it now ! I 've called you here to lay this before you . Will you follow me on a blind chance ? ALL Yes ! We will ! You can count on us , sir . ( etc . ) WASHINGTON I want you all to realize that this is a desperate chance . Failure means  --  well , we might as well face it  --  it means the end of our cause ; but success  --  well , gentlemen , we can only hope and pray for success ! ( knock ) Will you see who 's at the door , Colonel Reed ? REED Yes , sir . WASHINGTON Tell whoever it is to come back later  --  I 'm in council . REED Yes , sir . ( a mumble at the door ) I beg pardon , sir , they 've just brought in a prisoner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say , sir , it 's Honeyman the Tory , and you left orders  --  WASHINGTON Honeyman ? Excellent ! Gentlemen , I must ask you to leave me . ALL Yes sir , General , of course . ( etc . ) WASHINGTON You may hold yourselves in readiness for action . I 'll issue the orders shortly . ALL ( going ) Yes , sir . Very good , sir . ( etc . ) WASHINGTON Bring the prisoner in , Colonel Reed . REED ( off ) Yes , sir . Bring him in , men . VOICES ( coming in ) Here you are  --  come along . ( etc . ) CORPORAL Here he is , General , that Tory you wanted , sir . WASHINGTON Very good , men . You may go . CORPORAL Can you handle him safe , sir ? WASHINGTON He seems to be well bound . I think I 'll have no trouble . CORPORAL Yes , sir . Very good , sir . Come on , men . We 'll wait outside , sir . WASHINGTON ( loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , eh ? HONEYMAN ( loud ) I demand to be set free . Ye 'll all answer to yer King fer this . ( door shuts ) WASHINGTON ( low ) What news ? HONEYMAN Across the river in Trenton there ai n't but a thousand Hessians . WASHINGTON Who 's commanding ? HONEYMAN Colonel Rall , and he ai n't none too keerful  --  no patrols up er down the river  --  nobody at all north of him , and six miles to the nearest post on the south of him . WASHINGTON Excellent  --  excellent ! We can do it ! I 'll order the attack tomorrow night ! We 'll trap them ! We 'll fight for once instead of retreat  --  we 'll  --  HONEYMAN Beggin ' yer pardon , sir . WASHINGTON Well ? HONEYMAN If yer figgerin ' on attackin ' , the time is Christmas night !

WASHINGTON Ragamuffins ? Yes , they are , poor fellows , but Honeyman , we 'll see  --  perhaps ragamuffins can fight when they 're given the chance  --  and with this information , you have given us our chance ! HONEYMAN Wal ' , sir , I thought ye 'd like to know . WASHINGTON Now , shall I turn you lose , Honeyman ? HONEYMAN No , General , I figger ye 'd better treat me like a prisoner er I ca n't be any more use to ye . WASHINGTON True , very well then . I 'll have you put in the guardhouse and contrive to have you escape . HONEYMAN Yes , sir . WASHINGTON ( calling ) Oh , Orderly ! VOICE ( off ) Yes , sir . WASHINGTON Tell the Corporal who 's waiting out there to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir  --  Corporal , come take charge of your prisoner . CORPORAL ( off , coming in ) Come on , men ! Fall in around the prisoner  --  and look sharp that he does n't try anything  --  forward march ! ( sound of feet receding ) WASHINGTON ( to himself ) Christmas night ! Trenton  --  God be with us ! ANNOUNCER That night , by some unexplained accident , John Honeyman escaped from the guardhouse and returned to the British lines , where he continued his valuable service for the American cause . Washington , with the information that Honeyman had brought him , was able to lay his plans intelligently and carefully . Just after dusk has fallen on Christmas night , Washington orders his troops to the shore of the river . Snow is falling and the wind is howling , as Washington and Knox stand together near the boat landing  --  ( wind and murmur of crowd with occasional sharp commands in background through this scene . ) WASHINGTON This weather ought to help us , Knox . KNOX Brrr  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you mean , General . WASHINGTON The snow will cover our movements . KNOX Yes  --  in more ways than one , General .

WASHINGTON No , a company of foot soldiers first to stand guard and protect the landing . KNOX Yes , sir . ( calling ) General Green ! VOICE ( off ) Yes , sir . KNOX Send one of your companies across first to stand guard and protect the landing . VOICE Very good , sir . Company A , into the boats ! ( orders and mob confusion ) KNOX The river looks bad , sir . See all the ice ? It looks wicked ! WASHINGTON Ice ! Hm  --  I had n't foreseen this . VOICE ( calling ) General Knox ! KNOX What is it ? VOICE The boatmen say they ca n't make it , sir . WASHINGTON Ca n't make it ? But they 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  WASHINGTON Call Colonel Glover , Knox ! KNOX ( calling ) Glover ! Colonel Glover ! Pass the word for Colonel Glover . ( order repeated several times at different distances ) WASHINGTON We 've got to get across , Knox , we 've got to ! If this attempt fails , there 's nothing left for us ! Nothing ! KNOX We 'll get across , sir , if we have to swim . GLOVER ( coming in ) Colonel Glover reports , sir . WASHINGTON Colonel Glover , can your regiment of seafaring men handle our boats in that river ? GLOVER General Washington , my men can handle boats in any water ! WASHINGTON The boatmen say they ca n't cross because of the floating ice . GLOVER Sir , my men are sea sailors , not river boatmen  --  it takes more than ice to scare them off ! WASHINGTON Good ! Put some of them in every boat . GLOVER Yes , sir . WASHINGTON And you will take general charge of the entire fleet . GLOVER Very good , sir . WASHINGTON Tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one whose voice can be heard in this storm ! GLOVER Very good , sir ! ( going out ) This way , the Marblehead regiment ! This way to the boats ! ( mob ) ANNOUNCER For the next nine hours the difficult work of crossing the ice-filled river went forward . Colonel Glover and his regiment of seafaring men from Marblehead , Massachusetts , performed almost miraculous service in landing every man , horse , and gun without losing anything ! It was five o'clock in the morning of December 26 when Washington , now on the Jersey shore of the river , turned to Knox  --  ( wind and crowd noise ) WASHINGTON Has the last boatload landed , Knox ? KNOX Yes , sir . WASHINGTON Call the men to attention . KNOX ( calling ) Call your men to attention ! VOICES Company  --  company ! ( etc . ) Attention ! First regiment is formed , sir , second  --  ( etc . ) KNOX The men are formed , sir . WASHINGTON Men , we are about to start upon our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning depends the outcome of our struggle for liberty and independence . I shall take the first brigade and half the artillery with me down the Pennington road . The rest of the detachment under command of General Green will take the river road . It should take us about four hours to reach the outposts of Trenton . Now , it is necessary for us to attack simultaneously , so will the officers all set their watches with mine . It is now just five o'clock and ten minutes . At nine o'clock , attack ! Let every man march quietly , keep in good order in the ranks , give prompt obedience to his officers , and bear in mind the watchword  --  Victory or Death ! March your men off ! VOICES First Regiment  --  Second Regiment  --  Company  --  Company  --  ( etc . ) ANNOUNCER Thus , on that cold and stormy December morning , the half frozen , desperate band of ragamuffin soldiers started its march toward Trenton  --  toward its last forlorn hope . Washington prayed that he might catch the garrison of Hessians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken so long to effect the crossing of the ice-filled river that he could not surprise the enemy ! As a matter of fact , warning was sent to Colonel Rall , but that officer , secure in his belief that no effective force of Colonial soldiers could be sent against him , paid no attention to the warning . It was nearly nine o'clock when the Corporal of the advance guard of Washington 's detachment hurried back to report to the General . CORPORAL General Washington , we 've sighted the enemy outpost . WASHINGTON Good ! Halt the brigade , Knox . KNOX Brigade ! VOICES Company  --  company ! ( etc . ) KNOX Halt ! WASHINGTON It lacks five minutes of the time set ! Oh , Corporal  --  CORPORAL Yes , sir ? WASHINGTON Did you see any sign of General Green 's command on the river road ? CORPORAL We saw ' em a half hour ago , sir , as we came over that hill back there . WASHINGTON Were they abreast of us ? CORPORAL Yes , sir , a little ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KNOX Yes , sir . WASHINGTON This storm has likely ruined the flintlocks . KNOX No doubt of that , sir  --  we 'll have to use bayonets . WASHINGTON Order bayonets fixed , and the troops deployed ready to charge bayonets on command . KNOX Brigade , fix bayonets ! ( voices repeat order , etc . ) Shall the artillery lead or follow , sir ? WASHINGTON Follow and take position at the head of every street . KNOX Very good , sir . WASHINGTON Hm  --  two minutes  --  order the troops deployed . KNOX Deploy your troops  --  prepare to charge bayonets ! ( command repeated  --  mob noise as order is obeyed ) WASHINGTON Keep your ears open for firing  --  it 's nearly time . ( musketry ) KNOX There it is , sir ! WASHINGTON Green has started ! Order the charge , Knox ! And God be with us ! KNOX Forward ! Charge bayonets ! Ho ! ( a great roar from the mob as the charge begins ) ANNOUNCER So Washington and his men swept into the village of Trenton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half it was all over . The disposed army of ragamuffins put the Hessians to rout ! It was the first great American victory of the Revolution , and its effect was enormous . The discouraged Colonists suddenly received new heart . Hope for the cause of independence had a rebirth , and Washington , instead of fighting a losing battle alone , found himself the leader of his countrymen in fact , as well as in name ! In crossing the Delaware , Washington had saved the cause of American independence
