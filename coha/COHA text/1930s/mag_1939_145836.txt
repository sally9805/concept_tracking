On the snowy hillocks of New England , profitably instructing the ski-minded East , ride many of the finest skimeister the Alps have produced . But their hearts are as heavy as their purses ; they pine for the lofty Alps . <P> For most Alpiners , the Rocky Mountains would be more homelike , but the big money still lies on the low slopes of the East . Skiing , however , is perking up in the West . Last weekend , at Government-built Timberline Lodge on Oregon 's 11,253-ft . Mt . Hood . 5,000 spectators watched more than 100 top-flight skiers from the U. S. , Canada and Europe compete in the season 's most important ski competition , the National Championships . From the winners would be picked the U. S. slalom and downhill teams of five men and five women to be sent to the world championships* in Norway next year . <P> They saw two U. S. youngsters beat the whizzing foreign skiers at their own game . Dartmouth 's great Dick Durrance sped down the two-and-a-half-mile Mt . Hood downhill course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced twice around the wicked slalom turns in the Ski Bowl on neighboring Tom , Dick and Harry Mountain in 2:44.6 for the best combined score of all , open or amateur . By far the best of the women in the combined score was graceful , 26-year-old Betty Woolsey of Connecticut , captain of the women 's team . <P> <P> *Not the Olympics . Because the U. S. does not agree that European skiing instructors are amateurs , there will be no Olympic ski competition in 1940.
