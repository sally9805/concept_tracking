( See Cover ) <P> In drowsy , cupolaed courthouses , behind the flyspecked fronts of general stores , in thousands of voting booths in a belt stretching through 19 States of the South and West and jumping over the Pacific to Hawaii , Election Day dawned last week . The voters were the nation 's growers of cotton , rice , and flue-cured tobacco , 2,500,000 strong . They were asked to give a straight Yes or No on the strictest controls possible under the Agricultural Adjustment Act : The imposition of prohibitive taxes on any producer who markets more than a fixed crop quota in 1939 . To the question of how the farmers of the U. S. feel about the most ambitious farm program ever undertaken on their behalf , the Election might spell out a huge Yes , No , or Maybe . <P> When day was done , it had spelled out a Maybe . Secretary of Agriculture Henry Agard Wallace called the outcome " a clear cut example of economic democracy . " Of cotton farmers 82% voted their confidence in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , when neither the U. S. surplus had piled up to the 10,000,000 bales , nor the world supply to the 51,000,000 bales reached last week . Only 56% of the tobacco farmers said Yes , less than the two-thirds necessary to invoke the quota , far less than the 86% who shouted Yes last spring . And rice farmers , whose reserves did not reach the 11,974,000 bushels quota level for this year , made their first vote a hearty 64% No . <P> Concretely , the election changed the farm picture only for flue-cured tobacco. * By voting No , tobaccomen rejected Secretary Wallace 's offer to fix a rigid quota for each seller , levy a penalty of one half the market price for excess sales . By voting No , they also ruled out loans on whatever portion of their 1939 crop they may keep off the market . Unaffected by the Election was the " voluntary " half of the farm program-acreage restriction which growers of all three crops make in return for soil conservation payments and other cash benefits . <P> For the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not mean opposition to the whole farm program , but merely that farmers are not feeling bad enough just now to be willing to take castor oil . But one thing it did not mean was the wholehearted vote of confidence AAA was looking for , and that last week it needed as never before . <P> The Farm Problem has been a major political issue for 20 years . For the last six Congress has followed the gyrations of farm income more closely than the Supreme Court is supposed to follow the election returns . <P> In 1932 , with farm income at $4,328,000,000 , a post-War low , Herbert Hoover lost every State in the Farm Belt . <P> In 1933 , AAA handed out its first big farm subsidy , $162,000,000 in benefit payments : to plow under 10,500,000 acres of cotton , kill 222,149 brood sows , 6,188,717 little pigs . Farm income rose to $5,117,000,000 . <P> In 1934 , Congress extended benefits to more crops , farm subsidies rose to $556,000,000 , farm income to $6,348,000,000 . <P> In 1935 , the program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
