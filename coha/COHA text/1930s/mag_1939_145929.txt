Wheat-Belt Messiah <P> Alma Swensson was the prim , capable wife of a Lutheran schoolman in the little Swedish-American town of Lindsborg , Kans. ( pop . 2,004 ) . Alma Swensson loved Handel 's oratorio , The Messiah , decided that her Swedish neighbors should hear it too . So she sent for the music , gathered a chorus of young people from the surrounding towns and farms , rehearsed them and let the welkin ring . That was in 1882 . <P> Mrs. Swensson 's sacred musical was such a success that it went on tour , in lumber wagons along dusty Kansas roads , to the neighboring towns of Salemsburg , Salina and New Gottland . Next year they did it again . The chorus grew , acquired a permanent orchestra and conductor , hired famous soloists like Lillian Nordica , Ernestine Schumann-Heink , Olive Fremstad . Lindsborg 's annual Messiah became the biggest musical event in Kansas . <P> Last week Lindsborg 's chorus sang its 168th Messiah . Visitors from as far away as Mexico swelled the little Kansas town to two-and-a-half times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bach 's surging , intricate St. Matthew Passion . Twice a week for many weeks , the husky , hard-handed choristers had rehearsed with religious earnestness . Some drove from farms 50 miles away . Imported soloists from the East marveled at the sober fervor with which they chanted the complicated scores . <P> No fashion-plate maestro guided them , but a lean , timid , white-bearded , 61-year-old Swedish music teacher named Dr. Hagbard Brase . Dr. Brase , who has brought up a strapping Swedish-American family of five on a modest salary as professor of music at Lindsborg 's Bethany College , has led all of Lindsborg 's Messiahs since 1915 . A simple , religious man , whose hobby is gardening , Dr. Brase sleeps little spends his nights mostly poring over scores by Bach and Handel . Says he : " There will never be time enough in this world or the next to plumb the depths of the great masterpieces they have given us. "
