Nowadays the Creole stories of gentle George Washington Cable seem amiable but shrewd , are taken as patent proof that Cable loved his native New Orleans .

Southern literary tempers are not quite so testy now , but they still have a big pinch of gunpowder in them . Latest Southerner to get scorched is 35-year-old Ben Robertson of Clemson , S. C. ( pop . 420 ) , whose novel about his ancestors brought on himself the wrath of old settlers , neighbors and the D. A. R. <P> A descendant of Daniel Boone , a newspaperman who has worked in Honolulu , New York , the Dutch East Indies , Author Robertson called his family chronicle Travelers ' Rest . When Northern firms turned it down he organized the Cottonfield Publishers with two friends , brought out the book at a cost equal to the price of " 19 bales of eight-cent cotton . " An honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of an old Southern family through their fights with nature , the neighbors , and each other , shows old pioneers with their buckskins off and their coonskin caps hanging from the wrong hatracks , wenching , gambling , stealing , murdering . What bothered old settlers was that Author Robertson attributed these activities to prominent people readily identified as his ancestors-Indian scouts , Senators , wealthy planters . Civil War heroes . When neighbors complained , " You 've really slung mud over us all , " when a regent of the State D. A. R. jumped to the attack , the Robertson family called a reunion at nearby Chauga Creek , and with clan spirit outweighing pride in their distinguished ancestors , defended the book and outspoken Descendant Ben .
