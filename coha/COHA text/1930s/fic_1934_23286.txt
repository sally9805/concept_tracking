THE SANCTUARY OF THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE A STORY BY GEORGE WELLER T THE front end of the varnished yellow car , third class , of the Antwerp-Brussels train , Marple swayed above his luggage . He was deferential to his suitcases . All he possessed in the world was in them ; they were in a sense his woman , for he put all he acquired into them , he took them about wherever he went , and he carried them himself . In his blue cheviot shirt and blue tie he was a tall bachelor 's button , head slightly bent over his neatly piled baggage as though ready to catch its words if it should make some little murmur of protest . " The heat , " it might complain up to him : then he would bend a trifle lower and admit , " Yes , it is hot . " In electric quiet the train swam through the level countryside , breathing with little sidewise clicks that seemed to come up out of the hot green hushes along the track . He lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , reminding himself that this was the Antwerp-Brussels stretch . It was not the Padua-Venice stretch , although he found himself peering for St. Mark 's campanile to come poking up out of the fiat green horizon like a burnt match someone has sharpened . Marple was glad his own country was not like that , all full of cities just so far apart . He was proud of his unbalanced country , Ohio and New York State crowded with cities , and yet between Needles in California and the eastern end of the Navajo reservation nobody able to drive a car from north to south . To hell with Italy and her long tunnels , making it just a subway ride from Bologna to Florence . He had a country where they could n't even find the airplanes after they fell . He had a country where nobody ever sees the accident , not like Europe with its stretcher bearers always hanging round . But in himself he was a lot less than his country . He was only an American with a job teaching school in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict about proselytism nowadays . Besides , we have been quietly doing our best out there to get away from the missionary spirit of just after the War . The Turks never really liked us for it , and now , of course , with the Ghazi and everything , we have to be careful . " He liked their mystification over " the Ghazi " so much that he never said " Mustafa Kemal " any more . And Marple was not a missionary . He was just a fellow three years out of college who happened to be lucky enough  --  yes , lucky enough  --  to get a job teaching . He was not an expatriate . It just happened that he was lucky enough  --  yes , I said lucky enough  --  to get this job of mine reach-ing in an American school in Europe . Yes , teaching English to Turks . And if you do n't like it , you know what you can do . You or anyone else twenty-five years old that thinks he can get a much better job than mine these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What you doing riding on my train , Mr. Marple ? " It was the young Nazi from Chicago , the one who had made such a point of being polite to the Jews on the ship . He was about Marple 's age , but already he had a bakery of his own in Chicago . He was going back to spend the summer with his people in Karlsruhe . They shook hands . It was about two hours since they had said farewell forever at the Antwerp gangplank , a farewell that was generous because it promised to be everlasting . " If you should ever be going through Karlsruhe , Mr. Marple " . . . " I do n't suppose you ever get down as far as Constant ' in the summer . .. " No , I have to get right back to my bakery in Chicago . " Their handshakes dropped away , Marple wondering how long it would take for a boatload of people to get well mixed in a continent , raisins sprinkling down through Antwerp into the heaving , pasty dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with him , a girl also from the ship . She was a slim tall girl with brown hair and a steady flush on her cheekbones , a flush too bright for beauty . She had long light hands ; he saw them again , arranging her steamer blanket when it slipped . Though they had never spoken to each other , they had smiled regularly when passing on the deck . He had read her smile as meaning : " Here I am off for Europe , the strange countries I have read about and never seen , the languages I have n't heard , is n't it secret and wonderful ? " And he had smiled back at her to say that it was , and nodded wisely at her to mean that she would love it all , not only Paris and London and some single place more , but all of it , and that it would put a tall elixir in her . Now they smiled at each other again . But the boat-smile seemed meaningless , off the boat . It was too seamanlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of marine glasses , though knowing perfectly well that there were no porpoises to be laughed at , along this dry green track , " Where are you going ? " he asked seriously . " Mannheim , " she answered . " And where else ? " He was experimenting with a new gravity-of-theland , reminding her that they were now back on land , with all its responsibilities . Obediently she grew gave also . " Nowhere else . Just Mannheim , " she said . Bored , the young Nazi nodded to them as though they belonged to him and the steamship line forever , and went away down the aisle , seeming always to seek a Jewish face to pose anew the problem of how he should conduct himself . The minute he had gone there was real reason for being grave at going to Mannheim . Why ? It darkened her face and she wrung her glove off her hand and felt in her bag for her mirror . What was it ? Marple found that she was standing closer to him than she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a moment before he had been talking across to her . Now she was nearer him . Now she was looking rather up at him than across , and a silence lay between them . In the silence he took note of her hair . It was dark brown and bobbed and she was wearing it lifted back over her ears , the third time she had changed her mind about it since he had first seen her on the boat . What else was she uncertain about that her so uncertain how to fix her hair ? Then he observed that she was looking at him in her mirror . She turned him up a guilty halfsmi le . Hastily he said , " Sit down here on my baggage , if you do n't mind the discomfort . " They sat down together . After a little he said , " Mannheim . I never was in Mannheim in my life . " " No-o-o ? " she said surprisedly . But she was not very much surprised . Why do n't you make a visit there this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Marple heard them . And hearing these words in the air , he compared them with others of hers , listened to the echoes of her past words and examining them , found that she had an accent . She was not an American . She was a Mannheimerin , a Rhein-made ' . It was the touch of French in her that made him fail to notice it before , that brought her nearer to being an American . When the new estimate had overlaid the old he said , growing more American himself as he did so , " But you speak English so perfectly . You certainly are n't one of the German dollar-tourists . You 've spent a lot more than five days in New York , " he ran on with hollow sagacity . The locomotive heard him and lifted a long derisive hoot . " I 've been nearly five years in New York , " she responded . There was a roar growing in the distance . " I was a . . . " ( a train passed deafeningly , darkening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finished . A governess probably . Our German governess . Someone in New York was saying that the German governess we have for the children has gone back to her people in Germanyfor the summer . We let her go back because she has n't seen her people in GerMany for almost five years . Hastily he began to heap her with similarities to himself , comfortable ones that would help to get round her being , though beautiful , a governess in a New York family . He talked German to her . They would both be changing at Brussels for Cologne . Then they would both have a couple of hours waitover in Cologne for the train down to Mannheim and the train across to Berlin . So they would have to be saying good-by in Cologne , it seemed . But there would be time to visit the cathedral . Had she ever been there ? Yes . Never mind , she could go again with him . The sanctuary was said to be particularly beautiful . Then they would have tea together . He finished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found in himself a strange little sting of regret . Fresh though he was from the liner 's forty meaningless farewells , he was wincing already at having to say good-by in Cologne to this woman . He observed that farewell coming nearer . There was no salving hypocrisy about it . In Cologne they would have been knitted up by the meaningful face of the land , not like the blank blue horizon of the sea that , never having known presence , can not count absence a loss . With the cathedral towering over them like two gray , gothicized shells in a gunclip , he asked an elderly man , " Wie koramt man zum Telegraphenarnt , bitte schOn ? " " Zum Telegraphenamt ? " brightly replied the man , who had apparently waited a lifetime of afternoons in front of the cathedral at Cologne for just that question . " Bitte , gehen Sie nur rechts vorne . . . . " She had wondered aloud whether she ought to telegraph her family that she was coming . He thought it advisable : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train until morning , and they might be worried about her . She thought they would not be worried . " Let me telegraph a little later , " she said to him . But she pleaded so sweetly that it was like an invitation to overrule her . And now that she had given him control of her in her own language , he led the way in everything , saw that she had her Belgian francs changed into marks at the best rate , found nut what time her train would be in Mannheim , and asked the man in the Telegrammangabe when the telegram would be delivered to her family . ( " It will reach the Mannheim office in 27 to 31 minutes and be delivered immediately . " ) She watched the man stuffing the telegram into its tube , until he took her arm , saying , " Now we have the rest of our time to ourselves . " They had not tasted food since breakfast aboard the ship , but there was a risk that they might miss seeing the cathedral . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead necktie and a motherly smile , was blocking the single little wooden door that was still open . Frequently he stepped aside to let people go out , but blocked everyone who tried to enter . Impartially , with mounting pleasure in his office , lie turned away those who had piety in their faces or money in their hands . Put yourself in my place , he counselled them gently . If I let in you and you I must also allow you and you to enter . Nicht water ? The people began to turn away . Heartily he bellowed a sexton 's benediction after them : And if I let you all in , then where should I be , can you tell me that ? Dipped in logic although not bathed in grace , the visitors wandered down the stone stairs . rest of their lives . I hope the United States did n't make me like that . " He poured wine for her , but she did not touch it . " Of course you were in an American home , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call working on your feet fourteen hours a day American home life ? " she demanded . She pushed the wine away . Absently she murmured , " My brother wanted to come to Antwerp to meet me . But then I should have had to pay him his expenses . " Suddenly she caught his chin and turned his face round to her . " I do n't think you even heard me when I said what my work was . I 'm a cook . You know that , do n't you ? " " Of course I do , " he said . He caught his arm relaxing and held her instantly tighter . He thought he saw a shadow like pleasure cross her face ; the guilt of it was his . Words poured down his polite brain chute . " But you were able to get away for the summer to go home to Mannheim ? " ( Hell , man , how many times does she have to say it for you ? ) " I had to give her my notice , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . She was not a woman who had been kissed often . Her eyelashes were wide and alert . " Then you wo n't be going back to the same people ? " He wanted to get them out of the way ; he half feared , half wildly hoped that he knew them . " I do n't know . Perhaps I 'll decide to . " " But you will be going back to the States ? " She hesitated . " Maybe I shall . " " And now you will stay all summer in Mannheim ? " She paused longer , and her eyes flicked wearily downward . " Yes . " " With your family ? " She looked at him without a word , waiting , and at last he kissed hei . Her mouth trembled under his , as though she were trying to cry out . She held him off a moment to ask in a quick high voice , " Would n't you think there was something wrong with a girl who has been more than four years away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to diem ? " " No , " he said . " Not at all . " She closed her eyes . Anger came to him from nowhere . Demanding its passport , he found that it had come from the purposelessness of his earning money and from her weariness at being a cook . " I ca n't go to Mannheim , " he said . He wanted to cut off any white shoot of her hope close to the ground . " This thing in Turkey is all the job I have and that 's where I have to go . " He saw her face tighten but he could not stop . " My leave in America is over and now I have to go back for the summer session . Teaching is on the make in Turkey . " " And just now I am beginning my vacation , " she said . " For the first time in nearly five years I can do whatever I want and I do n't have to earn money for awhile . " He learned from the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were quiet , each rejecting in the mind the eight days of crossing the Atlantic , damning them as unregrettable because they were now lost . He perceived that she was like him . Knowing that if this were so , she must have suffered often , he desired to protect her . " Why is it that you love me ? " he asked , taking her hand . " Because you hold your head high when you walk , " she answered promptly . She seemed glad to be rid of it , having had it on her mind so long ; it was a relief to have been asked . Then she found she had forgotten an ingredient and added , " And because your face looks as though you were strict . " Ifer face cleared . She began cutting the last sandwich in halves . He kissed her , saying to himself , What shall I do ? How can I keep her undisappointed ? A night together was no solution . This was love to her . A marriage does not always satisfy love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in for awhile . It is hard enough to perceive the end of love in death , without having to plan a way to end it in life . From her eyes he knew another thing : if he slept beside her he would begin to love her . That would be another beginning , another death to be planned ahead . For she was like himself . She was seeming more like himself every minute he was near her . Already they had grown somewhat older together . He desired her , but that mattered less than this underlying similarity of her to him . The danger in an explosion of desire was nothing to that in an explosion of recognition . For a full second be realized that they could be parts of one whole . It was given to him , the male part , the part in motion , to decide whether they should become one . He had only to beckon . She would go to Turkey or anywhere else with him . It was easy enough for her . She was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have any decisions to make . The words came to him : And her lover saluted her with a kiss at parting . He put them away , rejecting the omen . " I have decided nothing yet , " he said . The words waited , undismissed . " The trouble with both of m is that we work too hard , " she said , taking her half of the sandwich and looking at it . " We do n't think what we shall be able to do with the money once weget it . We just say : get it . Work overtime , let your hair get all dried at the roots over a hot stove , never mind . Just keep saying to yourself : I can take it , I 'm a girl than can take it . Keep putting your pay in the bank every week or keep sending a money order home all the time . I can take it , say . Then some day you find like me you sent the money to Germany to keep it safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth only half because the dollar went down . Why work and get old for money , when there is so many ways of having your money taken away from you ? " He stared out the window . A baker 's boy on a bicycle pumped past , his handle-bar basket full of supper rolls . " It is foolish , " she said . " Nothing could be more foolish than working like that , with no one loving you in New York or even in Mannheim . What time is it ? " " Five minutes of six . " " And when did you find my train was ? " " Ten minutes of seven . " " That means we have to go now , to get our suitcases out of the Aufbewahrung . " " We can stay a little longer , " he said . " Not long . " She looked at herself in the mirror , found him in it , and addressed him directly there . " You know what else I thought about you ? I thought you were bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , gefahrlich . Dangerous . I thought you were a bad man . " She put her hair in order . He noticed that her fingers were weak . " You 're not bad , though , are you , Marple ? " He remembered that Marple , the last name used alone , was not so chilling in German as it was in English , then he forgot it again . She was accusing him . He grew angry with her . She had perfected her Anglo-Saxon woman 's trick of accusing men in the States , where men had for a long time been guilty of whatever law or woman accused them . " I ca n't take you with me , if that 's what . you mean , " he said . " I have n't the money . " He hated her for forcing him to say it , and he thought : Do n't be so proud . You let yourself be fooled by your American job too , for all your European knowledge . Probably somewhere you let love slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can all be made up just like that , on the way from New York to Mannheim . You think you can arrive home just as unused as you went away , and with several dollars to the good . Well , you ca n't . You 've been tricked too , just like everyone else who is young now . We 've all been tricked together , and it 's too late , and it never will be made up to us , never , " But now that I know you , " she said , " I find that I love you more than I did . " Again she was looking from one to the other of his eyes . " I have learned something from you . You seem a lot more sensible to me than if you were a man that was bad with women . I think I shall remember you better . " Somewhere the quarter hour lackadaisically was chimed . She put her hat on , not very carefully , and she stood up , instantly resting her hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew her toward him . She gave him her whole weight . He buried his face against one breast , saying , " I do n't know whether you will ever think anything of me , but please do n't think I am letting you go because I should n't know how to keep you . " " Oh , I know that , " she said . " I know you would know how to do that . " He felt her hands in his hair . " 1 mean , " he said , " with my having to go all the way down there , and you having at least to go to Mannheim now . . . I mean , we both know a night would n't be enough for us either . " " Are you going to see me to my train ? " she said . There were no taxis ; they would have to walk fast . With surprise they discovered the wine in their legs , confessed it to each other , each charging himself with irresponsibility . Four Storm Troopers stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas-pipe railing of a little park . She jumped merrily down and caught herself on his arm , glancing archly at the Storm Troopers , then up into his face . " Schau ' doch , " she whispered , " I do n't want you to feel sad . There is nothing to be sad about . We are doing this thing the best way . Do n't you agree with me ? " He nodded . " All right then . Do n't you dare be downcast . " There was no sense of finality about getting the suitcases out of the checkroom , the platform inspector in brilliant German railroad blue calling her gnitdige Frau , his asking her whether she had enough marks to get something more substantial to eat about eight o'clock , where she had put her ticket , whether the telegram was certain to have been delivered , how far it was to the house , whether she was hungry again yet  --  it seemed he could not stop asking such questions . He had never known they existed in him . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class was so full . When he saw her sitting on her baggage just as though it were still Antwerp-Cologne , he suddenly wished he had prevented her from going . She was going to be uncomfortable on the way to Mannheim . " Abfahrtr " Einsteigenr Swiftly he did for the last time the subtraction sum : Mannheim-family minus Cologne-Marple . The differ . ence was heavy . She had to go . As if in agreement with him , the bright blue inspector drew his heels together and held the baton with the green and white disk on the end above his broad red cap . A whistle piped . He was moving with her , on the train for Mannheim . He kissed her and leaped down . He felt her mouth still under his as he turned to face the window that was moving out of the station . Waving , he moved sidewise across the platformto the edge of the opposite railpit . He watched her face until the angle of the window closed it away from him , and he was watched by her until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have another look at the cathedral . The doors were still shut . They would not be open until morning , when he would be in Berlin . Coolly he looked up at the carvings of the tympanum , the mustered saints . But inwardly he was puzzled . He could not understand why it seemed to him that he was wearing on his body all the love the woman from Mannheim could give anyone .
