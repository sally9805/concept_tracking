Dec. 25 was nearly half a year away , but last week AAAdministrator Chester C. Davis told U. S. wheat farmers just how good they would have to be if Santa Claus was going to keep on visiting them : <P> 1 ) They must sign contracts promising to plant wheat acreage for the next four years of any size that AAA may fix within a range of 75% to 100% of their 1930-32 average . <P> 2 ) Specifically , they must hold their acreage for 1936 down to not more than 85% of their 1930-32 average . <P> There was just one drawback : Mr. Davis foresees the possibility that before the end of the next four years , the U. S. Supreme Court may decide that there is no Santa Claus . In the event of such a decision adverse to AAA , he announced , <P> " The Government , in fairness and honesty , would pay , and legally would be bound to pay farmers in full for their compliance up to that time , but not beyond that time . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Armour and Swift got injunctions in Chicago forbidding the Government to collect hog processing taxes . In Virginia , P. Lorillard ( Old Golds ) and Philip Morris opened suits against tobacco processing taxes . In Detroit , Denver and Kansas City Federal judges restrained the Government 's tax collections . Processing taxes on wheat , corn , hogs , cotton , tobacco were contested . A temporary injunction against the operation of the Bankhead Cotton Act was issued in the Texas courts . All told , AAA found itself facing 705 court challenges , which meant that 705 processors were eager to maintain before the law that the Christmas gifts farmers have been getting do not come from Santa Claus , that processing " taxes " are but white whiskers to conceal the fact that one group of citizens are putting thieving hands into the pockets of another group . <P> One reason for these numerous challenges was that the NRA Supreme Court decision hinted that AAA might also be unconstitutional . Another reason was the attempt made to have the AAAmendments before Congress ( see p. 10 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes even if illegally collected . The courts , as well as the litigants , were stirred to action by the prospect that suits for recovery might be forbidden . Said U. S. <P> District Judge Merrill E. Otis in Kansas City , granting a temporary injunction to a group of millers and packers : " It is said that Congress is about to pass a law , and the President will approve it , whereunder the doors of the courts of justice will be closed to those whose money and property unlawfully have been taken . <P> " With humiliation it must be confessed that there is basis for this apprehension . . . .
