Many a child-bearing Russian housewife , already beset with a scarcity of salt , sugar , matches , soap , etc. , last week faced the prospect of didying her infant with her own platok ( kerchief ) because of an acute shortage of diapers . The Government organ Izvestia revealed that of the 1938 quota of 3,170,000 diapers , the Commissariat of Light Industry had managed to turn out only 765,900 in the first nine months of the year . To make matters worse , Izvestia somewhat puzzlingly added , " many of these failed to reach the ultimate consumer . " Presaging a " purge " of the luckless officials , the paper blamed " inefficient organization . " <P> On trial in Moscow last week , accused in the Soviet Prosecutor 's scathing phrase of " producing 2,000,000 imaginary pencils , " were the Soviet executives of the famed Sacco &; Vanzetti Pencil Factory . <P> The State bought the factory in 1930 from the famed Hammer family , U. S. small-businessmen who bought a pencil-manufacture monopoly in the Soviet Union from the State under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenin . They cleaned up huge profits making pencils for Communists to plan with , and the Stalin State finally paid the Hammers $1,000,000 for their going concern , let them take out Romanov antiques which they now sell on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue . <P> The post-Hammer Soviet management , finding its pencil-making falling each year a little further behind the Five-Year Plan , took to falsifying the Sacco &; Vanzetti Pencil production figures , are now being tried for their group-crime.
