Enclosed in the 40-by-120-yard transept of Dartmouth College 's vast , cruciform gymnasium at Hanover , N. H. lies the fastest foot-racing track in the world . It was laid seven years ago on the college 's 30-year-old indoor cinder track so that Dartmouth boys competing in big indoor meets could accustom themselves to board tracks . But in building it , Dartmouth 's Buildings Superintendent Willard Gooding made a few constructive errors . <P> He selected solid spruce planking one and one-half inches thick instead of the one-inch boards ordinarily used in track building . On a framework of two-by-fours he conventionally laid the planks lengthwise along the straightaways , but set them unconventionally across the course at the turns . He banked the turns at a 30 angle instead of the ordinary 20 . <P> To Dartmouth 's grey , veteran Track Coach Harry Hillman , onetime Olympic runner , the result has since been more headache than help . Year after year on the springy spruce track , his athletes stepped off more remarkable times in practice , were beaten in unremarkable time in competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much faster Dartmouth 's track was than those in other sports arenas , he invited the great Glenn Cunningham to race over it . No official world record could be hung up , because the International Amateur Athletic Federation recognizes only outdoor performances . Cunningham amazed everybody with a 4:04.4 mile , the fastest ever run by man , two seconds under British Sydney Charles Wooderson 's world record . Unsure of the track , Cunningham ran his second quarter in a slow 64 seconds ; later he figured he could have run the distance safely two seconds faster . <P> <P> Cunningham 's feat encouraged Dartmouth to try again . Last week the middle-distance flash of the season , Negro Portrait Painter &; Student John Borican of Columbia University , who week before had jumped the gun to beat Glenn Cunningham in Manhattan in the fastest 1,000 yards ever run , went to Dartmouth to see how fast he could run 800 meters and the half-mile ( 880 yards ) . Spaced out to pace him were four Dartmouth runners with handicaps of from 10 to 95 yards . Careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not before . He turned off the quarter in a sweet 52.4 , overhauled the pacers one by one , raced on to break the 800-meter tape in 1:49.2 , the half-mile tape 5.1 yards farther on in 1:49.8 . <P> This time clipped 1.6 seconds off the great Lloyd Hahn 's indoor half-mile record of 1 : 51.4 set in 1928 , but Borican was dissatisfied . Said he : " I think I could have taken two seconds off my time tonight if I had . . . someone in front of me on the last lap . " <P> Two seconds off his time would have bettered every 800-meter and 880-yard mark in the books . The official 800-meter world record of 1:49.6 is held by Elroy Robinson , but is about to be replaced by Sydney Wooderson 's 1:48.4 of last summer. * For the half mile , Wooderson 's 1:49.2 is the pending record . <P> Wooderson is a frail-looking London solicitor whom the British fondly call " Leather Legs . " Main chance U. S. runners have at his three world records is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Cunningham , Ben Eastman and New Zealand 's Jack Lovelock all set previous world records . <P>
