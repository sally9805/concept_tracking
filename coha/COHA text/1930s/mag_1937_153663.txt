The Irish Republican Army , Ireland 's most fanatical antiRoyalist group , have long been a headache to the Government of Northern Ireland . According to Belfast 's police , they staged the burnings , beatings and bombings specially arranged for the State visit of King George &; Queen Elizabeth ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) . They were accused last week of another outrage : attacking a man 's home when his person is not available . <P> The Republicans felt that they had a specially acute grudge against the Rt . Hon. Sir Dawson Bates , 60 , Home Secretary of Northern Ireland . He had just taken charge of the police campaign to track down the extremists who did their best to reduce the royal visit to a shambles . Moreover , since 1922 he has been empowered by the Civil Authorities Act to jail indefinitely anybody suspected of sedition , has frequently exercised his privilege to the discomfort of Republicans . <P> So last week , while Sir Dawson was in Belfast , three masked raiders called at his home , Magherabuoy House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants with revolver butts , ravished his desk , scattered his papers , turned his house inside out . Police astutely concluded that they had been searching for embarrassing evidence of recent burnings , beatings , bombings-evidence on the strength of which Sir Dawson might feel inclined once more to make use of the Civil Authorities Act .
