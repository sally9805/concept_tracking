It was after midnight when Senor Dr. Don Carlos Leiva , Salvadorean charge d'affaires , returned from a friendly card game to his legation on Connecticut <P> Avenue one night last week . In the dark hallway a light was flashed into his face . He saw the glint of a revolver . " Stick ' em up ! " a hard voice ordered . Instead , Dr. Leiva , 51 and husky , fell upon the intruder , grappled for his throat . They wrestled about . The pistol fired wildly . " Pete ! Pete ! " called the stranger and up from the basement came " Pete " to join the tussle . Dr. Leiva was given a hard pate-pounding with a revolver butt . Blood blinded him . He dropped to the floor . The burglars escaped out a rear entrance . <P> Somehow the doughty diplomat staggered across the street to Achilles Orphanos ' delicatessen store where the alarm was sounded . An ambulance carried the chief representative in the U. S. of the Government of Salvador to the Emergency Hospital where 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractured skull . <P> Police investigators quickly discovered that it was diplomatic liquor the burglars were after . They had jimmied their way into the legation , almost wrecked the liquor storeroom in the basement . At the back fence , cases were stacked up for removal . Seventeen boxes of fine whiskey had already been hauled away . <P> When Secretary of State Stimson read of the assault in his morning newspaper , he immediately wrote Dr. Leiva : " I was shocked to learn of the injuries which you suffered last night and I hasten to extend to you an expression of my regret . I assure you the police will make every effort to apprehend the offenders . I trust that you will recover promptly and I want you to know that you have my deepest sympathy . " To newsmen the Secretary of State declared that it was a " very serious thing " when diplomats failed to get the protection to which their official immunity entitles them . President Hoover sent his personal physician , Dr. Joel Boone , to the hospital to see Dr. Leiva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it did not give foreign embassies and legations better protection . Its chief insisted they got the best attention the force could afford on its limited budget . <P> Meanwhile Dr. Leiva , not so badly hurt that he could not express himself freely , told newsmen : " It might have happened to anybody . But the Washington police force is the worst I have ever known . . . . One man during the fight thrust his hand into my face and I nearly bit his little finger off . " <P> Hopefully he added : " Sometimes such bites are poisonous . The police may be able to find him when he goes to a doctor , for I bit to the bone . " <P> Under international law Dr. Leiva could collect handsome damages from the U. S. Government for his injuries and the rape of his liquor storeroom . Following U. S. precedent , he might even land Salvadorean marines in Washington to safeguard Salvadorean life &; property . Good-humored , he took no action , made no claim .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
