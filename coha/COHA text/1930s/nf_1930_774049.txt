txt // used as indicating vigor and past production but has little value in predicting future production except as it indicates good health of the individual . In case of breeding hens a lack of pigment at the close of the laying year would ordinarily indicate the lateness of laying and the physical condition of the bird . Failure to recover normal pigment prior to the breeding season would indicate faulty management or a lack of recuperative power . Such a bird would be a questionable breeder in view of the fact that the vitality of a chick is measured by the physical condition of the hen at the time the egg was laid . Breeding hens lacking proper pigmentation at the beginning of the hatching season would be likely to produce chickens deficient in pigment and of low vitality . 9 . Individuality. ? It is a matter of observation that certain birds in a flock are by nature much more highly pigmented than are others . This difference is apparent in all sections of the body carrying the pigment factor . For example : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy charge of yellow pigment show this in creamy plumage and orange colored shanks and beak , creamy colored earlobes , etc. , and that birds having chalk-white plumage are likely to have lemon-colored shanks and beak . This brings us to the question of major importance to the man attempting to place a group of birds in the show ring or to cull a flock of birds on the farm . We are safe in saying that the pigment test will indicate the extremes of egg production at any time of the year . The hen with the yellow vent , eyering , earlobes , beak and shanks can always be identified as a low producer if handled during the middle of the laying year ( June to September ) . This does not necessarily mean that she should be disposed of on this evidence alone because at certain times of the year it is necessary for the bird to recuperate her vitality and body weight in preparation for the next year 's job . This means that special care must be used when these heavily pigmented birds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year when heavy laying birds should be entirely or partially bleached . Always when in doubt , other characters must be used to supplement pigmentation . CHAPTER VI MOLT AND ITS RELATION TO PRODUCTION IN order that we may understand the particular part of the plumage or part of the feather referred to when discussing the molt , a brief outline of the makeup of a single feather and the way in which the feathers are grouped together will be presented . The term " plumage " is generally used to include all the feathers of the body . The body plumage usually includes only the small , short feathers attached to the body proper and does not include the longer , more rigid feathers of the wings and tail . CONSTRUCTION OF THE FEATHER The main part or backbone of a feather is known as the stem . This stem is made up of two parts : the quill , which is cylindrical and hollow and forms the base of the feather , and the shaft , which forms the upper framework part of the feather . ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the quill is filled with blood and appears reddish-purple in color . As the feather develops further the blood disappears and is replaced by a parchment-like material known as pulp . The shaft is grooved on the underside . The upper part of the feather is usually known as the vane of the feather . The shaft , of course , forms the framework of the vane to which the barbs of the feather are attached . These barbs are slender projections from either side of the shaft and they are attached one to another on each side of the shaft by small 1 ( 1 // barbules . ( Fig. 48 . ) The barbules are at right angles to the barbs and they have minute hooklets attached to them . These hooklets hold the adjacent barbs together thus forming a rigid surface for use in flight . All of the barbs hooked together in this way by the hooklet-bearing barbules are often spoken of as the web of the feather . The stem of the feather has two small holes in it ; one at the lower end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , and the other one at the junction of the quill and shaft . This is so located that it comes at the surface of the skin where the quill emerges from the skin . This allows the entrance of outside air and it is partially covered by a small rudimentary feather or tuft of down . This is known as the accessory plume . DIVISION INTO FEATHER TRACTS All of the feathers of the bird are constructed alike . They vary in size , shape and rigidity . They are grouped together in tracts or groups and are spoken of by the particular tract in which they are located . From the standpoint of the student of anatomy they are spoken of as the ventral tract , femoral tract , and the humeral tract ; but from the standpoint of the student of judging they are spoken of by more common terms . Ordinarily they are grouped as follows : Head. ? The small feathers on the top of the head . Neck. ? The feathers attached to the neck of the bird : Intl extend ing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . // Back. ? The feathers attached to the back of the bird and extending part way down on either side of the body . Breast. ? The feathers located in the ventral tract which extends the entire length of the under side of the body . Fluff. ? The small downlike feathers on the abdomen of the bird . Thighs. ? The feathers located on the thighs of the bird and extend ing from the hips down to the hock joint . Tail. ? The fourteen to sixteen main tail feathers forming the V-shaped tail . They are placed in the shape of a V with the apex of the V just back of the oil gland . Usually in the case of Single Comb White Leghorns there are seven main tail feathers on each branch of the V , but in a small percentage of the Leghorns and a larger percentage of the heavier breeds there are eight feathers on each branch of the V or seven on each branch with a center feather directly at the apex . // Primaries or Flights. ? These are the feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out from the body of the bird . There are usually ten primary feathers although rarely in Leghorns and quite frequently in the heavier breeds there are eleven . In one Wyandotte hen thirteen primaries were found in one wing while twelve primaries were counted in the other wing . Secondaries. ? This is the group of feathers nearest the body when the wing is spread out . There are fourteen feathers in this group . The secondary feathers nearest the body are quite small . Axial Feather. ? This is a single , small feather separating the primaries from the secondaries . Finger Feathers. ? These are four small feathers attached to the very outer end of the wingbow . They vary from 4 centimeters in length ( about 12 inches ) for the smallest one to 10 centimeters in length ( about 4 inches ) for the largest one . Many of these sections are shown in Fig 49 . Molt is Inherited. ? Each year , in case of mature birds , all of these feathers are usually dropped and new ones grown in . This act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as molting . This tendency to drop the old feathers and grow new ones at approximately regular intervals seems to be definitely inherited . MOLT IN THE BABY CHICK AND GROWING CHICKEN The young chick in its development from a baby chick to a mature bird passes through several complete molts . The first body covering of the chick is downy in nature and as a result does not drop out like normal feathers but instead has a method of molting quite peculiar to its nature . When the baby chick is hatched it has small pin feathers for flights and in two or three days it develops pin feathers that eventually become tail feathers . ( Fig. 50 . ) The down of the chick grows longer , and on certain areas of the body develops shafts . Within a few days the shafts burst open , allowing the web of the feather to spread out . The down , however , often clings to the end of the opened feathers thus giving the ragged appearance noticeable when the chicks are two to three weeks of age . ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , just above the crop , and this line extends down each side of the crop and breast . Then a tuft on each thigh and a line down the spine appear . These areas increase in size until at four or five weeks of age the chick becomes fully feathered . In work conducted at Cornell University in 1908 by Rice , Nixon and Rogers , it was found that these first feathers were completely lost , and new ones // grown in again at the age of eight weeks . The second growth of real feathers was completed at the age of thirteen weeks . The third growth was kept until just prior to maturity when the mature plumage took its place . There is no further change of plumage , except under certain abnormal conditions , which will be discussed later , until the bird ceases production after her first laying year . When production ceases in the late summer or fall of her first laying year , the fowl begins to renew her old , worn-out plumage . It is this renewal that we are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between certain molting factors and annual production . It is true that dif ferent individuals vary greatly in the way in which they molt and that many factors affect the time and the rate at which the molt takes place . These many factors have made the study of the molt a very intricate problem and much of this problem is still unsolved . TIME AND ORDER OF MOLT Best Hens May Lay and Molt at the Same Time. ? A few years ago the statement was constantly being made that it was not possible for laying hens to molt , and still continue to lay . Work carried on // during the past few years in various experiment stations points out the fallacy of this statement . As a result of a study of the molt characteristics at Iowa State College by Vernon ( 1926 ) it was found that the heaviest producers were able to continue in production at a heavy rate and at the same time drop feathers quite rapidly both in the body plumage and in the primary or flight feathers . Van Manen ( 1923 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that birds will lay and molt at the same time only when they are increasing or maintaining their body weight . They ceased to do both as soon as their body weight began to decrease . Observations at Cornell University on two groups of birds in their first laying year indicated that 16 of the 53 birds in Flock A and 26 of the 66 birds in Flock B continued to lay for some time after they had started to molt . The average date at which these 16 hens began to molt was August 24 , while in the following year for the 26 hens the average date of beginning to molt was September 8 . The percentage production for the four weeks previous to the day when the first primary feather was dropped and for the four weeks following that date , with the actual amount of molt taking place in the different parts of the plumage , is shown in Table 3 . These results indicate that there was very little decrease in the production , yet during the four weeks following the day of the dropping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped two or more primary feathers in each wing . In addition they averaged somewhat better than a slight body molt during the same period . There was very little molt in the secondaries or tail feathers . Comparison is also made in Table 3 with flocks of equal size in which the birds ceased production before or at the time of the dropping of the first primary feather . This comparison shows that while the percentage production of the birds laying and molting at the same time did not decrease , nevertheless the amount of molt , both in the wings and tail as well as the body plumage , was decidedly reduced . The birds that have the reserve power to continue in production after the feathers have started to drop or to molt while yet in production are looked upon as the most efficient egg producers . They are to be preferred to the birds that quit laying when the molt starts . The average production of the group of 16 hens that laid and molted at the same time was 225.3 eggs per hen , whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started averaged only 145.7 eggs per bird . This is an advantage of 80 eggs per bird . Practically the same advantage existed the following year in case of the 26 birds that laid and molted at the same time . // // Order of Molt Is Fairly Definitely Fixed. ? The order of the molt in the domestic hen is very definite . We find a few birds that vary slightly from the usual order but in general the variations are so few and of such small significance that they may be disregarded . Body Molt. ? Fig. 51 gives us in a diagrammatic way the usual order of molt in the body plumage . It will be noted that the head and neck feathers are the first ones to drop out . The feathers on the front of the neck do not drop out as quickly as do those on the back of the neck . Very often in a false molt brought on by faulty feeding or manage ment conditions the molt will be confined to the head and neck feathers . This is due to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible to a careful feeder or observer and steps can be taken by the poultryman to counteract or stop the molt before it progresses any further , or what is more likely to occur , the cessation of production enables the bird to recuperate and therefore renew the feathers . // Following the head and neck molt we find that the molt begins in the other parts of the body proper at about the same time . The feathers on the back of the body , the breast , fluff , and thighs all begin to drop at approximately the same time . Usually the body molt will have commenced by the time the wing and tail feathers have started to drop . The Tail Molt. ? The order of the tail molt is not uniform . Usually the innermost pair of feathers will molt first , but occasionally the molt will be scattered throughout the tail with no uniformity . In a good producer that is molting rather rapidly it is not at all unusual to find that the entire tail has dropped at approximately the same time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing is quite regular , especially in Leghorns . More variations seem to exist in case of the heavier breeds . The order of molt in the wing may be followed quite closely by studying Fig. 52 . This figure shows twelve reproductions of drawings of the left wing of one of the hens on which weekly observations were made at Cornell University . The drawings are made to scale and represent the actual lengths of the respective feathers as they were measured each week . Observations were made on 53 laying hens from November 1 , 1924 , to March 20 , 1926 , and on 66 laying hens the following year . Notations were made as to the amount of molt taking place in each part of the body plumage . Five different degrees of molt were used . The tail feathers and secondary feathers that were being renewed were noted and measurements to the nearest centimeter were made of all of the primary feathers that were in the process of growth . The production of the hen from which the measurements were taken in order to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first laying year . The molt of this hen was slightly more rapid than we would expect to find in a hen of this production but the order of the molt was practically identical with the order shown by all of the 119 birds . The diagrams will be of considerable aid in supplementing the description of the order as given in the next few paragraphs . The old feathers are shown in this chart in solid color while the new feathers are shown in a much lighter shade . The primaries , as a rule , will start to drop out a few days before the tail feathers . Ordinarily the secondary feathers will start to drop out about the same time as the tail feathers . Where the bird continues to lay after the primaries have started to drop the secondaries are several days or perhaps weeks later in dropping . As already pointed out , the primaries began to drop a few days before the secondaries . With birds that ceased production soon after the molt , started this delay was very short , but with birds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several weeks after the primaries began to drop this delay was often as long as the period of combined molt and production . The primary feather next to the axial feather dropped out first in nearly every case . The primaries continued to drop out in regular // order , the outer one being the last one to drop . Occasionally variations from this regular order were observed but rarely would the order be reversed for more than two feathers . The most common reversal was the second feather ahead of the first feather . The White Wyandottes seemed to reverse the order more frequently than did the Leghorns , Barred Plymouth Rocks or Rhode Island Reds . This exception is not significant . The order of the dropping of the secondaries is much less regular than the order of the dropping of the primaries . Counting from the axial feather toward the body the order observed in this group of birds was as follows : 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 10 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regularity is not as easily followed as in case of the primaries the uniformity of this order is much more consistent than has been supposed . Vernon ( 1926 ) , of the Iowa Experiment Station , working on the order of the secondary feather molt , observed a slightly different order than the one reported above . Daily observations would be necessary to determine accurately which one is correct . Both investigators agree that the four feathers next to the body are the first to drop , followed by the second one from the axial feather . The general order of the central group is from the axial feather toward the body . The last secondary feather to drop is the one next to the axial feather . The axial feather drops at the same time as the first secondary feather . The Reason for the Order of Molt. ? It is very interesting to note how the order of the molt has been worked out to meet the demands of the bird in order to provide at all times adequate feather surface for flight . In the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable it to escape by flight from its enemies was imperative and a close study of the wing charts as shown from week to week indicates how this order of molting of the primaries and secondaries has been adapted to meet the needs for flight at all times . It will be noted that there are three distinct divisions of solid surface to the wing , all of which shed and renew feathers almost at the same time . This is due to the fact that the first secondary and axial feathers are left to the last part of the molt , at which time the nearest primaries and secondaries are completely grown in again . TIME REQUIRED FOR MOLTING The time required for the molting of the primary feathers varies widely in different birds . In general this time variation seems to be associated with egg production , the highest producers usually molting in less tine than the low producers . However , it should be pointed // out that this relationship is not one hundred per cent because many other factors enter in , thus offsetting some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Required for Molting. ? Some of these offsetting factors are as follows : ( 1 ) the physical condition of the bird at the time that the molt begins ; ( 2 ) the time of the year at which the molt occurs ; ( 3 ) the management given the hens , especially with respect to the use of artificial lights and special feed , and ( 4 ) the length of time devoted to combined production and molt . The high producers are much more likely to lay late into the fall of the year when the temperature is much lower and as a result require more feed for the maintenance of the body temperature and to carry on the body processes than does the lower producer that completes a large part of her body and wing molt in the late summer months when the temperature is much warmer . Finally , the feeding conditions may have a marked effect in case of many flocks because there is a general tendency to neglect the birds during the summer season on the assump tion that they will find their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rations are frequently inadequate even on commercial poultry farms . The highest layer , due to the fact that she lays later into the fall , is more liable to be molting during this time of neglect while the lower producer mixed in with many hens that were still laying earlier in the season had better feeding conditions thus enabling her to make more rapid progress in growing a new coat . Most of the instances in which the high producers have taken a long time in which to renew their feathers could be explained by one or more of these offsetting factors . The experience of practical poultrymen will show that molting hens require an adequate ration for molting just as much as they do for laying . The ration probably affects the rate of molt in many flocks. * These irregularities in the rate of molt do not occur often enough to overbalance the effect of production quality and as a result a direct correlation is found between the time required for molting and egg pro duction. // LOW AND HIGH PRODUCERS GROW IN NEW FEATHERS AT THE SAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell University indi cated that the low-producing birds grew individual primary feathers in the same length of time as did the high-producing birds . About sixty per cent of the primary feather is grown during the first three weeks of the growth period and at the end of six weeks about ninety-five per cent of the feather is completed . Table 4 shows the percentage of the primary feathers grown each week . In no instance did an individual feather become completely grown in less than six weeks and many of the feathers required seven weeks to complete the growth . The shape of the feather did not apparently have any effect on the rate of growth . The pointed feather seemed to require just as long to grow as did the round , blunt feather . It did require longer for the long feathers to grow than it did for the shorter feathers . RATE OF DROPPING THE PRIMARY FEATHERS Since there is no difference between the high- and low-producing birds in respect to the rate of growth of the primary feathers we would expect to find some variation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the primary feathers or the time between the dropping of one feather and the next successive feather . Such a condition would have to exist if we were to get more rapid molt in // case of the high-producing birds than we did in case of the low-pro ducing birds . As shown in Table 5 this difference actually did exist in the case of the two groups of high-line birds and the one group of low-line birds studied at Cornell University . An analysis of this table indicates that the low and the high producers dropped about the same number of primaries , although the first group of high-line birds dropped more feathers than the second group . This difference was due to an epizootic of roup in the first group that caused a slight molt in early spring and resulted in a larger amount of molt for the year because most of those feathers that were dropped in the spring were renewed again the next winter . This removes the possibility of a shorter molt period due to the failure to drop all of the primary feathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for differences in physical characters . // If we consider the time between the dropping of the first and last primary feathers as the time required for molt we find that in case of the three groups studied there was no clear-cut difference between the low and the high producers . This is unfair to the best birds , however , because many of those birds continued to lay while they were molting . If these birds had ceased production and molted completely before starting to lay again they probably would have shortened the molt period slightly . The rate of production is not materially affected by the molt but the rate of molt is slowed up by the production . The number of days in production while in molt is shown in column six of Table 5 . Note that the low birds do not continue in production nearly as long after starting to molt as do the high producers . As indicated in the seventh and eighth columns the net days in molt decreases as the production of the bird increases . This study of rate of dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no material difference in the molt period of different egg production groups when the total period of molt is considered , but when those birds that continue to lay after they start to molt are given credit for that production and are not charged up with time for molt as long as they are performing the two operations at the same time , the high producers will require less time for their molt than will the low producers . This shorter time that is required is due , not to differences in the number of feathers dropped or the rate of growth of an individual feather , but to the time saved by performing two jobs at one time . BODY MOLT COMBINED WITH PRODUCTION The best birds not only molt the primaries while still in production but they also molt the body plumage . Table 6 shows the index value of the molt and Table 7 the percentage of the total body molt , during the year , that was performed during the production period . The percentage increases as the egg production increases . The index value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molt and then computing the actual molt for each week and totaling for the year . Table 6 indicates the amount of molt in the body plumage in the different egg production groups . The 1925 group is much larger than the other groups due to the epizootic of roup . Also note that the higher producing groups did not molt as much in the body as did the lower production groups . In one bird that laid only 19 eggs during the year three distinct body molts were recorded . Pin feathers were found on her body every week of the year . // EFFECT OF VACATION MOLT ON THE ORDER OF MOLT When a bird takes a vacation period during the winter or early spring and drops a few of the primaries and then ceases to molt and goes back into production again , she will start molting again in the // fall at the point where she ceased previously . For example , if she drops three primaries during the vacation molt she will start with the fourth primary when she starts to molt again . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping the remainder of her primaries she // will usually start over again with the first primary and repeat again on those feathers dropped during the vacation period . This procedure was followed in the case of 22 different birds that took vacation periods . If the vacation occurs the previous fall in the form of a late fall molt in pullets that started to lay early , then the normal order of molt will be followed in case of the molt at the end of the first year of production . A STUDY OF ACTUAL WINGS OF BIRDS TELLS INTERESTING FACTS In order to illustrate how certain factors may be detected by a study of the wings of different birds several examples have been shown in Fig. 53 . Bird No. 20 , in Fig. 53b shows a molt in the primaries , the first three feathers having been dropped and having nearly grown in again at the time the photograph was taken . This wing is very typical of the best producers in October when they are still in production but at the same time are slowly renewing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not started to drop at the time the photograph was taken . When the bird is molting the secondary feathers and the tail feathers , as well as the primaries and the body plumage , she will usually cease production and make a complete job of the molt . Bird No. 7 , in Fig. 53c , indicates the rapid molt very often found on the best birds after they cease production . She had dropped three of the ten primaries before ceasing production and she dropped the remaining seven primaries within the next five weeks following the cessation of production . The illustration shows where five of the remaining seven feathers had already been dropped out and the remaining two dropped the week following the time the photograph was taken . The secondary feathers in this bird were practically all dropped out as shown by the illustration . Bird No. 93 , in Fig : 53d , molted part of her primaries and then went back into production again . The new feathers may be recognized from the old ones by the slightly whiter or glossier condition and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the first fall of the early laying pullets or during the winter or at some other time , can always be detected by the fact that the last feather to drop is always shorter or in some instances longer than the ones on either side of it . Both conditions have been observed , but ordinarily the last feather to drop will be slightly shorter and the half circle formed by the outer edge of the feathers is broken at the point of the shorter feather . This condition may be due to the bird starting in production again and hence less food material is left available for growing feathers . // Bird No. 54 shows a typical poor producer starting through the second wing molt . ( Fig. 53e . ) Bird No. 49 shows three feathers dropped at approximately the same time . ( Fig. 53f . ) This study of the several groups of birds at Cornell TJniversity revealed a few birds that were very low producers which went part way through their molt the second time . The only other time that a second molt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a bird repeated on those feathers which were dropped during the vacation period . These two groups of birds can usually be kept separate and not mistaken one for the other because the vacation molter will show the shorter feather somewhere in the wing , indicating to the observer that she had taken a vacation . The poor layers that repeat part of their molt usually do not cease in the molting process ; hence all of the feathers that have been completely renewed will be full length . Great care should be taken to avoid an error in identifying these two groups of birds . DISTINGUISHING THE RAPID MOLTER One of the most difficult problems to interpret in the case of individual birds is the question of the rapidity of the molt . The best measure of this rapidity is the relative length of the growing primaries . If the difference in length between successive feathers is very small and the bird is renewing several of her primaries at one time , one can be fairly sure that the particular bird is a rapid molter . Fig. 53f shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird would be valued higher than another bird having greater differences between the successive primaries . It is assumed that other factors of pigmentation , body type and head type were similar in each instance . The bird that is molting and laying at the same time should also be given preference over the bird that ceases production prior to the molt . An exception to this last statement will be found and should be considered in case of birds that lay heavily up until snowfall . Occasionally such birds will not molt at all until forced to do so by changed feeding and management conditions . These birds would not necessarily be given the preference over the bird that molts early but continues to lay for a time . A bird should not be discounted for molting late in the fall even when compared with a bird that both lays and molts at the same time . The one will probably lose about the same time as will the other by the time she has renewed her coat of feathers and is ready for another year of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molter may not be a poor producer because she may be // still in a laying condition . This laying condition can be recognized by pigment and the characters indicating present laying condition . The time that she ceases production is the important thing to know rather than the time she began to molt . We attempt to determine how long an individual bird has been out of production by the time she has been molting . To do this one should be careful to check pigment with the molt to determine if the bird actually was out of production as long as the molt would indicate . BODY WEIGHT AFFECTS THE MOLT There is another factor that undoubtedly has an important part to play in the question of the rate of molt . No doubt there is an inherited relationship between egg production and the rate of molt , but all studies of data on molt would indicate that there is considerable effect upon shedding of feathers due to the physical condition of the bird at the time of the molt . The bird that is low in body flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease conditions will not molt as rapidly as a bird that is in better flesh . Van Manen ( 1923 ) in unpublished data at Cornell University pointed out that birds which were gaining in weight at the time the molt began could continue for a longer period in production , whereas with the birds which were losing in body weight the tendency was to cease production . Birds maintaining a constant weight were also able to continue in production and molt at the same time . The time and rate of molt , therefore , are influenced by feeding and management . TIME OF THE MOLT MAY AFFECT THE RATE OF MOLT There is considerable evidence to indicate that the rate of molt is partially dependent upon the time of the molt . When the bird gets an early start in the summer there is not the same demand for rapid growth of the feathers to provide protection from the cold as there is during the late fall and winter months . This may have some influence on the rate of molt . FAILURE TO MOLT ALL OF THE PRIMARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any flock of birds will carry over one or more of the old primary feathers . This is not necessarily a characteristic of the best birds , although as a rule the best birds will carry over more old feathers than the lower producers . The carrying over of feathers // is mainly a matter of the influence of the season and the vitality of the birds . The fact that the poorest producers molt earliest gives them more favorable weather and a longer time in which to complete their molt than in case of the late layers that do not begin to molt until cold weather sets in . The effect of cold weather is to sharpen the appetite for food to furnish heat for the body . This extra amount of food helps to hasten the renewal of the feathers . The rate of molt under normal conditions in case of the body plumage is a reliable guide in the determination of production quality . The poorest bird will drop a few body feathers at a time but never will drop a sufficient number to look bare in spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body feathers at one time . This is no doubt due to the inherited urge to lay calling upon the body for material to make feathers and to a high vitality to furnish the nutriment to sustain production . A late laying and late molting hen therefore must be doubly valuable . This being true , special care should be taken on the part of the poultryman to prevent these birds from becoming chilled during the cold days in early winter . The latest layers , being better producers , are most likely to drop all of their body feathers at approximately one time and often require additional care for a few days . Fig. 54 shows a bird that dropped her body plumage quickly . Fig. 55 shows a bird that laid two years without a complete molt. // Do NOT FORCE A PREMATURE MOLT There has always been discussion among poultrymen regarding the advisability of forcing an early molt in order , theoretically , to get the birds back quickly into late fall and winter production . The bulk of the evidence indicates that time is lost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent by the high egg prices in the early winter , but they are not sufficiently higher than the price of eggs in the late summer to offset the loss of time for the molt . Management condi tions will usually control the profitableness of such an attempt to shift the time of the molt . When the poultryman has a large enough flock of the early molters , that molted early due to management conditions rather than to poor production quality , to warrant special care for these birds it will often pay to force them for fall and early winter produc tion . The big objection lies in the fact that these birds should be dis posed of in early spring and the housing space is left unoccupied . A few breeders contend that the normal early molter will get back into production earlier than will the late layer and will lay more eggs the following winter . The Missouri station observed 200 S. C. White Leghorns in 1921 , and found the results shown in Table 8 , when they grouped these birds according to the time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molters came back and laid the most winter eggs and the most eggs the following year . Early molters must be given special care and management in order to make them respond in egg production during the fall and winter months . CHAPTER VII THE HEAD AND ITS RELATION TO PRODUCTION THE head must be considered as a composite organ of many parts consisting of the skull , the brain , the secondary sex characters , the comb , wattles , earlobes , the beak , the eyes , the ears , and the face . All of these parts functioning together involve , and are responsible for , many activities and changes indicating production qualities . The Functions of the Head. ? The head is the source of : ( 1 ) Nervous energy ; ( 2 ) intelligence ; ( 3 ) temperament ; ( 4 ) expression ; ( 5 ) disposition ; ( 6 ) it is the location of the senses , including tasting , seeing , hearing , smelling , and feeling ; ( 7 ) actions , including eating , singing , cackling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8 ) attractiveness in form and color . The head therefore controls many parts of the body and is involved in the operation of them . Hence the head , like the body , is made up of a large aggregation of parts each one with its own function affiliated with those of other parts of the body . Each part of the head may be examined separately , but the head should be considered as a whole when final judgment is rendered as to the vitality or production of the individual . Great is the Responsibility of the Head. ? When considered as a whole , the head is called upon to assume chief responsibility for the safety of the body . It is the intelligence arm of service . It contains the brain to see , feel , hear , taste , translate , decide and to speak . It combines in one composite section of the body a periscope , a conning tower with a telegraph system perfectly installed and possessing the combined authority of the pilot and captain of the poultry ship . The brain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the many branches of the nervous system drives the machinery of the whole body : the disgestive , assimilative , respiratory , circulatory , secretory , excretory and reproductive systems . If certain nerves are severed , the wings fail to function ; if other nerves are injured , the feet are paralyzed ; or if other nerves are affected the head and the neck hang limp ; if one cuts a certain nerve the heart ceases to beat . Likewise the whole digestive and assimilative systems 12:3 // upon which the reproductive system depends can not operate efficiently if the nervous system is out of order . As in any electric wiring system all nerves radiate from the main trunk line , the spinal cord , of which the brain is the master motor . It should be clearly apparent therefore why it is that birds in order to lay most efficiently must be surcharged with nervous energy and that the perfect working of the egg machine must have a brain motor which keeps on charging night and day every day in the year . The head therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stopped . In this respect the animal machine is unique ; it is self-lubricating , self-feeding , and self-charging . All that it requires is the raw material ? the feed , and the place to do business ? the factory , and it will do the rest ; moreover , when properly mated the poultry machine will turn out new egg machines most of which are equal and some superior to the original models . How TO READ THE " LANGUAGE " OF THE HEAD The head must be studied in detail , section by section , before discussion of it as a whole . It must be apparent that there is a major significance in the head parts in the judging of poultry for egg production . In fact , the head is the most expressive of all the physical characters . It reflects most accurately the physiological and reproductive conditions and values of birds . It is a mirror which reflects all of the many other sections of the body . This unique and important distinction belongs to the head and the head only , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bird . For this reason the functions of the head , as a unit as well as of each of its parts must be clearly understood before one can wholly appreciate its full significance , and hence be able to apply the principles involved in the judging of poultry . The Head of a Mature Bird , Except in Shape , is a Variable , Not a Fixed , Character. ? The appendages of the head are more variable during the life of the fowl than any other section of the body . It is this variability principally that enables one to read the language of the head when undertaking to determine health and production . Perhaps of greater importance than that of any other single section of the head , although least possible of exact appraisal of its value , are the skull and the brain within . The Shape of the Head Alone is not Sufficient. ? The conformation of the head alone , according to our present knowledge , is not a dependable character for judging , within narrow limits , the production value // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from body type . The head is a shell and the body a framework within which are held or upon which are hung the vital functioning parts . All of these , both outside and inside , are involved and therefore must be taken into consideration . Both head type and body type therefore are the physical and the mechanical expressions of capacity and vitality . The Inheritance of the " Urge to Lay " as the Impelling Force. ? The way birds function depends upon the extent to which they have inherited the tendency to reproduce . The " urge to lay " is the impelling factor which is revealed in the head by condition , action and expression as much as or more than it is by mere size and shape . If the shape of the head were the single key to the actual determination of either the productive or the prepotent values of birds , one should be able to distinguish by the sense of touch , when blindfolded , the more productive from the less productive individuals . If this were true one should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , or to estimate the past production of hens by the examination of their skeletons , and hence be able to state the approximate number of eggs laid by the individual . Unfortunately , so far as we know , no such clearly defined method can be demonstrated accurately with poultry . The science of phrenology and the art of reading character by mechanical measurements apparently have never been worked out scientifically with either hens or persons . This limitation , however , does not justify the assumption that head size and head shape do not have value in judging for intelligence , vitality , or production . What it is desired here to convey is the fact that there are several characters other than the skull which , if considered singly , are of nearly equal importance or , if taken together , are of greater significance than the mere shape of the skull . All of the head factors when taken together may be considered of more importance in deciding vitality , and nearly equal in value when deciding production qualities , than would be true of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shape. ? Many theories have been advanced regarding the significance of various " bumps " of the head . Walter Hogan asserted that he had discovered the bump of amativeness clearly defined at the back of the head as indicating prepotency . This assumption apparently was based upon inferences drawn from theories concerning human phrenology which may or may not have been proven . But whether true or false the fine distinctions in production values would be exceedingly difficult to determine accurately on an object as small as a chicken 's head . // Intelligence Versus Intuition. ? Also , the front portion of the brain , the cerebrum , and the rear portion , the cerebellum , come in for their share of attention as being involved in egg production ability . This assumption is based upon an analogy between the size , shape and quality of brains as indicating intelligence in our domestic animals and people . Birds are motivated more by the subconscious processes than by reasoning power . No scientific data based upon accurate measurements , so far as we can learn , have yet been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately estimating what a bird 's production , within narrow limits , had been or would be likely to be , based strictly on shape or size of the skull , or as determined by the size and convolutions of the brain . The Skull , the Brain and Other Head Parts when Taken Together Are Valuable. ? Notwithstanding the limitations , our best production judges have fairly definite ideas regarding the general productive qualities , within wide limits , that are commonly associated with different types of heads . How the best judges , by the use of head points , arrive at their final decisions , it is impossible always to say , since they appear to place different values upon the various parts of the head . Steup sees and feels the shape of the head . Foreman appears to look more for temperament . Each one , no doubt , is right within the limitations of the characteristics named . It is inevitable , however , that all judges , consciously or unconsciously , do and should consider all of the parts of the head in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shapes of heads do have significance in judging for production , in the main the other parts of the head must be depended upon to reflect the finer distinctions of the vitality , temperament , intelligence , sex urge , and the probable laying value . The Strain Reflects the Man. ? Here again the accuracy of our conclusions is liable to be misinterpreted due to the influence which preconceived ideas of the breeder may have had in his selection of birds having heads of certain types instead of retaining or rejecting birds strictly according to their production based upon trapnest records and progeny testing results . Thus we have certain quite characteristic types of heads , as we have also types of bodies in birds of the same variety , but of different strains based largely , if not entirely , upon the owners ' ideas as to what high-producing birds should be like , rather than upon the way the head developed and took shape according to the natural tendencies of the bird as best fitted for the performance of its functions in production . // The Kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are most generally associated with high egg production , as compared to low production values , may be defined as follows : The higher production types may be described as broad in front , flat on top , the width carried well back , as compared to a narrow front and rounded top when seen from the front , rear or side . The eye should be placed well in front of the head and near the top of the skull . These dimensions should be considered relatively as well as actually , that is , the relative proportions should be taken into consideration as well as the actual size of the head . This description , however , is too general to be applied accurately in estimating fine degrees of production . This is because there are too many exceptions to the rule and too many instances where the different measurements can not be recognized on birds differing considerably in their production . In order to secure the most accurate perspective of the size and shape of the heads of bird , when making comparisons , some focal point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of the fowl when viewed from the side appears to be the location of the eye . The dimensions of the head when viewed from the top ( Fig. 56 , left ) front or rear ( Fig. 56 , right ) or from the side , ( Fig. 57 ) should be from the center of the visible area . These dimensions are best expressed actually or relatively by describing a circle about the head when viewed from the side with the eye as the center and this circle divided horizontally and vertically through the center , and at regular intervals , by parallel lines both horizontally and vertically . The same system can be used for comparing the heads when viewed from front , rear or above . THE SKULLS OF BIRDS OF WIDE VARIATIONS IN PRODUCTION Figs. 56 and 57 are reproductions of the skulls of six hens . These are lettered A , B , C , D , E and F respectively . The different views of the skull of the same hen are designated Al , A2 and A3 , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hens A and B laid 303 eggs each ; Hen C laid 185 eggs ; hen D , 173 eggs ; hen E , 78 eggs , and hen F , 109 eggs . The record for each hen was made during the first year of laying . An exmination of the profiles of the skulls ( Fig. 56 ) shows several differences . The reader , as a matter of interest , will be able to discover these for himself . The following differences may be seen : 1 . The skulls of the three highest producing birds are smaller than those of the low-producing hens. 2 . The bridge of the nose is more refined and the beak less arched , and the top of the head flatter in A and B. 3 . The top of the head of the two lowest producers , E and F , appears shorter and higher than is the case in A , B , C and D. 4 . No proportionate difference in the back portion of the skulls is apparent . 5 . When viewed from the top heads E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . No clearly defined differences can be detected when the skulls are viewed from the rear . These studies of the skull are made purely to stimulate further investigation and under no circumstances are they to be considered as having positive or negative significance for or against the value of the skull as indicative of production quality . These skull comparisons show quite clearly several slight differences in the types of heads which , if all other conditions were equal , and positive correlations between type of head and production were accurately determined , should give us quite a helpful key for estimating // the production qualities of birds , insofar as they are influenced or determined by shape of skull indicating brain power . Many skull examinations must be made before accurate conclusions can be drawn . The Brain in Relation to Production. ? The big if which it is necessary to mention here is , if the quality of the " gray matter " were equal . This is the stumbling block in the science and art of phrenology whether applied to hens or people . How often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size and the shape of the head is concerned with a disappointingly low order of intelligence and sluggish energy as measured by scholarship , business ability or professional success . And how often have we seen positively brilliant persons who have scored low on size and shape of head . The same is true of the shapes of the heads of poultry as measuring their production . We secure the highest degree of brain power only when both the shape and the quality are correct . The Thickness of the Skull. ? The inside rather than the outside of the skull decides capacity . Here is another factor in estimating the size and shape of the brain which can not be adequately measured or estimated in the live bird , namely , the thickness of the bones of the head in proportion to the size and shape of the brain cavity . This factor introduces an element of uncertainty when judging birds or people by head points , which seriously complicates the problem . From the above it will be seen that when judging a bird 's performance by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all having to do with the final judgment : ( 1 ) the shape , ( 2 ) the quality , ( 3 ) the quantity . The shape can be quite easily measured approximately by sight and touch or fairly accurately by the use of calipers . The quality of the brain ( the gray matter ) can best be gauged by the bird 's appearance as shown by expression and actions . Third , the quantity can be surmised only by comparing the size of the head and the coarseness or fineness of the bones in other parts of the body and of the skin ? as size and shape of shanks , size and shape of the scales on the shanks , coarseness of the skin , etc. , as correlated with thickness of the skull . Fortunately , for the poultry judge , we have the great law of " correlation of parts " for guidance . There is a distinct harmony in the similarity of the structure of bones in all of the sections of the body . If they are heavy and coarse in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same bird . Hence , the bones of the shanks , for example , would reflect the quality of the bones in the head , the thickness of which we could not measure without killing the bird . The size of the brain , though presumably having value physiologically , as influencing production , can not he measured accurately in the living bird . Nevertheless it is interesting to know the results of // some attemps to ascertain the differences in size and shape of brains of birds varying considerably in production . A limited amount of data regarding the brain weight of hens of different intensity and annual egg production are shown in Table 9 , by Hall ( 1926 ) . These figures do not reveal any appreciable difference in weight of brain that might not be accounted for by the size of bird or other factors . The only conclusion which can be drawn from these data is that whatever differences there may be in brain development , as influencing production , apparently are due to the quality or the shape of the convolutions of the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vary with weight of bird . The contrast in the weight of the birds from the lightest to the heaviest and the small num ber of birds involved do not provide sufficient data to justify conclu sions when so small an object , relatively , as the brain is under con consideration . Figs. 58 and 59 show x-ray exposures of several heads . In an attempt to penetrate beneath the surface of the head in order to learn the location of the lobes of the brain with reference to the sections of the skull and the thickness of the bony structure a considerable number of x-ray exposures were made of high- and low-line pullets , hens and cocks . The plates were made by a well-known authority in x-ray photography , Dr. Ramsey Spillman . Two females of high-line breeding b and c and two of low-line breeding e and f , are shown in Figs. 58 and 59. a and d are exposures of the underside of the head through the jaw bones , which cloud the view of the brain . The side views , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer lobes of the brain and the sections of the skull . These will be more easily located if the reader will // first note the parts of the skull and brain as shown in Fig. 60 . The dark lines mark the areas where sections of the skull come together in a horizontal plane to the eye which usually also mark the fissures where the lobes of the brain come together . One is impressed with the size of the eye , the eye socket and the optic lobe . It is important , and possibly surprising too , to realize that the brain is not located ventral ( above ) but dorsal ( back ) of the eye . Here , as shown in Fig. 62 , the thickest portion of the skull is at the most vulnerable points to protect the brain from injury from above , from the side or the front . The attachment of the comb to the head shows that in case of b ( high producers ) and f ( low producers ) the point of rear attachment is well back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ( low producers ) it is directly over the eye . In the case of all of the birds shown the front attachment of the comb is directly over the front of the nasal opening . Presumably the location of the comb does not have any particular significance . Comparing the outline of the tops of the heads and beaks , those in B and C ( high producers ) would appear to be a trifle flatter than in E and F ( low producers ) . ( Fig. 57 . ) No conclusions are offered regarding the relationships of type of skull or brain as indicating the production value of birds insofar as shown by the x-ray views of the four birds studied . Similar and far more detailed studies must be made on a larger number of birds of widely different production values before conclusions would be justified . Although no significant differences were observed , according to our limited knowledge of interpretation , either in the size or shape of the brains or the skulls , the illustrations ( Figs. 57 and 58 ) show quite clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skulls which suggest the possibilities for further investigation . What Lobe of the Brain Governs Reproduction ? ? There is still another complication in judging birds by the shape of the skull . It has not yet been definitely proven with poultry just what lobe or convolution of the brain is responsible for the stimulus of the act of procreation . Certain it is that there is such a stimulus based on the power of suggestion . This is proven by common observation of the mating of fowls . It is manifested in the pairing of birds at mating time and preference of individuals in the case of polygamous species . It is most conspicuously shown by the mutual mating receptivity of male and female in the case of the domestic fowl late in the afternoon , when about three-fourths of the daily matings normally take place . This being the time , presumably , when the oviduct is most free front obstruction , on account , of egg formation , to the passage of the sperms of the // male to the upper part of the oviduct when the egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oviduct , at which point the fertilization most readily takes place by the female cell uniting with the male cell , the sperm . The " urge to lay " is the impulse to egg production . Though a hen presumably does not " will to lay or not to lay , " there are forces within and conditions without the body which , synchronizing together , result in egg production . The forces from within are the inherited tendencies involving the reproductive system and all the supporting organs of digestion , assimilation , circulation , etc. , and each of these functions with the brain . The forces from without the bird are all the environmental conditions such as food , sunshine , temperature , the air , and the birds with whom they are associated . The senses of sight , sound , smell , hearing , touch , all have their responses in appetite , fear , courage , happiness , revenge and sex response . Hence it would appear plausible that the quality of certain parts of the brain would be largely responsible for the excitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical side view of the skull , brain and principal organs of the head is shown in Fig. 60 , drawn by Dr. Papez of the Cornell Medical College . Observe the large proportion of the head occupied by the eyeball situated in front of the brain . Note the heavy skull bone like an armor plate above the eye and brain . A snore comprehensive and detailed view of the brain of the fowl can he seen from the under side ( ventral ) , as shown in Fig. 61 . The // striking lesson to be learned from this clear drawing of the brain is its similarity to a telephone switchboard . It will be seen that each of the nerves branching off from the abducens nerve ( ab ) is a branch line which controls an important organ . The thinking and reasoning part of the brain in the fowl is in front and on top of the forebrain , the cere-brum , and consists of a very narrow portion , whereas in man this portion of the brain constitutes the largest part . Fig. 62 shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain removed . The portion marked f is the region of the forebrain or cere-brum ; cb is the cerebellum ; t , tectum ; m , medulla oblongata ; e marks the place of the ear ; eye shows a portion of the thin wall of bone which forms a partition between the eyeballs ; n is the nasal opening . Com pare with Figs. 60 and 61 . It is evident that it is diffi cult to prove just what part of the brain is responsible for activating the reproductive system . Perhaps at s o m e future time scientific research will reveal the secret and show how the knowledge may be apmore accuratel through plied studying the size and shape of the skull . For the present it is certain that more accurate judgment of the production quality of birds may be had by noting in addition to the shape the many other factors which the head reveals . Just what particular part of the brain is chiefly responsible , what is the seat of the reproductive response , has been the object of ' conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . // DESCRIPTIVE CLASSIFICATION OF THE PARTS OF THE HEAD The composite character of the head is clearly revealed when it is examined in detail , section by section , and function by function . An attempt at such an analysis with descriptive terms is here shown . It should be studied carefully and used freely when comparing birds . It focuses the attention upon each section . When the record is carefully made of the characteristics of each bird according to the descriptive terms , it furnishes a comprehensive detailed record to be preserved and compared with similar record or records made of the same bird or of different birds at other times of the year . The physical characters indicating egg and meat production and vitality values as applied to the domestic fowl and the terms to describe them are shown in the following copy of stencil 5549 prepared for use in a poultry research project in 1927 , at the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University . The outline here reproduced was the result of considerable previous study of the head in old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees of quality . The classification is reproduced here in the hope that other students of the head characters may use it to increase further their knowledge of this important section of the bird . Head Feathering. ? The feathers of the head have the same sig nificance as the plumage of the other parts of the body . They , like the feathers of the neck , are molted first . It would appear true that heavily laying hens are more likely to become baldheaded than are the poor producers . In explanation of this occurrence it has been asserted that baldness is due to the following causes . ( 1 ) The highest producers are laying so heavily and maintaining their unmolted plumage that less nutriment is available for growing new feathers on the head .

Dopey // Another theory is that the feathers have been broken off in mating and have not been renewed . ( 3 ) Still another reason suggested is that the blood circulation is less rapid on top of the head than in other parts of the body . The first is generally accepted as the most plausible . The second hardly seems justified and the third does not have a sound physiological basis of fact . The Beak. ? The beak , being a part of the bony structure of the head , must be judged with it since its size , color , and attachment to the skull have much to do with the general appearance of the head . The significance of the beak in judging depends primarily upon its shape and color . In this respect it may be used as a reflection of the physical condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . Each species of birds is in a class by itself as regards shape of beak . For example , a long , flat , thin beak , as compared to a short , heavy , curved beak , could not be used as indicating high or low production or high or low vitality in all species of birds . The crow , with a flat beak and the hawk with a curved beak would , in their natural state of vigor , no doubt , represent similar degrees of vitality and production . The philosophy that the long , flat thin beak is indicative of lower vitality and presumably lower production than in the case of the same species of poultry having a heavy , well-curved beak , is based on the belief , which appears to be borne out by observation , that the domestic fowl when suffering on account of improper feeding or the ravages of disease or parasites will be likely to show the effects in certain types of abnormalities in growth . These usually are manifested as a result of low vitality and not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head and beak , shanks and toes , out of proportion to the other parts of the body . ( Fig. 24 . ) Inherited , as well as acquired , weakness also apparently manifests the fact in a similar manner , as regards the shape of the beak . Appearances are often deceptive . When considering the shape of the beak and head , the influence of the change of shape and size of the comb may be deceptive as influencing the judgment of the appearance of the head as a whole . The reader , in order to observe this relationship , is advised to make drawings of the heads of birds and to note how a change in the size and shape of comb will greatly affect the judgment of the shape of the head and beak . The changing color of the beak due to the influence of production and food supply is one of the most valuable sections of the body for observing pigmentation . The Comb. ? Reproductive efficiency is best shown by the comb . The past , , present or future production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dries down and the scurf peels off and it becomes cold when the bird is dormant ; it becomes warm , showing red crevices when it expands and later crimson red over the entire surface when production begins . Present and future production , therefore , is easily shown by the comb and wattles . The size and type of the comb are determined by the poultry breeders . The comb may be bred large or small , with high or low rear blade or spike , straight or lopped , rose or single , as a variety characteristic , and it has no apparent influence on the number of eggs laid by a bird . It then becomes purely a unit character , the same as the ovary would be a single unit character , and the two are not necessarily inherited together . However , as between birds of the same variety or strain of individuals , those which are in production have larger combs than those which are dormant . It would appear also that , if left to natural development without selection by man with reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers might be expected to be slightly larger than those of the low producers of the same variety and strain . The comb , therefore , may be looked upon as a secondary sexual character which reflects in its color , size and texture and temperature the condition of the reproductive system and this in turn indicates the general health of the bird . The shape of the comb , likewise , apparently has a variety significance only . It apparently indicates the productivity of the bird only insofar as the texture reflects refinement and warmth and the fullness shows health and activity of the reproductvie system . In its normal condition it merely represents the idea or fancy of the breeder . The only exception to the above which appears to be well founded , is that in very low or degenerate condition of birds , there appears to be a reversion toward the primitive forms of small comb . The number , size and shape of the points of the comb seem to have some significance . The broad , flat points are generally considered to be associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pencil points . ( Fig. 2 . ) The thickness of the comb is important . The very thin , limp combs with a narrow base indicates too much refinement and the thick , leathery combs are associated with too much coarseness . The best comb is one that has a good broad attachment to the head but is not carried too stiff . Pictures of the original species of the wild jungle fowl , Gallus Bankiva , as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , illustrate the appearance of the progenitors of all or most of our domestic fowls . Note the high rear blades , then compare these small combs of some of the degenerate types as the result of inbreeding and the exhibition types as bred by some of the // fanciers , and as contrasted with the other extreme , the ponderous combs of some of the English Utility Leghorns , which are much too large as some of the American types are too small . The size of the comb , it would seem , should not be of either extreme , and the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and utility . The main fact to consider here is the fallacy of breeding for a single character without regard to whether or not the bird possesses high production . To select any breed for any character or combination of characters , whether that is the comb , head or body , in order to increase production instead of selecting birds on account of their production , is getting the cart before the horse and the horse faced backward . It would seem certain that we will see the style of the small , high , rear blade , comb type of the exhibition Leghorns change . It is not correctly correlated with a large capacity body . A desirable comb should have smooth texture ; a thick base ; short , regular shaped points ; medium-sized blade well adapted for coldweather conditions ; and the rear blade horizontal or following the neck to meet the demands of symmetry or outline of the bird . The same principle would apply to all breeds , except that with the general purpose breeds the combs have been bred less conspicuous and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean breeds . The temperature of the comb varies with the reproductive condition . It is warmest when birds are just commencing to lay and is coldest when the bird is dormant . The texture of the comb and wattles is the most conspicuous part of the body to ascertain the texture of the skin . It varies in texture from velvety , glossy fineness to an extremely thick , pebbly condition . Neither extreme is to be desired . If it is too fine the bird may show too much refinement bordering on weakness . If it is too rough the bird is likely to be too coarse in all parts of the body for the most efficient production . The color of the comb is so variable depending upon the physical condition of the bird that it is the conspicuous and most reliable indication of health and reproductive activity . The comb colors arrayed in the order of the health values are from bright red to dark red and purple and the opposite extreme in color .

Any of these conditions is a sign of weakness . The smooth , full , red face is the ideal condition indicating // good health . Face feathering is objectionable on account of appearance and may be associated with heavy feathering in other parts of the body , which it is believed , is correlated with low production . The Eye. ? The eye is the most important single character of the head and perhaps of the bird . It should be considered with respect to four principal qualities , each one of which has an important bearing on health and production . The eye has the distinction of having the largest lobe of the brain to support it . The eyes are so placed in the front part of the head that they serve as the searchlight and conning tower combined . They guide the entire ship . It is not surprising to find , therefore , that the eyes are the windows through which the judge may look at the interior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence indicates the condition of the supporting muscles . Therefore the eyes should be prominent and not sunken . The shape is determined principally by the eyelid and eyebrow . The open eye shows health . The drooping eyelid indicates a lack of vitality . The cross-eyed bird has eyes that focus on the beak instead of straight ahead or at right angles to the head . This condition is a deformity and usually is found in a narrow head . The size of the eye is responsible principally for its prominence . The size and prominence are best observed when the head is viewed from the front or rear , from which position the convexity of the eyeballs may be seen . When viewed from the side the best type of eye is wide open and approximately round . The prominence of the eye is indicated also by the appearance of the edge of the inner eyelid which is scarcely visible in a sunken eye . The color of the iris of the eye is similar to other pigment sections of the body in that it is somewhat variable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reserve vitality . When the vitality of a bird is sapped by parasites or disease the iris of the eye may become a bright gray color . Mentality. ? It is the sparkle and flash , the challenge of the eye , which is responsible for expression . This in turn reflects the mental response so closely associated with high production . The action of the head and the speed of blinking the eyes are reflexes of the mental condition which reveal nervous energy and intelligence . The birds having bright , alert expressions are in violent contrast to the sleepy , dull individuals . The disposition of birds reflects their ancient origin or their modern development . The most undesirable types retain their original flighty , quarrelsome dispositions , whereas the most highly developed types are friendly and docile . CHARACTERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE HEAD 143 ' The Intelligence. ? The intelligence of birds may be defined as inquisitive , curious , bright and alert as compared to the indifferent or even stupid individuals . Just how much reasoning power is possessed by the highest producers as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological tests , but it is already apparent to those who have handled many birds in trapnests that the highest producers do differ materially from the lowest producers in those mental traits which are manifested by actions here discussed under the term " mentality . " THE CHARACTERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE HEAD In an attempt to bring together the characters of the head in relation to their various functions Fig. 63 has been drawn . The border line between characters and functions frequently is not very clearly drawn and sometimes is debatable . Under each of the eight groups of functions are shown the particular characters which best indicate the functional activity of the bird under different conditions of vitality , age and production for each of the sexes . For example , starting with constitutional vigor , it is believed that the shape of the head and beak , the color of the comb and wattles , the pig144 THE HEAD AND ITS RELATION TO PRODUCTION ment in the beak and face , and the plumage both as to quantity and quality , will best reveal the vitality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 63 to nervous energy , body type , digestive efficiency , physical condition , disposition , reproductive efficiency , and sex dominance , a careful examination of many birds with book in hand and the descriptive classification of the parts of the head ( page 138 ) to record the observations , one should be able to master the science and art of reading the language of the head . The more one studies the heads of birds the more he will come to spell constitutional vigor , nervous energy , and sex dominance in capital letters . EARLY ATTEMPTS TO DESCRIBE , CLASSIFY AND DEFINE THE HEAD TYPES AS INDICATIVE OF PRODUCTION VALUE Many attempts have been made to describe and classify the types of heads of the domestic fowl as indicating their production . Each attempt has added to the sum total of knowledge , but no one , it may be fairly said , has succeeded in standardizing the information into a perfectly working system . This is no reflection on the value of the several important contributions that have been made . The reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points is the comparative newness of the proven facts upon which to base a perfect system . Such a system is not possible until after sufficient scientific research has been conducted . A brief summary of the progress in judging by head points follows . Further light on the history of judging by physical examination no doubt will reveal many other definite contributions . In 1918 the Cornell Poultry Judging School approved a descriptive statement of the difference between the head of a high-producing and a low-producing fowl as follows : " One of the finer indications , but yet one of the most valuable in picking the high layer is the fineness of the head and the closeness and dryness of feathering . The head of a high layer is fine . The wattles and earlobes fit close to the beak and are not loose and flabby . The face is clean cut . The eye is full , round and prominent , especially when seen from the front . The high layer is trimmer , that is , the feathers lie closer to the body and after heavy production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glossy but the plumage becomes worn and threadbare . CHANGES IN THE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS The comb , wattles and earlobes enlarge or contract , depending on the ovary . If the comb , wattles and earlobes are large , full and smooth , or hard and waxy , the bird is laying heavily . If the comb is limp the // bird is only laying slightly but is not laying at all when the comb is dried down , especially at molting time . If the comb is warm it is an indication that the bird is coming back into production . " TERMINOLOGY USED BY FOREMAN , 1919 , IN DESCRIBING HEADS Foreman , 1919 , gave a detailed description of head characters in which he described several head types . " Egg type in poultry is more reliably indicated by the head than any other single part of the body . The head reveals health , constitutional vigor , age , refinement , coarse ness and masculinity . " The following quotations are descriptive legends used in describing several birds with distinctly different head types . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note the keen , refined , intelligent expression in this heavy producer ? large , bright eye ; narrow skull ; clean-cut face , possessing femininity and vitality . This hen was selected by refinement of the head as the record hen in the College flock in 1916 just as she began to lay . " " Miss I. W. W. , a lazy disposition . A coarse head is characteristic of unprofitable layers . Older hens taking on fat will also show this coarse , broad skull , wrinkled face , china eye and dull inactive expression . " " Miss Chuckle Head is a zero producer . Note the masculinity expressed in this individual by long wattles , gouty face and coarse comb . This is a typical head of a hen that has developed permanent atrophy of the ovary . She never has nor never will produce an egg . This type is not common . " " This head shows extreme refinement . Care and judgment must be exercised or refinement of the head will lead to selection of individuals that are not sufficiently robust to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small heads and extreme fineness of features generally indicate a propensity for broodiness . " " Crow Head . Note the long , straight , narrow beak and sunken eye . This is an undesirable type readily developing colds and disease and is constitutionally a poor producer . " Payne , 1922 , devoted considerable attention to the head as here quoted : " A lean , clean-cut face with prominent , clear eyes , and an absence of wrinkled skin about the head is a mark of good quality . " " Poor layers usually show a beefy head , full face , heavy eyelids and eyebrows , and round shanks covered with rather coarse scales . " " Heavy , overhanging eyebrows , and a lack of luster throughout the head , comb and wattles are further indications of broodiness . " The Foreman Classification of Head Types. ? At the Cornell Poultry Judging School , in 1921 , Foreman wrote the following description // of the head of a high producer as compared to that of a low producer , which was incorporated as a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire staff . The High Producer. ? " The head should be of medium length and depth , with strong impressive lines . The face should be full with a bright , intelligent , friendly and expressive eye , indicating a sensitive and responsive nervous organization . The skull should be wide and flat , the width increasing uniformly from the attachment of the beak to a point directly back of the eye . A smooth and lean condition of the skin covering the face is desirable . The head should be neatly attached to the neck , avoiding all tendency toward throatiness . " The Low Producer. ? " Thick , prominent jaws , narrow skulls , heavily wrinkled or shallow faces , small or sunken eyes , overhanging eyebrows , or combs with extremely narrow serrations are all undesirable . " On the same occasion Foreman gave the following description and classification of the head types . As general information for judging he stressed three essentials : ( 1 ) head character ; ( 2 ) balance ; ( 3 ) temperament . He further emphasized the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) lymphatic. physical ; ( b ) functional ; defined as : ( a ) aggressive ; ( b ) active ; ( c ) These he referred to as representing the ( a ) ( c and d ) nervous and mental condition of the birds . The heads of fowls were further classified and de-scribed under six de-scriptive terms . These were : ( 1 ) crowheaded ; ( 2 ) overly refined ; ( 3 ) refined ; ( 4 ) lacking in character ; ( 5 ) beefy ; ( 6 ) masculine . No attempt was made by Foreman to give the estimated produc-tion ratings for the six classes . The distinctions which he made in // describing the important characteristics of the classes of birds are given in detail . 1 . Crowheaded ( Fig. 64 ) . ? Long , shallow head , depressed face and sunken eye . A low vitality type ; slow to mature , feather and lay They are described as rangy and awkward . Their production woula depend upon the degree of temperament to furnish the driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as describing the " crowhead " type . // 2 . Overly Refined ( Fig. 65 ) . - Small ; highly sensitive and delicate ; high-laying temperament ; bright , active disposition and distinctly effeminate but lacking in robustness , vigor and weight to sustain high production . They lose pigment rapidly . This brief abstract from Foreman represents the generally accepted description of the overly refined grade . 3 . Refined ( Fig. 66 ) . - This is Foreman 's best grade . He defines the head and body as being in proper balance , and having a high quality of activity , energy and production . The face is of medium length and depth and the skin of fine texture and lean appearance . This shape of the head is described as of medium length and depth , with skull and jaw of the same width and thickness , which gives a full but flat appear ance to the face when viewed from the front . The skull tapers uni formly to the beak from the rear of the eyes , where it reaches its great est width . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eye is located near the top of the skull and well to the rear of the face . This description by Foreman of recent date apparently agrees with Steup 's head points for the high-producing hen except that Steup describes the location of the eye of the high producer " well toward the nostril under the front half of the comb . " // 4 . Lacking in Character ( Fig. 67 ) . - Foreman described this group as " having a distorted conformation of the head and an expression of negative character . " It lacked nervous energy and proper proportion and balance . Such birds have dull eyes , listless expressions and are short season , low producers , slow to mature and they molt early . Beefy Head ( Fig. 68 ) . -A short heavy head with heavy , coarse , rounded skull , jaw wider than the skull . The eye is located midway lx'tween the skull and jaw and is sunken , and such birds usually have // thick skins and are sluggish in temperament . The neck is short , stout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . 6 . Masculine Type ( Fig. 69 ) . - This type , according Foreman , is the result of abnormality of the sex organs which materially alters the appearance of the secondary sexual characters . He mentions two distinct types of masculine birds . One shows the typical masculine type early in life and the other later in life . The first shows the effect of incomplete , early non-sexing . They carry high pigment in the various sections of the body , red combs and spurs ; and other masculine characters such as sickle feathers , develop . The voice becomes coarse and masculine . Males treat these individuals as they would other males . The second class of masculine type hens shows the changes less distinctly . Foreman 's very careful descriptions of the last five grades are clearly made and are accurate accord-ing to our present knowledge . Foreman 's classification of head types does not cover a wide range of high quality birds . Five of the six types would be considered as below the average . This throws too many birds of many degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas System for Judging by Head Points. ? In 1929 Payne and Steup gave a comprehensive description of the shape of the head as a character indicating laying quality . While recog-nizing the value of other parts of the head in estimating egg production the claim was made that the shape alone was sufficient to form correct judgment of laying values . The keystone of the claims for this system is based upon the head having fixed characters as distinguishable from the variable characters . It is claimed that since the skull characters do not change during the year or for life with any individual they may be observed accurately at all times and under all conditions . This fact , if true , certainly would be a great advantage . The four cornerstones of the system are : ( 1 ) " The flatness of the top of the skull from side to side " ; ( 2 ) " The carry forward of the skull width " ; ( 3 ) " Ilead balance , " and ( 4 ) // " Levelness of the top of the skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 70. ) ( 1 ) The first factor , flatness of the top of the skull from side to side , when viewed from the front , is a reaffirmation of one of the early and frequent observations of the characteristics of the heads of high producing hens . This particular dimension is to be observed by looking at the bird from the front or rear , in which event a high producer would have a flat head and a poor producer would have a head high in the center and sloping toward the eyes . Coupled with the flatness of the skull it is claimed that the distance from the eye to the top of the skull is narrower in a high producer than it is in a low producer . This difference in distance is accounted for by the greater height of the center of the top of the head of a low producer , which , when viewed from the side , front or rear , would be arched . ( Fig. 57 . ) If it should be true that the head of the low producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be due to the greater thickness of the skull bone at that point . If so , this would check with the common belief that low producers are coarse-boned , and if this is true we would expect thicker bones in the head as well as the shanks and other parts of the skeleton . ( 2 ) The second character , " The carry forward of the skull width , " implies in the higher producer a wider forehead and the location of the eye sockets farther forward . According to Steup , the eye of a high producer is " set well forward in the head , well under the front half of the comb , whereas poor producers have the eye sitting farther back under the rear half of the comb or else behind the comb entirely . " This principle has been generally accepted for some time . It requires a keen eye to see the slight differences in the location of the eye with respect to the back and fore part of the head and comb attachments . Great emphasis is placed in the Steup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and narrow right in front of the eye " and that the extremely good hens carry this width farther forward than do poor layers . ( 3 ) Steup 's third character , " head balance , " emphasizes the comparative distance between the top of the head and the bottom of the jaw as measured by a vertical line drawn through the eye , as balanced by the distance from the front of the earlobe to the tip end of the beak as measured by a horizontal line drawn below the eye . ( Fig. 70. ) ( 4 ) The fourth character is " levelness of the top of the skull both in front and behind the eye . " It differs from his first character by having the slope of the head , front and back , from the top of the head when viewed from the side . // The distinction , according to this character , between the good and the poor producers is that the good hens have heads which when viewed from the side have a flat top line as compared with a steeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer when the center of the head is directly above the eye . The angles may be compared to a flat gable roof representing the higher producer and the steep gable roof the lower producer . In order to bring out more graphically and clearly the four characCLASSIFICATION // ters which Steup proposed , note Fig. 70 in which a few lines are used to show the exaggerated differences . Sketch 1 shows the " flatness of top of skull from side to side , when viewed from the front . Sketch 2 shows " carry forward of skull width " when viewed from the top . Sketch 3 , " head balance " is viewed from the side . ( In good layers , the vertical distance is nearly equal to the distance from the front of earlobe to the tip of the beak , whereas in poor layers the distance of the vertical line is much shorter than the horizontal line . ) Sketch 4 , " levelness of the top of the skull both in front of and behind the eye , " is viewed from the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crow head " from the round , blocky head of the phlegmatic or masculine types . No attempt is made by Steup to estimate , even approximately , the number of eggs that the hens which meet the requirements of each of the four characters would lay as compared to the hens that do not . I n ratings as to laying quality the birds are described as good or poor layers , or extremely good or extremely poor layers . // The Cornell University Classification of Head Types. ? This is a composite system based on the ideas of many of the members of the teaching staff of the Annual Cornell Poultry Judging Schools , 1918 to 1929 . Both Foreman , 1924 , and Steup , 1929 , presented their ideas at the Judging School and these ideas have been considered in this classification . It includes the results of many individual examinations of birds having a wide range of production , including several breeds and varieties , but principally White Leghorns . It retains the descriptive terms of Foreman 's first three classes , namely : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) crowheaded . His next type ( 4 ) " beefy head , " has been changed to " coarse , " which falls in the unrefined group . His ( 5 ) " lacking in character " type has been replaced by " phlegmatic , " and his ( 6 ) incomplete or " hermaphroditic , " has been replaced by the word " masculine . " The qualities of the birds included under all six grades remain essentially the same . The order in which Forelll ; tn // // No doubt the reason why the term rugged refined was not suggested  --  - " c  --  + ' - ' - " a , . -+ " ,  --   --  not the need for the rugged refined class . Not so many years ago the word refined appropriately represented our highest grade in production , about 200 to 250 eggs . But with the more recent advance in breeding for high production and for larger eggs has come the necessity for breeding larger , longer-lived birds to stand up under the larger and larger demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 to 300 egg or higher classes , and the number of such birds found on breeding farms , furnish the proof of the justification of the rugged refined class . The rugged refined head and body associated with high production were found among many birds and hence this quality had to be described and named . It may not be too prophetic to predict that the superior quality and increasing number of " rugged refined " birds may soon justify dividing this group into two grades . In this event some suitable term must be found to describe adequately the finest triumphs of production breeding . Super-rugged refined might express the quality . ( Figs. 78 and 79. ) // APPROXIMATE ESTIMATED PRODUCTION TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THE PROPOSED SEVEN HEAD TYPES Although it is not possible with our present limited knowledge to estimate accurately the past or future production of birds within narrow limits or even into high and low indi-v i d u a 1 s in all instances , nevertheless modern knowl-edge and skill do enable a properly qualified person to designate certain ranges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlapping above or below the predicted produc-tion for any particular head type . The following state-went of the expected pro-d u c t i o n of birds , under normal conditions of management , classified according to seven head types , will serve as an ap-proximate general guide in undertaking to estimate their production . The seven types naturally may be grouped into two classes : ( 1 ) those that are Refned and ( 2 ) those that are Unrefined . The former include types a , b and c , laying 150 eggs or more , and the latter types , d , e , f and g , laying less than 200 eggs . The refined group a , b and c may be termed good layers , and those in d , e , f and g , medium to poor layers . Suitable to the needs of most persons who would desire to specify // three groups of birds according to their production qualities the breeders would be found in types a and b , the commercial layers in types c , d and e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When thus segregated according to head types into the above three groups , reasonably accurate selection should be made . In actual practice on the farm it is assumed , of course , as it would be in the showroom , that the head character would not be used alone , but would furnish invaluable information to check with body type , molt , pigment , etc . This contribution alone is a great accomplishment . CHAPTER VIII BODY TYPE , INTERNAL ANATOMY , AND CHANGES IN PHYSICAL CONDITION AS AFFECTING EGG PRODUCTION BODY type is the outline of a bird when seen from any direction . The outline is determined by the skeleton or bony framework and muscular development . The plumage is merely the covering of the bird which materially modifies the appearance but can not be considered as determining the type . The plumage together with the bony frame-work and muscular tissues form the outline which in the judging of live birds is used to express type as a characteristic of breeds of poultry . Body type is a character which can be used with both sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in immature or young birds . The various body type characters relating to egg production are ) ( it // spoken of as anatomical or permanent characters , as contrasted with physiological characters such as pigment or molt changes . The various external body measurements which have been studied in relation to egg production are illustrated in Fig. 80 , reproduced from a drawing of a live bird . Fig. 81 shows the same measurements on the skeleton of a bird . In general the body type may be used as an indication of laying capacity , laying condition , constitutional vigor and sex dominance . There are several body measurements or sections of the body which may be discussed separately and the relation each has to body functions and to egg production pointed out . BODY TYPE Head Type. ? This section of the bird is very closely correlated with all other parts of the body . This makes it a key character . Hence , all of Chapter VII is devoted to a discussion of the relation of head type to egg production . Head type is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used in judging poultry for egg production . Heart Girth. ? The second section of the body is Lha1 , of the heart ; // girth , or spring of ribs and depth of the anterior ( front ) portion of the body . The spring of the ribs may be measured by the use of the thumb and fingers , by resting the palm of the hand on the back just behind the shoulders with the thumb and fingers along the sides of the bird as shown in Fig. 82a . By sliding the hand along the back , the width of the loin , the hips and the pelvic region ( rump ) can be determined . The depth is measured by placing the thumb on the small of the back of the bird , about midway between the hips and the wings , directly above the middle of the keel bone , with the fingers at the front end of the keel . ( Fig. 82b . ) By sliding the thumb along the back and at the same time the fingers along the keel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the bird , can be determined readily . Heart girth and front depth indicate a bird 's capacity in this region of the body . This section is comparable to the human chest measure . Within this section of the body are found some of the most vital organs of the internal anatomy of the fowl , namely , the heart and lungs . These organs are essential first for life itself , and further they must be of sufficient size to enable them to take care of the extra work imposed upon them by high egg production . These organs , together with the liver and kidneys , are responsible for the circulation and purification of the blood , and of the carrying of food nutrients and of body fluids to various parts of the body , and the elimination of waste materials . Good capacity , then , in this region is absolutely essential and hence we can not expect high or efficient production in narrow-chested , shallowbodied , or small birds . Length and Width of Back. ? This region of the bird is located at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extends to the posterior ( rear ) end of the body . The length of back generally includes the section of the bird described under heart girth as well as the rear portion of the back . The width of this section of the bird may be determined by continuing to move the hand backward when in the same position as shown for measuring the spring of ribs ( Fig. 82a ) throughout the entire length of the back . The back should be wide and carry its width throughout . This is one of the most important sections of the body as indicating constitutional vigor and longevity . The reproductive organs , the ovary and oviduct are located there . Moreover , a strong back is the first essential to a rugged constitution . It is here that the process of egg formation is carried on ; hence the necessity for good capacity . If a hen is to lay many eggs weighing two ounces each ( twenty-four ounces to the dozen ) she must have actual capacity in this region great enough to hold the egg after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or discomfort . Birds with narrow // backs , or backs which are pinched at the rear , or birds small in size , will lack cubic capacity for satisfactory egg production . Angle of Tail to Back. ? This character apparently has no relation with egg production ; it varies greatly with different breeds and varieties of birds as well as with different strains of the same variety , and usually between individuals of the same strain , except as the angle of the tail is influenced by changes in body weight and type due to production . ( Fig. 80 . ) Condition of Pubic Bones and Width of Pelvic Arch. ? Pubic bones which are extremely stiff or are very blunt and thick , due to heavy layers of fat , indicate that the bird is in a dormant condition , or is not drawing on the body fat at a very rapid rate for egg production . The bird which has been laying heavily for a few weeks will almost always have pubic bones that are of medium thickness and are flexible rather than stiff . Extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions often indicate some constitutional weakness . The width of the pelvic arch , or distance between the pubic bones , may be taken as an indication of laying condition and capacity . This measurement changes very materially as a bird passes from a laying to a dormant condition , or vice versa , the width being narrow in dormant birds and wide in birds laying heavily . This was one of the characters used by Walter Hogan in what is known as the " Hogan System " for the determination of egg production quality . ( Chapter II . ) It was one of the first external characters used in attempting to determine egg production . Since it is a measurement which changes from time to time it can not be used in the same manner as the more fixed characters , such as width of back . If a group of birds are taken when they are all laying heavily and the width of the pelvic arch is determined for each bird there will be little if any relation found to exist between this measurement and the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width of the pelvic arch may , however , be used with a fair degree of accuracy at certain times of the year , in telling the laying condition of birds ; that is , whether the bird is laying or dormant , and in this way be a great aid in picking out the best layers in a flock of birds , for example , pullets laying their first eggs as indicating precocity or laying their last eggs as indicating persistency . Fig. 82c shows the method of measuring the width of the pelvic arch . Care must be taken in using this measurement since the width between the pubic bones may be caused by an accumulation of hard fat , rather than the actual distance between the bones . Such a condition is often found in birds with meat-producing tendencies . // Distance from Pubic Bones to Posterior ( Rear ) End of Keel . This character indicates laying condition and capacity , and may be determined by placing the fingers on the rear end of the keel and the ends of the pubic bones . ( Fig. 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called rear depth , is obtained by placing the thumb on the back of the bird , just behind the hips , and the fingers on the rear end of the keel . This measurement is very similar to the width of the pelvic arch in its relation to egg produc tion as it changes with laying con dition . Large capacity is desired , as a hen must consume large quan tities of food in order to lay well and the digestive organs which transform the food nutrients into material for the production of eggs or meat , and body maintenance , are located in this region . The distance between the pubic bones and the rear end of the keel is influenced also by the length of the keel bone itself . A short keel bone would in-crease the distance from the pubic bones without any increase in depth of abdomen to indicate larger body capacity and therefore would be a deceptive measurement . ( Fig. 84a . ) This measurement , if the length of the keel is normal , would indicate the abdominal capacity . The Length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor-board upon which the internal organs of the bird rest . It should have plenty of length rather than be too short . This is because birds with short keels are very likely to break down in the abdomen under very heavy production or when very fat , this being especially true of the general purpose or heavy varieties . ( Fig. 84a . ) A slightly rocker-shaped keel is desired because stronger to resist pressure from above . ( Fig. 84b . ) Lateral Processes. ? The distance between the lateral processes may be used to indicate capacity and laying condition , as well as the physical condition of the bird . This measurement is relatively hard to obtain satisfactorily . The pubic bones indicate the same conditions relative to egg production as the lateral processes . Shanks and Feet. ? The condition of the shanks and feet may be taken as an indication of health and of rrieat or egg production tenden cies . A round , fleshy , coarse-se , iled shank is indicative of a ineat168 BODY TYPE , INTERNAL ANATOMY production tendency whereas a shank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a fleshy appearance is associated with an egg type bird . There is great variation between different breeds and varieties with respect to this character . Combining all of these characters together into one individual would produce a body type which would approximate a rectangle in shape as viewed from one side , slightly longer on the back than the keel and slightly deeper in the rear than in front in the case of the female which is laying heavily , and a body that blends well in all its parts . ( Fig. 85 . ) Such a bird might be called an " ideal egg type , " but since it is entirely possi ble to have such a body in the smallest and the largest birds and with all grades between , and any of them lay a large number of eggs , as far as numbers are concerned , we must limit the term " ideal egg type " to a bird which will lay efficiently and define what is meant by " efficient egg production . " EFFICIENT EGG PRODUCTION " Efficient egg production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eggs laid in one year . The smallest breed might be so bred that under proper feed and management conditions a hen would lay as many small eggs in a year as a larger bird , but it would be unprof itable to produce or sell such eggs commercially . An efficient egg pro ducer , then , might be described as a hen that would lay two hundred or more eggs in one year , all of which would be of desired shape and color and weigh two ounces each or more , or 24 to 28 ounces per dozen . Although theoretically there is a definite type of bird for most efficient egg production the exact size and type has not been demonstrated and agreed upon . Such a bird , according to the general opinion of breeders , will be found in a Single Comb White Leghorn , of standard weight , 4 to 5 pounds . ( Figs. 86 and 87 . ) The general purpose varieties , used for egg production and meat production combined , should weigh from 52 to 7 pounds , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . The males in the case of Leghorns should weigh one pound // more than the females and the General Purpose varieties two pounds more . High egg production , however , may be obtained in a large number of varying body types . This is apparent by the fact that medium egg production is obtained from many differ-ent breeds and varieties of chickens , and if the numer-ous varieties are considered from the standpoint of body type very great variations will be found . If the very best producing Plymouth Rocks , Rhode Island Reds , Leghorns , Wyandottes , and even such a heavy breed as the Brahma , are considered in a class it will be found that they have a similarity of type , as regards body conformation , and balance . In other words , high egg h pate breed differences and produce a type best fitted to efficient egg production . ( Fig. 88 . ) Since a 4- to 5-pound Leghorn or a 52- to 7-pound Plymouth Rock , // Rhode Island Red or Wyandotte has been found large enough for efficient egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger or smaller bird for commercial egg production . The bird first must maintain her body if she is to produce eggs efficiently and remain well , but there seems no justification in maintaining more weight than is necessary to accomplish the objects named . The excess weight must be maintained at a loss so far as egg production is concerned . Therefore , it is apparent that one need not pay much attention to relative weights and measurements as between different birds when judging because a 6-pound hen must necessarily have a wider back than a 3-pound hen if both are normal individuals . The important relationship to consider is the balance between different // sections of the same individual . The highest layers are those that approach perfect production balance . Such a balance exists when each part of an individual is properly developed and coordinated in such a way as to provide a proper working relationship with every other part in order that all may function with the greatest efficiency . Both hens and males must be selected for actual weights and measurements , to conform to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight beyond which it would not be economical to go . In other words , a bird might possess an ideal body type for egg production but be so small that it would not be large enough to produce efficiently , or so large that It could not produce economically . STATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS Several investigators have made external body measurements and observations on large numbers of birds , and worked out mathematical relationships between these measurements and egg production . The results of these investigators have not been in very close agreement , and the work has not shown relationships as significant as were thought by many to exist , where representative samples of the poultry populations studied have been taken . The results of the studies of several investigators are given in Table 10 , expressed in the form of coefficients of correlation , which indicate the manner in which two variables vary with respect to each other . Since annual production is the best measure of a bird 's ability to produce eggs , all correlations given in the table apply to the relation between annual production and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall ( 1926 ) showed a correlation of ? 0.18+0.10 between weight of bird and annual production in the case of 55 birds in dormant condition and - 0.15+0.07 in the case of 81 birds in laying condition . Results. ? By a very careful study of the results of these investigators in their efforts to present statistically the relation between annual egg production and body measurements some very interesting points are illustrated . Of seven different groups of birds studied , five showed no significant relation between weight of bird and annual egg production . The correlations obtained by the other two investigators , though significant , are low in value . It is also interesting to note that the two investigators who found positive correlations between body weight and annual egg production , also found , in most cases , positive correlations between the individual body measurements and annual egg production . On the other hand the investigators who found no correlaSTATISTICAL // tion , or a slight negative correlation with annual egg production , also found little or no relation between the individual body measurements and egg production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , all birds at the time the observations were made were either in heavy laying condition or dormant ; two groups in laying and one dormant were studied . The correlations for these three groups of birds between annual egg produc tion and weight of bird were negative and agreed very closely . In all other cases the groups of birds studied were mixed birds , in all stages of laying or dormant condition . Therefore it may safely be assumed that where a mixed group of birds is used the relationships obtained simply reflect laying condition at the time the observations were made , and not the true relationship between annual production and body measurements , since certain body measurements vary materially in the same bird under different conditions of production and dormancy . Scholten ( 1927 ) reports on body measurements in relation to egg production on 1024 birds , 727 Leghorns and 297 Barnevelds . Only relative measurements were used in this study , the length of back being taken as the constant . The relative values for the different measure ments were obtained by the formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two measurements which are compared , a being expressed in percentage of c , so that c is always the back length . This work led Scholten to conclude as follows : " There exists a positive correlation between various external measurements of the hen and her egg production . This correlation is so slight , however , that it is of no value in selecting the most productive birds according to external characters ; and in both light and medium heavy birds it is too small to be of any practical value . " It is a common observation by poultrymen that the highest produc ers usually are not the largest birds in a flock or strain . This would have to be the condition if a very pronounced , significant , positive cor relation were to exist between body weight or body measurements and annual egg production . On the other hand the tendency is for the size of the body to decrease with continued selection for numbers of eggs without regard to size of eggs or size of bird . Since there is a close rela tionship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected that any body measurement taken alone would tend to have the same relationship with annual production as body weight // itself , and by referring to the results given in the table it will be found that this is what actually occurs . In order then , to determine the true relationship between body measurements and annual egg production , birds must be in the same laying condition . The results of investigations which have been made until the present time have not shown any significant relation to exist between body measurements and numbers of eggs laid , if the birds are all in the same laying condition . However , this does not prove or indicate that there is not a most efficient type for egg production . This can be readily understood if one stops to analyze the problem . Both body type and the ability to produce eggs are inherited , and they are not necessarily inherited together any more than white plumage color is combined or even associated with high or low egg production . They are two entirely separate and distinct factors . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , have a wide back , good heart girth and plenty of capacity , and not be a satisfactory egg producer . However , it is found that most high producers do have bodies well suited to the job because a good body is necessary in order that the inherited factors responsible for high egg production may express themselves . Nevertheless among the poor producers will be found birds with excellent bodies , and it is these birds that may be mistaken for good producers if body measurements are used in judging without the aid of physiological characters such as pigment and molt changes and changes in physical condition , actions , etc. , which have a very close relation to egg production as illustrated in Chapters IV , V and VI . Although actual or relative body measurements may not show a significant relation to numbers of eggs , nevertheless , if a flock of birds is considered as a whole , the size of the body does have a distinct relation to size of egg , the larger birds in a particular strain laying the larger eggs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are large enough to lay desirable sized eggs . Fig. 89 shows the change in body size of two groups of birds over a long period of time . Compare these changes with changes in egg weight during the same period . ( Fig. 132 . ) In summing up the results of investigational work on the subject of body type and body measurements it would seem logical to conclude that there is a definite body type associated with efficient egg production , although due to the lack of the inherited factors for high egg production there are many birds of good egg type which do not produce well . They inherited the factory but without some of the essential machinery installed . They lacked the power plant , so to speak , for driving the egg machinery . They lacked the urge to lay . Hence the well-built factory could not produce . It follows therefore , that in // selecting birds for egg production , they should first have a good body , the factory , but should have associated with this character the physioExcept for sex differences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important respects from those of the female . Generally // males are deeper in front body measurements than females , and are more shallow at the rear of the body . There are no outstanding changes in body measurements in males comparable to changes in distance between the pubic bones and distance from keel to pubic bones in the female , depending upon laying condition . The main differences in body type between males and females are illustrated in Fig. 90 . INTERNAL ANATOMY The relation of internal anatomy to egg producing ability can have only an indirect bearing upon the selection of birds for egg production , as it is impossible to determine accurately and then only by correlation with external characters , the size and type of the internal organs and still retain the individual birds for production . This is because we can not know exactly what the inside of a bird looks like without killing it . It is important , however , to know if a positive relation does exist between various internal organs and egg production . There is no doubt but that a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very little fundamental research work , however , has been done on this subject . Some studies , however , made by Hall , of Cornell University , throw some light upon this important region of the bird . Two lots of birds were examined , both groups being of similar type and breeding . The first group of 55 birds were all in dormant condition when the observations were made , while the second group of 81 birds were all laying . In order to be sure that all birds were in laying condition , the birds were trap-nested . Each bird was allowed to come into laying and lay several eggs . At the time each bird was killed , she was taken from the trapnest with an egg in the oviduct , or was killed within 12 hours of the time she had laid an egg in the trapnest . The relationships found to exist between the weights and measurements of the internal organs and annual production are very similar to those found by the many investigators working on external measurements ; that is , that very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual production . This lack of a positive relationship between these characters is to be expected since we do not find that egg production increases proportionately as size of bird increases . Size of body and size of internal organs are definitely correlated . This study on internal anatomy does , however , bring out some interesting facts . The relations of the internal organs to egg production for the two groups of birds were in very close agreement . It was found that birds when out of production or in a dormant condition weigh less // than when they are ready to begin laying or are in a laying condition . The average weight of the dormant group was 1593 grams ( 3.51 lb. ) while the birds in the laying group averaged 1723 grams ( 3.80 lb . ) . A large part of the difference can be accounted for by differences in the weight of the reproductive organs . The average weight of the ovary and ova of the dormant group was 4.91 grams ( 0.011 lb. ) and in the laying group 51.76 grams ( 0.114 lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . The average weight of the oviduct in the dormant group was 9.27 grams ( 0.020 lb. ) and in the laying group 51.12 grams ( 0.113 lb . ) . This fact alone indicates that it would be impossible to draw any conclusions concerning the true relationship between external or internal body measurements or weights and annual production unless the birds are all in the same condition with respect to their reproductive organs . It is entirely possible , in fact probable , that the same group of birds weighed and measured at different times of the year may give entirely different results , when related to annual egg production , due to the fact that at one time of the year a larger or smaller proportion may be laying than at another time . This actually seems to be what occurs . The birds used for the correlations of annual production with weight of bird in the two groups observed in the study on internal anatomy by Hall , are of the same strain and breeding as the birds studied by Asmundson and Moore , Table 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in dormant condition or all in laying condition , slight negative correlations with weight of bird and annual production were obtained , the correlations for the two groups agreeing very closely . On the other hand , both Asmundson and Moore obtained positive correlations with the groups of birds they studied , but the observations were made when some birds were laying and some were not , and if the measurements were taken in October or November , as some of them were , the best producers still being in production at that time would weigh more than the ones out of production due to their reproductive condition , and hence give a positive correlation with annual production , which would not be the case if the birds compared were all in laying condition , or all in dormant condition . Again it is logical to conclude from the work done on internal anatomy that a bird may have a good body and not lay well ; she may also have a large heart , large lungs , gizzard , intestine and liver , and yet not be an efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urge to lay . If she does have the inherited factors for high ngg production then she must have normal internal organs of good size in order that the factors for egg production may express themselves . Souba ( 1923 ) working on the internal anatomy of cockerels , found // that coefficients of correlation between the body weight and the weights of the different organs of one hundred Single Comb White Leghorn cockerels varies from 0.521 ? 0.05 to 0.801 ? 0.024 . Correlations between the size of testes and size of comb and between the length of testes and length of comb , and between these characters and body weight are high , and indicate that from a knowledge of the body weight and development of the comb one can predict the sexual development of cockerels . Heuser ( 1918 ) found that males with high-egg ancestry developed combs more rapidly than males with low-egg ancestry . ( Fig. 91 . ) This difference disappeared as the males reached maturity . PHYSICAL CONDITION Physical condition is very closely related to what is commonly known as " handling quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . ( Fig. 92 . ) Comb. ? The comb is one of the best indications of the laying con dition of a bird . The comb of a pullet will begin to expand and take on a red color before she lays her first egg and will be full , red and waxy at the time production begins . It will remain of good size until laying ceases , when it shrinks and becomes dry and scaly . ( Plate I. ) After the hen has recuperated and is ready to lay again the comb assumes // very much the same appearance as it did when she began to lay as a pullet . The temperature and color of the comb will change very materially , depending upon whether the bird is quiet or in an excited condition . Plumage. ? Size , shape and color of plumage apparently have little relation to egg production . High-producing birds generally have more brittle feathers and hence more rough and broken feathers than do low producers which are continually renewing their plumage . High producers often have very close feathering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin on the face is an indication of laying condition , and reacts very much the same as the color in the comb . A clean-cut condition of the face is desired , neither too full or fat or too sunken . Thickness of skin may be indicated to some degree by the skin on the face . Skin. ? Thickness , looseness , elasticity and pliability of skin all indi cate laying condition . Hens if laying heavily will have a very loose , pliable skin , which will thicken due to the accumulation of fat , and become hard and dry and very tight when a hen is not in laying condi tion , as illustrated in Fig. 93 . The best hens have a thinner , more pliable skin than do low producers , if the two are compared when
