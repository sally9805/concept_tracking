Liberal lawyers hold that the law flourishes by truing up ever more wisely with new and unblinkable social conditions . Liberal artists conceive the tradition of the fine arts as involving a like growth and adaptation . Occasionally , in each field , progress in interpretation is marked by a commentary so learned as to become a classic . Published last week was a serious book which may well become a sort of Blackstone on Coke to future art students . The subject : The Art of Cezanne* The commentators : Albert C. Barnes and Violette de Mazia . Dr. Albert Coombs ( ' ' Argyrol " ) Barnes of Merion , Pa. got his nickname , his millions , and his great collection of French paintings from the product* he trademarked in 1902 and manufactured until 1930 . He got his artistic taste from the sound advice of the late William Glackens ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) , from persistent study and from the inquisitive philosophy of his friend John Dewey ( see p. 56 ) . White-headed , black-browed Dr. Barnes got his temper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who have offended him the full-blooded doctor has often publicly kicked in the teeth , with obstreperous rhetoric . In 1937 it was the Pennsylvania Museum , for buying what the doctor considered a fifth-rate Cezanne ( TIME , Nov. 29 , 1937 ) . Now revealed in more dignified terms ( thanks , possibly , to Collaborator de Mazia , an instructor and researcher at the choosey Barnes Foundation ) are the Barnes qualifications on that subject . <P> They are impressive . From the fully assembled data of Cezanne 's life , Collaborators Barnes and de Mazia have , for one thing , interpreted his personality with more enlightenment and justice than any pro or con writers have been able to do . His everlasting self-distrust , compensatory self-assertion , slowness and difficulty with his medium they freely concede . But Cezanne 's knowledge of painting and the profound calculation and power of his real triumphs they fully establish . Not only the effect of these paintings , which other critics have expressed not quite so well : " Fundamentally they are static , not inert or dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buttress is active . . . . Composed not only in the usual sense of having their parts disposed in an orderly arrangement , but in the sense in which we speak of a person 's ' composure . ' . . . " But also , in exhaustive detail and supplemented by analyses of 81 paintings ( 147 are reproduced ) , the means by which the effect was attained , e. g. , an economy which used the same brush strokes to create volumes , to set them in deep perspective , and to make a decorative , mosaic-like surface pattern . <P> Though the Barnes-de Mazia book ( their fourth in collaboration ) + was not quite on the dot to celebrate the centenary of Paul Cezanne 's birth ( Jan. 19 , 1839 ) , it clarified considerably the reasons for celebration . <P> <P> *Harcourt , Brace ( $5 ) . *Argyrol was the first silver compound found strong enough to kill gonococci without injuring delicate membranes of eyes , nose , throat , bladder .
