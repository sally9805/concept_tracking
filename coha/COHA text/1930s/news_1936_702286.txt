txt The testimonial dinner for the Charter Revision Commission at the Waldorf-Astoria last night , be-1 came the setting for presenting the plans for a fusion campaign in 1937 , to perpetuate " nonpartisan city government . " Mayor La Guardia in somewhat veiled language , later amplifiedl by Thomas D. Thacher , chairman of the charter commission , indicated what he thought would be the consequences of a return to the city to machine control . " The Mayor has suggested to you where the victory is to be won , " Mr. Thacher said . " He did n't name names , but if that political organization or those five political organizations ( that had fought the ? charter ) control the government of this city on Jan. 1 , 1938 , that or- ganization will exploit this charter with the consequences he has in dicated . " Then you may say , instead of celebrating a victory for better government in this city , ' to the spoilsmen of this city belongs the victory of the charter fight . ' Warns on Next Election " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one with sensitive ears can hear a cynical laugh , when your chairman ( Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , who presided ) calls this a true victory . Iti comes from those who hope , nay , in the strength of their faith , expect and demand political resurrec-1 tion in the next municipal election . I " Even now they are planning to exploit or wreck this instrument of 1 public government . They would as j soon kill the child after it has been horn as they would before election . and , as the Mayor has pointed out to you . this is the process which they are now engaged in , in so far as county government is concerned . " Mayor La Guardia had , in somewhat mild language , attacked the Democratic organizations for blocking county government reform , say-1 Mg : " Only a year ago the people of . this State voted a constitutional amendment abolishing certain county offices , merging others , transferring the duties of those that are to be abolished , and leaving the necessary enactment into law to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal assembly . And up to this date no local law has been enacted to carry out the mandate of that constitutional amendment . No provision has been made ! ! and yet we had the election of a Sheriff in one of the counties notI withstanding the constitutional amendment . " Now surely the people of this city are not going to be indifferent to the refusal to carry out a mandate , the highest form of legislation , that of a constitutional amendment or a referendum vote . And these gentlemen of the commission , ! who have labored so long and patiently , certainly deserve the support that the people of this city must give to them to see to it that the new charter comes into being on Jan. 1 , 1938 , and is put into sympathetic hands . City Planning Commission " Now , the charter provides for a planning commission with real powers and not theory . It is per-1 feet , it is desirable , it is necessary , and it will be successful if the right kind of persons are appointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistakes , all the neglect , all the indifference , all the selfishness of the past , in the building of this city , will be multiplied . It therefore becomes exceedingly important that the first commission be composed of men who have an understanding of the problem and establish a tradition so that no matter what happens there will never be a possibility of a planning commission to wreck all that has been accomplished . " The members of the first City Planning Commission will be appointed by the Mayor to be elected next Fall . There was no direct reference at any time to the possibility of the Mayor himself being a candidate for re-election . Dr. Butler Lauda Thacher Dr. Butler , who had spoken on charters and city planning in Dutch and Colonial times , arose near the end of the meeting and said : " That speech of Judge Thacher 's was a great and challenging speech . It behooves us to organize the charter campaign committee without delay into a charter defense committee and see to it that we heed the warning Judge Thacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this next battle ? " Mr. Thacher had asked . " We have a different situation when we get into that campaign . It will not be a nonpartisan issue as such issues are regarded . But after all , why should n't it be ? As Dr. Butler indicated , it is n't a question of a Republican administration , a Democratic or a Socialist administration ; it is a question of good government and good men in government , be they Democrats , Socialists , or Communists . " Is it possible for this city under your leadership and your influence to repeat this charter victory ? I have faith that it is , but it is not too soon to begin now , and it is to begin to pursue exactly the same technique in a campaign of public education on two or three or four issues ; first the issue of county government , which is directly related to the same problems of city administration with which the charter deals . " People asked us why we did n't deal with it in the charter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abolish offices , when the constitution of the State had already done so ? That record demonstrates the bad faith and the untrustworthiness of the organizations now controlling the municipal assembly . Those men will seek office again to continue their sabotag- ? ing of the people 's will . That is issue No. 1 . Administration of Charter " Issue No. 2 is to explain to the people , as the Mayor suggested , the vital questions involved in this charter and its administration by men who will serve with an eye single to the interests of the people and to the growth and development of this city . There is an issue which must be placed before the people in a long and intensive campaign of public education . " Then there is the question of the codification of all the law relating to the city . The charter will not be completed until that job , which has been so ably carried on by Reuben Lazarus and Major Meyer , is completed , and it is approaching completion . It is under supervision and control of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finish the work and to relate it to the charter itself . That board is composed of thet Mayor , the Corporation Counsel and the Controller . " If that board proceeds free of political domination and control , that job will be done and done well , because of the men who are actually doing the work . If it is i completed under the domination of other auspices , it will be sabotaged as the county offices have . " And then there is a fourth issue , the greatest issue that this city faces today , and that is the domination and control of political organizations over the process and prosecution of crime . " Present at the dinner were pracIdeally all of the men who had been active in the Fusion campaign in 1933 , and in the audience of approximately 1,000 persons there were a large number of officeholders in the Fusion administration . The dinner was arranged by the Merchants Association , in conjunction with the State Chamber of Commerce , the New York Board of Trade , the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staten Island Chamber of Commerce , City Club , Citizens Union , Bar Association , New York County Lawyers Association , New York Building Congress , Real Estate Board of New York , League of Women Voters and the Women 's City Club .
