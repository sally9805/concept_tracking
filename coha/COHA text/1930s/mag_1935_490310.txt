TOO many demands are being made on our time by industrialists and their agents . Our article about throwing walnuts against a windowpane so stirred a plate-glass company that they actually shipped us a piece of glass ( heat-treated ) and a two-pound sack of black walnuts and invited us to throw to our heart 's content , and see if we could bust the glass . What we discovered , after twenty minutes of pitching curves and spit-walnuts , was how quickly a writer can throw his arm out . The glass did not break , which left the plate-glass company victor and ourself feeling strangely defeated . A psychologist would probably be interested to know that we were unable to resume our work till we had taken a heavy iron paperweight and heaved it through the pane . That got it . N. W. Ayer &; Son , equally careless of our time , recently sent us some photographs of the motor van used by Prince Mdivani for transporting his polo ponies from one playing field to the other . The photographs were submitted " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a horse van was just one of the ten thousand tiny problems that make our week a living hell , or , as it is sometimes called around here , dying hell . It is a wonderful thing to know that the Prince has a way of getting his ponies from one field to another , just as it is a wonderful thing to know that bath sponges can be bought in pastel shades or that the American Bison Society met the other day , found bison increasing , and elected a president . But what to do about these things ! Luckily , we 're not completely unresourceful . We 're sending N. W. Ayer &; Son a glossy print of the shoes which we use in transporting ourself from one water-cooler to another . For their consideration . NOBODY has ever justly accused the United States Navy of lying down in an emergency . When someone is in distress , the Navy is right on hand . As an ardent follower of the sea branch of our armed forces , we can report that , to our notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was never quite so heroically disassociated from the sea , as last week when a Navy plane was dispatched to carry food to a snowbound farmer living on an experimental blueberry farm owned by an absent chiropractor . It was just one of those New Jersey vicissitudes which illustrate the enormously intricate problem of our national defence . ANEW YORKER 'S seasons are more a matter of the eager mind than of the weather . With snow deep in the hills , it is almost strawberry time in Manhattan . We expect to find the ripe red berry any day now on the menu . Already it is spring in the advertiser 's heart ; and the fabric people , knowing that earth will soon be a maiden again , have wedded poetry and silk . We have received , from Baker-Schwab , a folder called " A Baker-Schwab Exclusivity , " which shows the new dress prints , each illustrative of a famous nature poem . Huddled here by our radiator , with the Harvard Club 's chimney blowing a cold plume of smoke into the red winter west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a James Whitcomb Riley creation ) : " You pause to lop a creamy spray Of elder-blossoms by the way , " new bolero buttons down the back , and underneath a shirred yoke with string loops lacing through rhinestone rings down the shoulder . And another swatch of a world-soul gown ( a Ralph Waldo Emerson creation ) : " Spring still makes spring in the mind When sixty years are told ; Love wakes anew this throbbing heart , And we are never old , " the peasant sleeve combined with the sophisticated Schiaparelli neck . We like to think , on this cold afternoon , of Emerson , dead , these fifty years , living again , self-reliant , in a Schiaparelli neck , in a 1935 exclusivity . WALK east on Forty-third Street V from Broadway and you encounter one of the more pungent of the city 's contradictions . First a sign in Childs window , where a girl swinging within a clock dial announces that " Time changes , Childs has changed , too . " Next door the Gospel Mission , where one reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forever . " Oh , that Childs , unlike Time , would cease to change and be not merely sanitary but Christlike ! We used to go to Childs for wheatcakes and balm ; now we 're half scared to go , for fear we 'll have to sit through a floor show . SPEAKING of finding peace amid the clank of life 's dishes and the treachery of its doilies , a woman friend of ours has related a pitiful tale of a woman who went to Macy 's restaurant , in search of her soul . She was shown to a table occupied by two other women . For a moment she hesitated , then she turned to the hostess and said in a trembling voice : " I came here to he alone . There are times I just got to he alone and this is one of them . Ca n't you please find me a place ? " She was a large woman , and lier trouble seemed to be heavy around her like a cloud . There was no empty table . Our friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great woman , shaken with g : ofand wanting solitude , threading her way out of the room , frustrated and bereft , was a very sad sight indeed . Last Ride HAVING resolved in a moment of sentiment to be present at the passing of the Madison Avenue trolley service , we journeyed up to 135th Street on a cold , bitter evening . January was dying by minutes , and in February ( at the stroke of midnight , in fact ) the new buses were to start . Standing about the car barn were a lot of cold people whose connection with the affair seemed more professional than sentimental . Some photographers appeared , tracking down an insane rumor that the Mayor was coming up for a ride on the first bus ; disillusioned , they morosely fell to taking pictures of Car 2075 , which was to make the last run . The reporters ' search for bona-fide passengers was rewarded , just before we pulled out , by the appearance of three colored ladies . The motorman was Mr. John Sheridan . but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored by the assignment . It just happened to be his regular run , and nobody else had asked for the job . His mind was full of tomorrow , when he would have a new gray uniform and a new streamlined bus . His attitude was discouraging . We pulled out of the car barn at exactly 11:55 , with the publicity man 's blessing , and his solemn word that we it had paid any fares . A Mr. Everett White , a small , active man who carried a briefcase , had been hesitating for a long time , torn between the desire to be the last passenger on the last car , and the first on the first bus ; at the last moment he plumped for the car . However , after we had banged down Madison Avenue for twenty or thirty blocks , he decided to get of and wait for the bus . We kept looking for sentimental last-riders among the people who got on , but did n't see any . They were just the ordinary run of people going home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " La Traviata " rolled up in her lap , a man wearing a derby hat and yellow string gloves , a woman with four roses wrapped up in green paper . A little touch of drama was unfolded when the first bus , which had started some five minutes after us , pulled up behind us at a red light in the upper Sixties . Mr. White rejoined us , full of news . First woman bus-rider was a Miss Edith Kennedy , of the Bronx , who was accompanied by a Mr. Joe Raby . The reporters had discovered among the passengers a Negro named Al Smith , and were elated . The company was giving out pamphlets , " The Passing of New York 's Pioneer Street Railway , " and Mr. White had two . He also had one of the first bus transfers , autographed by Mr. Sheeran , president of the line . We were n't to worry about being passed by the bus , because the driver had strict orders to respect our sentimentality . This last news turned out to be wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up alongside us , and an official ordered Mr. Sheridan to call everything off at Forty-second Street and go back to the car barn ; the passengers could transfer to the bus , he said . Innocent Abroad M RS. wife of the COCHRAN , Lon-the don producer , has al-ways had difficulty about people 's names , and long ago she work-ed out a little formula to avoid embar-rassment . When she meets somebody she is n't sure about , she gives him her hand and murmurs , " It 's so nice to see a friend of Charles ' . " That usually makes everybody happy , but it led to a complication the other afternoon . She had taken a taxi from her hotel , and pretty soon , when it got stopped by a light , a tall , melancholy roan put his hand in at the window . After but a moment 's hesitation , Mrs. Cochran took it , pressed it warmly , and murmured her sentence about Charles . The stranger , looking baffled , withdrew his hand quickly , leaving the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flustered , fumbled in her bag . The first thing her fingers lit on was a five-dollar bill , and she handed this through the window , hoping vaguely that the incident was closed . It gaped a little , though . The cabman , who had taken it all in , turned around and looked at her severely . " I ought to take you home , lady , " he said . " You ai n't safe in the streets . " Tea-Testing VERY day this past week , from ID A.M. until 2 P.M. , with no time out for lunch , the seven gentlemen comprising the United States Board of Tea Experts for 1935 have been meeting in the United States Appraisers Stores on Varick Street in the government 's annual tea-testing bee . They sit around a table with a revolving top ? a little smaller , perhaps , than the average dinner table , and with a pair of scales and some boxes of tea in the centre , and a line of thin china cups around the edge  --  and go through a ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done . They must taste each sample of tea sent in by the trade this year . As the table revolves , a pinch of tea is put into each cup , and hot water is poured upon it . Then the testing begins . Each tester sniffs his cup intently . Then he dips a deep-howled spoon into it and brings up some of the infused tea leaves , which he also sniffs . Then , after the tea has cooled a bit , he takes a spoonful into his mouth and quickly spits it out into a one-gallon cuspidor he has handy . A tester rarely swallows any tea , and he never misses the cuspidor . After the testing is done , each sample is discussed . Mostly the discussion is brief , the testers agreeing on the elimination of samples that are either superior or inferior to government " minimum standards . " Of the three hundred samples , all arc gradually eliminated save eight , one for each of the general classifications of tea shipped into the United States  --  Scented Orange Pekoe , Formosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the official " minimum standard " which will guide the government in its admittance or exclusion of tea over the period of a year . it 's toward the end of the session that the real discussion comes , when the samples begin to narrow down to the final eight . Then the testers sit around , resmelling , retastimz , and arguing as solemnly as the Supreme Court justices discussing the gold-clause question . Once the eight " minimum standard " teas have been selected , samples are sent to the tea examiners at all American ports of tea entry , to important tea-shipping centres abroad , and sold to the trade at cost . Up to 1897 , when Congress passed the Tea Act , which created the board , the tea examiners , lacking fresh annual official samples , had nothing much to go on but their memories . Now their lives are made easier by the seven ex perts , who meet every twelve months . These seven are chosen each year by the Secretary of Agriculture from " responsible elements of the tea trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner at New York . This city is chosc n for the testing because it 's the big tea port of the country . Changes in the board have been infrequent during its thirty-eight years . The only new member this year , for example , is Mr. Hellyer , of a Chicago tea firm . Except for an interval of a few years , Mr. Andrew P. Irwin , of Philadelphia , has been on the board ever since its foundation . The members get fifty dollars and expenses for attending ; it 's really the prestige they enjoy . They do n't go through any special training before their annual testing week , for all the year around their business involves testing tea . Most tea experts are tea-lovers as well , we arc told . Mr. Hutchinson , chief tea examiner in New York , never drinks less than three cups a day , even though in his day 's work he will test from sixty to three hundred samples , and occasionally his tongue " feels like a piece of tripe . " Mr. Irwin avoids this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above about all the testers taking the tea into their mouths . He never tastes in testing ; just smells . That may be why he 's lasted so long . E feic JAN upstate gentleman has sent us a nature note . After the first snow of the season , he says , a gray squirrel began to come to his window for food . The gentleman got in some nuts and fed them to him . One day , though , he was out of nuts , and in his extremity offered peanut butter . The squirrel gagged on it at first , but after the second try learned to eat it slowly . Now he wo n't eat nuts at all . Sheer case of decadence . 101 Night Letters WE made a thorVV nugh investigation in the case of the elf who two or three weeks ago sent out a batch of Western Union night letters , over Jules Glaenzer 's name , inviting a number of persons to a farewell party for Barbara Hutton Mdivani . We had fallen to wondering what happens under such circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borderland between crime and good , clean fun , depending on how much of a rumpus the victim wants to make . The police told us that ordinarily the culprit , if caught , would n't be charged with anything more serious than disorderly conduct . He might , they said , be charged with some special kind of forgery or impersonation , but they were a little vague about these points . A complication in the Glaenzer case is that the prankster would probably turn out to be somebody High Up : a friend of Mr. Glaenzer 's , or someone Mr. Glaenzer has always thought of as a friend . However , the police said , brightening , there 's no use borrowing trouble ; they are n't at all likely to catch him . He ca n't he traced through his handwriting , because the telegrams and names were typewritten , and the police have only the vaguest description of him . He just went up to the Western Union counter in the Grand Central , filed the telegrams , and then " vanished into thin air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prank was a flop , for Mr. Glaenzer got wind of it at ten in the morning , and this gave him plenty of time to get in touch with Western Union , which obliged him to the extent of agreeing to let him send nut day letters , explaining the situation , to the same addressees . There were one hundred and one day letters to send , and it cost him $45.45 , whereas the stranger had had to pay only $22 for the same number of night letters . Mr. Glaenzer ran a few words into extra charges , we noticed , calling his persecutor a moron and a stupid idiot , but he doubtless felt it was worth it . Among the people Mr. Glaenzer had to break the news to were twenty total strangers , the entire cast of " Anything Goes ! , " the chorus at the Paradise Restaurant , and the housemothers of two questionable resorts , who were asked to come and bring along five young ladies each . Mr. Glaenzer swears he caught everybody in time , spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a single knock at the door . We cornered a Western Union official and asked him how often this sort of thing happened . Well , he said , not looking us in the eye , he did n't think it had ever happened before . We did n't say anything , but we knew it had . Three winters ago , Mme. Alma Clay-burgh 's name was signed to about two hundred wires to writers , musicians , and whatnot , asking them to contribute their professional services to a " Wampum Week " she was getting up for charity . It would have been quite an affair if it had gone through : Walter Damrosch , for instance , was asked to participate , with his orchestra . These telegrams were typewritten too , but there was a handwritten correction on one of them , and some time later Mme. Clayburgh received a check for some tickets to a charity affair , and  --  yes , that 's it . Turned out to be a young woman she knew quite well . She did n't do anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Union man to whom we talked said that while V. U. did all it could to assist victims of fake signatures on telegrams , it could n't he held responsible . There 's no law requiring the sender of a wire to identify himself . A clerk , at his discretion , may ask for identification . This means that if you try to send any night letters signed " Jules Glaenzer " for a while , you 'll be questioned closely . Up From the Depths AWRESTLER from Brooklyn College came to grips with a wrestler from St. John 's College before a small but attentive audience one night recently , in the basement of one of the Brooklyn College buildings . The bout was gruelling , or , as they say across the river , groolling . The wrestlers fought hard , grew sweaty and dirty . Their movements became slower , more painful . When they were near exhaustion , a lone rooter broke the silence . " Come on , Karpen ! " he yelled to the man on top . At this the underdog solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooter . " The name is Goldblatt , " he sighed , gently . Gullet pVERYBODY 'S violating the law -y again , it turns out , just as they did during prohibition . Since January 1st , you 've been liable to a fine of one thousand dollars or two years ' imprisonment or both for every time you threw a liquor bottle away without breaking it . If you gave it to your janitor and he did n't break it , you were both liable . The rag-and-bottle man was liable , too , if he bought it . You ca n't even give a bottle away . The law was made effective with the new year , over the squawks of the distillers and rectifiers ( and the cheers of the bottle-makers , who smell six or seven millions a year in added business ) , and was first manifest here when federal agents confiscated over a million unbroken bottles in the possession of second-hand dealers , most of whom had never heard a thing about the matter . Restaurants and hotels , trying to he legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're told a vast number of people are being treated at hospitals for cuts . One place hired girls as bottle-smashers and armored them in heavy rubber ponchos , gloves , and helmets ; not a girl lasted more than two days uninjured . We knew about this situation only vaguely until we looked up a Mr. Halbert P. Hill , who stands ready to lead the way out of the wilderness of broken glass that seems to he threatening us all . A subscriber found the name of the Banner Bottle Breaker Company in the phone book and asked us to investigate . Mr. Hill , we discovered , is presi dent of the company . He 's an engineer , mostly occupied with big refrigeration plants . He built Ruppert 's ice-making establishment , largest in the world . In getting permits to build distilleries , he had dealings with the federal alcohol commission , and last June he heard about the bottle-breaking law . It suddenly dawned on him that it would take machinery to do all the breaking that lay ahead , and the Banner Bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you can drop any bottle up to a magnum ( itself illegal Last we heard ) and smash it into half-inch pieces , the edges of which are ground down until they are practically harmless . The pieces are called " culler . " " Culler " is also used as a verb , it seems . Mr. Hill told us his machine will " cullet " thirty-five bottles a minute . He 's sold over a hundred Banners to date , at $150 . His company is planning a smaller model at about half that price for apartment houses , small restaurants , etc. , and also an ambulatory service which will start next week . Trucks with smashing machines in them will pull up before a customer 's door , smash away , and drive off with the collet . An electric wire will he run from the truck into the oilsterrier 's building to tap electric current , and this , so the company has been assured , will satisfy the federal regulation that the breaking must be done " on the premises . " Childs tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and bust them there , but this was n't ellowed . One problem that arises , naturally , is what to de with your cutlet . Mr. Hill is hound that broken glass wo n't go the way of old razor blades , and he 's , working on several things . In the first place , cullet free of corks , metal , and so on , and run through the machine one color at a time , is worth seven dollars a ton for remelting . Ground up , it can he used as a substitute for caibon black in making automobile tires . Also , Mr. Hill is dickering with the state highway people to put cullet in guard posts along roads ( it sparkles swell at night ) and with house-builders to set it in the walls of stucco houses . Any way you look at it , this is a funny country . ff Key THIS youngster Yehudi Menuhin ( he 's eighteen now , if our addition is correct ) has a quicker sense of humor than certain other violinists you could name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play on a very elegant broadcasting hour  --  the General Motors Symphony Concert Hour ? and the gentleman in charge was a hit restive . He came into the artists ' room of the Center Theatre in Radio City , where the conceits arc given before a tremendous picked audience of Cadillac owners , and approached Yehudi . " By the way , " he began , " we 've got a pretty tight program , tonight , so we ca n't  --  ah  --  have any waits much between numbers . Now . . . " " Oh , you mean about the applause ? " smiled Yehudi . " Yes , that 's it , " said the concert manager , " Well , I 'll tell you what we 'll do , " said the young man . " If there 's too much applause after my first number , you stand in the wings and hold up two fingers while I 'm playing the second . Then I 'll just play a couple of sour notes and there wo n't be any applause . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
