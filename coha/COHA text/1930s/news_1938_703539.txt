" Many persons saw in these editorials an attempt to force President Lazaro Cardenas to refuse the arbitration proposals . Although the Government Press Department prohibits officials from commenting publicly on any matter , the opinion is freely expressed in private that Secretary of State Cordell Hull 's - demands have put President Cardenas on the spot . The President , who is on his country estate with troops keeping the curious more than a mile away from his dwelling , is seen as forced either to lose national prestige by backtracking upon all his public declarations and policies through accepting arbitration or else defying the United States , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienating the more conservative elements in Mexico and facing possible reprisals . Public Is Thunderstruck According to many opinions in political circles , the United States note makes vacillation impossible and has finally driven home to Mexicans - generally that the United States does not approve of the President 's extreme **30;179;TOOLONG course . The public is still thunderstruck . All eyes are turned on President Cardenas who alone will decide which course to follow . The President is scheduled next Thursday to open the regular sessions of Congress with a speech on the state of the nation and subsequently to address the " constituent assembly " of the Latin American Labor Federation on Sept .. -5 . It is believed that there- will be some delay in answering the United States note and it is thought possible that President Cardenas may give an indication of the attitude that he plans to assume - in one of these speeches . AIn more radical labor circles the hope is expressed that President Cardenas will defy the United States and declare in favor of an even more extreme course at the meeting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unlikely , bat not impossible . John L. Lewis is expected to arrive on Tuesday to attend the labor sessions . The press noted today an announcement of the formation of a new militia " to defend the fatherland against communism . " It is understood that the German legation is supporting the move , but in general is keeping away from the organization . The Mexican Labor Confederation unions some months ago formed a uniformed labor militia and this is a countermove . There is no discussion in the press or streets about the need for supporting the . good neighbor policy , the only consideration apparently being what is best for Mexico . The Noticias claims that it is very well known that Mexico has not the money for immediate payment . " In regard to the demand that no further American properties be seized , that is a restriction upon the sovereignty that our country I enjoys , " it says . " When force is exercised by ' the stronger upon the weaker either with or without reason , it can not be termed friendly without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to pass from words to deeds . " Note Praised by Americans American and other foreign business circles praised the note warmly , regarding it as " measured , complete and to the point . " It was hoped that it would lead to the straightening out of difficulties and to a resumption of trade'by halting the extremist course . Diplomatic circles applauded the note as a frank expression of opinion given in the friendliest manner . Universal 's Chihuahua correspondent reports today that the auditor of the r4lroad unions arrived there prepared to take over the management of the Kansas City , Mexico &; Orient ' and Mexico-Northwestern Railroads . Both are Americanowned , ' the first-named being.leased to the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe . Both operate in Northwestern Mexico . While the liniversal says that the companies have agreed to turn over - to the unions rather than to pay wage increases , this is denied by the president of both lines in a dispatch from El Paso , Texas . Further Expropriation The National Railways Union management here , however , confirmed the taking over of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree &; nationalizing 22,692 acres of farrn " and grazing land in the State of Hidalgo belonging to the American heirs of the late William G. Nourse . The land will be divided among 581 peasants . Although Mr. Nourse acquired the property in 1907 , the government claims that the land was taken from the Indians by  --  the township in 1884 , being sold to one Wenceslao whence , after passing through the hands of three different owners , it became the property of Mr. Nourse . The government therefore explains that it is merely " returning " the land to its proper owners . President Cardenas only received the United States note at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon and therefore the publication of this expropriation is not regarded as a defiance of the United States wishes that there be no further seizures . Report Disturbs Hull Special to TAM NEW YOWL Tlisilea . WASHINGTON , Aug. 26 . ? A reliort by a news agency today that there had been further large seizures of American-owned land in Mexico disturbed Secretary of State Cordell Hull . At first it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chihuahua immediately following Mr. Hull 's strong request in his note that seizures cease . As later details of the affair arrived , however , it was evident that the expropriations had been made over a period of weeks and months and were not a new development . At a press conference this morning Mr. Hull courteously but firmly declined to amplify the test of his note , although correspondents asked several questions based on the fact that the text of the note referred to an apparent exchange of views during the long negotiations which had never been made public . The Secretary was asked , in the light of this reading , whether Mexico had not already declined to submit to the type of arbitration suggested in his communication . Mr. Hull said that he could not discuss these matters at this time . The Mexican problem is obviously the most vexing one ' in the field of foreign affairs now before the Administration , for it involves a precedent , defended by Mexico but de-. nounced as international immorality by this government , which has direct bearing on billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republics . Pacifists Make Protest The precedent that Mexico seeks to establish is to the effect that any country m.iy take over property according to its economic needs , either without compensation or with payment deferred into the indefinite future , if the government of the country taking this action deems it expedient . The United States Government 's problem was further complicated today by the expression of one phase of public opinion , voiced by the National Council for the Prevention of War , which asked in a public statement whether " we are dealing , differently with Mexico and our European debtors like Great Britain and France . " The council also inquired whether demands for payment to landholders " cover real pressure for payment to American oil companies that have , according to all accounts , received already many times the amount of their investment . " " The American people have every reason to avoid , on this continent , " the council added , " the mistakes of Europe which led. to the civil war in Spain .
