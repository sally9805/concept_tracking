txt Statistics and Allowances . I was greatly interested to read in THE TIMES the report before the American Statistical Association , that unless the average person can afford $5 a week for food , he is underfed and can not maintain health for any length of time . Of course this applies only to the low ' wage earners ; but how about those who have to depend on the pitiful allowance the Home Relief thinks is sufficient to live on ? A family of four have to live on less than $6 a week ; in other words , less than $1.50 a head , and out of that $2 a week goes for milk alone to feed the children on . I suppose , however , this lingering starvation is better than dying outright . There are always plenty of promises that " it ca n't keep up forever . " , JAMES VA1VN .
