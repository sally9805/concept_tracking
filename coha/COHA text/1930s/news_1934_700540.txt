txt Pelham Bay Park Service . In a letter to THE TIMES some time ago William G. Fullen , chairman of the Transit Commission , argued that a Pelham Bay express service would not be beneficial from the standpoint of saving time . Granted , but it undoubtedly would have a decided effect in minimizing the present outrageous congestion , and that surely is a worthy objective in itself . Under the present system many passengers for stations between 125th Street and Hunts Point Road needlessly congest the Pelham Bay train ; when the Hunts Point Road trains will serve them as well and with more comfort . It is this unreasoning attitude that must be thwarted . It strikes me that a change is imperative . I suggest the adoption of the express service , or at least the abandonment of the trains that terminate at Hunts Point Road and Third Avenue and their replacement by more Pelham . Bay Park trains .
