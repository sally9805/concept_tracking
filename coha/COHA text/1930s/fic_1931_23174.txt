THE LOST ROMANCE A STORY BY LORD DUNSANY AL L through the summer Jorkens had told us no story . He often lunched at the Billiards Club , but it was never his custom to talk much while he was eating , and afterwards he used to rest in a chair . I would not say he slept ; it was rather more of a torpor ; and , although he muttered sometimes , he told no story . Nobody minded ; there are all sorts of things to do in summer : gardening , golf , weeding lawns , and a hundred other things that take up one 's time and one 's interest and give one plenty to talk about , without needing to listen to Jorkens . I recollect one member of our club telling me a story about gardening . It was not in the least true , but it served to pass the time away and entitled one to tell a similar tale in return . Then someone else would talk of his garden , and so on . And all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , when gardening was over , when the days grew short in London almost suddenly , and the fog and the night began to shut down upon us in earnest , then it hardly seemed that any tales we might tell could bring back to our memories any ray of lost summer , and some of us naturally turned to Jorkens then ; for , whatever we may think of the method he had of inspiring himself , his tales had at any rate an origin in lands that shimmered with sunshine , and he seemed to have the knack of bringingsome of it to us through the dark and early evening that hung bleak by our windows . So one November day , quite early in the month , I took the liberty of talking to Jorkens while he rested after his lunch ; and though he did not immediately recall who I was , or follow the trend of my remarks , I certainly brought back his attention to us , so that later on when another of us referred to one or two of his earlier gallantries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not speak . He did not speak until he had had some refreshment that I was only too glad to provide for him ; and then I questioned him directly . I had framed my question with some care , knowing that the unusual had an unfailing attraction for Jorkens . " Have you ever failed , " I asked , " in any affair with a lady ? " For a moment he seemed about to say " No , " when the banality of such an answer froze the word on his lips , and for several seconds he appeared deep in thought . " Only once , " said Jorkens . " No , only once . Oh , it is a long time ago now , and it was a long , long way from here . tell you . It was in the island of Anaktos . You probably do n't know it , in the Mediterranean , far away from here . In the Mediterranean in the early summer . Well , it 's all gone now . But that summer in Anaktos I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pepper trees in the bright morning . There were eighteen of them , sisters of the Greek Reformed Church . They had a convent on the island , and it was easy to see where she came from ; that was not the difficulty . The difficulty was in speaking to her at all or in even seeing her face . Yes , they do n't wear cowls , those sisters , they veil themselves completely . They wear white gloves , too : you do n't see an inch of skin . They have some sort of holy saying that where a fly can alight there is room for Satan . Well , there it was , you see . And yet , for all that , I got the idea  --  and never have I had any idea more strongly  --  that she was extraordinarily beautiful . She was tall and slender and she had lovely hands and she walked with a stride as graceful and light as the step of any young antelope , slipping unseen from the forest on hoofs unheard by the lions . Of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her eyes . " She walked third on the left , of the eighteen . It was a difficult situation . I was determined to speak to her alone ; and you can do that even when they are walking with seventeen others if once you can catch their eye ; but when you can not even see their eyes , you can not make any sign to one more than to the whole lot . Even if I waited at a corner and made a sign just as she came round .. . no , there seemed no way of doing it . Oh , I did a lot of thinking . I thought of leaving a note in the path with a leaf over it , and pulling the leaf away with a bit of silk just as the second two passed it , and it would be right before her . She always walked in the same place in that procession . But that would have been no use , because they would have all seen her stoop to pick it up , and I knew where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first saw the procession that it would come the same way every day at the same hour , except of course on saints ' days ; and , sure enough , it did . And every day my belief in her surpassing beauty grew stronger , and for a week I could think of nothing that was any good at all . They 'd a good wall at the convent , quite ten feet high , and broken glass on the top that did n't look to me particularly Christian . But it was n't the wall that stopped me but the impossibility of finding her if I got over , before I found one of the others , or nine of them for that matter , for that 's what the odds were . If I threw a note over , the odds were no better ; and of course I did n't even know her name . " Well , at the end of the week the idea came to me . Of course all great ideas are simple ones ; but I 'd been thinking too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when it did come l can take no credit for it : I did n't get it by thinking . I was walking to a place , a little wood , where I could be alone and think things out , one day when she had passed me for the seventh or eighth time , with that gentle and beautiful stride , her hands swaying very softly like slightly wind-blown flowers ; I was pushing into the wood , which nobody owned or tended , when a burr stuck to my clothes . I doubt if I should ever have found any way to speak to her if it had not been for that . I had barely touched the burr and yet it stuck ; and when I tried to pull it off it seemed to stick harder than ever . " That 's what I got my idea from . And what I did was to write a note on tissue paper and roll it up very small and fasten it on to the burr . I simply wrote , ' Most beautiful of the sisters , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me where to come . If you refuse , be sure that I shall go to everlasting perdition . ' " I did n't set much store by the last sentence , because after all she was a woman . But just in case she was too much frozen by dogma , then the threat of hell would be just the thing for her ; because it is their job to keep souls from hell , not to send them there . So I threw that in on the tiny bit of paper . Practically blackmail . " Well , I never quite knew which part of the letter fetched her , but some part of it did . For I walked towards them along their path next day and threw the burr at her dress as she passed ; and , not the day following that , but the day after that one , the same burr hit my jacket as we passed at the usual place . Her note said ' At five to-morrow in our orchard , if you can climb the wall by the ilex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five stone less than I am now , and invisible wings to lift me  --  that 's what one has in youth . Yes , I could climb the wall . I made a sort of ladder for the near side , out of logs , and took up plenty of sacking for the glass bottles . Then I fastened a rope to the trunk of a handy tree and took the end over the wall with me to get back by . The ilex was no use for climbing down , but it was a world of use for concealing me from the windows . And there was the orchard underneath me , and plenty of cover from the trees if you went carefully . She was standing there expecting me and looking pretty grim , so far as you could tell by her attitude ; to make up , I almost fancied , for her lapse in answering my note . Why , even reading it , in a place like that , was probably more of a sin than shoplifting would be here . Well , there she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ; there could be no doubt of that , though her face was still muffled up and gloves covered her hands and wrists . " Her first words to me were , ' Why did you  - -  rite that you would go to everlasting perdition ? What did you mean by it ? ' " ' Because , ' I said , ' your beauty has so profoundly enchanted me . ' " ' How can you know , ' she asked , ' if I am beautiful or not ? ' " And I was so enthralled by a strange certainty that I answered , ' I know . ' " And then she went back to her original question , ' Why everlasting perdition ? ' " ' Because , ' I said , there would be nothing else left for me . ' " ' But bow ? ' she asked . " ' Easy enough , ' I said . ' Just helplessly drifting . ' " She would n't leave that point for a long while . But I did n't want to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how it is if you 're with a beautiful woman , and she is all wrapped up in mystery  --  you do n't think much about your soul . But she did n't want to talk of anything else . I began to wish I had never mentioned it . And yet , if I had n't , who knows if I 'd ever have seen her . I thought at first that I had attracted the woman in her , and that she was only pretending to be more interested in everlasting perdition . But she stuck to her point until I began to wonder . And such a place for a talk like that ; the gray boles of old apple trees clustered in a quiet angle of the great convent wall , the green lawns flashing beyond through gaps in the gnarled branches , with the old ilex shadowing us and sheltering us from view . What a place for a talk about Hell ! But she would have it . And I would have it that it was to Hell I would go if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' How do you know if I am beautiful ? ' " And again I swore to her in all sincerity that I surely knew she was lovely . " And then she ridiculed me , and then my turn came . ' Take off those veils , ' I said . ' And prove it . ' " And at first she said ' No , ' and that it was against the rules of their Order . But I said , No . You have mocked at truth . You laughed at me for saying that you were beautiful . Truth comes before all your rules . ' " I argued like that with her for a while , and at last I saw I was winning . She had n't said she would unveil , but I knew she was going to ; I was as sure as one sometimes is that some bursting bud in spring , on an early morning , will be an open flower by noon . Her hands moved to her hood where all those veils were fastened , then she let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who she was and what she was she did not say , but she spoke of a terror that came when she was young , moving from village to village as quietly as lengthening shadows , and bringing death with it or life-long disfigurement : that was the smallpox . ' I was perhaps . . she said , and seemed to tremble as though Satan would hear her , ' perhaps I was beautiful then . ' " ' And what  --  what happened then ? ' I asked as well as I could , for something came to me suddenly , like an icy wind through the apple trunks , a fear , for the first time , of something amiss . " ' The smallpox , ' she said simply . I just escaped with my life . Of my beauty ' ( and still she said the word as though it were sin to speak it ) ' nothing remained , and scarcely even my fea-tures . ' " ' Scarcely . I blurted out , and found no more to say . And she kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You do not wish to see my face now ? ' she said . " But that was not true . I could have wept to hear of the ruin of that beauty of which I felt so sure . And yet I could not believe that in the ruins was no trace at all of the radiant face I had fancied . And fancy was n't the word for it either : it seemed nothing less than insight . " So I said , Yes . Still . And as much as ever . ' " I thought that the glory that is in beautiful faces might linger there even yet . " And then to console her for whatever was lost , and because it was perfectly true I said , ' You have a beautiful voice . ' " And she answered , my people have beautiful voices . ' " And as yet she had said nothing of who they were . " ' Your people ? ' I said . " Yes , the Hottentots , ' was her answer . " ' The Hottentots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by something she heard in my voice , and repeated proudly , ' The Hottentots . ' " Did I tell you we were speaking in English , and perfect English ? " But you speak English , ' I gasped . " ' The English rule there , ' she said . " ' But the convent ? The Order ? ' I blurted out , clinging still to a despairing hope that what she told was impossible . " It is open to all , ' she said , ' who accept the discipline of the Greek Reformed Church . ' " I was silent , silent , silent . You could hear the young leaves swaying to a small breeze lost in the apple trees . And then after a long while she spoke again . She turned her veiled face to me , I remember , and said , ' You still wish to see my face ? ' " And I said ' Yes . ' What else could one say ? I could hardly say No , ' even if I had n't asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved her hands again to her hood and began the untying of a great number of knots , and all of them seemed as tight as though some elder hand had wrenched them shut with a jerk . It gave my eyes time to rove , and my thoughts with them . Otherwise I should have seen her face . But now I saw , far enough off , I admit , but I saw two sisters walking over a lawn : I saw their white dresses every now and then as they crossed the little vistas between the trunks of the apple trees . And I meant to tell her this , and to say that if unveiling was against the rules of her convent , now would not be the time to do it . Rut her hands were busy with the last of those knots . And all I said in the end was , ' Perhaps not now . ' " Then I took one long , long look at her , remembering my illusion , an illusion that is often with me still , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ilex ; then I went to my rope and got back over the wall . " And Jorkens looked sadly into the deeps of the fire , as though the old illusion were glowing there still and a little warming the blood of the middle-aged man by its beauty , after Lord knows how long . In common gratitude I signed to the waiter . Really there was no more for anyone to say . Watley need n't have spoken at all . And yet he did . And this was what he said , " It was no illusion , Jorkens . " " What ! " said Jorkens . " No illusion , " Watley repeated . " The sisters of the Greek Reformed Church are the loveliest girls in those islands . They make a point of it . Whenever they get a beautiful girl they count it a victory over Satan . And they are beautiful . " " But a Hottentot , " said Jorkens , " disfigured by smallpox . " " Oh , that , " said Watley with a wave of his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They keep their wits about them . Be cunninger than the Tempter ' is one of their mottoes . ' Jorkens gripped the whiskey that was by now beside him , and drained it without a word . Again I signed to the waiter . Still Jorkens was utterly silent and seemingly miles away from us , or more likely years and years . Another whiskey came , and he drained that too . And as he still said nothing , sitting there heedless of us , we went quietly away from the room and left him alone . As I went through the door he still seemed searching and searching for something lost in the sinking glow of the fire .
