High in the Andes dwells the vicua , an undersized member of the camel family . Fast as the antelope , agile as the chamois , the goatish little vicua , which lives only at altitudes over 12,000 ft. , has to be killed to be captured-otherwise he spits in your eye and runs away . <P> Some 4,000 miles from Arequipa , Peru , where the fine under-hairs of the vicua 's fleece bring around $14 a pound , dwells Sylvan I. Stroock . His S. Stroock &; Co. , Inc. of New York is the leading U. S. manufacturer of rare expensive fabrics-camel 's hair , llama , cashmere and vicua , most costly of all these . <P> Last week a flashy Manhattan haberdasher , Marty Walker , had the " honor and distinction " of advertising that his was " the first concern in the entire world privileged to present MEN 'S HEAVY-WEIGHT*OVERCOATS of the world 's most precious fabric , 100% PURE STROOCK VICUA CLOTH . " Broadway crowds stopped to gape at the model coat which 60 vicuas died to make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> *These " Heavyweight Overcoats " are made from 35-ounce-per-yard cloth . Stroock &; Co. has made a lightweight ( 20-oz. ) vicua cloth since 1925.
