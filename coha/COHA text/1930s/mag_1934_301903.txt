Geneseo is a pretty little town in the lush Genesee Valley of western New York . Around it lie the broad acres of James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. , onetime ( 1925-27 ) U. S. Senator and now a Representative whose family in the old days could travel all the way to Rochester , 30 mi. north , without setting foot off its own land . Depression has dealt lightly with Geneseo 's 2,260 inhabitants , who work on farms or in the cannery &; jam factory , or teach in the State Normal School , and deposit their money in the Wadsworth bank . Thriving seat of Livingston County , the town supports two weekly newspapers , the Livingston Republican and the Livingston County Leader . Last week the Leader made big local news . <P> The news was first developed in Manhattan . Aware of the widespread talk about universal fingerprinting , compulsory or voluntary , as an aid to law &; order , Vice President Edward C. Johnston of Western Newspaper Union , a feature syndicate serving the rural Press , worked it into a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his client Walter B. Sanders , publisher of Geneseo 's Leader . Last fortnight the Leader splashed down its front page a two-column invitation to all Geneseans to come to the newspaper office and be fingerprinted , free , by a new process using no ink . <P> " Fingerprints , " urged the Leader , " are a protection to the family against kidnappers and fakes . . . . Fingerprints are more and more being used by the great insurance companies and banks of the country . Fingerprints afford definite means of identity to those who may meet with accidents or death . . . . Modern speed of living is resulting in increase of amnesia-loss of memory . Fingerprints would afford immediate identification . " <P> To reassure suspicious citizens , the Leader added : " No police officials have anything to do with the plan . " <P> Through last week 1,000 men , women &children-; nearly half the population of Geneseo-trooped down Main Street past the Normal Grill and Ulmer 's drug store to the corner of Bank Street , then up a narrow flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scout was first in line . A 78-year-old town character named Pliny B. Seymour had himself fingerprinted " in case my memory should fail or something . " A couple from the cannery brought their four-month-old daughter . The whole Rotary Club , including Representative Wadsworth &; Son James Jeremiah ( " Jerry " ) who sits in the State Assembly , marched over from their weekly luncheon to press their fingers on a chemical pad , press them again on a sensitized card on which the prints then showed black . <P> Each subject was permitted to take his print card home , was urged by the Leader to send it to the " NonCriminal Section " of the U. S. Department of Justice . <P> Elated over the result , Mr. Johnston planned to try the fingerprint campaign elsewhere , hoped it would sweep the U. S.
