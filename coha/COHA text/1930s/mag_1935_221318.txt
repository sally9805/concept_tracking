If three 240-ton locomotives were piled one on top of the other and their combined weight rested on a postage stamp , the resultant pressure would be some 1,440,000 lb. per sq . in . Such a pressure , Harvard University announced last week , has been produced in its physics laboratories by stocky , soft-spoken Percy Williams Bridgman and maintained for 15 hours on a speck of graphite as big as a pinhead . <P> That was a special experiment . For routine high-pressure work Dr. Bridgman uses about half the maximum , working up to 720,000 lb. and then down again in one hour . Even that squeeze has not been duplicated elsewhere . In principle the Bridgman pressure apparatus is simple , like Archimedes ' theoretical lever with which the old Greek said he could move the world . It is a hydraulic press , in which is utilized the fact that a piston bearing on a small area of a confined liquid delivers its pressure against every other area of equal size in the tank . Thus if a force of 100 lb. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the force transferred through the liquid to a 1,000 sq . in. piston is 100,000 lb . The catch is that to make apparatus able to stand such a stress is a delicate , costly and patience-taxing business . If the reinforcement is imperfect or if the materials are not the best in the tiny arena where the gigantic crush is finally focused , steel is likely to bulge like butter . Squeezed by 300 tons per sq . in. , some of the contraction of a substance is due to a shrinkage of the atoms themselves . The complex atom of cesium shrinks most of all metals . Of 48 metals under high pressure , 39 become better conductors of electricity . Iron grows softer , glass harder . Squeezed water turns solid ( ' ' ice " ) in five different forms , one of which does not melt until heated to nearly 212F . Under the increased pressures announced last week , two more kinds of ice are formed , one of which can be made hotter than boiling water without melting . Professor Bridgman reasoned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could squeeze and twist them at the same time . Therefore instead of letting the vertically opposed cylinders ( 1 in. in diameter ) compress the substance directly , he inserted between them a flat , hard steel block , ground microscopically smooth on its upper and lower sides . Between the block surfaces and the cylinder faces are placed specks ( one-tenth gram or less ) of the stuff to be tested . Straight pressure is applied , squeezing out some of the stuff from under the pistons , until the friction of its flow becomes so great that no more escapes . Then , as the pressure is stepped up , the steel block is rotated by a man exerting his full strength at the end of a yard-long lever , equipped with a strain gauge to measure the twisting force . When the lever is rotated through 35 , the distortion in the little disk of material is equal to that in a one-inch cube one of whose faces is theoretically pushed 60 inches out of position .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
