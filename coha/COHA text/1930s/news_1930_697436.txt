txt WAR DEBT CANCELLATION . It Would Have a Most Favorable Effect at This Time . To the Editor of The New York Times : I can not conceive of anything that at the present time would have a more favorable effect , economically or politically , upon the entire international situation than the reduction or cancellation of war debts . I have the feeling that if an agitation were started at this time for such action by the United States it might receive the support of the country . Selfishness is one of the guiding motives of human nature , and when this country was prosperous we were not so much interested in what the conditions were In Europe ; but with our export trade now on a low level and our commodities in most cases selling below the cost of production , anything that we could do to improve the European situation would be to our own benefit . We hear many suggestions today toward the improvement of conditions , but I honestly believe that nothing would improve the whole situation so quickly and so effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York , Oct. 30 , 1930 . Whv Not General Clark ? To the Editor of The New York Times : I was astounded in noting in THE TIMES that General George Rogers Clark got only twenty-eight votes , or not half enough to admit him to the Hall of Fame . If I mistake not , General Clark of Virginia , singlehanded , won the entire Northwest Territory from the British and Indians during the Revolutionary War , and that a monument costing $2,000 , - 000 is now being erected to his memory at Vincennes , Ind . In that period of the history of this country three men stand out : Washington , who won our independence ; Clark , who won the entire Northwest , and Napoleon Bonaparte , who gave us Louisiana for a song , and thus gave us an empire and prevented wars for 100 years with the British and Spanish .
