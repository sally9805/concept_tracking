When Oscar Bruno Bach was 18 he made a finely wrought metal Bible cover for Pope Leo XIII 's study . A native of Germany but a longtime resident of Manhattan , Oscar B. Bach is , according to the current Iron Age , " probably the foremost metal craftsman of this country . " He has done a great deal of impressive metal decoration for public buildings , rich men 's homes , ships , mausoleums , world 's fairs . Last week bemonocled , pipe-sucking Mr. Bach discussed with newshawks a metallurgical process which he had developed ( after years of research ) , and which not only delivers stainless steel in a variety of colors but also increases greatly the corrosion resistance of inexpensive chrome steel . <P> Metallurgists have tried to produce colored stainless steel for years . One of the first patents , issued to Columbia University 's crack Electrochemist Colin Garfield Fink in 1933 , has never been industrially developed . Researchers of Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp . are reported to have hit on a promising technique , but they are keeping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patent protection , kept mum about his method for quite a while . <P> In the Bach process , the steel is first " pickled " ( cleaned with acid ) , then coated with colorless chemicals ( formula undisclosed ) and heated . The coated steel turns black , gold , bronze , purple , blue , red or green , and the color becomes an integral part of the surface . The treatment increases the corrosion resistance of 6% chrome steel ( 16 per Ib. ) almost to that of high-grade chrome-nickel stainless steel ( 34 per lb . ) . Said Iron Age : " The increase in corrosion resistance , in part verified by at least several disinterested laboratories , is astonishing . " Last week Mr. Bach declared that use of cheap steel , thus colored and corrosion-proofed would greatly reduce the cost of prefabricated houses .
