txt When international markets open today their first task will be the assimilation of two outstanding week-end developments in the European gold bloc  --  selection of Paul Van Zeeland , vicegovernor of the National Bank of Belgium , as the new Belgian premier , and a reduction in the Italian discount rate to 3V2. % from 4% . What the new premier means to the gola standard in Belgium is not known . The market will have to wait for the selection of the new cabinet , and then for its program . The Italian discount action is something of a surprise package for international markets . The Italian crisis last fall forced an upward revision on November 26 in the bank rate to 4 , ; ; , from 3%. the lowest in the history of the Banca &Italia.; It was followed on December 8 by nationalization of Italian foreign assets in order to provide the central bank with exchange reserves to counter the growing deficit in foreign trade until the trend could be corrected through a reduction in imports . Tinder ordinary circumstances , the reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger dwindles . The Italian central bank has made some progress in rebuilding its gold reserves and reserve ratio , but the ratio is still close to its legal minimum . In the exchange market , however , the lira has been allowed to drop to new lows , probably to offset partially the depreciation of sterling , and available statistics do not indicate any correction yet in the trade balance . Ordinarily , a reduction in the bank rate can be accomplished only when a currency is high in the foreign exchange markets , because it tends to move capital away from the country These considerations now are of little import . even were capital movements into and out of Italy free . Viewed in this light , the bank rate reduction probably is an attempt to return to the cheap money program for internal purposes which was interrupted by the crisis last fall . with no reference to the outside world . The Belgian action Is another example of the realism with which King Leopold III is ruling Belgium . In his reign of little more than one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During all of this time . Belgium 's difficulties have been mainly financial and he has each time called a leading financial expert , instead of a politician . The first was George Theunis who resigned last week , precipitating the current crisis . Theunis was one of Belgium 's outstanding financial authorities . Paul van Zeeland. who now has been invited to form a government , is of the same type . Vice-governor of the National Bank of Belgium , he served directly under Louis Franck , and in the de Broqueville cabinet , which resigned last November . he was banker-minister without portfolio , the post held by Emile Francqui In the Theunis governmentWhat van Zeeland 's attitude toward the gold standard will be remains to be seen . He has been outspokenly liberal in his views and is regarded as an admirer of the Roosevelt theories of government . As vice-governor of the National Bank of Belgium be has had ample opportunity to watch the failure in the United States of the managed currency theory and of depreciated currency to bring about a lasting trade revival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show whether he believes that depreciated currency would work for Belgium . At the annual meeting of the National Bank of Belgium in mid-February . the Bank claimed that devaluation would not help unemployment . the budget or the public debt held abroad , but that it would be followed by a further rise in tariffs and quotas against Belgian goods . This has already started with the 50ri. increase in the British steel tariffs . his liberal leanings . on the other hand , may Incline him toward an opportunistic theory of government , rather than uncompromising conservatism . On Saturday . before his commission was known , the Belgian currency scored a sharp recovery in the foreign exchange market , after having dropped to new lows . By Saturday 's close , the rate had not recovered to what would be considered a normal quotation , as dictated by the gold points , but the gain was made at the expense of all other currencies which remained practically unchanged in the New York market .               @ @ @ @ @ @
