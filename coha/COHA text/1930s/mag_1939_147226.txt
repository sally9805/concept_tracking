While in France the once mighty Left opposition devoted its annual convention almost exclusively to family quarrels last week , the British Left was scarcely less ineffectual . Biggest issue at the Labor Party Congress at Southport was the expulsion of Sir Stafford Cripps , tall , thin , wealthy , inconsistent , indiscreet ' ' Red Squire " of Filkins , Labor 's ablest parliamentary debater and leader of Labor 's intellectual leftwing . Last January Sir Stafford proposed a Popular Front of Laborites , Communists , Liberals , anti-Chamberlain Conservatives , broke Party discipline when he sent out his proposals to Labor Party offices after Labor 's executive committee rejected it .

It forbade him to appear before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Commons backed down ; another resigned from his paper ; four were expelled before the Congress opened . But the Congress overruled the executive , let Sir Stafford speak . Soon the Red Squire joined the retreat at full stride , humbly asked for reinstatement for himself and his four allies , promised " to abide by the decisions of the conference on a Popular Front .

Congress reaffirmed his expulsion . <P> Internal harmony restored , Labor then jumped with ineffectual vigor on Prime Minister Chamberlain , damned his delay in concluding a defensive pact with Russia , denounced his policy in Palestine by a vote of 890-to-2 . But it accepted conscription lying down . And although it began preparations for a general election , probably this autumn , observers noted with Sir Stafford gone it had no popular leader likely to lead Labor to a national victory , that no Labor Party Congress since its earliest days had attracted so little attention , that even a small conference of rebellious Conservatives like Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party that polled 8,000,000 votes only four years ago .
