Radio set is offered in exchange for a fat goose . <P> Who needs a short fur coat in exchange for a fat goose ? <P> Willing to give five marks ( $2 ) worth of cloth for a fat goose . <P> With agony-column ads such as these , hungry Germans are pathetically trying to wangle at least one good meal during the Christmas holidays . The blockade of the Reich , already as tight as Great Britain and France are able to make it , is becoming still more drastic due to war in the Baltic , and , if the Balkans blaze up too in a Soviet grab at Bessarabia , German scarcity may soon be back to the bare bones of 1918 . Significantly , last week , Vierjahresplan , official magazine of Reich Economic Four-Year Plan Director Hermann Wilhelm Gring , declared : " We must face the facts . They are the same as in 1914-18 . England 's power has brought German overseas trade to a complete standstill . " <P> The article containing this piece of super-gloom was by Emil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who became board chairman of the North German Lloyd and Hamburg American Lines when the Nazis lumped them under the same directorate in 1933 . Herr Helfferich urged that the Government aid stagnant German export-import firms by permitting them to discharge superfluous employes ( illegal under the Nazi job-protection laws ) ; by letting them use " rent free " the Government warehouses in which German clogged exports are now piling up ; and by directly providing " necessary capital to keep them afloat . " If all this is done , " then we need not fear for our foreign trade , " concluded Economist Helfferich . " The German trader may , with his inherent acumen , find new business possibilities , perhaps new pathways to his old territories overseas . " <P> Since precious little German trade can be sailed , submarined or flown overseas , writing about " new possibilities " or " new pathways " in Vierjahresplan sounded like official whistling in the dark .
