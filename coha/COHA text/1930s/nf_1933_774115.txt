txt  | In some cases a transferred meaning is linguistically determined by an accompanying form . The word cat always has a transferred meaning when it is accompanied by the suffix - kin ( catkin ) , and the word pussy when it is compounded with willow ( pussy-willow ) ; similarly , the word eye when it has the suffix - let ( eyelet ) . The words dog , monkey , beard when they appear with the marks of verb derivation ( say , with a preceding to ) , always have transferred meaning ( to dog someone 's footsteps ; do n't monkey with that ; to beard a lion in his den ) . These linguistic features may be purely negative : give out , used without an object ( his money gave out ; our horses gave out ) , always has a transferred meaning ( become exhausted ' ) . In these cases the structure of the language recognizes the transferred meaning . Even a linguist who made no attempt to define meanings would have to specify that give out , intransitive , meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , transitive ( he gave out tickets ) . In many cases we hesitate whether to view the form as a single form with several meanings or as a set of homonyms . Examples of this are air atmosphere ; tune , melody ; manner ' ( this last including airs haughty manners ' ) , key instrument for locking and unlocking ; set of tones in music , ' charge attack ; load ; accuse ; debit , ' sloth name of an animal ; laziness . ' We are likely to make the mistake of thinking that the transferred meanings of our language are natural and even inevitable in human speech ? the more so , as they appear also in other European languages . This last , however , is merely a result of our common cultural traditions ; while transferred meanings occur in all languages , the particular ones in any given language are by no means to be taken for granted . Neither in French nor in German can one speak of the eye of a needle or of an ear of grain . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any European , but it would be nonsense in Menomini and doubtless in many other languages . On the other hand , in Menomini una : ? new he places him in position ' has also the transferred meaning he picks lice from him . ' In Russian , no'ga leg ' is not used of the leg of a chair or table ; this transferred meaning appears only in the diminutive ' noAka little leg ; leg of a chair or table . ' Accordingly , when the linguist tries to state meanings , he safely ignores the uses of displaced speech , but does his best to register all cases of transferred meaning .  | All this applies also to another type of deviant meaning , the narrowed meaning , with this difference , that we are far more ready to accept a form in a narrowed meaning . The practical situation guides us at once to take car in different narrowed senses in The diner is the second car forward ( railroad-carriage ' ) ; Does the car stop at this corner ? ( ' street-car ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor-car ' ) . When we hear the command to call a doctor , we take it at once to mean a doctor of medicine . A burner is primarily a person or instrument that burns things , but usually , in a narrowed sense , a gas-tap arranged to give a certain kind of flame . A bulb among gardeners is one thing and among electricians another . A glass is usually a drinking-glass or a looking-glass ; glasses are usually eye-glasses . Narrowed meanings are hard to define , because , after all , every occurrence of a form is prompted by some one practical situation which need not contain all the possibilities of meaning : apple is used now of a green one , now of a red one , and so on . The language itself , by formal characteristics , recognizes narrowed meanings in certain combinations . For instance , blackbird is not merely any black bird ' : in this combination the meaning of black is greatly narrowed ; similarly blueberry , whitefish , and the like . Widened meanings are less common . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we use the word to include lions , tigers , and so on ; the word dog , however , is not similarly used to include wolves and foxes . On the other hand , hound is used poetically and facetiously of any kind of dog . Often , the widened meaning is recognized in the structure of the language , and appears only when certain accompanying forms are present . Thus meat is edible flesh , but in meat and drink and in sweetmeats it is food in general ; fowl is an edible bird , but in fish , flesh , or fowl or the fowl of the air it is any bird. , Often enough the speakers of a language do not distinguish a central and a marginal meaning in cases where an outsider might see two situationally different values ; thus , day in English means a period of ' twenty-four hours ( Swedish dygn dygn ) or the light part of this period ( in contrast with night ; Swedish dag da:g ) . 9. 9 . The second important way in which meanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call connotations . The meaning of a form for any one speaker is nothing  | more than a result of the situations in which he has heard this form . If he has not heard it very many times , or if he has heard it under very unusual circumstances , his use of the form may deviate from the conventional . We combat such personal deviations by giving explicit definitions of meaning ; this is a chief use of our dictionaries . In the case of scientific terms , we manage to keep the meaning nearly free from connotative factors , though even here we may be unsuccessful ; the number thirteen , for instance , has for many people a strong connotation . The most important connotations arise from the social standing of the speakers who use a form . A form which is used by a less privileged class of speakers often strikes us as coarse , ugly , and vulgar . I ai n't got none , I seen it , I done it sound nasty to the speaker of standard English . This may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or criminals may bear a connotation of devil-may-care wit , and those of a rustic type may strike us as homely but poetic . A form used by a more privileged class of speakers may strike us as over-formal or prettified and affected . Most speakers of Central-Western American English find this connotation in the use of a instead of e in forms like laugh , bath , ca n't and of juw instead of uw in forms like tune , sue , stupid . Connotations of local provenience are closely akin to these ; a Scotch or an Irish locution has its own tang ; so have , in America , certain real or supposed Anglicisms , such as luggage ( for baggage ) or old chap , old dear as terms of address . Even in communities that have no writing , some forms are recognized ( rightly or wrongly ) as archaisms ; in communities that have written records , these serve as additional sources of archaic forms . Examples are , in English , the old second-person singular forms ( thou hast ) , the third-person forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjunctive ( if this be treason ) , the pronoun ye , and many forms like eve , e'en , e'er , morn , anent , and so on . Sometimes fully current locutions may preserve some special aphoristic form ; thus , an old sentence-construction survives in a few proverbs , such as First come , first served or Old saint , young sinner . The connotation of technical forms gets its flavor from the standing of the trade or craft from which they are taken . Sea-terms sound ready , honest , and devil-may-care : abaft , aloft , the cut of his jib , stand by ; legal terms precise and a bit tricky : without let or  | hindrance , in the premises , heirs and assigns ; criminals ' terms crass but to the point : a stickup , a shot ( of whiskey ) , get pinched . The connotation of learned forms is vaguer but more frequent : almost any colloquial form has a parallel form with learned connotation . NORMAL LEARNED He came too soon . He arrived prematurely . It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is your destination ? now at present if he comes in case ( in case that , in the event that , in the contingency that ) he comes ; should he come , . . so ( that ) you do n't lose it . in order that you may not lose it , lest you lose it . As these examples show , the learned , elegant , and archaic types of connotation merge in many a form . In formal speech and in writing , we customarily prefer learned forms , up to a certain degree : he who uses too many learned forms is a stilted speaker or a tiresome writer . Foreign speech-forms bear connotations of their own , which reflect our attitude toward foreign peoples . The foreign features of form may consist in peculiarities of sound or of phonetic pattern : garage , mirage , rouge , a je ne sais quoi ; olla podrida , chile con carne ; dolce far niente , fortissimo ; Zeitgeist , Wanderlust ; intelligentsia . In other instances , the foreign feature lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that goes without saying . This flavor is turned to facetious use in mock foreign forms , such as nix come erouse ( mock-German ) , ish gabibble ( ' it 's none of my concern , ' supposedly Judeo-German ) . Schoolboys use mock-Latinisms , such as the nonsense-form quid sidi quidit , or macaronic verse : Boyibus kissibus priti girlorum , girlibus likibus , wanti somorum . Some languages , and most notably , perhaps , English , contain a great mass of semi foreign or foreign-learned forms ? a class of forms with a separate style of pattern and derivation . Our textbooks of rhetoric distinguish these forms , as the " Latin-French " part of our vocabulary , from the " native " or " Anglo-Saxon " forms . The connotation , however , does not depend directly upon the actual provenience of the forms . The word chair , for instance ,  | is Latin-French in origin , but does not belong to the foreignlearned part of our vocabulary . The chief formal characteristics of our foreign-learned forms is perhaps the use of certain accented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - 'ejtiy education . Another feature is the use of certain phonetic alternations , such as sijv in receive , but sep in reception and sij in receipt , or vajd in provide , but vid in provident , viz in visible , and viz in provision . These peculiarities suffice to mark certain words and constituents of words as foreign-learned , especially certain prefixes ( ab- , ad- , con- , de- , dis- , ex- , in- , per- , pre- , pro- , re- , trans- ) ; these prefixes themselves in part show peculiar phonetic alternations , as in con-taro but collect , correct , and abjure but abs-taro . Semantically , our foreign-learned forms are peculiar in the capricious and highly specialized meanings of the combinations ; it seems impossible , for instance , to set up any consistent meaning for elements like sijv in conceive , deceive , perceive , receive or tend in attend , contend , distend , pretend , or d(j)uws in adduce , conduce , deduce , induce , produce , reduce . The connotative flavor of these forms lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these forms measures his education . Errors in their use ( malapropisms ) mark the semi-educated speaker . The less educated speaker fails to understand many of these forms , and is to this extent shut out from some types of communication ; he may take vengeance by using mock-learned forms , such as absquatulate , discombolulate , rambunctious , scrumptious . Many languages contain a foreignlearned layer of this kind : the Romance languages have a Latin type , largely identical with ours ; Russian , beside a fair sprinkling of this type , has learned forms from Old Bulgarian ; Turkish has a stratum of Persian and Arabic words , and Persian of Arabic ; the languages of India similarly use Sanskrit forms . Opposed to the foreign-learned connotation , the slangy connotation is facetious and unrestrained : the users of slang forms are young persons , sportsmen , gamblers , vagrants , criminals , and , for that matter , most other speakers in their relaxed and unpretentious moods . Examples are familiar , such as guy , gink , gazebo , gazook , bloke , bird for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on ; the slang form may at the same time be foreign , as loco crazy , ' sabby understand , ' vamoose go away , ' from Spanish . The value is largely facetious ; when the slang form has been in use too long , it is likely to be replaced by some new witticism.  | 9. 10 . The varieties of connotation are countless and indefinable and , as a whole , can not be clearly distinguished from denotative meaning . In the last analysis , every speech-form has its own connotative flavor for the entire speech-community and this , in turn , is modified or even offset , in the case of each speaker , by the connotation which the form has acquired for him through his special experience . It may be well , however , to speak briefly of two more types of connotation which stand out with at least relative clearness . In many speech-communities certain improper speech-forms are uttered only under restricted circumstances ; a speaker who utters them outside the restriction is shamed or punished . The strictness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe tabu . The improper forms belong for the most part to certain spheres of meaning , but often enough there exist by their side forms with the same denotation but without the improper connotation , as prostitute by the side of the improper form whore . Some improper forms denote objects or persons that are not to be named in a casual way , or perhaps not to be named at all . In English , various terms of religion , such as God , devil , heaven , hell , Christ , Jesus , damn are proper only in serious speech . Violation of the rule exposes the speaker to reproof or avoidance ; on the other hand , in certain groups or under certain conditions , the violation connotes vigor and freedom . In many communities the names of persons are tabu under some circumstances or to some people . The male Cree Indian , for example , does not speak the names of his sisters and of some other female relatives ; he explains the avoidance by saying , " I respect her too much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms . In English there is a severe tabu on some speech-forms whose meaning is connected with excretory functions , and on some that deal with reproduction . A third type of improper connotation is less universal among us ; the avoidance of ominous speech-forms , which name something painful or dangerous . One avoids the words die and death ( if anything should happen to me ) and the names of some diseases . Other peoples avoid mention of the left hand , or of thunderstorms . In some communities one avoids the names of game animals , either during the hunt or more generally . Under special conditions  | ( as , on the war-path ) , many speech-forms may be avoided , or inverted speech , saying the opposite of what one means , may be iii order . 9. 11 . The second more specialized type of connotation that here deserves to be pointed out , is intensity . The most characteristic intense forms are exclamations . For these we have in English not only a special secondary phoneme lb but also certain special speech-forms , interjections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms all reflect a violent stimulus , but differ in connotation from an ordinary statement in which the speaker merely says that he is undergoing a strong stimulus . Certain speech-forms have an animated flavor , akin to the exclamatory , as , for instance , the placing first of certain adverbs : Away ran John ; Away he ran . In connected narrative a similar flavor appears in less violent transpositions : Yesterday he came ( and said . . . ) is more lively than He came yesterday . . . In English the historical present , in narrating past events , is either elegant , as in the summary of a play or story , or , in ordinary speech , slightly vulgar : Then he comes back and says to me . . . English is especially rich in another type of intense forms , the symbolic forms . Symbolic forms have a connotation of somehow illustrating the meaning more immediately than do ordinary speech-forms . The explanation is a matter of grammatical structure and will concern us later ; to the speaker it seems as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flip , flap , flop , flitter , flimmer , flicker , flutter , flash , flush , flare , glare , glitter , glow , gloat , glimmer , bang , bump , lump , thump , thwack , whack , sniff , sniffle , snuff , sizzle , wheeze . Languages that have symbolic forms show some agreement , but probably more disagreement as to the types of sounds and meanings which are associated . A special type of symbolic form , which is quite widely distributed , is the repetition of the form with some phonetic variation , as in snip-snap , zig-zag , rif raf , jim jams , fiddle-faddle , teeny-tiny , ship-shape , hodge-podge , hugger-mugger , honky-tonk . Closely akin to these are imitative or onomatopoetic intense forms , which denote a sound or an object which gives out a sound : the imitative speech-form resembles this sound : cock-a-doodle-doo , meeow , moo , baa . Many bird names are of this sort : cuckoo , bobwhite , whip-poor-will . Doubled forms are common : bow-wow , ding-dong , pee-wee , choo-choo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language : the French dog says gnaf-gnaf pal paf ; the German bell says bim-bam . Among the forms just cited , some have an infantile connotation ; they are nursery forms . The most familiar are papa and mama . In English almost any doubled syllable may be used , in almost any meaning , as a nursery-word ; each family develops its private supply of the type ' didij , ' dajdaj , ' dajdij , ' mijmij , ' wawa . This custom provides speech-forms which the infant can reproduce with relative ease , and it helps adults to turn the infant 's utterances into conventional signals . The pet-name or hypochoristic connotation largely merges with that of the nursery . In English , relatively few pet-names like Lulu , have the doubled nursery form ; in French this type is common : Mimi , Nana , and so on . English pet-names are less uniform Tom , Will , Ed , Pat , Dan , Mike can be described structurally as shortenings of the full name ; this is not the case in Bob for Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard , Jack for John . Some have the diminutive suffix - ij , as Peggy , Maggie for Margaret , Fanny for Frances , Johnny , Willie , Billy . There is some intensity also in the connotation of nonsenseforms . Some of these , though conventional , have no denotation at all , as tra-la-la , hey-diddle-diddle , tarara-boom-de-ay ; others have an explicitly vague denotation , as fol-de-rol , gadget , conniption fits . Any speaker is free to invent nonsense-forms ; in fact , any form he invents is a nonsense-form , unless he succeeds in the almost hopeless task of getting his fellow-speakers to accept it as a signal for some meaning .  | GRAMMATICAL FORMS 10. 1 . Our discussion so far has shown us that every language consists of a number of signals , linguistic forms . Each linguistic form is a fixed combination of signaling-units , the phonemes . In every language the number of phonemes and the number of actually occurring combinations of phonemes , is strictly limited . By uttering a linguistic form , a speaker prompts his hearers to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the linguistic meaning of the form . We assume that each linguistic form has a constant and definite meaning , different from the meaning of any other linguistic form in the same language . Thus , hearing several utterances of some one linguistic form , such as I 'm hungry , we assume ( 1 ) that the differences in sound are irrelevant ( unphonetic ) , ( 2 ) that the situations of the several speakers contain some common features and that the differences between these situations are irrelevant ( unsemantic ) , and ( 3 ) that , this linguistic meaning is different from that of any other form in the language . We have seen that this assumption can not be verified , since the speaker 's situations and the hearer 's responses may involve almost anything in the whole world , and , in particular , depend largely upon the momentary state of their nervous systems . Moreover , when we deal with the historical change of language , we shall be concerned with facts for which our assumption does not hold good . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere fact that speakers co-operate in a very refined way by means of language-signals . In describing a language , we are concerned primarily with the working of this cooperation at any one time in any one community , and not with its occasional failures or with its changes in the course of history . Accordingly , the descriptive phase of linguistics consists in a somewhat rigid analysis of speech-forms , on the assumption that these speech-forms have constant and definable meanings ( ? 9.5 ) . Our basic assumption does have to be modified , however , right at the outset , in a different way . When we have recorded a fair  | number of forms in a language , we always discover a feature which we have so far ignored in our discussion : the partial resemblance of linguistic forms . Suppose we hear a speaker say John ran , and a little later hear him or some other speaker say John fell . We recognize at once that these two forms , John ran and John fell , are in part phonetically alike , since both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical knowledge tells us that the meanings show a corresponding resemblance : whenever a form contains the phonetic element Ian , the meaning involves a certain man or boy in the community . In fact , if we are lucky , we may hear someone utter the form John ! all by itself , without any accompaniment . After observing a number of such cases , we shall be constrained to modify the basic assumption of linguistics to read : In a speechcommunity some utterances are alike or partly alike in sound and meaning . The common part of partly like utterances ( in our example , John ) consists of a phonetic form with a constant meaning : it answers , therefore , to the definition of a linguistic form . The parts which are not common to the partly-like utterances ( in our example , ran in the one utterance , and fell in the other ) may , in the same way , turn out to be linguistic forms . Having heard the form John ran , we may later hear the form Bill ran , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an isolated Ran . The same will happen with the component fell in John fell : we may hear a form like Dan fell or even an isolated Fell . In other cases , we may wait in vain for the isolated form . Knowing the forms John , Bill , and Dan , we may hear the forms , Johnny , Billy , and Danny and hope to hear now an isolated -y - ij with some such meaning as little , ' but in this instance we shall be disappointed . In the same way , familiar with the forms play and dance , we may hear the forms playing and dancing , and then hope , in vain , to hear an isolated - ing - iij , which might reassure us as to the somewhat vague meaning of this syllable . In spite of the fact that some components do not occur alone , but only as parts of larger forms , we nevertheless call these components linguistic  | forms , since they are phonetic forms , such as ij or iij , with constant meanings . A linguistic form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others ( as , for instance , John ran or John or run or running ) are free forms . In other cases we wait in vain for the occurrence of a form even as part of some other form . For instance , having heard the form cranberry , we soon recognize the component berry in other forms , such as blackberry , and may even hear it spoken alone , but with the other component of cranberry we shall have no such luck . Not only do we wait in vain to hear an isolated *cran , but , listen as we may , we never hear this element outside the one combination cranberry , and we can not elicit from the speakers any other form which will contain this element cran- . As a practical matter , observing languages in the field , we soon learn that it is unwise to try to elicit such forms ; our questions confuse the speakers , and they may get rid of us by some false admission , such as , " Oh , yes , I guess cran means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall come to the conclusion that the element cran- occurs only in the combination cranberry . However , since it has a constant phonetic form , and since its meaning is constant , in so far as a cranberry is a definite kind of berry , different from all other kinds , we say that cran- , too , is a linguistic form . Experience shows that we do well to generalize this instance : unique elements , which occur only in a single combination , are linguistic forms . Sometimes we may be unable to decide whether phonetically like forms are identical in meaning . The straw- in strawberry is phonetically the same as the straw- in strawflower and as the isolated straw , but whether the meanings are " the same , " we can not say . If we ask the speakers , they will answer sometimes one way , sometimes another ; they are no more able to tell than we . This difficulty is part of the universal difficulty of semantics : the practical world is not a world of clear-cut distinctions . 10. 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial phonetic-semantic resemblances to other forms ; examples are , John ran , John fell , Bill ran , Bill fell ; Johnny , Billy ; playing , dancing ; blackberry , cranberry ; strawberry , strawflower . A linguistic form which bears a partial phonetic-semantic resemblance to some other linguistic form , is a complex form . The common part of any ( two or more ) complex forms is a linguistic form ; it is a constituent ( or component ) of these complex  | forms . The constituent is said to be contained in ( or to be included in or to enter into ) the complex forms . If a complex form , beside the common part , contains a remainder , such as the cran- in cranberry , which does not occur in any other complex form , this remainder also is a linguistic form ; it is a unique constituent of the complex form . The constituent forms in our examples above are : John , ran , Bill , fell , play , dance , black , berry , straw , flower , cran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent in Johnny , Billy ) , - ing ( bound-form constituent in playing , dancing ) . In any complex form , each constituent is said to accompany the other constituents . A linguistic form which bears no partial phonetic-semantic resemblance to any other form , is a simple form or morpheme . Thus , bird , play , dance , cran- , -y , - ing are morphemes . Morphemes may show partial phonetic resemblances , as do , for instance , bird and burr , or even homonymy , as do pear , pair , pare , but this resemblance is purely phonetic and is not paralleled by the meanings . From all this it appears that every complex form is entirely made up , so far as its phonetically definable constituents are concerned , of morphemes . The number of these ultimate constituents may run very high . The form Poor John ran away contains five morphemes : poor , John , ran , a- ( a bound form recurring , for instance , in aground , ashore , aloft , around ) , and way . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as this ; we could not understand the forms of a language if we merely reduced all the complex forms to their ultimate constituents . Any Englishspeaking person who concerns himself with this matter , is sure to tell us that the immediate constituents of Poor John ran away are the two forms poor John and ran away ; that each of these is , in turn , a complex form ; that the immediate constituents of ran away are ran , a morpheme , and away , a complex form , whose constituents are the morphemes a- and way ; and that the constituents of poor John are the morphemes poor and John . Only in this way will a proper analysis ( that is , one which takes account of the meanings ) lead to the ultimately constituent morphemes . The reasons for this will occupy us later . 10. 3 . A morpheme can be described phonetically , since it consists of one or more phonemes , but its meaning can not be analyzed within the scope of our science . For instance , we have  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other morphemes , such as pig , pen , tin , ten , and , on the basis of these resemblances , can be analyzed and described in terms of three phonemes ( ? 5.4 ) , but , since these resemblances are not connected with resemblances of meaning , we can not attribute any meaning to the phonemes and can not , within the scope of our science , analyze the meaning of the morpheme . The meaning of a morpheme is a sememe . The linguist assumes that each sememe is a constant and definite unit of meaning , different from all other meanings , including all other sememes , in the language , but he can not go beyond this . There is nothing in the structure of morphemes like wolf , fox , and dog to tell us the relation between their meanings ; this is a problem for the zoologist . The zoologist 's definition of these meanings is welcome to us as a practical help , but it can not be confirmed or rejected on the basis of our science . A workable system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small number of signaling-units , but the things signaled about ? in our case , the entire content of the practical world ? may be infinitely varied . Accordingly , the signals ( linguistic forms , with morphemes as the smallest signals ) consist of different combinations of the signaling-units ( phonemes ) , and each such combination is arbitrarily assigned to some feature of the practical world ( sememe ) . The signals can be analyzed , but not the things signaled about . This re-enforces the principle that linguistic study must always start from the phonetic form and not from the meaning . Phonetic forms ? let us say , for instance , the entire stock of morphemes in a language ? can be described in terms of phonemes and their succession , and , on this basis , can be classified or listed in some convenient order , as , for example , alphabetically ; the meanings ? in our example , the sememes of a language ? could be analyzed or systematically listed only by a well-nigh omniscient observer . 10. 4 . Since every complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of morphemes would account for all the phonetic forms of a language . The total stock of morphemes in a language is its lexicon . However , if we knew the lexicon of a language , and had a reasonably accurate knowledge of each sememe , we might still fail to understand the forms of this language . Every utterance contains some significant features that are not accounted for by the lexicon . We saw , for instance , that the five  | morphemes , John , poor , ran , way , a- which make up the form Poor John ran away , do not fully account for the meaning of this utterance . Part of this meaning depends upon the arra'ngement ? for example , upon the order of succession ? in which these morphemes appear in the complex form . Every language shows part of its meanings by the arrangement of its forms . Thus , in English , John hit Bill and Bill hit John differ in meaning by virtue of the two different orders in which the morphemes are uttered . The meaningful arrangements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there seem to be four ways of arranging linguistic forms . ( 1 ) Order is the succession in which the constituents of a complex form are spoken . The significance of order appears strikingly in contrasts such as John hit Bill versus Bill hit John . On the other hand , *Bill John hit is not an English form , because our language does not arrange these constituents in this order ; similarly , play-ing is a form , but *ing-play is not . Sometimes differences of order have connotative values ; thus , Away ran John is livelier than John ran away . ( 2 ) Modulation is the use of secondary phonemes . Secondary phonemes , we recall ( ? 5.11 ) , are phonemes which do not appear in any morpheme , but only in grammatical arrangements of morphemes . A morpheme like John Ian or run ron is really an abstraction , because in any actual utterance the morpheme is accompanied by some secondary phoneme which conveys a grammatical meaning . In English , if the morpheme is spoken alone , it is accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is either John ! or John ? or John . ? this last with falling final-pitch , as , in answer to a question ? and there is no indifferent or abstract form in which the morpheme is not accompanied by any finalpitch . In English complex forms , some of the constituents are always accompanied by secondary phonemes of stress ( ? 7.3 ) ; thus , the difference in the place of stress distinguishes the noun convict from the verb convict . ( 3 ) Phonetic modification is a change in the primary phonemes of a form . For instance , when the forms do duw and not nut are combined into a complex form , the uw of do is ordinarily replaced by ow , and , whenever this happens , the not loses its vowel , so that the combined form is do n't dow nt . In this example the modification is optional , and we have also the unmodified  | forms in do not , with a difference of connotation . In other cases we have no choice . Thus , the suffix - ess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is added also to duke d(j)uwk , but in this combination the form duke is modified to duch- doe- , for the word is duchess ' dotes . Strictly speaking , we should say that the morpheme in such cases has two ( or , sometimes , more ) different phonetic forms , such as not nut and nt , do duw and dow , duke and duch- , and that each of these alternants appears under certain conditions . In our examples , however , one of the alternants has a much wider range than the other and , accordingly , is a basic alternant . In other cases , the alternants are more on a par . In run and ran , for instance , neither alternant is tied to the presence of any accompanying form , and we might hesitate as to the choice of a basic alternant . We find , however , that in cases like keep : kep-t the past-tense form contains an alternant ( kep- ) which occurs only with a certain accompanying form ( -t ) ; accordingly , to obtain as uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( keep , run ) as basic , and describe the alternant which appears in the past tense ( kep- , ran ) as a phonetically modified form . We shall see other instances where the choice is more difficult ; we try , of course , to make the selection of a basic alternant so as to get , in the long run the simplest description of the facts . ( 4 ) Selection of forms contributes a factor of meaning because different forms in what is otherwise the same grammatical arrangement , will result in different meanings . For instance , some morphemes spoken with exclamatory final-pitch , are calls for a person 's presence or attention ( John ! Boy ! ) , while others , spoken in the same way , are commands ( Run ! Jump ! ) , and this difference extends also to certain complex forms ( Mr. Smith ! Teacher ! versus Run away ! Backwater ! ) . The forms which , when spoken with exclamatory final-pitch , have the meaning of a call , may be said , by virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English language ; we may call it the form-class of " personal substantive expressions . " Similarly , the forms which , when spoken with exclamatory final-pitch , have the meaning of a command , make up , by virtue of this fact , the English form-class of " infinitive expressions . " Whether an exclamation is a call or a command , depends upon the selection of the form from the one or the other of these two classes .  | The meaning of a complex form depends in part upon the selection of the constituent forms . Thus , drink milk and watch John name actions , and , as we have just seen , are infinitive expressions , but fresh milk and poor John name objects and are substantive expressions . The second constituents , milk , and John , are the same ; the difference depends upon the selection of the first constituent . By virtue of this difference , the forms drink and watch belong to one English form-class ( that of " transitive verbs " ) , and the forms fresh and poor to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selection are usually quite complicated , with form-classes divided into sub-classes . In English , if we combine a form like John or the boys ( form-class of " nominative substantive expressions " ) with a form like ran or went home ( form-class of " finite verb expressions " ) , the resultant complex form means that this object performs ' this action ( John ran , the boys ran , John went home , the boys went home ) . These features of selection , however , are supplemented by a further habit : we say John runs fast but the boys run fast , and we never make the reverse combinations of John with run fast , or of the boys with runs fast . The formclass of nominative expressions is divided into two sub-classes ( " singular " and " plural " ) and the form-class of finite verb expressions likewise , into two sub-classes ( " singular " and " plural " ) , such that in the complex forms which mean that an object performs an action , the two constituents agree as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Latin , the form pater filium amat ( or ( ilium pater amat ) means the father loves the son , ' and the form patrem filius amat ( or filius patrem amat ) means the son loves the father ' ; the forms pater father ' and filius son ' belong to a formclass ( " nominative case " ) whose forms , in combination with a verb like amat he loves , ' denote the performer ' of the action ; the forms patrem father ' and filium son ' belong to a different form-class ( " accusative case " ) , whose forms , in combination with a verb like amat , denote the undergoes ' ( ' object ' or goal ' ) of the action . The features of selection are often highly arbitrary and whimsical . We combine prince , author , sculptor with the suffix - ess in princess , authoress , sculptress ( in this last case with phonetic modification of r to r ) , but not king , singer , painter . By virtue of this habit , the former words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded .  | 10. 5 . The features of grammatical arrangement appear in various combinations , but can usually be singled out and separately described . A simple feature of grammatical arrangement is a grammatical feature or taxeme . A taxeme is in grammar what a phoneme is in the lexicon ? namely , the smallest unit of form . Like a phoneme , a taxeme , taken by itself , in the abstract , is meaningless . Just as combinations of phonemes , or , less commonly , single phonemes , occur as actual lexical signals ( phonetic forms ) , so combinations of taxemes , or , quite frequently , single taxemes , occur as conventional grammatical arrangements , tactic forms . A phonetic form with its meaning is a linguistic form ; a tactic form with its meaning is a grammatical form . When we have occasion to contrast the purely lexical character of a linguistic form with the habits of arrangement to which it is subject , we shall speak of it as a lexical form . In the case of lexical forms , we have defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sememes ; in the same way , the smallest meaningful units of grammatical form may be spoken of as tagmemes , and their meanings as episememes . The utterance Run ! , for example , contains two grammatical features ( taxemes ) , namely , the modulation of exclamatory finalpitch , and the selective feature which consists in the use of an infinitive verb ( as opposed , for instance , to the use of a noun , as in John ! ) . Each of these two taxemes happens to be , in English , a tactic form , since each is currently used as a unit of signaling . Taking each of them with its meaning , we describe them as units of grammatical form ( tagmemes ) . The tagmeme of exclamatory final-pitch occurs with any lexical form and gives it a grammatical meaning ( an episememe ) which we may roughly describe , perhaps , as strong stimulus . ' The tagmeme of selection by which infinitive forms are marked off as a form-class , has a grammatical meaning ( an episememe ) which we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tagmeme may consist of more than one taxeme . For instance , in forms like John ran ; poor John ran away ; the boys are here ; I know , we find several taxemes . One constituent belongs to the form-class of nominative expressions ( John , poor John , the boys , I ) . The other constituent belongs to the form-class of finite verb expressions ( ran , ran away , are here , know ) . A further taxeme of selection assigns certain finite verb expressions to certain nomina- five expressions ; thus , the constituents are not interchangeable in the three examples I am , John is , you are . A taxeme of order places the nominative expression before the finite verb expression : we do not say *ran John . Further taxemes of order , in part reversing the basic one , appear in special cases like did John run ? away ran John ; will John ? A taxeme of modulation appears only in special cases , when the nominative expression is unstressed , as in I know aj ' now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as John 's here , with z for is , or I 'd go , with d for would . Now , none of these taxemes , taken by itself , has any meaning , but , taken all together , they make up a grammatical form , a tagmeme , whose meaning is this , that the one constituent ( the nominative expression ) performs ' the other constituent ( the finite verb expression ) . If we say John ran ! with exclamatory pitch , we have a complex grammatical form , with three tagmemes . One of these is strong stimulus , ' the second is ( object ) performs ( action ) , ' and the third has the episememe of complete and novel ' utterance , and consists , formally , in the selective feature of using an actor-action phrase as a sentence . 10. 6 . Any utterance can be fully described in terms of lexical and grammatical forms ; we must remember only that the meanings can not be defined in terms of our science . Any morpheme can be fully described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more phonemes in a certain arrangement . Thus , the morpheme duke consists of the phonemes , simple and compound , d , juw , k , in this order ; and the morpheme - ess consists of the phonemes e , s , in this order . Any complex form can be fully described ( apart from its meaning ) in terms of the immediate constituent forms and the grammatical features ( taxemes ) by which these constituent forms are arranged . Thus , the complex form duchess ' dotes consists of the immediate constituents duke djuwk and - ess es , arranged in the following way : Selection . The constituent duke belongs to a special class of English forms which combine with the form - ess . This form-class includes , for instance , the forms count , prince , lion , tiger , author , waiter , but not the forms man , boy , dog , singer ; it is a sub-class of a larger form-class of male personal nouns . The form - ess constitutes a little form-class of its own , by virtue of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms in the class just  | described . All these facts , taken together , may be viewed as a single taxeme of selection . Order . The form - ess is spoken after the accompanying form . Modulation . The form - ess is spoken unstressed ; the accompanying form has a high stress . Phonetic modification . The juw of duke is replaced by o , and the k by c . Given the forms duke and - ess , the statement of these four grammatical features fully describes the complex form duchess . Any actual utterance can be fully described in terms of the lexical form and the accompanying grammatical features . Thus , the utterance Duchess ! consists of the lexical form duchess and the two taxemes of exclamatory final-pitch and selection of a substantive expression . If some science furnished us with definitions of the meanings of the units here concerned , defining for us the meanings ( sememes ) of the two morphemes ( duke and - ess ) and the meanings ( episememes ) of the three tagmemes ( arrangement of duke and - ess ; use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the meaning of the utterance Duchess ! would be fully analyzed and defined . 10. 7 . The grammatical forms are no exception to the necessary principle ? strictly speaking , we should call it an assumption ? that a language can convey only such meanings as are attached to some formal feature : the speakers can signal only by means of signals . Many students of language have been misled in this matter by the fact that the formal features of grammar are not phonemes or combinations of phonemes which we can pronounce or transcribe , but merely arrangements of phonetic forms . For this our scholastic tradition may be largely to blame ; if it were not for this tradition , there would perhaps be nothing difficult about the fact , for instance , that in English , John hit Bill and Bill hit John signal two different situations , or that convict stressed on the first syllable differs in meaning from convict stressed on the second syllable , or that there is a difference of meaning between John ! and John ? and John . A form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without , for instance , any specification as to final-pitch , is , properly speaking , not a real linguistic form , but only a lexical form ; a linguistic form , as actually uttered , always contains a grammatical form .  | No matter how simple a form we take and how we utter it , we have already made some selection by virtue of which the utterance conveys a grammatical meaning in addition to its lexical content , and we have used some pitch-scheme which , in English at any rate , lends it a grammatical meaning such as statement ' yesor-no question , " supplement-question , ' or exclamation . ' The grammatical forms of a language can be grouped into three great classes : ( 1 ) When a form is spoken alone ( that is , not as a constituent of a larger form ) , it appears in some sentence-type . Thus , in English , the use of the secondary phoneme ! gives us the sentence-type of exclamation , and the use of a substantive expression gives us the type of a call ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , rarely , more ) forms are spoken together , as constituents of a complex form , the grammatical features by which they are combined , make up a construction . Thus , the grammatical features by which duke and - ess combine in the form duchess , or the grammatical features by which poor John and ran away combine in the form poor John ran away , make up a construction . ( 3 ) A third great class of grammatical forms must probably be set up for the cases where a form is spoken as the conventional substitute for any one of a whole class of other forms . Thus , the selective feature by which the form he in English is a conventional substitute for a whole class of other forms , such as John , poor John , a policeman , the man I saw yesterday , whoever did this , and so on ( which forms , by virtue of this habit , constitute form-class of " singular male substantive expressions " ) , must doubtless be viewed as an example of a third class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substitutions .  | SENTENCE ? TYPES 11. 1 . In any utterance , a linguistic form appears either as a constituent of some larger form , as does John in the utterance John ran away , or else as an independent form , not included in any larger ( complex ) linguistic form , as , for instance , John in the exclamation John ! When a linguistic form occurs as part of a larger form , it is said to be in included position ; otherwise it is said to be in absolute position and to constitute a sentence . A form which in one utterance figures as a sentence , may in another utterance appear in included position . In the exclamation just cited , John is a sentence , but in the exclamation Poor John ! the form John is in included position . In this latter exclamation , poor John is a sentence , but in the utterance Poor John ran away , it is in included position . Or again , in the utterance just cited , poor John ran away is a sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John ran away , it is in included position . An utterance may consist of more than one sentence . This is the case when the utterance contains several linguistic forms which are not by any meaningful , conventional grammatical arrangement ( that is , by any construction ) united into a larger form , e.g. : How are you ? It 's a fine day . Are you going to play tennis this afternoon ? Whatever practical connection there may be between these three forms , there is no grammatical arrangement uniting them into one larger form : the utterance consists of three sentences . It is evident that the sentences in any utterance are marked off by the mere fact that each sentence is an independent linguistic form , not included by virtue of any grammatical construction in any larger linguistic form . In most , or possibly all languages , however , various taxemes mark off the sentence , and , further , distinguish different types of sentence . In English and many other languages , sentences are marked off by modulation , the use of secondary phonemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of sentences , and distinguish three main sentence-types : John ran away . John  | ran away ? Who ran away i , . To each of these , further , we may add the distortion of exclamatory sentence-pitch , so that we get in all , six types , as described in ? 7.6 . This use of secondary phonemes to mark the end of sentences makes possible a construction known as parataxis , in which two forms united by no other construction are united by the use of only one sentence-pitch . Thus , if we say It 's ten o'clock . I have to go home . with the final falling pitch of a statement on o'clock , we have spoken two sentences , but if we omit this final-pitch ( substituting for it a pause-pitch ) , the two forms are united , by the construction of parataxis , into a single sentence : It 's ten o'clock , I have to go home . Another feature of sentence-modulation in English and many other languages , is the use of a secondary phoneme to mark emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress for this ( " Now it 's my turn , " ? 7.3 ) . The emphatic element in English may be marked also by the use of special constructions ( It was John who did that ) and by word-order ( Away he ran ) ; in languages where stress is not significant , such methods prevail , as in French C'est Jean qui l'a fait s e zan ki 1 a fe It is John who ( lid it . ' Some languages use special words before or after an emphatic element , as Tagalog ikaw ' in ? ai nag'sa:bi nijan you ( emphatic particle ) the one-who-said that , ' i.e. You yourself said so ' ; Menomini ' jo:hpeh ' niw , kan ' wenah ' wa:pah Today ( emphatic particle ) , not ( emphatic particle ) tomorrow . ' Our high stress can even strike forms that are normally unstressed : of , for , and by the people ; immigration and emigration . 11. 2 . Beside features of modulation , features of selection may serve to mark off different sentence-types . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , where a special construction , or the use of a special particle , marks an emphatic element . In English , supplement-questions are distinguished not only by their special pitch-phoneme l , , but also by a selective taxeme : the form used as a supplement-question either consists of a special type of word or phrase , which we may call an interrogative substitute , or else contains such a word or phrase ; Who ? With whom ? Who ran away ? With whom was he talking ? Perhaps all languages distinguish two great sentence-types which we may call full sentences and minor sentences . The difference consists in a taxeme of selection : certain forms are favorite  | sentence forms ; when a favorite sentence-form is used as a sentence , this is a full sentence , and when any other form is used as a sentence , this is a minor sentence . In English we have two favorite sentence-forms . One consists of actor-action phrases ? phrases whose structure is that of the actor-action construction : John ran away . Who ran away ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? an infinitive verb with or without modifiers : Come ! Be good ! This second type is always spoken with exclamatory sentence-pitch ; the infinitive may be accompanied by the word you as an actor : You be good ! As these examples show , the meaning of the full sentence-type is something like complete and novel utterance ' ? that is , the speaker implies that what he says is a full-sized occurrence or instruction , and that it somehow alters the hearer 's situation . The more deliberate the speech , the more likely are the sentences to be of the full type . The nature of the episememe of full sentences has given rise to much philosophic dispute ; to define this ( or any other ) meaning exactly , lies beyond the domain of linguistics . It is a serious mistake to try to use this meaning ( or any meanings ) , rather than formal features , as a starting-point for linguistic discussion . Quite a few of the present-day Indo-European languages agree with English in using an actor-action form as a favorite sentencetype . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agree also in that the actor-action form is always a phrase , with the actor and the action as separate words or phrases . In some of these languages , however ? for instance , in Italian and Spanish and in the Slavic languages ? the actor and the action are bound forms which make up a single word : Italian canto ' kant-o I sing , ' canti ' kant-i thou singest , ' cant-a ' leant-a he ( she , it ) sings , ' and so on . A word which contains a favorite sentence-form of its language is a sentence-word . Some languages have different favorite sentence-types . Russian has an actor-action type of sentence-word finite verbs , like those of Italian : poiju I sing , ' po'jo thou singest , ' poi jot he ( she , it ) sings , ' and so on . In addition to this , it has another type of full sentence : i'van du'rak John ( is ) a fool , ' sol'dat ' xrabr the soldier ( is ) brave , ' o'tets ' doma Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , one component , which is spoken first , is a substantive ; the other form is a substantive to which the first  | is equated , or an adjective ( adjectives have a special form for this use ) , or an adverbial form . When a language has more than one type of full sentence , these types may agree in showing constructions of two parts . The common name for such bipartite favorite sentence-forms is predications . In a predication , the more object-like component is called the subject , the other part the predicate . Of the two Russian types , the former is called a narrative predication , the latter an equational predication . For a language like English or Italian , which has only one type of bipartite sentence , these terms are superfluous , but often employed : John ran is said to be a predication , in which the actor ( John ) is the subject and the action ( ran ) the predicate . Latin had the same types of full sentence as Russian , but the narrative type existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ( she , it ) sings , ' amat he ( she , it ) loves , ' and one with a goal-action construction : cantatur it is being sung , ' amatur he ( she , it ) is loved . ' The equational type was less common than in Russian : beatus ille happy ( is ) he . ' Tagalog has five types of predication , with this common feature : either the subject precedes and a particle aj ( after vowels , j ) intervenes , or the reverse order is used without the particle . There is , first , an equational type : al ' ba:ta j maba'it the child is good , ' or , with inverse order , maba'it ark ' ba:ta ? good ( is ) the child . ' Then there are four narrative types , in which the predicates are transient words , which denote things in four different relations to an action . The four types of transient words are : actor : pu'mu:tul one who cut ' goal : pi'nu:tul something cut ' instrument : ipi'nu:tul something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . ' These transient words are by no means confined , like our verbs , to predicative position ; they can figure equally well , for instance , in equational sentences , as : ark pu'mu:tul aj si ' hwan the one who did the cutting was John , ' but in the predicate position they produce four types of narrative predication : actor-action : sja j pu'mu:tul nark ' ka:huj he cut some wood ' goal-action : pi'nu:tul nja ark ' ka:huj was-cut by-him the wood , ' i.e. he cut the wood '  | instrument-action : ipi'nu:tul nja aij ' gu:luk was-cut-with byhim the bolo-knife , ' i.e. he cut with the bolo ' place-action : pinu'tu:lan nja axe ' ka:huj was-cut-from by-him the wood , ' i.e. he cut ( a piece ) off the wood . ' Georgian distinguishes between an action-type , as ' v-is ? er I-write ' and a sensation-type , as ' m-e-smi-s me-sound-is , ' i.e. I hear . ' Such distinctions are never carried out with scientific consistency ; Georgian classifies sight in the action-type : ' v-naxav I-see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command in English consists of merely an infinitive form ( come ; be good ) and only occasionally contains an actor ( you be good ) . In German , beside a favorite sentence-type of actor-action which closely resembles ours , there is an impersonal variety , which differs by not containing any actor : mir ist kalt mi:r ist ' kalt tome is cold , ' that is , I feel cold ; ' hier wird getanzt ' hi:r virt ge'tantst here gets danced , ' that is , there is dancing here . ' In Russian , there is an impersonal type which differs from the equational predication by the absence of a subject : ' nulno it is necessary . ' 11. 3 . English has a sub-type of full sentences which we may call the explicit-action type ; in this type the action centers round the verb do , does , did . This taxeme of selection appears in the contrast between , say , I heard him and I did hear him . The explicitaction type has several uses . When the verb is an emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type emphasizes the lexical content ( the sememe ) of the verb , as in " I heard him " ( but did not see him ) , or in " Run home ! " ( do n't walk ) ; the explicitaction type emphasizes the occurrence ( as opposed to nonoccurrence ) or the time ( present or past ) of the action , as in " I did hear him , " or " Do run home ! " Secondly , we use the explicitaction type wherever the verb is modified by not , as in I did n't hear him or Do n't run away ; thus , English , by a taxeme of selection , distinguishes a negative type of full sentence . Further , within our explicit-action type , we distinguish a subtype in which the verb do , does , did precedes the actor . This inverted type occurs in formal yes-or-no questions , along with question-pitch ; Did John run away ? Did n't John run away ? in contrast with the uninverted ( informal ) type : John ran away ? John did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so widely paralleled among languages as the more general characteristics of English full sentences . In German , for instance , the negative adverb is not tied up with a special-sentence-type : Er kommt nicht e:r ' komt ' nixt he comes not ' is like Er kommt bald e:r ' komt ' bait he comes soon . ' Other languages , however , resemble English in using special sentence-types with negative value . In Finnish , negative sentences have a special construction : the verb ( which , as in Italian , includes actor and action in one sentence-word ) is a special negative verb , which may be modified by an infinitivelike form of another verb : luen I read ' en lue I-do n't read ' luet thou readest ' et lue thou-dost-not read ' lukee he reads ' ei lue he-does n't read . ' In Menomini there are three main types of full sentence , equational , narrative , and negative : narrative : pi:w he-comes ' equational : enu ? pajiat he ? the one who comes , ' that is , It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he-comes ( negative ) , ' that is , He does not come . ' In the negative type the two parts are , on the one side , the negative word kan in its various inflections and , on the other , the rest of the sentence , marked by the use of special verb-forms . Special types of full sentences for formal questions are more widespread . German uses actor-action forms in which the verb precedes the actor : Kommt er ? ' komt e:r ? comes he ? ' in contrast with Er kommt e:r ' komt he comes . ' French also uses special interrogative constructions : Is John coming ? ' is either Jean vient-il ? Pan vjent i ? John comes he ? ' or Est-ce que Jean vient ? e s ka fan vjen ? Is it that John comes ? ' In Menomini the three main types of full sentence have each an interrogative sub-type : narrative : pi : ? ? Is he coming ? ' equation : enut pajiat ? he ( interrogative ) the one who comes ? ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative : kane : ? upianan ? not ( interrogative ) he-comes ( negative ) ? ' that is , Is n't he coming ? ' Other languages lack a special sentence-type for formal yes-or-no questions , but some of them use special interrogative words , as Latin venitne ? we'nit ne ? Is he coming ? ' and num vent ? You  | do n't mean to say he is coming ? ' ( expectation of negative reply ) , in contrast with venit ? He is coming ? ' This use of special little words ( particles ) to mark a formal yes-or-no question , appears in many languages , such as Russian , Chinese , Tagalog , Cree . Most languages agree with English in marking supplementquestions by the presence of special words , but the details differ : in Tagalog and in Menomini , for instance , the supplement-question is always an equational sentence , e.g. , Menomini awe : ? pajiatz who the-one-who-comes ? ' that is , Who is coming ? ' The English command is an example of a special sentence-type used in exclamations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some kinds of exclamations . In Menomini there are two such , one of surprise , where the occurrence is new or unforeseen , and one of disappointment at the non-occurrence of something expected : SURPRISE narrative : piasah ! and so he 's coming ! ' equational : enupa ? pajiat ! and so it 's he that 's coming ! ' negative : kasa ? upianan ! and so he is n't coming ! ' DISAPPOINTMENT narrative : piapah ! but he was coming ! ' equational : enupa ? pajiat ! but he was the one who was coming ! ' negative : kapa ? upianan ! but he was n't coming ! ' 11. 4 . A sentence which does not consist of a favorite sentenceform is a minor sentence . Some forms occur predominantly as minor sentences , entering into few or no constructions other than parataxis ; such forms are interjections . Interjections are either special words , such as ouch , oh , sh , gosh , hello , sir , ma 'm , yes , or else phrases ( secondary interjections ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goodness me , goodness gracious , goodness sakes alive , oh dear , by golly , you angel , please , thank you , good-bye . In general , minor sentences seem to be either completive or exclamatory . The completive type consists of a form which merely supplements a situation ? that is , an earlier speech , a gesture , or the mere presence of an object : This one . Tomorrow morning . Gladly , if I can . Whenever you 're ready . Here . When ? With whom ? Mr. Brown : Mr. Smith ( in introducing people ) . Drugs . State Street . They occur especially as answers to questions ; for this use  | we have the special completive interjections , yes and no . Even in this regard languages differ : French says si yes ' in answer to negative questions , such as Is n't he coming ? ' but oui wi yes ' in answer to others , such as Is he coming ? ' Some languages have no such interjections . Polish answers with ordinary adverbs , affirmatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne not . ' Finnish answers affirmatively by an ordinary form , e.g. Tulette-ko kaupungista ? ? Tulemme . Are you coming from town ? ' ? We are coming , ' and negatively by its negative verb : Tunnetteko herra Lehdon ? ? En ( or En tunne ) Do you know Mr. Lehto ? ' ? I do n't ' ( or I do n't know ' ) . Exclamatory minor sentences occur under a violent stimulus . They consist of interjections or of normal forms that do not belong to favorite sentence-types , and often show parataxis : Ouch , damn it ! This way , please ! A substantive form naming a hearer is used in English as a demand for his presence or attention : John ! Little boy ! You with the glasses ! With parataxis : Hello , John ! Come here , little boy ! The interjections sir and ma'am are especially devoted to this use ; in the same way Russian uses an interjection s , as da-s yes , sir ; yes , ma'am , ' without distinction of sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Latin Balbus ( man 's name ) , vocative Balbe , or Fox iskwe:wa woman , ' vocative iskwe , and iskwe:wak women , ' vocative iskwe:tike . In Menomini the terms of relationship have special , highly irregular vocative forms : ne ? neh my older brother , ' vocative nano : ? or neki:jah my mother , ' vocative ne ? c:h . Other words are spoken as vocatives with short vowels instead of long : mete:muh woman , ' vocative metemuh . In Sanskrit , vocative forms were unstressed . Occasionally we find minor sentences of aphoristic type ( ? 9.9 ) used with much the same value as full sentences ; English examples are The more you have , the more you want . The more , the merrier . First come , first served . Old saint , young sinner. 11. 5 . In most languages the sentence is characterized also by a selective feature more general than all those we have been discussing : some linguistic forms , which we call bound forms ( ? 10.1 ) , are never used as sentences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , duchess , etc. , or the - ish i ? in boyish , childish , greenish , etc. , or the -s s in hats , books , cups , etc . These are genuine linguistic forms and convey a meaning , but they occur only in  | construction , as part of a larger form . Forms which occur as sentences are free forms . Not every language uses bound forms : modern Chinese , for instance , seems to have none . A free form which consists entirely of two or more lesser free forms , as , for instance , poor John or John ran away or yes , sir , is a phrase . A free form which is not a phrase , is a word . A word , then , is a free form which does not consist entirely of ( two or more ) lesser free forms ; in brief , a word is a minimum free form . Since only free forms can be isolated in actual speech , the word , as the minimum of free form , plays a very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary life , the word is the smallest unit of speech . Our dictionaries list the words of a language ; for all purposes except the systematic study of language , this procedure is doubtless more useful than would be a list of morphemes . The analysis of linguistic forms into words is familiar to us because we have the custom of leaving spaces between words in our writing and printing . People who have not learned to read and write , have some difficulty when , by any chance , they are called upon to make word-divisions . This difficulty is less in English than in some other languages , such as French . The fact that the spacing of words has become part of our tradition of writing , goes to show , however , that recognition of the word as a unit of speech is not unnatural to speakers ; indeed , except for certain doubtful cases , people easily learn to make this analysis . In our school tradition we sometimes speak of forms like book , books , or do , does , did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , this is inaccurate , since there are differences of form and meaning between the members of these sets : the forms just cited are different linguistic forms and , accordingly , different words . In other cases , inconsistencies in our habits of writing may make us uncertain . We write John 's in John 's ready , where it is two words ( John and z , an alternant of is ) and in John 's hat , where it is one word ( consisting of John and the bound form -z , possessive ) . We write the boy 's as though it were two or three words , but , strictly speaking , it is only one word , since the immediate constituents are the boy and -z possessive , and the latter is a bound form ; this appears clearly in cases like the king of England 's or the man I saw yesterday 's , where the meaning shows that the -z  | is in construction with the entire preceding phrase , so that the two are united into a single long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages , however , it is impossible to distinguish consistently , on the one hand , between phrases and words and , on the other hand , between words and bound forms . The linguist can not wait indefinitely for the chance of hearing a given form used as a sentence ? that is , spoken alone . Some forms are rarely so used . Inquiry or experiment may call forth very different responses from hearers . Are English forms like the , a , is , and ever spoken alone ? One can imagine a dialogue : Is ? ? No ; was . The word because is said to be a woman 's answer . An impatient listener says And ? We can imagine a hesitant speaker who says The . . . and is understood by his hearers . Aside from such far-fetched situations , the general structure of a language may make one classification more convenient than another for our purpose . The form the , though rarely spoken alone , plays much the same part in our language as the forms this and that , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class the as a word : this thing : that thing : the thing this : that : ( the ) . In other cases , the difficulty is due to features of phonetic modification . The forms z in John 's ready , m in I 'm hungry , or nt in Do n't ! are unpronounceable in English , but we have to class them as words , for they are merely alternants of the pronounceable forms is , am , not . In French we have even the case of a single phoneme representing two words : au o in a phrase like au roi o rwa to the king , ' arises by phonetic modification of the two words d a to ' and le k the ' ; this o is homonymous with the words eau water ' and haut high . ' In other cases the doubtful forms are units of grammatical selection rather than of modification , and yet , in view of the total structure of their language , may be best classified as words . French , again , has several forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me ' and lui lqi he , him ' are replaced in certain constructions by shorter forms that do not ordinarily appear in absolute use , such as je in I , ' me me me , ' it ill he , ' le k him ' ; for instance : je le connais a 1 kane I know him , ' it me connatt i m kone he knows me . ' The replacement of the absolute forms by these conjunct forms is to be described as a feature of  | selection rather than of modification ; nevertheless , the conjunct forms , largely because of their parallelism with the absolute forms , have the status of words . A less important border-line case is the use of bound forms in hypostasis ( ? 9.7 ) , as when we speak of a girl in her teens , taking up all kinds of isms and ologies . At the other extreme we find forms which lie on the border between words and phrases . A form like blackbird resembles a twoword phrase ( black bird ) , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to class this form as a single ( compound ) word . In this case there is a clear-cut difference , since in blackbird the second word ( bird ) , has a weaker stress instead of a normal high stress , a difference which in English is phonemic , and this formal difference correlates with the semantic difference between blackbird and black bird . The distinction is not always so clear : ice-cream ' ajs , krijm , spoken with only one high stress , will be classed as a ( compound ) word , but the variant pronunciation ice cream ' ajs ' krijm , with two high stresses , will be classed as a two-word phrase . Similar variants exist in types like messenger boy , lady friend . This criterion of stress fails us in forms like devil-may-care ( as in a devil-may-care manner ) or jack-in-the-pulpit ( as the name of a plant ) . If the former were devil-may-care-ish , we should not hesitate to class it as a word , since here one of the immediate constituents is the bound form - ish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( phrase-words ) because of certain other features which , within the system of the English language , place them on a level with other words . One of these is their peculiar function ; as a phrase devil-may-care would be an actor-action form , but as a phrase-word it fills the position of an adjective . Another is their indivisibility : the plant-name jack-in-the-pulpit can not be modified by putting the word little in front of pulpit , but the corresponding phrase permits of this and other expansions . This latter principle , namely that a word can not be interrupted by other forms , holds good almost universally . Thus , one can say black ? I should say , bluish-black ? birds , but one can not , similarly interrupt the compound word blackbirds . The exceptions to this principle are so rare as to seem almost pathological . Gothic had a bound form ga- which was prefixed especially to verbs : ' se:hwi he should see , ' ga'se:hwi he should be able to see . '  | Yet occasionally we find words included between this ga- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the translation of Mark 8 , 23 : ' frah ina ga- u hwa ' se:hwi ' he asked him whether u he saw anything hwa . ' None of these criteria can be strictly applied : many forms lie on the border-line between bound forms and words , or between words and phrases ; it is impossible to make a rigid distinction between forms that may and forms that may not be spoken in absolute position . 11. 7 . The word is not primarily a phonetic unit : we do not , by pauses or other phonetic features , mark off those segments of our speech which could be spoken alone . In various ways , however , different languages give phonetic recognition to the wordunit : some , like French , very little , and others , like English , very much . As a free form , the word is capable of being spoken in absolute position ; accordingly , it is subject to the phonetic patterning of its language . It is sure to contain at least one of the phonemes which normally serve as syllabics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occasionally violate this principle . The initial and final consonants and clusters in the word are necessarily such as can occur at the beginning and at the end of speech ; thus , no English word begins with q or mb and none ends with h or mb . Beyond this , many languages place further restrictions on the phonetic structure of the word . We may find that some of the permitted medial clusters do not occur within the body of a single word ; in English , permitted clusters like se , vt , tsv , ststr , as in rash child , give ten , it 's very cold , least strong , and double consonants , like nn , tt , bb , as in ten nights , that time , nab Bill , do not occur within simple words . On the other hand , French , with its insertion of a , and languages like Fox or Samoan , which use no final consonants , tolerate no more clusters within a phrase than within a word . Some languages have the peculiar restriction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowels in the successive syllables of a word . Thus , in Turkish , the vowels of a word are either all front vowels i , y , e , 0 , as in sevildirememek ' not to be able to cause to be loved , ' or all back vowels i , u , a , o , as in jazildiramamak ' not to be able to cause to be written ' .  | In Chinese we have the extreme of structural word-marking ; each word consists of one syllable and of two or three primary phonemes : a non-syllabic simple or compound phoneme as initial , a syllabic simple or compound phoneme as final ; and one of the pitch-schemes ( ? 7.7 ) ; the initial non-syllabic may be lacking ; the language has no bound forms . In English and many other languages , each word is marked by containing one and only one high stress ( forgiving ; convict , verb ; convict , noun ) . In some of these languages the word-unit is even more plainly marked , in that the position of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the word : in Bohemian and in Icelandic the first syllable is stressed , in Cree the third-last ( the antepenult ) , in Polish the next-to-last ( the penult ) . In Latin the penult was stressed , as in amamus a'ma : - mus we love , ' unless this syllable had a short vowel followed by no more than one consonant , in which case the antepenult was stressed , as in capimus ' kapimus we take . ' In languages like these , the stress is a word-marker , which indicates the beginnings or ends of words , but , since its position is fixed , it can not distinguish between different words . In Italian , Spanish , and modern Greek , the stress comes always on one of the last three syllables of a word . In ancient Greek a word had either a simple accent on one of the last three syllables or a compound accent on one of the last two , with some further restrictions based on the nature of the primary phonemes in these syllables . Among stress-using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning of a word whose stress comes on the first syllable ; witness contrasts like a name versus an aim or that scold versus that 's cold ( ? 7.5 ) ; others , such as Dutch , Italian , Spanish , and the Slavic languages , regulate the onset of stress by purely phonetic habits , starting the stress on a consonant which precedes a stressed vowel , even though this consonant belongs to another word , as in Italian un altro u'n altro another . ' A language like French , which uses no stress-phonemes , can not in this way mark its word-units . Phonetic recognition of the word-unit , in cases like the above , is disturbed chiefly by two factors . Words which contain , among their ultimate constituents , two or more free forms , generally have the phonetic character of phrases . In English , compound words have the same medial clusters as phrases : stove-top vt ,  | chest-strap ststr , pen-knife nn , grab-bag bb ; phrase-derivatives may even have more than one high stress : old-maidish ' owld ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , words in included position are subject to modulations and phonetic modifications which may remove the phonetic characteristics of word-marking . Thus not in the phrase do n't ' dow nt loses both its high stress and its syllabic ; the phrase ca n't is homonymous with the word cant ; compare , similarly , lock it , with locket , feed her ' fijd 1 with feeder , and so on . In the normal pronunciation at all e't ol the stress begins on the t of at . These included variants , in which a word loses the phonetic features that characterize words in absolute position , will concern us in the next chapter . In the present connection it is worth noticing , however , that in a small way these modified phrases may nevertheless involve phonetic recognition of the word-unit , because they contain phonetic sequences that do not occur in single words . Thus , the final sequence ownt is permitted in English , but occurs only in the phrases do n't and wo n't , and not in any one word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tn , tst occur in phrases , thanks to phonetic modification of the first word , as in t next the night , ' t Stu:At thou standest , ' but not in any one word . In North Chinese a phrase may end in syllabic plus r , as in Maw3 ' ma r3 little horse , ' but only as a result of phonetic modification of two words , ? in our example , may horse ' and r2 son , child , small . ' In the few languages which use no bound forms , the word has a double importance , since it is the smallest unit not only of free form but also of linguistic form in general . In languages which use bound forms , the word has great structural importance because the constructions in which free forms appear in phrases differ very decidedly from the constructions in which free or bound forms appear in words . Accordingly , the grammar of these languages consists of two parts , called syntax , and morphology . However , the constructions of compound words and , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .   12. 1 . Traditionally , the grammar of most languages is discussed under two heads , syntax and morphology . The sentencetypes , which we surveyed in the last chapter , are placed under the former heading , and so are the types of substitution ( which we shall consider in Chapter 15 ) , but grammatical constructions , which we shall now examine , are dealt with partly under the heading of morphology . There has been considerable debate as to the usefulness of this division , and as to the scope of the two headings . In languages that have bound forms , the constructions in which bound forms play a part differ radically from the constructions in which all the immediate constituents are free forms . Accordingly , we place the former under the separate heading of morphology . The difficulty is this , that certain formal relations , such as the relation between he and him , consist in the use of bound forms , while the semantic difference between these forms can be defined in terms of syntactic construction ; he serves , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as an undergoer ( hit him ) . Nevertheless , the traditional division is justified : it merely happens that in these cases the meanings involved in the morphologic construction are definable in terms of syntax instead of being definable merely in terms of practical life . Syntactic constructions , then , are constructions in which none of the immediate constituents is a bound form . Border-line cases between morphology and syntax occur chiefly in the sphere of compound words and phrase-words. 12. 2 . The free forms ( words and phrases ) of a language appear in larger free forms ( phrases ) , arranged by taxemes of modulation , phonetic modification , selection , and order . Any meaningful , recurrent set of such taxemes is a syntactic construction . For instance , the English actor-action construction appears in phrases like these : John ran Bill fell John fell Our horses ran away . Bill ran  | In these examples we see taxemes of selection . The one constituent ( John , Bill , our horses ) is a form of a large class , which we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be used in this way . The other constituent ( ran , fell , ran away ) is a form of another large class , which we call finite verb expressions ; a form like John or very good could not be used in this way . Secondly , we see a taxeme of order : the nominative expression precedes the finite verb expression . We need not stop here to examine the various other types and sub-types of this construction , which show different or additional taxemes . The meaning of the construction is roughly this , that whatever is named by the substantive expression is an actor that performs the action named by the finite verb expression . The two immediate constituents of the English actoraction construction are not interchangeable : we say that the construction has two positions , which we may call the positions of actor and of action . Certain English words and phrases can appear in the actor position , certain others in the action position . The positions in which a form can appear are its functions or , collectively , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position thereby constitute a form-class . Thus , all the English words and phrases which can fill the actor position in the actor-action construction , constitute a great form-class , and we call them nominative expressions ; similarly , all the English words and phrases which can fill the action position on the actor-action construction , constitute a second great form-class , and we call them finite verb expressions . 12. 3 . Since the constituents of phrases are free forms , the speaker may separate them by means of pauses . Pauses are mostly non-distinctive ; they occur chiefly when the constituents are long phrases ; in English they are usually preceded by a pause-pitch . We have seen ( ? 11.1 ) that free forms which are united by no s other construction may be united by parataxis , the mere absence of a phonetic sentence-final , as in It 's ten o'clock , I have to go home . In ordinary English parataxis a pause-pitch appears between the constituents , but we have also a variety of close parataxis without a pause-pitch , as in please come or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of semi-absolute forms , which grammatically and in meaning duplicate some part of the form with which they are joined in parataxis , as in John , he ran away . In French this type is regularly used in some kinds of   questions , as Jean quand est-il venu ? ian kant at i vny ? John , when did he come ? ' Parenthesis is a variety of parataxis in which one form interrupts the other ; in English the parenthetic form is ordinarily preceded and followed by a pause-pitch : I saw the boy , I mean Smith 's boy , running across the street . In a form like Wo n't you please come ? the please is a close parenthesis , without pause-pitch . The term apposition is used when paratactically joined forms are grammatically , but not in meaning , equivalent , e.g. John , the poor boy . When the appositional group appears in included position , one of its members is equivalent to a parenthesis : John , I the poor boy , ran away . In English we have also close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Brown , John the Baptist , Mr. Brown , Mount Everest . Often enough non-linguistic factors interfere with construction ; what the speaker has said is nevertheless meaningful , provided he has already uttered a free form . In aposiopesis the speaker breaks off or is interrupted : I thought he ? . In anacolouthon he starts over again : It 's high time we ? oh , well , I guess it wo n't matter . When a speaker hesitates , English and some other languages offer special parenthetic hesitation forms , as r or e in Mr. ? ah ? Sniffen or Mr. ? what you may call him ? Sniffen or that ? thingamajig ? transmitter . 12. 4 . Features of modulation and of phonetic modification play a great part in many syntactic constructions ; they are known as sandhi . ' The form of a word or phrase as it is spoken alone is its absolute form ; the forms which appear in included positions are its sandhi forms . Thus , in English , the absolute form of the indefinite article is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the article is an emphatic element and the next word begins with a consonant , as in " not a house , but the house . " If the next word begins with a vowel , we have instead a sandhi-form , an ' en , as in " not an uncle , but her uncle . " A feature of modulation appears in the fact that when a , an is not an emphatic element , it is spoken as an unstressed syllable , as in a house e ' haws , an arm en ' arm . In English , a word in absolute form has one high stress ; hence we may say that in a sandhi-form without high stress a word is spoken as if it were part   of another word . Various languages use sandhi-forms of this sort ; they are known as atonic forms . This term is not altogether appropriate , since the peculiarity is not always a lack of stress . In the French phrase l'homme 1 am the man , ' the article le la is atonic , because its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phonetic pattern ( lack of a vowel ) . In the Polish phrase ' do nuk to the feet , ' the preposition do to ' is atonic precisely because it has the stress , for the stress in this language is placed on the next-to-last syllable of each word , and falls on do only because this word is treated as part of the following word . An atonic form which is treated as part of the following word ? this is the case in our examples so far ? is a proclitic . An atonic form which is treated as if it were part of the preceding word is an enclitic ; thus , in I saw him aj ' so im , the aj is proclitic , but the im enclitic . The sandhi which substitutes an for a , and the sandhi by which this and other words are unstressed in phrasal combinations , are examples of compulsory sandhi . Other English sandhi habits are optional , because paralleled by unaltered variants , which have usually a formal or elevated connotation ; for instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more elevated variant I saw him aj ' so him . Beside the sandhi-forms in did you ? ' dijuw ? , wo n't you ' wowncuw ? , at all e'tol ( in American English with the voiced tongue-flip variant of t ) , we have the more elegant variants ' did juw ? ' wownt juw ? et ' al . Sandhi-forms may be unpronounceable when taken by themselves ; this is the case in a number of English examples :  | The French language has a great deal of sandhi . Thus , the article la la the ' ( feminine ) loses the a before a vowel or diphthong : la femme la fam the woman , ' but l'encre 1 ankr the ink , ' Vale 1 wa the goose . ' The adjective ce se this ' ( masculine ) adds t before the same sounds : ce couteau sa kuto this knife , ' but cet homme sat am this man . ' A plural pronoun adds z before the initial vowel of a verb : vous faites vu let you make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plural noun-modifier behaves similarly : les femmes le lam the women , ' but les hommes lez am the men . ' A first-person or second-person verb adds z , a third-person verb t , before certain initial vowels : va va go thou , ' but vas-y vaz i go thou there ' ; elle est el e she is , ' but est-elle ? et el ? is she ? ' A few masculine adjectives add sandhi-consonants before a vowel : un grand garcon ken gran garson a big boy , ' but un grand homme cen grant am a great man . ' In languages with distinctions of pitch in the word , modifications of pitch may play a part in sandhi . Thus , in Chinese , beside the absolute form ' i ' one , ' there are the sandhi-forms in ii ' phi ' ' may one horse ' and i2 ko ' zan2 one man . ' Sandhi-modification of initial phonemes is less common than that of the end of a word ; it occurs in the Celtic languages , as , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate special or irregular cases of sandhi , peculiar to certain forms and constructions . General  | or regular sandhi applies to any and all words in a short ( closeknit ) phrase . In some forms of English , such as New England and southern British , words which in absolute position have a final vowel , add r before an initial vowel : water Nato but the water is ' 6e ' watar iz ; idea aj'dija but the idea is Zij aj'dijar iz . When three consonants come together in French , the wordfinal adds a ; thus , porte part carries ' and bien bjEn well ' appear in the phrase as porte bien parta bjen carries well . ' A word whose first syllable in absolute form contains a , either because the word has no other syllabic or because otherwise it would begin with an unpermitted cluster ( ? 8.6 ) , loses this a in the phrase whenever no unpermitted group would result : le la the ' but l'homme 1 am the man ' ; cheval saval horse , ' but un cheval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ne no not , ' le la it , ' demande damand ask , ' , but je ne le demande pas Pa n la dmand pa I do n't ask it ' and si je ne le demande pas si na 1 domand pa if I do n't ask it . ' In Sanskrit there is a great deal of general sandhi ; for instance , final ah of the absolute form appears in the following sandhivariants : absolute de : ' vah a god , ' sandhi-forms : de : ' vas ' tatra the god there , ' de : ' vac carati the god wanders , ' de : ' va e:ti the god goes , ' de : ' vo : dada:ti the god gives , ' and , with change also of a following initial , before ' atra here , ' de : ' vo : tra the god here . ' Certain words , however , behave differently ; thus , ' punah again ' gives ' punar dada:ti again he gives , ' ' punar ' atra again here . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature . Thus , in some Dutch pronunciations the absolute forms heb ' hep have ' and stop stop stop ' behave differently in sandhi : heb ilc ? ' heb ek ? have I ? ' but stop ilc ? ' stop ek ? do I stop ? ' The forms which have the voiced consonant in sandhi have it also whenever it is not at the end of the word , as hebben ' hebe to have , ' in contrast with stoppen ' stope to stop . ' Sandhi-distinctions based on morphologic features like this , may be called reminiscent sandhi . Sandhi may go so far as to restrict the word-final in a phrase beyond the ordinary medial restrictions of a language . Thus , the sequence ta is permitted medially in Sanskrit , as in ' patati he falls , ' but t at the end of the word is in close-knit phrases replaced by d before a vowel : absolute ' tat that , ' but ' tad asti that is. '  | 12. 6 . Taxemes of selection play a large part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? in stating , for instance , under what circumstances ( with what accompanying forms or , if the accompanying forms are the same , with what difference of meaning ) various form-classes ( as , say , indicative and subjunctive verbs , or dative and accusative nouns , and so on ) appear in syntactic constructions . We have seen that , the selective taxemes delimit form-classes . These classes are most numerous in the languages that use most taxemes of selection . The syntactic constructions of a language mark off large classes of free forms , such as , in English , the nominative expression or the finite verb expression . Since different languages have different constructions , their form-classes also are different . We shall see that the great form-classes of a language are most easily described in terms of word-classes ( such as the traditional " parts of speech " ) , because the form-class of a phrase is usually determined by one or more of the words which appear in it . In languages which make a wide use of selective taxemes , the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English actor-action construction , in addition to the general selective taxemes , shows some more specialized taxemes of the same sort . With the nominative expressions John or that horse we can join the finite verb expression runs fast , but not the finite verb expression run fast ; with the nominative expressions John and Bill or horses the reverse selection is made . Accordingly , we recognize in each of these two form-classes a division into two sub-classes , which we call singular and plural , such that a singular nominative expression is joined only with a singular finite verb expression , and a plural nominative expression only with a plural finite verb expression . It would not do to define these sub-classes by meaning ? witness cases like wheat grows but oats grow . Further examination shows us several varieties of selection : ( 1 ) many finite verb expressions , such as can , had , went , appear with any actor ; ( 2 ) many , such as run : runs , show the twofold selection just described ; ( 3 ) one , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with the preceding ; ( 4 ) one , finally , am : is : are , shows a threefold selection , with a special form that accompanies the actor I , precisely the actor form as to which ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) dis-agree :  | ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) A I can I run I was I am B the boy can the boy runs the boy was the boy is C the boys can the boys run the boys were the boys are A=B=C A=C A=B Thus we find among nominative expressions and among finite verb expressions a threefold subdivision , due to taxemes of selection ; among nominative expressions sub-class A contains only the form I ; sub-class B contains those which are joined with finite verb expressions such as runs , was , is , and sub-class C contains those which are joined with finite verb expressions such as run , were , are . In fact , we can base our definition of the three subclasses on the selection of the three finite verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we define the sub-classes of finite verb expressions by telling with which nominative expressions ( say , I : the boy : the boys ) they occur . The narrower type of selection in cases like this one is in principle no different from the more inclusive type by which our language distinguishes great form-classes like nominative expres- ' sions.and finite verb expressions , but there are some differences of detail . The narrower type of selection , by which great formclasses are subdivided into selective types , is called agreement . In a rough way , without real boundaries , we can distinguish three general types of agreement . 12. 7 . In our example , the agreement is of the simplest kind , which is usually called concord or congruence : if the actor is a form of sub-class A , the action must be a form of sub-class A , and so on . Sometimes one of the subdivisions is otherwise also recognized in the structure of the language ; thus , in our example , classes B and C of nominative expressions are otherwise also definable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifiers this , that with class B , but these , those with class C : we say this boy , this wheat , but these boys , these oats . Accordingly , we view the subdivision of nominative expressions into singulars and plurals as more fundamental than that of finite verb expressions , and say that the latter agree with or stand in congruence with the former . For the same reason , we say that the forms this , that , these , those stand in congruence with the accompanying substantive form . Congruence plays a great part in many languages ; witness for example  | the inflection of the adjectives in most Indo-European languages in congruence with various sub-classes ( number , gender , case ) of the noun : German der Knabe der ' kna:be the boy , ' ich sche den Knaben ix ' ze:e den ' kna:ben I see the boy , ' die Knaben di : ' kna:ben the boys , ' where the selection of der , den , die agrees with the sub-classes of the noun ( singular and plural , nominative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , ' the form das , as opposed to der , is selected in agreement with the so-called gender-classes into which German nouns are divided . These genders are arbitrary classes , each of which demands different congruence-forms in certain kinds of accompanying words . German has three gender-classes ; for each of these I give phrases showing the congruence of the definite article and of the adjective kalt cold ' : " masculine gender " : der Hut der ' hu:t the hat , ' kalter Wein 1kalter ' vajn cold wine ' " feminine gender " : die Uhr di : ' u:r the clock ' kalte Milch 1kalte ' milx cold milk ' " neuter gender " : das Haus das ' haws the house , ' kaltes Wasser 1kaltes ' vaser cold water . ' French has two genders , " masculine , " le couteau la kuto the knife , ' and " feminine , " la fourchette la furset the fork . ' Some languages of the Bantu family distinguish as many as twenty gender-classes of nouns. 12. 8 . In other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntactic position of the form . For instance , we say I know but watch me , beside me . The choice between the forms I ( he , she , they , we ) and me ( him , her , them , us ) depends upon the position of the form : the I-class appears in the position of actor , the me-class in the position of goal in the action-goal construction ( watch me ) and in the position of axis in the relation-axis construction ( beside me ) . This type of selection is called government ; the accompanying form ( know , watch , beside ) is said to govern ( or to demand or to take ) the selected form ( I or me ) . Government , like congruence , plays a great part in many languages , including many of the Indo-European family . Thus , in Latin , different verbs govern different case-forms in the substantive goal : videt bovem he sees the ox , ' nocet bovi he harms the ox , ' utitur bove he uses the ox , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different main clauses may govern different forms of subordinate verbs ,  | as in French je pense qu'il vient za pans k i vjen ' I think he is coining , ' but je ne pense pas qu-il vienne za n pans pa k i vjen ' I do n't I hink he is coming . ' Identity and non-identity of objects are in many languages ( iistinguished by selective features akin to government . In English we say he washed him when actor and goal are not identical , but he washed himself ( a reflexive form ) when they are the same person . Swedish thus distinguishes between identical and non-identical actor and possessor : han tog sin hatt han ' to:g si:n ' hat ' he took his ( own ) hat ' and han tog hans hatt hans ' hat his ( someone else 's ) hat . ' The Algonquian languages use different forms for nonidentical animate third persons in a context . In Cree , if we speak of a man and then , secondarily , of another man , we mention the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the so-called obviative form , as ' na:pe:wa . Thus , the language distinguishes between the following cases , where we designate the principal person as A and the other ( the obviative ) as B : ' utinam u'tastutin ' he ( A ) took his ( A 's ) hat ' ' utinam utastu'tinijiw ' he ( A ) took his ( B 's ) hat ' utina'mijiwa u'tastutin ' he ( B ) took his ( A 's ) hat ' utina'mijiwa utastu'tinijiw ' he ( B ) took his ( B 's ) hat . ' 12. 9 . In the third type of agreement , cross-reference , the subclasses contain an actual mention of the forms with which they are joined . This mention is in the shape of a substitute-form , resembling our pronouns . In non-standard English this occurs in such forms as John his knife or John he ran away ; here the form his knife actually mentions a male possessor , who is more explicitly mentioned in the accompanying semi-absolute form John ; similarly , the he in he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mary she ran away . In French , cross-reference occurs in the standard language especially in certain types of questions , such as Jean oft est-il ? Pan u et i ? ' John where is he ? ' that is , ' Where is John ? ' ( ? 12.3 ) . A Latin finite verb , such as cantat ' he ( she , it ) sings , ' includes substitutive mention of an actor . It is joined in cross-reference with a substantive expression that makes specific mention of the actor , as in puella cantat ' ( the ) girl she-sings . ' In many languages verb-forms include substitutive ( pronominal ) mention of both an actor and an undergoer , as , in Cree ' wa:pame:w ' he saw him or her ' ; accordingly , more specific   mention of both actor and undergoer is in cross-reference ' wa : - pame:w ' atimwa a'wa na:pe:w he-saw-him ( obviative ) a-dog ( obviative ) that man ' ; that is , the man saw a dog . ' Similarly , in many languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , in Cree , ' astutin hat , ' but ni'tastutin my hat , ' ki'tastutin thy hat , ' u'tastutin his , her , its hat ' ; hence , when the possessor is mentioned in another word or phrase , we have cross-reference , as in ' ca:n u'tastutin John his-hat , ' i.e. John 's hat . ' 12. 10 . Every syntactic construction shows us two ( or sometimes more ) free forms combined in a phrase , which we may call the resultant phrase . The resultant phrase may belong to a formclass other than that of any constituent . For instance , John ran is neither a nominative expression ( like John ) nor a finite verb expression ( like ran ) . Therefore we say that the English actoraction construction is exocentric : the resultant phrase belongs to the form-class of no immediate constituent . On the other hand , the resultant phrase may belong to the same form-class as one ( or more ) of the constituents . For instance , poor John is a proper-noun expression , and so is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the whole , the same functions . Accordingly , we say that the English character-substance construction ( as in poor John , fresh milk , and the like ) is an endocentric construction . The exocentric constructions in any language are few . In English we have , beside the actor-action construction , also that of relation-axis , as beside John , with me , in the house , by running away ; the constituents are a prepositional expression and an accusative expression , but the resultant phrase has a function different from either of these , appearing in entirely different syntactic positions ( e.g. as a modifier of verbs : sit beside John , or of nouns : the boy beside John ) . Another exocentric construction of English is that of subordination . The constituents in one type ( clausesubordination ) are a subordinating expression and an actor-action phrase , as in if John ran away ; the resultant phrase has the function of neither constituent , but serves as a modifier ( subordinate clause ) . In the other type ( phrase-subordination ) the constituents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantive : as I , than John , and the resultant phrase has the function of a modifier ( as big as I , bigger than John ) . Although the resultant phrase in an exocentric construction has a function different from   the function of any constituent , yet one of these constituents is usually peculiar to the construction and serves to characterize the resultant phrase ; thus , in English , finite verbs , prepositions , and subordinating conjunctions regularly appear in the exocentric constructions just illustrated , and suffice to characterize them . Endocentric constructions are of two kinds , co-ordinative ( or aerial ) and subordinative ( or attributive ) . In the former type the resultant phrase belongs to the same form-class as two or more of the constituents . Thus , the phrase boys and girls belongs to the same form-class as the constituents , boys , girls ; these constituents are the members of the co-ordination , and the other constituent is the co-ordinator . Sometimes there is no co-ordinator : books , papers , pens , pencils , blotters ( were all lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each member , as in both Bill and John , either Bill or John . There may be minor differences of form-class between the resultant phrase and the members ; thus Bill and John is plural , while the members are each singular . In subordinative endocentric constructions , the resultant phrase belongs to the same form-class as one of the constituents , which we call the head : thus , poor John belongs to the same form-class as John , which we accordingly call the head ; the other member , in our example poor , is the attribute . The attribute may in turn be a subordinative phrase : in very fresh milk the immediate constituents are the head milk , and the attribute very fresh , and this phrase , in turn , consists of the head fresh and the attribute very . In this way there can be several ranks of subordinative position ; in very fresh milk there are three : ( 1 ) milk , ( 2 ) fresh , ( 3 ) very . In the same way , the head also may show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the attribute this and the head fresh milk , and this , in turn , of the attribute fresh and the head milk . 12. 11 . If all the syntactic constructions which go to make up a phrase are endocentric , then the phrase will contain among its ultimate constituents some word ( or several words , members of a co-ordination ) whose form-class is the same as that of the phrase . This word is the center of the phrase . In the phrase all this fresh milk , the word milk is the center , and in the phrase all this fresh bread and sweet butter , the words bread and butter are the centers . Since most of the constructions in any language are endocentric , most phrases have a center : the form-class of a phrase is usually the same as that of some word that is contained in the phrase .   The exceptions are phrases of exocentric construction , and these , too , we have seen , are definable in terms of word-classes . The syntactic form-classes of phrases , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form-classes of syntax are most easily described in terms of word-classes . Thus , in English , a substantive expression is either a word ( such as John ) which belongs to this form-class ( a substantive ) , or else a phrase ( such as poor John ) whose center is a substantive ; and an English finite verb expression is either a word ( such as ran ) which belongs to this form-class ( a finite verb ) , or else a phrase ( such as ran away ) whose center is a finite verb . An English actor-action phrase ( such as John ran or poor John ran away ) does not share the form-class of any word , since its construction is exocentric , but the form-class of actor-action phrases is defined by their construction : they consist , of a nominative expression and a finite verb expression ( arranged in a certain way ) , and this , in the end , again reduces the matter to terms of word-classes . The term parts of speech is traditionally applied to the most inclusive and fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the principle just stated , the syntactic formclasses are described in terms of the parts of speech that appear in them . However , it is impossible to set up a fully consistent scheme of parts of speech , because the word-classes overlap and cross each other . In speaking of form-classes we use the term expression to include both words and phrases : thus John is a substantive , poor John a substantive phrase , and both forms are substantive expressions . Within the great form-classes which contain both words and ( thanks to endocentric constructions ) a vast number of phrasal combinations , there may be sub-classes due to small differences of phrasal construction . For instance , when an attribute like fresh , good , or sweet is joined to the head milk , as in fresh milk , this resultant phrase is still capable of joining with other attributes , as in good , sweet , fresh milk : the phrase has entirely the same functions as its center ( and head ) , namely the word milk . If , however , we join a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resultant phrase , this milk or this fresh milk has not quite the same function as the head or center , since the resultant phrase can not be joined with attributes like good , sweet : the construction in this milk , this fresh milk is partially closed . The possibilities in this   direction , in fact , are limited to adding the attribute all , as in all this milk or all this fresh milk . When the attribute all has been added , the construction is closed : no more attributes of this type ( adjectives ) can be added . 12. 12 . An example of a taxeme of order is the arrang anent by which the actor form precedes the action form in the normal type of the English actor-action construction : John ran . In languages which use highly complex taxemes of selection , order is largely non-distinctive and connotative ; in a Latin phrase such as pater amat filium the father loves the son , ' the syntactic relations are all selective ( cross-reference and government ) and the words appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ilium pater amat , and so on ) , with differences only of emphasis and liveliness . In English , taxemes of order appear in the difference between actor-action and action-goal , as in John ran and catch John ; the difference between John hit Bill and Bill hit John rests entirely upon order . In general , however , taxemes of order in English occur along with taxemes of selection . Languages which in this respect and in the general configuration of their syntax resemble English , may still show great differences as to taxemes of order . Thus , standard German differs from English in allowing only one attribute ( word or phrase ) of the verb to precede a finite verb : heute spielen wir Ball ' hojte ' spi:1en vi:r ' ball today play we ball . ' Further , it places several elements last in the sentence : certain adverbs , as ich stehe urn sieben Uhr auf ix ' ste:e um ' zi:ben ' u:r ' awf I get at seven o'clock up ' ; participles , as ich habe ihn heute gesehen ix 1ha:be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; infinitives , as ich werde ihn heute sehen ix 1verde i:n ' hojte ' ze:n I shall him today see ' ; the verb of a dependent clause : wenn ich ihn heute sehe ven ix i:n ' hojte ' ze:e if I him today see . ' French has a complicated and rigid system of ordering certain substitute ( " conjunct " ) accompaniments of its verbs . In the ordinary ( non-interrogative ) sentence-type , it distinguishes seven positions of these elements , which precede the finite verb : ( 1 ) actors , such as je za I , ' it il he , it , ' ils il they , ' on o ? one , ' ce se it , that ' ( 2 ) the negative adverb ne no not ' ( 3 ) farther goals of first and second persons , such as me me to me , ' vous vu to you , ' and of the reflexive se se to himself , herself , themselves '   ( 4 ) nearer goals , such as me ma me , ' vous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , ' le la him , it , ' les le them ' ( 5 ) farther goals of the third person : lui lqi to him , to her , ' leer lce:r to them ' ( 6 ) the adverb y i there , thither , to it , to them ' ( 7 ) the adverb en an from there , of it , of them . ' For example : ( 1-2-3-4 ) it ne me is donne pas i n ma 1 dan pa he does not give it to me ' ( 1-3-6-7 ) it m'y en donne i m j an don he gives me some of it there ' ( 1-4-5 ) on is lui donne on la lqi don one gives it to him ' ( 1-2-6-7 ) it n'y en a pas i n j ann a pa there are n't any , ' literally it has not of them there . ' Occasionally order serves finer distinctions . In French most adjectives follow their nouns : une maison blanche yn mezon blanti a white house ' ; a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty house ' ; others precede only with transferred meanings or with emphatic or intense connotations : une barbe noire yn barba nwa:r a black beard ' : une noire trahison yn nwa:r traizon a black betrayal ' ; un livre excellent cell li:vr ekselan an excellent book ' : un excellent livre a . splendid book ! ' A few show greater differences of meaning : un livre cher cell li:vra se:r a costly book ' : un cher ami cell se:r ami a dear friend , ' sa propre main sa propra men his own hand ' : une main propre yn men propr a clean hand . ' Viewed from the standpoint of economy , taxemes of order are a gain , since the forms are bound to be spoken in some succession ; nevertheless , few languages allow features of order to work alone : almost always they merely supplement taxemes of selection . 12. 13 . The languages of the Indo-European family are peculiar in having many parts of speech ; no matter upon what constructions we base our scheme , a language like English will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as substantive , verb , adjective , adverb , preposition , co-ordinating conjunction , and subordinating conjunction , in addition to interjections . Most languages show a smaller number . A distribution into three types is quite frequent ( Semitic , Algonquian ) ; usually one resembles our substantives and one our verbs . It is a mistake to suppose that our part-ofspeech system represents universal features of human expression . If such classes as objects , actions , and qualities exist apart from  | our language , as realities either of physics or of human psychology , then , of course , they exist all over the world , but it would still be true that many languages lack corresponding parts of speech . In languages with few parts of speech , the syntactic form-classes appear rather in phrases . Often the class of a phrase is indicated by some special word , a marker ; strictly speaking , the marker and the form which it accompanies are joined in an exocentric construction which determines the class of the phrase . Aside from this selective feature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical instance is Chinese . The parts of speech are full words and particles ( that is , markers ) . The principal constructions are three . ( 1 ) The favorite sentence-construction is one of subject and predicate , much like the English actor-action construction ; the subject precedes the predicate : that ' xaw3 he is good , ' that ' laj 9 he came . ' In certain cases , depending on differences of formclass , the predicate is marked by the particle a4 at its beginning : that sa4 ' xaw3 ian2 he ( p. ) good man , ' that is , he is a good man . ' ( 2 ) There is an endocentric construction in which the attribute precedes the head ; in meaning this resembles the similar English constructions : ' xaw3 i an2 good man , ' ' man4 ibhy4 slowly go , ' that is , go slowly . ' The attribute is in certain cases marked by the particle tit at its end : ' tig3 , xaw3 tie ' ant very good man ' ; 1wo3 tie ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , my father ' ; ' tso4 cot tit izan2 sit ( p. ) person , ' that is , a sitting person ' ; ' wo3 ' cje3 Itsa4 ti ' pia I write ( p. ) brush , ' that is , the brush I write with ' ? in this example the attribute is a phrase of subject-predicate construction ; ' maj3 ti ' sut buy ( p. ) book , ' that is , the purchased book . ' ( 3 ) A second endocentric construction , in which the attribute follows the head , resembles rather the English action-goal and relation-axis constructions : ikwant ' mane shut the door , ' itsaj4 ' cunt kwo in China . ' We may call this , somewhat inexactly , the action-goal construction , to distinguish it from ( 2 ) . Taxemes of selection consist largely in the marking off of a form-class which serves as subject in ( 1 ) , as head in ( 2 ) , and as goal in ( 3 ) , resembling the English substantive expression . To this form-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few  | words may be said to belong in their own right ; these are substitutewords of the type that he , she ' or wo3 I. ' The other object , expressions are phrases with various markers . The commonest , of these markers are certain particles which precede as attributes of type ( 2 ) , such as ca4 this , ' na4 that , ' na3 which ? ' Thus , ' Ca4 ko4 this piece , ' that is , this ( thing ) . ' In most instances these markers do not immediately join with a full word ; but only with certain ones , like the ko4 piece ' in the last example , which hereby constitute a form-class of numeratives ; the phrase of marker plus numerative joins the ordinary full word in construction ( 2 ) , as : ca ko ' zan2 this ( individual ) man ' ; 1wu3 IljaI4 ' cha ' five ( individual ) cart , ' that is , five carts . ' Another kind of object , expression is characterized by the particle till at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. ) , ' that is bookseller . ' In this way complex phrases are built up : that ' taw4 ' thjen2 1i3 ' chy4 he enter field interior go , ' that is , he goes into the field ' ; here the first word is the subject , the rest of the phrase the predicate ; in this predicate the last word is the head and the other three are an attribute ; this attribute consists of the action taw4 enter ' and the goal ' thjen2 li3 field interior , ' in which the first word is an attribute of the second . In the sentence ni3 ' mej2 pa3 ' maj3 ' mej2 ti ichjen3'kej3 wo3 you not take buy coal ( p. ) money give I , ' the first word is the subject , the rest the predicate ; this predicate consists of an attribute , mej2 not ' and a head ; within this head , the first five words are again an attribute and the last two ' kej3 wo3 give I ' a head , whose construction is action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ti ichjen3 take buy coal ( p. ) money , ' the first word is an action and the rest a goal ; this goal consists of the head chjen3 money ' and the attribute 1maj3 ' mej2 ti which is marked as such by the particle till appended . to the phrase imaj3 ' mej2 buy coal , ' whose construction is actiongoal . Thus the sentence means you not taking buy-coal-money give me , ' that is you have n't given me money to buy coal . ' In Tagalog , the parts of speech are , again , full word and particle , but here the full words are subdivided into two classes which we may call static and transient . The latter resemble our verbs in forming a special kind of predicate ( the narrative type , with four sub-types , ? 11.2 ) and in showing morphologic distinctions of tense and mode , but they differ from our verbs because , on the one hand , they are not restricted to the function of predicate and , on  | the other hand , there exist non-narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked optionally by order ( predicate precedes subject ) or by the particle aj and order ( subject precedes predicate marked by , initial aj ) , as illustrated in ? 11.2 . The subject and the equational predicate are selectively marked : the class of forms which fill these positions resembles the English substantive expression and , even more , the Chinese object expression . A few substitute-words , such as a'ku ' I ' and si'ja she , ' belong to this class by their own right ; all other object expressions are phrases , characterized by the presence of certain attributes , as isa iJ ' ba:ta ? ' one child , ' or by certain particles , chiefly si before names , as si ' hwan ' John , ' and ark before other forms , as ark ' ba:ta ? ' the child , a child , ' ark pu'la ' the red , ' that is , ' the redness , ' au ' pu:tul ' the cut , ' or , to illustrate transient forms , au pu'mu:tul ' the one who cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ark ipi'nu:tul ' that which was cut with , ' ark pinu'tu:lan ' that which was cut from . ' There are four attributive constructions . In one , a particle na , after vowels I ) , intervenes between head and attribute , in either order , as al ) ' ba:ta rJ sumu : ' su:lat or ark sumu : ' su:lat na ' ba:ta ? ' the writing child ' ; an pu'la rJ pan'ju ' the red handkerchief , ' al ) pan'ju i , i'tu ' this handkerchief . ' Another , more restricted attributive construction lacks the particle , as hin'di : a'ku ' not I , ' hin'di : maba'it ' not good . ' In the third attributive construction the attribute is an object expression in a special form : thus , a'ku ' I ' is replaced by ku , and si'ja ' he , she ' by ni'ja , and the particle si by ni , the particle an by nai ) : ark pu'la naq pan'ju aj matir ) ' had ' the red of the handkerchief is bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ka:nin ' the child ate ( some ) rice , ' ( actor-action ) ; ki'na:in nark ' ba:ta ? aiJ ' ka:nin ' the rice was eaten by the child ' ( goal-action ) ; see also the examples in ? 11.2 . In the fourth attributive construction , too , the attribute is an object expression : si is replaced by kaj and au by sal ; the attribute tells of a place : at ) ' ba:ta j na'na:ug sa ' ba:haj ' the child came out of the house , out of a house . ' 12. 14 . The details of syntax are often complicated and hard to describe . On this point , any fairly complete grammar of a language like English , German , Latin , or French , will prove more enlightening than would an abstract discussion . Syntax is obscured , however , in most treatises , by the use of philosophical instead of formal definitions of constructions and form-classes . As a single  | illustration of the more complex syntactic habits , we shall survey the main features of one construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we may call charactersubstance , as in fresh milk . This construction is attributive , and the head is always a nounexpression ? that is , a noun or an endocentric phrase with a noun as center . The noun is a word-class ; like all form-classes , it is to be defined in terms of grammatical features , some of which , in fact , appear in what follows . When it has been defined , it shows a classmeaning which can be roughly stated as object of such and such a species ' ; examples are boy , stone , water , kindness . The attribute in our construction is always an adjective expression ? that is , an adjective or an endocentric phrase with an adjective as center . The adjective is in English a word-class ( part of speech ) , definable precisely by its function in the character-substance construction which we are now to discuss ; its class-meaning will emerge from our discussion as something like character of specimens of a species of objects ' ; examples are big , red , this , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains a feature of order : the adjective expression precedes the noun expression : poor John , fresh milk . The adjectives are divided into two classes , descriptive and limiting , by the circumstance that when adjectives of both these classes occur in a phrase , the limiting adjective precedes and modifies the group of descriptive adjective plus noun . Thus , in a form like this fresh milk , the immediate constituents are the limiting adjective this , and the noun phrase fresh milk , which consists , in turn , of the descriptive adjective fresh and the noun milk . This difference subdivides our character-substance construction into two sub-types , the quality-substance construction , where the at- - tribute is a descriptive adjective expression , and the limitationsubstance construction , where the attribute is a limiting adjective . The quality-substance construction and the form-class of descriptive adjectives are both divided into several types by features of order . For instance , we say big black sheep and never *black big sheep , kind old man and never *old kind man , and so on . We shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formclass of descriptive adjectives is roughly qualitative character of specimens . ' The form-class of limiting adjectives is much smaller than that  | of descriptive adjectives , and constitutes , in fact , what we shall later define as an irregular form-class ? that is , a form-class which has to be described in the shape of a list of the forms ; however , the boundary between limiting and descriptive adjectives is not completely definable . The class-meaning of limiting adjectives will appear from the following discussion as something like variable character of specimens . ' Our limiting adjectives fall into two sub-classes of determiners and numeratives . These two classes have several subdivisions and are crossed , moreover , by several other lines of classification . The determiners are defined by the fact that certain types of noun expressions ( such as house or big house ) are always accompanied by a determiner ( as , this house , a big house ) . The classmeaning is , roughly , identificational character of specimens . ' This habit of using certain noun expressions always with a determiner , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Romance . Many languages have not this habit ; in Latin , for instance , domus house ' requires no attribute and is used indifferently where we say the house or a house . A number of features subdivides the determiners into two classes , definite and indefinite . Of these features , we shall mention only one : a definite determiner can be preceded by the numerative all ( as in all the water ) but an indefinite determiner ( as , some in some water ) can not . The definite determiners are : any possessive adjective ( John 's book , my house ) and the words this ( these ) , that ( those ) , the . The class of possessive adjectives is definable in terms of morphology . It is worth observing that Italian , which has a character-substance construction much like ours , does not use possessive adjectives as determiners : it mio amico il mio a'miko the my friend ' ( that is , my friend ' ) contrasts with un un mio amico a my friend ' ( that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite determiners is identified specimens . ' A precise statement of how the specimens are identified , is a practical matter outside the linguist 's control ; the identification consists in possession by some person ( John 's book ) , spatial relation to the speaker ( this house ) , description by some accompanying linguistic form ( the house I saw ) , or purely situational features ( the sky , the chairman ) , among which earlier mention by speech is to be reckoned ( " I saw a man , but the man did not see me " ) . Among the definite determiners , this : these  | and that : those are peculiar in showing congruence with the number-class of the noun ( this house : these houses ) . The indefinite determiners are a ( an ) , any , each , either , every , neither , no , one , some , what , whatever , which , whichever , and the phrasal combinations many a , such a , what a . The class-meaning is unidentified specimens . ' The word a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word one occurs not only as an indefinite determiner ( one man ) , but also in some entirely different functions ( as in a big one , if one only knew ) ; this phenomenon may be designated as classcleavage . The meanings of the various indefinite determiners are in part linguistically definable in terms of grammatical features of wider bearing than our present subject . For instance , what and which are interrogative , introducing supplement-questions , which prompt the hearer to supply a speech-form ( what man ? which man ? ) Whatever and whichever are relative , marking their noun as part of a subordinate clause ( whatever book you take , . . . ) . No and neither are negative , ruling out all specimens . Each , which , and whichever imply a limited field of selection : that is , the specimens concerned belong to an identified part ( or to the identified whole ) of the species ( which book ? which parent ? ) ; either and neither go farther in limiting the field to two specimens . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the case where they are emphatic elements ) : my , our , your , his , her , its , their , the , a ; others are sometimes atonic or spoken with secondary stress . The types of noun expressions which always have a determiner , are preceded , when no more specific determiner is present , by the articles , definite the and indefinite a , whose meaning is merely the class-meaning of their respective form-classes . A **25;999;TOOLONG , such as definite and indefinite , which always accompanies some grammatical feature ( here the types of noun expression which demand a determiner ) , is said to be categoric . The definite and indefinite categories may be said , in fact , to embrace the entire class of English noun expressions , because even those types of noun expression which do not always take a determiner , can be classed as definite or indefinite : John , for instance , as definite , kindness as indefinite . According to the use and non-use of determiners , English noun expressions fall into a number of interesting sub-classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the singular number , take no determiner , and are always definite : John , Chicago . The class meaning is species of object containing only one specimen . ' Here and in what follows , space forbids our entering into details , such as the class-cleavage by which a name occurs also as a common noun , in cases like homonymy ( two Johns , this John ) ; nor can we take up sub-classes , such as that of river-names , which are always preceded by the ( the Mississippi ) . II . Common nouns occur in both categories , definite and indefinite . The class-meaning is species of object occurring in more than one specimen . ' In the plural number they require a determiner for the definite category ( the houses ) , but not for the indefinite ( houses , corresponding to the singular form a house ) . A. Bounded nouns in the singular number require a determiner ( the house , a house ) . The class meaning is species of object occurring in more than one specimen , such that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unbounded nouns require a determiner for the definite category only ( the milk : milk ) . The class-meaning is species of object occurring in more than one specimen , such that the specimens can be subdivided or merged . ' 1 . Mass nouns never take a and have no plural ( the milk : milk ) . The class-meaning is that of B with the added proviso that the specimens exist independently . ' 2 . Abstract nouns in the indefinite singular without a determiner include all the specimens ( life is short ) ; with a determiner and in the plural , the specimens are separate ( a useful life ; nine lives ) . The class-meaning is that of B with the proviso that the specimens exist only as the demeanor ( quality , action , relation ) of other objects . ' Among the subdivisions of II , class-cleavage is frequent and interesting , as , an egg , eggs ( A ) , but " he got egg on his necktie " ( B1 ) ; coffee ( B1 ) , but an expensive coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , numeratives , fall into various sub-classes , of which we shall merely mention a few . Two of them , all and both precede a determiner ( all the apples ) ; the rest follow ( the other apples ) . Two , however , precede a in phrases which are determiners : many a , such a . The numeratives few ,  | hundred , thousand , and those formed with the suffix - ion ( million and so on ) , are preceded by a in phrases which serve as numeratives with plural nouns ( a hundred years ) . The numeratives same , very , one ? this last differs by class-cleavage from the determiner one ? are used only with definite nouns ( this same book , the very day , my one hope ) ; the numeratives much , more , less are used only with indefinite nouns ( much water ) ; the numerative all is used with both kinds of nouns but only with definite determiners ( all the milk ; all milk ) . Some , such as both , few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with plural nouns ; others , such as one , much , little , only with singular nouns . Some numeratives are used also in other syntactic positions , as , many and few as predicate adjectives ( they were many ) , and all , both as semi-predicative attributes ( the boys were both there ) . Some other interesting lines of classification among the English numeratives will appear when we take up the substitutive replacement of noun expressions in Chapter 15.  | MORPHOLOGY 13. 1 . By the morphology of a language we mean the constructions in which bound forms appear among the constituents . By definition , the resultant forms are either bound forms or words , hut never phrases . Accordingly , we may say that morphology Includes the constructions of words and parts of words , while nta includes the onstructions of phrases . As a border region we have phrase-words ( jack-in-the-pulpit ) and some compound words ( blackbird ) , which contain no bound forms among their immediate constituents , and yet in some ways exhibit morphologic rather than syntactic types of construction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of syntax . The features of modification and modulation are more numerous and often irregular ? that is , confined to particular constituents or combinations . The order of the conhtituents is almost always rigidly fixed , permitting of no such connotative variants as John ran away : Away ran John . Features of selection minutely and often whimsically limit the constituents that may be united into a complex form . Accordingly , languages differ more in morphology than in syntax . The variety is so great that no simple scheme will classify languages as to their morphology . One such scheme distinguishes analytic languages , which use few bound forms , from synthetic , which use many . At one extreme is a completely analytic language , like modern Chinese , where each word is a one-syllable morpheme or a compound word or phrase-word ; at the other , a highly synthetic language like Eskimo , which unites long strings of bound forms into single words , such as a:wlisa-ut-iss ? ar-siniarpu-ria I am looking for something suitable for a fish-line . ' This distinction , however , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one language may be in some respects more analytic , but in other respects more synthetic , than some other language . Another scheme of this sort divided languages into four morphologic types , isolating , agglutinative , polysynthetic , and in-  | fleeting . Isolating languages were those which , like Chinese , used no bound forms ; in agglutinative languages the bound forms were supposed merely to follow one another , Turkish being the stock example ; polysynthetic languages expressed semantically important elements , such as verbal goals , by means of bound forms , as does Eskimo ; inflectional languages showed a merging of semantically distinct features either in a single bound form or in closely united bound forms , as when the suffix -o in a Latin form like amo I love ' expresses the meanings speaker as actor , ' only one actor , ' action in present time , ' real ( not merely possible or hypothetical ) action . ' These distinctions are not co-ordinate , and the last three classes were never clearly defined . 13. 2 . Since the speaker can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually unable to describe the structure of words . The statement of morphology requires systematic study . The ancient Greeks made some progress in this direction , but , in the main , our technique was developed by the Hindu grammarians . No matter how refined our method , the elusive nature of meanings will always cause difficulty , especially when doubtful relations of meaning are accompanied by formal irregularities . In the series goose , gosling , gooseberry , gander , we shall probably agree that the first two forms are morphologically related , in the sense that gaz- in gosling is a phonetic modification of goose , but the guwz- in gooseberry does not fit the meaning , and , on the other hand , the formal resemblance g- of goose and gander is so slight that one may question whether it really puts the practical relation of meaning into linguistic form . This last difficulty appears also in the pair duck : drake , with their common d ... k . One soon learns that one can not look to the speakers for an answer , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such questions , they give inconsistent or silly answers . If the history of a language is known , one often finds that the ambiguity was absent in some older state of the language ? it appears , for instance , that some centuries ago gooseberry ' was *grose-berry and had nothing to do with a goose ? but facts of this sort evidently do not tell us how things work in the present state of the language . In describing the modulations and modifications which occur in syntax , we naturally take the absolute form of a word or phrase as our starting-point , but a bound form which occurs in several  | shapes will lead to several entirely different forms of description , , according to our choice of a basic alternant . For instance , the plural-suffix of English nouns appears ordinarily in three shapes : ( - ez glasses , -z cards , -s books ; by taking each of these three , in turn , as one 's starting-point , one can arrive at three entirely different statements of the facts . Very often there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phonetic modification , appears to express a meaning which is usually expressed by a linguistic form , as in v-uin : men , where modification of the vowel takes the place of the plural-suffix . In other cases there is not even a grammatical feature : a single phonetic form , in the manner of homonymy , represents two meanings which are usually distinguished by means of a linguistic form , as , singular and plural noun in the sheep ( grazes ) : the sheep ( graze ) . Here the Hindus hit upon the apparently artificial but in practice eminently serviceable device of speaking f a zero element : in sheep : sheep the plural-suffix is replaced by icro ? that is , by nothing at all . 13. 3 . What with these and other difficulties , any inconsistency of procedure is likely to create confusion in a descriptive statement of morphology . One must observe , above all , the principle of immediate constituents ( ? 10.2 ) . This principle leads us , at the outset , to distinguish certain classes of words , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free forms : 1 . Compound words , containing more than one free form : door-knob , wild-animal-tamer . The included free forms are the members of the compound word : in our examples , the members are the words door , knob , tamer , and the phrase wild animal . 2 . Derived secondary words , containing one free form : boyish , old-maidish . The included free form is called the underlying form ; in our examples the underlying forms are the word boy and the phrase old maid . B. Primary words , not containing a free form : 1 . Derived primary words , containing more than one bound form : re-ceive , de-ceive , con-ceive , re-tain , de-tain , contain . 2 . Morpheme-words , consisting of a single ( free ) morpheme : man , boy , cut , run , red , big .  | The principle of immediate constituents will lead us , for example , to class a form like gentlemanly not as a compound word , but as a derived secondary word , since the immediate constituents are tli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word gentlemanly is a secondary derivative ( a so-called de-compound ) whose underlying form happens to be a compound word . Similarly , door-knobs is not a compound word , but a de-compound , consisting of the bound form -z and the underlying word door-knob . The principle of immediate constituents leads us to observe the structural order of the constituents , which may differ from their actual sequence ; thus , ungentlemanly consists of un- and gentl ' - manly , with the bound form added at the beginning , but gentlemanly consists of gentleman and - ly with the bound form added at the end . 13. 4 . As examples of relatively simple morphologic arrangements we may take the constructions of secondary derivation that appear in English plural nouns ( glass-es ) and past-tense verbs ( land-ed ) . As to selection , the bound forms are in both cases unique , but the underlying forms belong to two great form-classes : the plural nouns are derived from singular nouns ( as , glasses from glass ) and the past-tense verbs from infinitive verbs ( as , landed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern us later . As to order , the bound form , in both cases , is spoken after the underlying form . By a feature of modulation common to nearly all constructions of English morphology , the underlying form keeps its stress , and the bound form is unstressed . The taxemes of phonetic modification are more elaborate , and will show us some peculiarities that appear in the morphology of many languages . To begin with , the bound form appears in several alternants , different shapes which imply , in this case , features of phonetic modification : glass : glasses - ez pen : pens -z book : books -s . If we collect examples , we soon find that the shape of the bound form is determined by the last phoneme of the accompanying form :  | - ez appears after sibilants and affricates ( glasses , roses , dishes , garages , churches , bridges ) ; -z appears after all other voiced phonemes ( saws , boys , ribs , sleeves , pens , hills , cars ) ; and -s after all other unvoiced phonemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three alternants - ez , -z , -s can be described in terms of phonetic modification , we say that they are phonetic alternants . Since the distribution of the three alternants is regulated according to a linguistically recognizable characteristic of the accompanying forms , we say that the alternation is regular . Finally , since the deciding characteristic of the accompanying forms is phonemic ( namely , the identity of the last phoneme ) , we say that the alternalion is automatic . Regular alternations play a great part in the morphology of most languages . Not all regular alternations are phonetic or automatic . In German , for instance , the singular nouns are divided , by certain syntactic features , into three form-classes which are known as genders ( ? 12.7 ) ; now , German plural nouns are derived from singulars by the addition of bound forms which differ according to the gender of the underlying singular : masculine nouns add -e , with certain vowel-changes : der Hut hu:t ' hat ' : Hiite ' hy:te ' hats ' ; der Sohn zo:n son ' : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree ' : Baum ' bojme ' trees ' neuter nouns add -e without vowel-change : das Jahr ja:r ' year ' : Jahre ' ja:re ' years ' ; das Boot bo:t ' boat ' : Boole ' bo:te ' boats ' ; das Tier ti:r ' animal ' : Tiere ' ti:re ' animals ' feminine nouns add - en : die Uhr u:r ' clock , watch ' : Uhren ' u:ren ' clocks , watches ' ; die Last last ' burden ' : Lasten ' lasten burdens ' ; die Frau fraw ' woman ' : Frauen ' frawen ' women . ' This alternation ( aside from special features which we need not consider ) is regular , but it is not phonetic , since , of the three alternants , -e with vowel change , -e , and - en , the last is not , in the system of the language , phonetically akin to the first two ; and the alternation is not automatic , but grammatical , since it depends not upon phonetic , but upon grammatical ( in this instance , syntactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have not yet described in terms of phonetic modification , the kinship of the three alternants - ez , -z , -s of the bound form that appears in English plural nouns . It is evident that three entirely different statements are possible , according to our choice of one or another of the three forms as our starting-point . Our  | aim is to get , in the long run , the simplest possible set of statements that will describe the facts of the English language . To try out the different possible formulae with this aim in view , often involves great labor . In the present instance our trouble is small , because our alternation has an exact parallel in English syntax : the enclitic word whose absolute form is is ' iz , alternates quite like our plural suffix : Bess 's ready iz , ez John 's ready z Dick 's ready s . Since in this case the absolute form is necessarily serves as the starting-point of description , we reach the simplest formula if we take - ez as the basic alternant also of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English any morpheme of the form iz , ez , unstressed , loses its vowel after all phonemes except sibilants and affricates , and then replaces z by s after unvoiced sounds . This covers also the alternation of the third-person present-tense verb suffix in misses : runs : breaks and of the possessive-adjective suffix in Bess 's , John 's , Dick 's . Moreover , it leads us to use a parallel formula in the case of the past-tense suffix of verbs . This suffix appears in three similar alternants : dance : danced -t , and we need not hesitate , now , to take - ed as the basic form for our description and to say that this form loses its vowel after all phonemes except dental stops , and then replaces d by t after all unvoiced sounds . 13. 6 . A survey of English plural nouns will soon show that the statement we have made holds good for an indefinitely large number of forms , but not for a certain limited number of exceptions . In some instances the constituent form in the plural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of English pronunciation which distinguish between el and i in unstressed position , use i in both the bound form ( glasses ) and the word ( Bess 's ) .  | We can describe the peculiarity of these plurals by saying that the final f , 0 , s of the underlying singular is replaced by v , ti , z before the bound form is added . The word " before " in this statement means that the alternant of the bound form is the one appropriate to the substituted sound ; thus , the plural of knife adds not -s , but -z : " first " the -f is replaced by -v , and " then " the appropriate alternant -z is added . The terms " before , after , first , then , " and so on , in such statements , tell the descriptive order . The actual sequence of constituents , and their structural order ( ? 13.3 ) are a part of the language , but the descriptive order of grammatical features is a fiction and results simply from our tuethod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , that the speaker who says knives , does not " first " replace f by Iv and " then " add -z , but merely utters a form ( knives ) which in certain features resembles and in certain features differs from u certain other form ( namely , knife ) . If the English plural nouns which exhibit this voicing of a final spirant in the underlying form , showed any common phonetic or grammatical feature that distinguished them from other nouns , we could describe this peculiarity as a regular alternant . This , however , seems not to be the case ; we have also plurals like cliffs , maths , creases , where f , 0 , s of the underlying form appears unchanged . We can make our general statement cover one group , but will then have to furnish a list of the cases that do not fall under the general statement . A set of forms that is not covered by a general statement , but has to be presented in the shape of a list , is said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our description so that as many forms as possible will be included in general statements . The choice is often decided for us by the circumstance that one group of forms is of indefinite extent and therefore amenable to a general statement , but not to a list . In the case of English nouns in -s , we obviously face this condition , for house : houses is the only instance where -s is replaced by z in the plural , while an indefinite number of plural nouns retains the -s of the underlying form ( glasses , creases , curses , dances , and so on ) . Our list , in this case , includes only one form , houses , unique irregularity . The list of plurals which substitute 6 for the -8 of the underlying form is not large , embracing only the forms baths , paths , cloths , mouths ( and for some speakers also laths , oaths , truths , youths ) ; on the other side we find a number  | of current forms , such as months , widths , drouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive , the habit of keeping -A in the forma .. tion of plurals that are not traditional and may be formed by a speaker who has not heard them : the McGraths , napropaths , monoliths . In the case of -f the list is larger : knives , wives , lives , calves , halves , thieves , leaves , sheaves , beeves , loaves , elves , shelves ( and for some speakers also hooves , rooves , scarves , dwarves , wharves ) ; wo decide to call these irregular on the strength not only of counterinstances , such as cliffs , toughs , reefs , oafs , but also of less common or occasional forms , such as ( some good ) laughs , ( general ) staffs , monographs . Where the two treatments occur side by side , as in laths Iasi or le ' 6z , roofs or rooves , there is usually some slight difference of connotation between the variants . The noun beef , as a mass-noun ( ? 12.14 ) , has no ordinary plural by its side ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its meaning of oxen , cattle , ' with archaic-poetic connotation . We may note in passing that the grammatical features we have discussed , determine features of the phonetic pattern ( ? 8.5 ) , by defining groups like sibilant-affricate , dental stop , voiced , unvoiced , and establishing the relation f , A , s versus v , z , and t versus d . We may describe " voicing of final spirant plus suffix - ez , -z , ( -s ) " as an irregular alternant of the regular plural-suffix - ez , -z , - sl ; the irregularity consists in a phonetic modification of the underlying form . The same modification is accompanied by modification of the syllabic in the uniquely irregular staff : staves . I n cloth kloO : clothes klowz we have a uniquely irregular plural with specialized meaning ( ' garments , clothing ' ) , beside the irregular plural cloths klAz with normal meaning . The homonymous third-person present-tense suffix of verbs is accompanied by phonetic modification of the underlying form in do duw : does doz , say sej : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past-tense suffix - ed , -d , -t is accompanied by phonetic modification in the irregular forms say : said , flee : fled , hear hijr : heard hfd , keep : kept ( and , similarly , crept , slept , swept , wept ; leaped and leapt are variants ) , do : did , sell : sold ( and , similarly , told ) , make : made , have : had . 13. 7 . In some cases the bound form appears in an unusual shape . In die : dice the alternant -s appears against the general  | habit ; in penny : pence the same feature is accompanied by modification ( loss of - ij ) in the underlying form , together with specialization of meaning , in contrast with the normal variant pennies . I n the past tense , we find 4 instead of -d in the archaic-flavored variants burnt , learnt . If we say that in English the unpermitted final cluster - dt is replaced by -t , we can class here , with -t instead of - ed , the forms bent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show irregular phonetic modification in feel : felt and similarly in dealt , knelt , dreamt , meant . If we say t hat the unpermitted final clusters - vt , - zt are replaced by - ft , - st , we can class here also leave : left and lose : lost . The bound form appears in the alternant -t instead of -d , and the underlying form replaces the syllabic and all that follows by a in seek sijk : sought sat and , similarly , in bought , brought , caught , taught , thought . In the extreme case , an alternant bears no resemblance to the other alternants . In ox : oxen the bound form added in the plural Is -n instead of - ez , -z , -s . If the language does not show parallel cases which warrant our describing the deviant form in terms of phonetic modification , an alternant of this sort is said to be supplelive ; thus , -n in oxen is a suppletive alternant of - ez , -z , -s , because English grammar shows no phonetic modification of - ez to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which suffers suppletion . Beside the ordinary derivation of kind : kinder , warm : warmer , and so on , we have good : better , where the underlying word good is replaced by an entirely different form bet- , which we describe , accordingly , as a suppletive alternant of good . In the same way , the infinitive be suffers suppletion , by i- , in the third-person present-tense form is iz . In child : children , a suppletive alternant - rn of the bound form is accompanied by phonetic modification of the underlying word . Another extreme case is that of zero-alternants ( ? 13.2 ) , in which a constituent is entirely lacking , as in the plurals sheep , deer , moose , fish , and so on . These plurals are irregular , for although some of them ( for instance , species of fish , like perch , bass , pickerel , large enough to be eaten in separate specimens , and not named after other objects ) can be classified by purely practical features of meaning , they have no formal characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of verbs shows a zero-alternant in bet , let , set , wet , hit , slit , split , cut , shut , put , beat , cast , cost , burst , shed , spread , wed . The third-person present-tense suffix has a  | zero-alternant in can , shall , will , must , may , and , in certain constructions ( for instance , with the modifier not ) , in need , dare ; this is a regular grammatical alternation , since these verbs are definable by their syntactic function of taking an infinitive modifier without the preposition to . Our possessive-adjective suffix - ez , -z , -s has a zero-alternant in one instance , namely , after an underlying form which ends in the plural-suffix - ez , -z , -s , as the-boys ' . A zero-alternant may go with modification of the accompanying form . Thus , the plural nouns geese , teeth , feet , mice , lice , men , women ' wimn add no bound form to the singular , but contain a different syllabic . In these plurals a grammatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( namely , the sememe more than one object ' ) which is normally expressed by a linguistic forum ( namely , the morpheme - ez , -z , -s ) . We may say that " substitution of ij " ( for the stressed syllabic of the underlying form ) in geese , teeth , feet , " substitution of aj " in mice , lice , " substitution of e " in men , and " substitution of i " in women , are alternants of the normal plural-suffix ? substitution-alternants or substitutionforms . In our past-tense verbs we find substitution of various syllabics taking the place of - ed , -d , -t , as : Table In stand : stood we have a more complex case with an alternant describable as " substitution of u and loss of n . " A zero-alternant replaces the bound form , and a suppletive alternant the underlying form , in cases like be : was , go : went , I : my , we : our , she : her , bad : worse .  | In cases like have hev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the constituents is modified by the loss of a phoneme . This loss may be described as a minus feature ; like zero-features or Nuf ) stitution-features , minus-features may occur independently . For instance , in a French adjective , the regular type has only one form , regardless of whether the adjective accompanies a masculine or a feminine noun , e.g. rouge ru:f red ' : un livre rouge ( a " li:vra ru:z a red book , ' masculine , and une plume rouge ( yn plym ru:z a red feather or pen , ' feminine . In a fairly large irregular type , however , the masculine and feminine forms differ : tint livre vert ve:r a green book , ' but une plume verte vert a green feather or pen . ' Thus : Table It is evident that two forms of description are here possible . We could take the masculine forms as a basis and tell what conw ) nant is added in each case in the feminine form , and this would , of course , result in a fairly complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feminine form as our basis , we can describe this irregular type by the simple statement that the masculine form is derived from the feminine by means of a minus-feature , namely , loss of the final consonant and of the cluster - kt . If we take the latter course , we find , moreover , that all the other differences between the two forms , as to vowel quantity and as to nasalization ( as in our last example ) , re-appear in other phases of French morphology and can in large part be attributed to the phonetic pattern . The last part of our discussion has shown us that a word may have the character of a secondary derivative and yet consist of  | only one morpheme , accompanied by a zero-feature ( sheep , as a plural ; cut as a past ) , by a substitution-feature ( men , sang ) , by suppletion ( went , worse ) , or by a minus-feature ( French verl , masculine ) . We class these words as secondary derivatives and recognize their peculiarity by calling them secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivation are added to the underlying form , are called affixes . Affixes which precede the underlying form are prefixes , as be- in be-head ; those which follow the underlying form are called suffixes , as - ez in glasses or - ish in boyish . Affixes added within the underlying form are called infixes ; thus , Tagalog uses several infixes which are added before the first vowel of the underlying form : from ' su:lat ' a writing ' are derived su'mu:lat one who wrote , ' with the infix - um-  , and si'nu:lat that which was written , ' with infix - in- j . Reduplication is an affix that consists of repeating part of the underlying form , as Tagalog su : - 'su:lat one who will write , ' ' ga:mit thing of use ' : ga : - 'ga:mit one who will use . ' Reduplication may be of various extent : Fox wa:pame:wa he looks at him ' : wa : - wa:pame:wa he examines him , ' wa:pa-wa:pame:wa he keeps looking at him . ' It may differ phonetically in some conventional way from the underlying word : ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pam-'phajnej it shines brightly ' ; Sanskrit ' bharti he bears ' : ' bi-bharti he bears up , ' ' bhari-bhartiI he bears off violently . ' 13. 9 . We have seen that when forms are partially similar , there may be a question as to which one we had better take as the underlying form , and that the structure of the language may decide this question for us , since , taking it one way , we get an unduly complicated description , and , taking it the other way , a relatively simple one . This same consideration often leads us to set up an artificial underlying form . For instance , in German the voiced mutes b , d , g , v , z are not permitted finals , and are in final position replaced by the corresponding unvoiced phonemes . Accordingly we get sets like the following : Table  | It is evident that if we took the underlying words in their actual shape as our basic forms , we should have to give a long list to tell which ones appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , if we start from an artificial underlying form with ( -z , as gra:z- , hawz- , in contrast with spa:s , aws , we need give no list and can account for the uniform final -s which actually appears in the independent forms , by the rule of permitted finals . Similarly for the other voiced mutes , as in Table where we set up a theoretical basic form rund- in contrast with ( aunt . We have seen that in some languages these theoretical forms appear also in the phrase , by reminiscent sandhi ( ? 12.5 ) . Similarly , some languages permit no final clusters and yet show included free forms with clusters . Compare the following nounforms in Menomini : Table It is evident that a description which took the singular forms as a basis would have to show by elaborate lists what consonants , as , ( k , j , s , tj , are added before a suffix ; the simple and natural description is to take as a starting-point the free forms not in their absolute shape , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like . Another example is furnished by Samoan , which permits no final consonants at all , and therefore has sets like the following : Table It is clear that a useful description will here set up the basic forms in theoretical shape , as tanis- , inum- , uluf-.  | 13. 10 . Modulation of secondary phonemes often plays a part in morphologic constructions . In English , affixes are normally unstressed , as in be-wail-ing , friend-li-ness and the like . In our foreign-learned vocabulary , shift of stress to an affix is a taxenie in many secondary derivatives . Thus , some suffixes have pre-suffixal stress : the accent is on the syllable before the suffix , regardless of the nature of this syllable ; thus , - ity in able : ability , formal : formality , major : majority ; - jn in music : musician , audit : audition , educate : education ; - ik in demon : demonic , anarchist : anarchistic , angel : angelic . In the derivation of some of our foreignlearned nouns and adjectives from verbs , the stress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we derive the noun insert ' insrt ; similarly , contract , convict , convert , converse , discourse , protest , project , rebel , transfer . In other cases this modulation appears along with a suffix : conceive : concept , perceive : percept , portend : portent ; in some , the underlying verb has to be theoretically set up , as in precept . In some languages modulation has greater scope . In Sanskrit , with some suffixes the derivative form keeps the accent of the underlying form : Table  | Tagalog uses both stress and vowel-lengthening as auxiliary phonemes ; three suffixes of the form - an differ in the treatment of these modulations . Suffix - an r is characterized by presuffixal stress and by long vowel in the first syllable of the underlying form : The meaning is action ( often reciprocal or collective ) by more than one actor . ' Suffix - an2 is stressed when the underlying word has stress on the first syllable ; otherwise it is treated like - an ' : The meaning is place of action , usually by more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has presuffixal stress when the underlying word is stressed on the first syllable ; it is stressed when the underlying word is stressed on the last syllable ; there is no vowel-lengthening beyond what is demanded by the phonetic pattern : The meaning is ( a ) an object which serves as locality of the underlying object , action , etc. , ' and ( b ) that which may be acted upon . ' In languages with auxiliary phonemes of pitch , these may play a part in morphology . Thus , in Swedish , the suffix - er of agentnouns shows the normal compound word-pitch of polysyllables ( ? 7.7 ) in the resultant form : the verb-stem le:s- read ' forms laser " le:ser reader ' ; but the - er of the present tense demands simple word-pitch in the resultant form : ( han ) laser ' le:ser ( he ) reads . ' 13. 11 . In all observation of word-structure it is very important to observe the principle of immediate constituents . In Tagalog , the underlying form ' ta:wa a laugh ' appears reduplicated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this form , in turn ,  | underlies a derivative with the infix - urn-  , namely tuma : ' ta:wsl one who is laughing . ' On the other hand , the form ' pi:lit effort ' first takes the infix - urn-  , giving pu'mi:lit one who compelled , ' and is then reduplicated , giving - pu:pu'mi:lit , which underlie ! nag-pu:pu'mi:lit one who makes an extreme effort . ' Close observation of this principle is all the more necessary because now and then we meet forms which compromise as to immediate constituents . Tagalog has a prefix part- , as in a'tip roofing ' part-a'tip that used for roofing ; shingle . ' The rj of this prefix and certain initial consonants of an accompanying form are subject to a phonetic modification ? we may call it morphologic sandhi ? by which , for instance , our prefix joins with ' pu:tul a cut ' in tim derivative pa-'mu:tul that used for cutting , ' with substitution of m for the combination of - rj plus p- . In some forms , however , we find an inconsistency as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting in quantity ' implies , by the actual sequence of the parts , that the reduplication is made " before " tho prefix is added , but at the same time implies , by the presence of m- for p- in both reduplication and main form , that the prefix in added " before " the reduplication is made . A carelessly ordered description would fail to bring out the peculiarity of a form like this . 13. 12 . In languages of complex morphology we can thus observe a ranking of constructions : a complex word can be described only as though the various compoundings , affixations , modifications , and so on , were added in a certain order to the basic form . Thus , in English , the word actresses consists , in the first place , of actress and - ez , just as lasses consists of lass and - ez ; actress , in turn consists of actor and - ess , just as countess consists of count and - ess ; actor , finally , consists of act and -r . There would be no parallel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In languages of this type , then , we can distinguish several ranks of morphologic structure . In many languages these ranks fall into classes : the structure of a complex word reveals first , as to the more immediate constituents , an outer layer of inflectional constructions , and then an inner layer of constructions of word formation . In our last , example , the outer , inflectional layer is represented by the construction of actress with - ez , and the inner , word-formational layer by the out . It is based on iwveral features . The constructions of inflection usually cause closure or partial closure ( ? 12.11 ) , so that a word which contains an inflectional construction ( an inflected word ) can figure as a constituent in no morphologic constructions or else only in certain Inflectional constructions . The English form actresses , for instance , can enter into only one morphologic construction , namely the derivation of the possessive adjective actresses ' ( with the zeroalternant of - ez , -z , -s , ? 13.7 ) . This latter form , in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has complete closure . Another peculiarity of inflection , in contrast with wordformation , is the rigid parallelism of underlying and resultant forms . Thus , nearly all English singular nouns underlie a derived plural noun , and , vice versa , nearly all English plural nouns are derived from a singular noun . Accordingly , English nouns occur , for the most part in parallel sets of two : a singular noun ( hat ) and a plural noun derived from the former ( hats ) . Given one of these , the speaker is usually capable of producing the other . Each such exit of forms is called a paradigmatic set or paradigm , and each form in the set is called an inflected form or inflection . Some languages have large paradigms , which contain many inflections . In Latin , for instance , the verb appears in some 125 inflectional forms , such as amore ' to love , ' amo ' I love , ' auras ' thou lovest , ' amat ' he loves , ' amamus ' we love , ' amem ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and so on ; the occurrence of one form usually guar , aantees the occurrence of all the others . It is this parallelism of the inflections which forces us to treat a single phonetic form , like sheep as a set of homonyms , a singular noun sheep ( corresponding to lamb ) and a plural noun sheep ( corresponding to lambs ) . It is this parallelism also , which leads us to view entirely different phonetic forms , like go : went , as morphologically related ( by suppletion ) : go as an infinitive ( parallel , say , with show ) and went as a past-tense form ( parallel , then , with showed ) . The parallelism , to be sure , is sometimes imperfect . Defective paradigms lack some of the inflections ; thus , can , may , shall , will , must have no infinitive , must has no past tense , scissors no singular . If , as in these cases , the lacking form happens to underlie the act wally existing ones , we do best to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *can or singular *scissor- . On the other hand , some irregular paradigms are over-differenti- ated . Thus , corresponding to a single form of an ordinary paradigm like play ( to play , I play , we play ) , the paradigm of be has three forms ( to be , I am , we are ) , and , corresponding to the single form played , it has the forms ( I ) was , ( we ) were , been . The existence of even a single over-differentiated paradigm implies homonymy in the regular paradigms . The parallelism of inflected forms goes hand in hand with a further characteristic : the different inflections differ in syntactic function . If we say the boys chauffe , our syntactic habit of congruence ( ? 12.7 ) requires us , when the boy is the actor , to supply also the form chauffes . In the case of the present and past inflections of the English verb this is not true : the parallelism of plays : played is not required by any habits of our syntax , but is carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks of inflection , we get compound paradigms ; the inflections of the English noun , for instance , consist of an outer construction , the derivation of the possessive adjective , and an inner one , the derivation of the plural : Table In the Latin verb we find a very complicated compound paradigm : an outer layer for different actors or undergoers , distinguished as to person ( speaker , hearer , third person ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and voice ( actor , undergoer ) , an inner layer for differences of tense ( present , past , future ) and mode ( real , hypothetical , unreal ) , and an innermost layer for a difference as to completion of the act ( imperfectic , perfectic ) . 13. 13 . We come , finally , to an important characteristic of inflection , akin to those we have mentioned , the derivational unity of paradigms . The inflectional forms of a paradigm do not each enter into composition and derivation , but the paradigm as a whole is represented by some one form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the singular , as in manslaughter , mannish , and those of the verb-paradigm by the infinitive , as in playground , player . An English paradigm consists of an underlying word ( itself a member of the paradigm ) and some secondary derivatives containing this underlying word ; as a constituent in further derivation and composition , the paradigm , as  | a whole , is represented by the underlying form ; the English language , accordingly , may be said to have word-inflection , wordderivation , and word-composition . In many languages , especially in those which have a more complex morphology , none of the forms in a paradigm can conveniently be viewed as underlying the others . Thus , the regular paradigms of the German verb contain a common element which is not equal to any of the inflecional forms . For instance , the paradigm represented by the forms lachen ' lax-en ( to ) laugh , ' ( ich ) lathe ' lax-e ( I ) laugh , ' ( er ) lacht lax-t ( he ) laughs , ' ( er ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ge-'lax-t laughed ' ( participle ) , and so on , shows a common element lack- lax- in all the inflectional forms , but none of these inflectional forms consists simply of the element lath- without an affix . In secondary derivation and composition the paradigm is represented by this same form , as in Lacher ' lax-er laugher ' and Lachkrampf ' lax-1krampf laughingspasm . ' This lack- , strictly speaking , is a bound form ; it is called the kernel or stem of the paradigm . The German verb is an example of stem-inflection , stem-derivation , and stem-composition . In our description , we usually treat the stem as if it were a free form . In some languages of this type , the common element of the paradigm differs from the stem which represents the paradigm in derivatives and compounds . Thus , an ancient Greek nounparadigm has stem-inflection . It contains a common element , a kernel , much like the German verb-stem , e.g. hipp- horse ' : Table In secondary derivation , however , this paradigm is represented not by the common element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip'po-te:s horseman , ' or with loss of the o by phonetic modification , in hipp-i'kos pertaining to horses . ' Similarly , as a compound-member , the paradigm is represented by a special compounding form , homonymous with the preceding : hippo-'kantharos horse-beetle . ' Thus , we distinguish between the kernel hipp- , which actually ( subject , however , in principle ,  | to phonetic modification ) appears in all the forms , and the stem hipp-o- , which underlies the further derivatives . Some exceptions to the principle of paradigmatic unity are only apparent . The possessive-adjective form in the English compounds like bull's-eye or the plural form in longlegs are due , as we shall see , to the phrasal structure of these compounds . Real exceptions do , however , occur . German has a suffix - then - xen small , ' which forms secondary derivatives from nouns , as : Tisch t is table ' : Tischchen ' tis-xen little table . ' In the system of German morphology , this is a construction of word-formation , but in a certain few instances the suffix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : beside Kind kint child ' : Kindchen ' kint-xen ) little child , ' the plural inflection Kinder ' kinder children ' underlies the derivative Kinderchen ' kinder-xen little children . ' If a language contained too many cases of this sort , we should simply say that it did not distinguish such morphologic layers as arc denoted by the terms inflection and word-formation.  | MORPHOLOGIC TYPES 14. 1 . Of the three types of morphologic constructions which can he distinguished according to the nature of the constituents ? namely , composition , secondary derivation , and primary derivation ( ? 13.3 ) ? the constructions of compound words are most similar to the constructions of syntax . Compound words have two ( or more ) free forms among their immediate constituents ( door-knob ) . Under the principle of immediate constituents , languages usually distinguish compound words from phrase-derivatives ( as , old-maidish , a secondary derivative with the underlying phrase old maid ) , and from de-compounds ( as , gentlemanly , a secondary derivative with the underlying compound word gentleman ) . Within the sphere of compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ; thus , the compound wild-animal-house does not consist , say , of three members wild , animal , and house , and not of the members wild and animal-house , but of the members wild animal ( a phrase ) and house ; and , similarly , the compound doorknob-wiper consists , unmistakably , of the members door-knob and wiper , and not , for instance , of door and knob-wiper . The grammatical features which lead us to recognize compound words , differ in different languages , and some languages , doubtless , have no such class of forms . The gradations between a word and a phrase may be many ; often enough no rigid distinction can be made . The forms which we class as compound words exhibit some feature which , in their language , characterizes single words in contradistinction to phrases . In meaning , compound words are usually more specialized than phrases ; for instance , blackbird , denoting a bird of a particular species , is more specialized than the phrase black bird , which denotes any bird of this color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difference as a criterion . We can not gauge meanings accurately enough ; moreover , many a phrase is as specialized in meaning as any compound : in the phrases a queer bird and meat  | and drink , the words bird , meat are fully as specialized as they are in the compounds jailbird and sweetmeats. 14. 2 . In languages which use a single high stress on each word , this feature distinguishes compound words from phrases . In English the high stress is usually on the first member ; on the other member there is a lesser stress , as in door-knob ' dowr-1nab , upkeep ' op-1kijp . Certain compounds have the irregularity of leaving the second member unstressed , as in gentleman ' jentmn , Frenchman ' frencmn ; contrast milkman ' milk-1men . Certain types of compounds , chiefly some whose members are adverbs and prepositions , stress the second member : without , upon . Accordingly , wherever we hear lesser or least stress upon a word which would always show high stress in a phrase , we describe it as a compound-member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream ' ajs ' krijm is a phrase , although there is no denotative difference of meaning . However , a phrase as prior member in a compound keeps all its high stresses : in wild-animal-house ' wajld'eniml-thaws the stress assures us only that house is a compoundmember ; the rest of the structure is shown by other criteria . As to the phonetic pattern , compound words are generally treated like phrases : in English , clusters like vt in shrovetide or nn in pen-knife do not occur within simple words . Sandhi-like phonetic modifications mark a compound as a single word only when they differ from the sandhi of syntax in the same language . Thus gooseberry ' guwzbrij is marked as a compound because the substitution of z for s is not made in English syntax , but only in morphology , as in gosling ' gazlid . Similarly , in French , pied-a-terre pjet-a-te:r temporary lodging ' ( literally foot-on-ground ' ) beside pied pje foot , ' or pot-au-feu pat-o-f ? broth ' ( literally pot-on-the-fire ' ) beside pot po pot , ' or vinaigre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil wine , ' are marked as compounds , because French nouns do not exhibit these types of sandhi in the phrase , but only in word-constructions , such as pieter pjete toe the mark , ' potage pata:z thick soup , ' vinaire vine:r pertaining to wine ' ; contrast , for instance , the phrase vin aigre veil egr sour wine . ' More striking phonetic modifications may mark a compound ; thus , in the following examples the prior member suffers greater modification than it does in any phrase of its language : holy ' howlij : holiday ' halidej , moon : Monday , two tuw : twopence  | ' topns ; Old English ' fgower four ' : ' Oer-Ife:te four-footed ' ; the second member , in Sanskrit na:wh ship ' : ati-'nuh gone from the ship ' ; ancient Greek pa'te:r father ' : ew-'pato:r wellfathered ' ; Gothic dags day ' : fidur-dogs four days old ' ; both members , in English breakfast ' brekfest , blackguard ' blegrd , boatswain ' bowsn , forecastle ' fowksl ; in some cases there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead ' fared , waistcoat ' wesket . In extreme cases , of course , the form may be so unlike the independent word that we may hesitate between calling it a compound-member or an affix : a form like fortnight ' fort-inajt , ' fortnet lies on the border between compound and simple word . The order of the members in a compound word may be fixed , while that of the phrase is free , as in bread-and-butter ' bred-n-ibotr ' slices of bread spread with butter , ' contrasting with the phrase , as in she bought bread and butter , she bought butter and bread . This criterion is likely to break down , however , because the order in a phrase , too , may be fixed : we have also a specialized phrase ' bred -i ' botr with the same order and the same meaning as the compound . Contrasting order is a surer mark : French blanc-bec plan-bek callow young person ' ( literally white-beak ' ) is characterized as a compound , because adjectives like blanc in the phrase always follow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to housekeep , to backslide , to undergo , since in a phrase a noun goal like house and adverbs of the type back , under would follow the verb ( keep house , slide back ) . 14. 3 . The commonest , but also the most varied and most difficult to observe , of the features which lead us to distinguish compound words from phrases , are grammatical features of selection . The plainest contrast appears in languages with stem-composition ( ? 13.13 ) . A stem like German lath- , which represents a whole verb paradigm in a German compound like Lachkrampf ' lax-1krampf laughing-spasm , ' but does not actually occur as an independent word , makes the compound unmistakably different from any phrase . Even more plainly , a compounding-stem , such as ancient Greek hippo- horse , ' may differ formally from all the inflections of its paradigm , and , in any case , characterizes a compound by its invariability ; thus , hippo- joins some other stem , such as ' kantharo- beetle , ' to form a compound stem , hippo-'kantharo- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms  | of this compound : nominative hippo'kantharo-s , accusative hippo'kantharo-n , and so on . Even when the compound-member is formally equal to some word , it may characterize the compound . In ancient Greek : t noun-stem is inflected by means of suffixes . Accordingly , tlu , first member of a compound noun-stem will remain the same in all forms of the paradigm . Thus , the phrase new city ' will show various inflectional forms of two paradigms : Table and so on , but the compound stem ne'a : poli- Naples , ' whose first member is in nominative singular form , will show this first member unchanged in all the inflections : Table In German , the adjective has word-inflection ; the underlying form is used as a complement of verbs : Das ist rot des ist ' ro:tl that is red , ' and the derived inflections appear as modifiers of nouns : roter Wein ' ro:ter ' vajn red wine . ' The absence of inflectional suffixes therefore characterizes the compound-member in a form like Rotwein ' ro:t- , vajn red-wine . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the beginning and what the end of a word or stem . In German , the past participle of verbs is formed by the addition to the stem of a prefix ge- and a suffix -t , as in gelacht ge-'lax-t laughed . ' The position of these affixes , accordingly , shows us that a form like geliebkost ge-'li:p , ko:s-t caressed ' is one word , derived from , a compound stem , but that a form like liebgehabt ' li:p ge- , hap-t liked ' is a two-word phrase . This gives us a standard for the classification of other inflectional forms , such as the infinitives liebkosen ' li:p- , ko:zen to caress ' and liebhaben ' li:p , ha:ben to like . ' Sometimes the compound-member resembles an inflectional form , but one which would be impossible in the phrase . The -z , -s on the prior members of bondsman , kinsman , landsman , marksman resembles the possessive-adjective suffix , but possessive adjectives like bond 's , land 's and so on , would not be so used in the  | phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as in une grdmde maison yn grand mezon a big house , ' drops the final consonant ( ? 13.7 ) to make the inflectional form used with masculine nouns : un grand garcon cell gran garson a big boy ' ; but , as a compound-member , the latter form appears also with certain feminine nouns : grand'mere gran-me:r grandmother , ' grand'porte gran-part main entry . ' Compound-members of this type are especially common in German : Sonnenschein ' zonen-isajn ' sunshine ' has the prior member Sonne in a form which , as a separate word in a phrase , could only be plural ; in Geburtstag ge'burts- , ta:k birthday , ' the -s is a genitive-case ending , but would not be added , in an independent word , to a feminine noun like die Geburt birth . ' A compound-member may be characterized by some feature of word-formation which differs from what would appear in an independent word . In ancient Greek there was a highly irregular verb-paradigm , containing such forms as da'mao : I tame , ' e'dme:the : he was tamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of a stem-form dame : - . From this paradigm there is derived , on the one hand , the independent agentnoun dme : ' te:r tamer , ' and , on the other hand , with a different suffix , an agent-noun - damo-  , which is used only as a second member of compound words , as in hip'po-damo-s horse-tamer . ' Compounds with special features of word-formation are known as synthetic compounds . Synthetic compounds occurred especially in the older stages of the Indo-European languages , but the habit is by no means extinct . In English , the verb to black underlies the independent agent-noun blacker ( as in a blacker of boots ) , but forms also , with a zero-element , the agent-noun - black which appears in the compound boot-black ; similarly , to sweep forms sweeper and the second member of chimney-sweep . Even forms like long-tailed or red-bearded are not aptly described as containing the words tailed , bearded ( as in tailed monkeys , bearded lady ) ; the natural startingpoint is rather a phrase like long tail or red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suffix - ed . This is the same thing as saying that we use compounds of the type long-tailed , red-bearded regardless of the existence of words like tailed , bearded : witness forms like blue-eyed , four footed , snub-nosed . Another modern English synthetic type is that of three-master , thousand-legger . In English , we freely form compounds like meat-eater and meat- eating , but not verb-compounds like to meat-eat ; these exist only in a few irregular cases , such as to housekeep , to bootlick . Now , to be sure , words like eater and eating exist alongside the compounds ; the synthetic feature consists merely in the restriction that a phrase like eat meat is paralleled by compounds only when - er or - ing is at the same time added . We may designate the types meateating and meat-eater as semi-synthetic compounds . 14. 4 . Among the word-like features of the forms which we class as compound words , indivisibility ( ? 11.6 ) is fairly frequent : we can say black ? I should say , bluish-black ? birds , but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some instances , however , other features may lead us to class a form as a compound word , even though it is subject to interruption . In Fox , a form like ne-pje:6i-wa:pam-a : - pena we have come to see him ( her , them ) ' has to be classed as a compound word , because the inflectional prefix ne- I ( but not thou ) ' and the inflectional suffixes -a : - him , her , them ' and - penal plural of first person ' unmistakably mark the beginning and end of a word ( ? 14.3 ) . The members of the compound are the particle pjr:ci hither ' and the verb-stem wa:pam- see ( an animate object ) . ' Nevertheless , the Fox language sometimes inserts words and even short phrases between the members of such compounds , as in **28;1026;TOOLONG : - pena we have come to see her , thy daughter . ' In German , compound-members can be combined serially ; Singvogel ' ziq-If 0:gel songbirds , ' Raubvogel ' rawp-if ? : gel birds of prey , ' Sing- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . ' Generally , a compound-member can not , like a word in a phrase , serve as a constituent in a syntactic construction . The word black in the phrase black birds can be modified by very ( very black birds ) , but not so the compound-member black in blackbirds . This feature serves to class certain French forms as compound words : thus , sage femme sa : - fam midwife ' is to be classed as a compound , in contrast with a homonymous phrase meaning wise woman , ' because only in the latter can the constituent sage wise ' be accompanied by a modifier : tres sage femme tre sa:z fam very wise woman . ' This restriction , like the preceding , is occasionally absent in forms which by other features are marked as compound words . In Sanskrit , where stem-composition plainly marks the prior member of compound words , this member is  | nevertheless occasionally accompanied by a modifying word , as in citta-prama'thini : de : ' va:na:m ' api mind-disturbing of-gods even , ' that is disturbing to the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of gods ' ) is a syntactic modifier of the compound-member citta- mind . ' 14. 5 . The description and classification of the forms which the structure of a language leads us to describe as compound words , will depend upon the characteristic features of this language . Linguists often make the mistake of taking for granted the universal existence of whatever types of compound words are current iii their own language . It is true that the main types of compound words in various languages are somewhat similar , but this similarity is worthy of notice ; moreover , the details , and especially the restrictions , vary in different languages . The differences are great enough to prevent our setting up any scheme of classification that would fit all languages , but two lines of classification are often useful . One of these two lines of classification concerns the relation of the members . On the one hand , we have syntactic compounds , whose members stand to each other in the same grammatical relation as words in a phrase ; thus , in English , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two examples will concern us later ) show the same construction of adjective plus noun as do the words in the phrases black bird and white cap . On the other hand , we have asyntactic cornpounds like door-knob , whose members stand to each other in a construction that is not paralleled in the syntax of their language ? for English has no such phrasal type as *door knob . The syntactic compound differs from a phrase only in the essential features which ( in its language ) distinguish compound words from phrases ? in English , then , chiefly by the use of only one high stress . It may differ lexically from the corresponding phrase , as does dreadnaught ; the corresponding phrase , dread naught , has an archaic connotation , and the normal phrase would be fear nothing . We can set up sub-classes of syntactic compounds according to the syntactic constructions which are paralleled by the members , as , in English , adjective with noun ( blackbird , whitecap , bull's-eye ) , verb with goal noun ( lickspittle , dreadnaught ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with adverb ( castaway ) , and so on .  | Many compounds are intermediate between the syntactic and asyntactic extremes : the relation of the members parallels some syntactic construction , but the compound shows more than the minimum deviation from the phrase . For instance , the compound verb to housekeep differs from the phrase keep house by the simple feature of word-order . In such cases we may speak of various kinds of semi-syntactic compounds . The difference of order appears also in upkeep versus keep up , and in the French blanc-bec versus bec blanc ( ? 14.2 ) . In turnkey versus turn the key or turn keys , the difference lies in the use of the article or of the number-category . Even types like blue-eyed , three-master , meat-eater , viewed as synthetic compounds , can be said to correspond to blue eyes , three masts , eat meat , and to differ from these phrases by simple formal characteristics , including the addition of the bound forms - ed , - er to the second member . In French , boite-a-lettres bwa:t-a-lvtr , literally box-for-letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both meaning mail-box , post-box , ' differ in the choice of preposition and in the use of the article from the normal phrasal type , which would give bone pour des lettres bwn:t pu:r de lctr box for letters ' ; the use of a and certain other prepositions in place of more specific ones , and differences of article ( especially of zero in place of the phrasal article represented by the form des ) , are in French well-marked features which enable us to set up a class of semi-syntactic compounds . Where semi-syntactic compounds are definable , they can be further classified in the same manner as syntactic compounds : thus , in the semi-syntactic blue-eyed the members have the same construction as in the syntactic blackbird , in three-master the same as in three-day , in housekeep , turnkey the same as in lickspittle , in upkeep the same as in gadabout . Asyntactic compounds have members which do not combine in syntactic constructions of their language . Thus , in door-knob , horsefly , bedroom , salt-cellar , tomcat we see two nouns in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asyntactic types of English compounds are illustrated by fly-blown , frost-bitten ? crestfallen , footsore , fireproof , foolhardy ? by-law , by-path , everglade ? dining-room , swimming-hole ? bindweed , cry-baby , driveway , playground , blowpipe ? broadcast , dry-clean , foretell ? somewhere , everywhere , nowhere . Compounds with obscure members , such as smokestack , mushroom , or with unique members , such as  | cranberry , huckleberry , zigzag , choo-choo , are , of course , to be classed as asyntactic . Although the relation between the members of asyntactic compounds is necessarily vague , yet we can sometimes extend the main divisions of syntactic and semi-syntactic compounds to cover also the asyntactic class . In English , for instance , the coordinative or copulative relation which we see in a semi-syntactic compound like bittersweet ( compare the phrase bitter and sweet ) , can be discerned also in asyntactic compounds like zigzag , fuzzywuzzy , choo-choo . Most asyntactic compounds seem to have a kind of attribute-and-head construction : door-knob , bulldog , cranberry . To the extent that one can carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds ( Sanskrit dvandva ) and determinative ( attributive or subordinative ) compounds ( Sanskrit tatpurusha ) ; these divisions will cross those of syntactic , semi-syntactic , and asyntactic compounds . One may even be able to mark off smaller divisions . The Hindu grammarians distinguished among copulative compounds a special sub-group of repetitive ( amredita ) compounds , with identical members , as in choo-choo , bye-bye , goody-goody . In English , we can mark off also a class in which the members show only some elementary phonetic difference , as zigzag , flimflam , pell-mell , fuzzywuzzy . The Hindus found it convenient to set off , among the determinatives , a special class of syntactic attribute-and-head compounds ( karmadharaya ) , such as blackbird . 14. 6 . The other frequently usable line of classification concerns the relation of the compound as a whole to its members . One can often apply to compounds the distinction between endocentric and exocentric constructions which we met in syntax ( ? 12.10 ) . Since a blackbird is a kind of a bird , and a door-knob a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same function as their head members ; they are endocentric . On the other hand , in gadabout and turnkey the head member is an infinitive verb , but the compound is a noun ; these compounds are exocentric ( Sanskrit bahuvrihi ) . To take a copulative type as an example , the adjective bittersweet ( ' bitter and sweet at the same time ' ) is endocentric , since the compound , like its co-ordinated members , bitter and sweet , has the function of an adjective , but the plant-name bittersweet is exocentric , since , as a noun , it differs in grammatical function from the two adjective members .  | Another type of English exocentric compounds consists of adjectives with noun head : two-pound , five-cent , half-mile , ( in ) applepie ( order ) . The difference of form-class may be less radical , but still recognizable in the system of the language . In English , the nouns longlegs , bright-eyes , butterfingers are exocentric , because they occur both as singulars , and , with a zero-affix , as plurals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the noun rouge-gorge ru:i-god robin ' ( literally red-throat ' ) is exocentric , because it belongs to the masculine gender-class ( le rouge-gorge the robin ' ) , while the head member belongs to the feminine gender ( la gorge the throat ' ) . In the English type sure footed , blue-eyed , straight-backed the synthetic suffix - ed , -d , -t goes hand in hand with the exocentric value ( adjective with noun head ) ; however , one might perhaps hesitate as to the classification , since - footed , - eyed , - backed might be viewed as adjectives ( compare horned , bearded ) . Types like clambake , upkeep are better described as endocentric , in English grammar , because the head members - bake and - keep can be viewed as nouns of action derived , with a zero-feature , from the verbs ; if English did not use many zero-features in derivation and did not form many types of action nouns , we should have to class these compounds as exocentric . Similarly , our description will probably work out best , if we class bootblack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent-nouns . On the other hand , the large class of English compounds that is exemplified by whitecap , longnose , swallow-tail , blue-coat , bluestocking , red-head , short-horn has noun function and a noun as head member , and yet is to be classed as exocentric , because the construction implies precisely that the object does not belong to the same species as the head member : these compounds mean object possessing such-and-such an object ( second member ) of such-andsuch quality ( first member ) . ' This appears in the fact that the number-categories ( longlegs ) and the personal-impersonal categories ( nose . . . it ; longnose . . . he , ' she ) do not always agree . In three-master , thousand-legger the synthetic suffix goes hand in hand with this exocentric relation . Nevertheless , there are borderline cases which may prevent a clear-cut distinction . The compound blue-bottle is endocentric if we view the insect as like a bottle , ' but exocentric if we insist that the bottle ' is only part of the insect .  | The Hindus distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dvigu ) , nouns with a ' lumber as prior member , such as , in English , sixpence , twelvemonth , fortnight , and adverbials ( avyayibhava ) , adverbs with noun head , such as bareback , barefoot , hotfoot , or with noun subordinate , such as uphill , downstream , indoors , overseas . 14. 7 . In secondary derivative words we find one free form , a phrase ( as in old-maidish ) or a word ( as in mannish ) , as an immediate constituent ; in the latter case , the underlying word may be a compound word ( as in gentlemanly ) or , in its own turn , a derived word ( as in actresses , where the underlying word actress is itself a secondary derivative from the underlying word actor ) . We have seen , however , that for the description of some languages , we do well to set up theoretical underlying forms , namely stems , which enable us to class certain forms as secondary derivatives although , strictly speaking , they do not contain a free form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in the description of forms like English scissors , oats , where we set up a theoretical scissor- , oat- as underlying forms , just as we class cranberry , oatmeal , scissor-bill as compound words . The underlying free form , actual or theoretical , is accornpanied either by an affix , or , as we saw , in Chapter 13 , by a grammatical feature . In many languages , secondary derivatives are divided , first of all , into inflectional forms and word-formational forms ( ? 13.12 ) , but we may do well to recall that languages of this sort nevertheless often contain border-line forms , such as , in English , beeves or clothes , which predominantly resemble inflectional types , but show a formal-semantic deviation . In the same way , learned ' lined , drunken , laden , sodden , molten , and the slang broke out of funds ' deviate from the strictly inflectional past participles learned lend , drunk , loaded , seethed , melted , broken . The inflectional forms are relatively easy to describe , since they occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us a picture of their inflectional systems . It may be worth noticing , however , that our traditional grammars fall short of scientific compactness by dealing with an identical feature over and over again as it occurs in different paradigmatic types . Thus , in a Latin grammar , we find the nominative-singular sign -s noted separately for each of the types amicus friend , ' lapis  | stone , ' dux leader , ' tussis cough , ' manus hand , ' facies face , ' when , of course , it should be noted only once , with a full statement as to where it is and where it is not used . Word-formation offers far more difficulty , and is largely neg. lected in our traditional grammars . The chief difficulty lies in determining which combinations exist . In very many cases we have to resign ourselves to calling a construction irregular and making a list of the forms . Only a list , for instance , can tell us from which English male nouns we derive a female noun by means of the suffix - ess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably require a subsidiary list to tell in which of these derivatives a final r is replaced by non-syllabic r , as in waiter : waitress , tiger : tigress ? for the type without this change , as in author : authoress is prob . ably regular . Special cases , such as duke : duchess , master : tress , thief : thievess demand separate mention . Once we have established a construction of this kind , we may be able to set up a typical meaning and then , as in the case of inflection , to look for parallels . Our suffix - ess , for instance , has a definable linguistic meaning , not only because of the parallel character of all the sets like count : countess , lion : lioness , but also because English grammar , by the distinction of he : she , recognizes the meaning of the - ess derivatives . Accordingly , we are able to decide , much as we are in the case of inflection , whether a given pair of forms , such as man : woman , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to draw up supplementary statements , resembling our descriptions of paradigms , which show the various formal aspects of some grammatically determined semantic unit . Thus , we find the sememe female of such-and-such male ' expressed not only by the suffix - ess , but also by composition , as in elephant-cow , she-elephant , nanny-goat , and by suppletion , as in ram : ewe , boar : sow ; some such pairs show inverse derivation , the male derived from the female , as goose : gander , duck : drake . Similarly , we should probably need a complete list to tell which English adjectives underlie comparative forms in - er of the type kinder , shorter , longer , and , having this list , we could recognize semantically equivalent pairs , such as good : better , much : more , little : less , bad : worse . In other groups the semantic relations are not grammatically definable . Thus , we derive a great many verbs from nouns by means of various changes , including a zero-element , but the mean- ings of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to man , to dog , to beard , to nose , to milk , to tree , to table , to skin , to bottle , to father , to fish , to clown , and so on . Or , again , we derive verbs from adjectives in several varieties of the meanings ' to become so-and-so ' and ' to make ( a goal ) so-and-so , ' with various formal devices : Table To this list we must add a large number of foreign-learned types , such as equal : equalize , archaic : archaize , English : anglicize , simple : simplify , vile : vilify , liquid : liquefy , valid : validate , long : elongate , different : differentiate , debile : debilitate , public : publish . When derivation is made by means of grammatical features , such as phonetic modification ( man : men ; mouth : to mouthe ) or modulation ( convict verb : convict noun ) or suppletion ( go : went ) or zero-elements ( cut infinitive : cut past tense ; sheep singular : sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may have a hard time deciding which form of a set we had better describe as the underlying form . In English , we get a simpler description if we take Irregular paradigms ( such as man : men or run : ran ) as underlying , and regular paradigms ( such as to man or a run ) as derived . In most cases this criterion is lacking ; thus , we shall find it hard to decide , in cases like play , push , jump , dance , whether to take the noun or the verb as the underlying form . Whatever our decision , the derivative word ( e.g. to man derived from the noun man , or u run derived from the verb to run ) will often contain no affixes , and will be described ( for reasons that will shortly appear ) as a secondroot-word . In the same way , phrase-derivatives , such as old-maidish , derived from the phrase old maid , offer no special difficulty so long as they contain a derivational affix , such as - ish , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jack-in-the-pulpit or vil-may-care , we have the difficult type of phrase-words . These  | differ from phrases in their uninterrupted and syntactically inexpansible character , and often in their exocentric value . 14. 8 . Primary words contain no free forms among their immediate constituents . They may be complex , consisting of two or more bound forms , as per-ceive , per-taro , de-ceive , de-tain , or they may be simple , as boy , run , red , and , in , ouch . The bound forms which make up complex primary words , are determined , of course , by features of partial resemblance , an in the examples just cited . In many languages the primary words show a structural resemblance to secondary words . Thus , in English , the primary words hammer , rudder , spider resemble sec. ondary words like dance-r , lead-er , ride-r . The part of the primary word which resembles the derivational affix of the secondary word ( in our examples , - er ) can be described as a primary affix . Thus , the primary words hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffix - er . The remaining part of the primary word ? in our examples , the syllable hem- in hammer , rod- in rudder , spajd- in spider ? is called the root . The root plays the same pa in primary words as the underlying form ( e.g. dance , lead , ride in secondary words ( dancer , leader , rider ) . This distinction between primary affixes and roots is justified by the fact that the primary affixes are relatively few and vague in meaning , while the roots are very numerous and therefore relax tively clear-cut as to denotation . ' In accordance with this terminology , primary words that do not contain any affix-like constituents ( e.g. boy , run , red ) art classed as primary root-words . The roots which occur in primary root-words are free roots , in contrast with bound roots which occur only with a primary affix , such as the root spajd- in spider . Primary affixes may be extremely vague in meaning and not merely as an obligatory accompaniment ( a determinative ) of the root . In English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of speech ; thus , we have , with - er , spider , biller , linger , ever , under ; with - le , bottle , little , hustle ; with - ow , furrow , ' Early students of language , who confused description with the entirely cliff ent ( and much harder ) problem of ascertaining historical origins , somehow got notion that roots possessed mysterious qualities , especially in the way of age . N and then one still hears the claim that the roots which we set up must once upon time have been spoken as independent words . The reader need scarcely be that this is utterly unjustified ; the roots , like all bound forms , are merely unite partial resemblance between words . Our analysis guarantees nothing about early stages of the language which we are analyzing .  | yellow , borrow . In other cases the meaning is more palpable ; thus , - oek , in hummock , mattock , hassock , and so on , forms nouns denoting a lumpy object of moderate size , and this is confirmed by its use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillock , bullock . Our foreign-learned prefixes get a vague but recognizable meaning from contrasts like con-tain , de-tain , per-tain , re-tain . In some languages , however , primary affixes bear relatively concrete meanings . The Algonquian languages use primary suffixes that denote states of matter ( wood-like solid , stone-like solid , liquid , string-like thing , round thing ) , tools , parts of the body , animals , woman , child ( but not , apparently , adult males ) . Thus , In Menomini , the verb-form kepa:hkwaham ' he puts a cover on it , ' has a stem kepa:hkwah- , which consists of the root kep- ' obstruction of opening , ' and the primary suffixes - a:hkw-  wood or other solid of similar consistency , ' and - ah-  act on inanimate object by tool . ' Similarly , in Menomini , akuapi:nam ' he takes it from the water , ' the verb-stem consists of the root akua- ' removal from a medium , ' and the suffixes - epi : - ' liquid ' and I-en- ' act on object by hand ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the root ni:sw- ' two ' and the primary suffix - unak ' canoe . ' These affixes are used also in secondary derivation . Some of them are derived from independent words or stems ; thus , in Fox , pje:tehkwe:we:wa ' he brings a woman or women ' is an intransitive verb ( that is , can not be used with a goal-object , ? much as if we could say the woman-brings ) containing the primary suffix - ehkwe:we : - ' woman , ' which is derived from the noun ihkwe:wa ' woman . ' In Menomini , the cognate - ehkiwe : , as in pi:tehkiwe:w ( same meaning ) , does not stand in this relation to any noun , because the old noun for ' woman ' is here obsolete , and the actual word is mete:muh ' woman . ' In some languages the use of primary affixes derived from nouns covers much the same semantic ground as our syntactic construction of verb with goal-object . This habit is known as incorporation ; the claslocal instance is Nahuatl , the language of the Aztecs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a prefix in a verbform like ni-naka-kwa ' I-meat-eat , ' that is , ' I eat meat . ' A root may appear in only one primary word , as is the case with most ordinary English roots , such as man , boy , cut , red , nast ( in nasty ) , ham- ( in hammer ) , or it may appear in a whole series of primary words , as is the case with many of our foreign-learned  | roots , like - sijv in deceive , conceive , perceive , receive . In either case , the primary word may underlie a whole series of secondary derivatives ; thus , man underlies men , man 's , men 's , mannish , manly , ( to ) man ( mans , manned , manning ) ; deceive underlies deceiver , deceit , deception , deceptive ; conceive underlies conceivable , conceit , concept , conception , conceptual ; perceive underlies perceiver , percept , perceptive , perception , perceptible , perceptual ; and receive underlies receiver , receipt , reception , receptive , receptacle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary word is lacking ; thus , we have no such primary word as *preceive , but we have the words precept , preceptor , which are best described as secondary derivatives of a theoretical underlying form *pre-ceive . The roots of a language make up its most numerous class of morphological forms and accordingly bear its most varied and specific meanings . This is clearest in languages which have roots as free forms , as , in English , boy , man , cut , run , red , blue , green , brown , white , black . The clear-cut meaning will be found also in bound roots , such as yell- in yellow , pure- in purple , nast- in nasty , and so on . In most languages , however , there are also roots of very vague meaning , such as , in English , the foreignlearned roots of the type - ceive , - tain , - fer ( conceive , contain , confer , and so on ) . This is particularly the case in languages whose primary affixes are relatively varied and specific in meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of its modification . This possibility is obvious when the root occurs as an ultimate constituent in a secondary derivative : thus , in the secondary derivative duchess the modification of the underlying word duke is at the same time a modification of the root duke , and iii the secondary derivatives sang , sung , song , the modifications of the underlying sing , are necessarily modifications of the root sing . The alternant shapes of roots are in some languages so varied that the describer may well hesitate as to the choice of a basic form . In ancient Greek we find the alternants dame : - , dme : - , dmo : - , dama- , darn- in the forms e-'dame : he tamed , ' e-'dme : - the : he was tamed , ' ' dmo : -s slave , ' da'ma-o : I tame , ' hip'podam-o-s horse-tamer . ' Our whole description of Greek morphology , including even the distribution of derivatives into primary and secondary types , will depend upon our initial choice of a basic form for roots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the root , with or without affix-like determinatives , occurs in words of symbolic connotation , as flap , flip , flop . If we take flap as the basic form of this root , we shall describe flip , flop as derivatives , formed by substitution of i smaller , neater ' and by substitution of a larger , duller . ' Similar cases are , with substitution of i : snap : snip , snatch : snitch , snuff : sniff , bang : bing , yap : yip ; of ij : squall : squeal , squawk : squeak , crack : creak , gloom : gleam , tiny : teeny , of o : mash : mush , flash : flush , crash : crush . At first glance , we should describe these forms as secondary derivatives , since the word flap can be said to underlie the words flip , flop , but it is possible that a detailed description of English morphology would work out better if we viewed words like flip , flop as primary modifications of " the root flap- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The roots of a language are usually quite uniform in structure . In English they are one-syllable elements , such as man , cut , red ; many of them are free forms , occurring as root-words , but many , such as spajd- in spider , hem- in hammer , and , especially , foreign-learned roots like - sijv in conceive , perceive , are bound forms . Some of these bound roots end in clusters that do not occur in word-final , as lomb- in lumber or liI ) g- in linger . In Russian , the roots are monosyllabic , with the exception of some that have 1 or r between vowels of the set e , o , as in ' golod- ' hunger , ' ' gorod- city . ' We have seen an example of the variability of a root in ancient Greek ; for this language , as well as , apparently , for Primitive Indo-European , we probably have to set up roots of several different shapes , monosyllabic , such as do : - give , ' and disyllabic , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the roots are monosyllabic free forms consisting , phonetically , of an initial consonant or cluster ( which may be lacking ) , a final syllabic ( including diphthongal types with non-syllabic j , w , n , q ) , and a pitch-scheme . The Malayan languages have two-syllable roots , with stress on one or the other syllable , as in the Tagalog root-words ' ba:haj house ' and ka'maj hand . ' In the Semitic languages the roots consist of an unpronounceable skeleton of three consonants ; accordingly , every primary word adds to the root a morphologic element which consists of a vowel-scheme . Thus , in modern Egyptian Arabic , a root like k-t-b write ' appears in words like katab he wrote , ' ka:tib writing ( person ) , '  | kita:b book , ' and , with prefixes , ma-ka:tib places for writing , studies , ' ma-ktab place for writing , study , ' je-ktub he in writing ; ' similarly , the root g-l-s sit ' appears in galas he sat , ' ga:lis sitting person , ' ma-ga:lis councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Chinese , the structure of the roots is absolutely uniform ; in others , we find some roots that are shorter than the normal type . It is a remarkable fact that these shorter roots belong almost always to a grammatical or a semantic sphere which can be described , in terms of English grammar , as the sphere of pronoun , conjunction , and preposition . In German , which has much the same root structure as English , the definite article contains a root d- , for in the forms der , dem , den , and so on , the rest of the word ( - er , - em , - en , and so on ) is in each case a normal inflectional ending , appearing also in the inflectional forms of an adjective like red ' : rot-er , rot-em , rot-en . The same applies to the interrogative pronoun who ? ' with forms like wer , wem , wen . In Malayan and in Semitic , many words in this semantic sphere have only one syllable , as , in Tagalog , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object-expression , ' aj sign of predication , ' na sign of attribution . ' This semantic sphere is roughly the same as that in which English uses atonic words . 14. 9 . Perhaps in most languages , most of the roots are morphemes . Even in cases like English sing : sang : sung : song or flap : flip : flop , a relevant description will view one of the forms as basic and the others as secondary derivatives or as primary derivatives with phonetic modification of the root . In other cases , however , we find clearly-marked phonetic-semantic resemblances between elements which we view as different roots . The pronominal words of English are probably best described as containing monosyllabic roots that resemble each other , especially as to the initial consonants : Table Complex morphologic structure of the root is much plainer in the case of English symbolic words ; in these we can distinguish , with varying degrees of clearness , and with doubtful cases on the  | border-line , a system of initial and final root forming morphemes , of vague signification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with this structure . Thus , we.find recurrent initials : Table In this last instance we see a formal peculiarity which confirms our classification . In English morphology there is no general restriction to the occurrence of -r or -1 as suffixes , and , in particular , they are not ruled out by the presence of r , 1 in the body of the word : forms like brother , rather , river , reader , reaper or little , ladle , label are common enough . The symbolic roots , however , that contain an r , are never followed by the determinative suffix -r , but take an -1 instead , and , conversely , a symbolic root containing I is never followed by -1 , but only by -r : brabble and blabber ure possible as English symbolic types , but not *brabber or *blabble.  | The analysis of minute features , such as the root-forming morphemes , is bound to be uncertain and incomplete , because a phonetic similarity , such as , say , the b- in box , beat , bang , represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semantic similarity , and for this last , which belongs to the practical world , we have no standard of measurement .  | SUBSTITUTION 15. 1 . Having surveyed sentence-types ( Chapter 11 ) and constructions ( Chapters 12 , 13 , 14 ) , we turn now to the third type of meaningful grammatical arrangement , substitution ( ? 10.7 ) . A substitute is a linguistic form or grammatical feature which , under certain conventional circumstances , replaces any one of a class of linguistic forms . Thus , in English , the substitute I replaces any singular-number substantive expression , provided that this substantive expression denotes the speaker of the utterance in which the substitute is used . The grammatical peculiarity of substitution consists in selective features : the substitute replaces only forms of a certain class , which we may call the domain of the substitute ; thus , the domain of the substitute I is the English form-class of substantive expressions . The substitute differs from an ordinary linguistic form , such as thing , person , object , by the fact that its domain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most inclusive meaning , such as thing , can be used of this or that practical situation , is a practical question of meaning ; the equivalence of a substitute , on the other hand , is grammatically determined . For instance , no matter whom or what we address , we may mention this real or pretended hearer in the form of a substantive expression by means of the substitute you ? and for this we need no practical knowledge of the person , animal , thing , or abstraction that we are treating as a hearer . In very many cases , substitutes are marked also by other peculiarities : they are often short words and in many languages atonic ; they often have irregular inflection and derivation ( I : me : my ) and special syntactic constructions . In many languages they appear as bound forms and may then be characterized by morphologic features , such as their position in structural order . 15. 2 . One element in the meaning of every substitute is the class-meaning of the form-class which serves as the domain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example ,  | is the class-meaning of English substantive expressions ; the clasmmeaning of I is that of singular substantive expressions , and tho class-meaning of the substitutes they and we is that of plural substantive expressions . Some substitutes add a more specific meaning which does not appear in the form-class , but even in these cases a set of several substitutes systematically represents the whole domain . Thum , who and what together cover the class-meaning of English substantive expressions . In the same way , he , she , and it together cover the class-meaning of singular substantive expressions ; within the set , he and she cover the same sub-domain as who , and it the same sub-domain as what , but the distinction between he and she implies a further and independent subdivision . Our selection of substitutes , then , divides English substantive expressions into the sub-classes of personal ( replaced by who and he-she ) and nonpersonal ( replaced by what and it ) , and it subdivides the personal singulars into the sub-classes of male ( replaced by he ) and female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class-meaning , every substitute has another element of meaning , the substitution-type , which consists of the conventional circumstances under which the substitution is made . Thus , I replaces any singular substantive expression ( this domain gives us the class-meaning of I ) , provided that this substantive expression denotes the speaker of the very utterance in which the I is produced : this is the substitution-type of I. The circumstances under which a substitution is made are practical circumstances , which the linguist , for his part , can not accurately define . In detail , they differ greatly in different languages ; in speaking a foreign language , we have great difficulty in using the proper substituteforms. 15. 3 . Nevertheless , it will be worth our while to leave , for a moment , the ground of linguistics , and to examine the problems which here confront the student of sociology or psychology . We find , at once , that the various types of substitution represent elementary circumstances of the act of speech-utterance . The substitution-types in I , we , and you are based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and that , there , then represent relations of distance from the speaker or from the speaker and the hearer . The interrogative type of who , what , where , when stimulates the hearer to supply a speech-form . The negative type  | of nobody , nothing , nowhere , never excludes the possibility of a speech-form . These types are remarkably widespread and uniform ( except for details ) in the languages of the world ; among them we find the practical relations to which human beings respond more uniformly than to any others ? numerative and identificational relations , such as positive-negative , all , some , any , same , other , and , above all , the numbers , one , two , three , and so on . These are the relations upon which the language of science is based ; the speech-forms which express them make up the vocabulary of mathematics . Many of these substitution-types have to do with species and individuals : they select or identify individuals ( all , some , any , each , every , none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every language has a form-class of object-expressions , with a class-meaning of the type species occurring in individual specimens . ' Accordingly , the substitutes for object-expressions , pronominals , will usually show the most varied substitution-types . In English , where object-expressions are a special part of speech , the noun , the substitutes for the noun make up a part of speech , the pronoun ; together , these two constitute a greater part of speech , the substantive . The pronouns differ from nouns , for one thing , in not being accompanied by adjective modifiers ( ? 12.14 ) . To a large extent , some substitution-types are characterized , further , by the circumstance that the form for which substitution is made , has occurred in recent speech . Thus , when we say Ask that policeman , and he will tell you , the substitute he means , among other things , that the singular male substantive expression which is replaced by he , has been recently uttered . A substitute which implies this , is an anaphoric or dependent substitute , and the recently-uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems nowhere to be fully carried out : we usually find some independent uses of substitutes that are ordinarily dependent , as , for instance , the independent use of it in it 's raining . Independent substitutes have no antecedent : they tell the form-class , and they may even have an elaborate identificational or numerative substitution-type ? as , for instance , somebody , nobody ? but they do not tell which form of the class ( for instance , which particular noun ) has been replaced . On the whole , then , substitution-types consist of elementary features of the situation in which speech is uttered . These features are so simple that , for the most part , they could be indicated  | by gestures : I , you , this , that , none , one , two , all , and so on . Especially the substitutes of the this ' and that ' types resemble interjections in their semantic closeness to non-linguistic foritis of response ; like interjections , they occasionally deviate from 11w phonetic pattern of their language ( ? 9.7 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substitution-type represents the whole meaning of a substitute , we can safely say that the meanings of substitutes are , on the one hand , more inclusive and abstract , and , on the other hand , simpler and more constant , than the meanings of ordinary linguistic forms . In their class-meaning , substitutes are one step farther removed than ordinary forms from practical reality , since they designate not real objects but grammatical form-classes ; substitutes are , so to speak , linguistic forms of the second degree . In their substitution-type , on the other hand , substitutes are more primitive than ordinary linguistic forms , for they designate simple features of the immediate situation in which the speech is being uttered . The practical usefulness of substitution is easy to see . The substitute is used more often than any one of the forms in its domain ; consequently , it is easier to speak and to recognize . Moreover , substitutes are often short forms and often , as in English , atonic , or , as in French , otherwise adapted to quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often work more safely and accurately than specific forms . In answer to the question Would you like some fine , fresh cantaloupes ? The answer How much are cantaloupes ? is perhaps more likely to be followed by a delay or aberration of response ( " misunderstanding " ) than the answer How much are they ? This is especially true of certain substitutes , such as I , whose meaning is unmistakable , while the actual mention of the speaker 's name would mean nothing to many . a hearer . 15. 4 . Returning to the ground of linguistics , we may be somewhat bolder , in view of what we have seen in our practical excursion , about stating the meanings of substitutes . We observe , also , that in many languages , the meanings of substitutes recur in other forms , such as the English limiting adjectives ( ? 12.14 ) . The meaning of the substitute you may be stated thus : A. Class-meaning : the same as that of the form-class of substantive expressions , say object or objects ' ; B. Substitution-type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute he may be stated thus : A. Class-meanings : 1 . Definable in terms of form-classes : ( a ) the same as that of the form-class of singular substantive expressions , say one object ' ; ( b ) the same as that of the form-class defined by the substitutes who , someone , say personal ' ; 2 . Creating an otherwise unestablished form-class : he is used only of certain singular personal objects ( the rest are replaced , instead , by she ) , which , accordingly , constitute a sub-class with a class-meaning , say ' male ' ; B. Substitution-types : 1 . Anaphora : he implies , in nearly all its uses , that a substantive designating a species of male personal objects has recently been uttered and that he means one individual of this species ; say recently mentioned ' ; 2 . Limitation : he implies that the individual is identifiable from among all the individuals of the species mentioned ; this element of meaning is the same as that of the syntactic category of definite nouns ( ? 12.14 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 15. 5 . Substitutes whose substitution-type consists of nothing but anaphora , are ( simple ) anaphoric substitutes : apart from their class-meanings ( which differ , of course , according to the grammatical form-classes of different languages ) , they say only that the particular form which is being replaced ( the antecedent ) has just been mentioned . In English , finite verb expressions are anaphorically replaced by forms of do , does , did , as in Bill will misbehave just as John did . The antecedent here is misbehave ; accordingly , the replaced form is misbehaved . A few English verbparadigms , such as be , have , will , shall , can , may , must , lie outside the domain of this substitution : Bill will be bad just as John was ( not did ) . Nouns , in English are anaphorically replaced by one , plural ones , provided they are accompanied by an adjective attribute : I prefer a hard pencil to a soft one , hard pencils to soft ones . This use of one as an anaphoric pronoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word one ( ? 12.14 ) , especially in forming a plural , ones . The details of this anaphoric substitution will concern us later ( ? 15.8 ? 10 ) . In subordinate clauses introduced by as or than , we have in Eng- lish a second kind of anaphora for a finite verb expression : we say not only Mary dances better than Jane does , but also Mary dances better than Jane . We can describe this latter type by saying that , ( after as and than ) an actor ( Jane ) serves as an anaphoric substitute for an actor-action expression ( Jane dances ) , or we can say that ( after as and than ) a zero feature serves as an anaphoric substitute for a finite verb expression accompanying an actor expression . Another case of an anaphoric zero-feature in English is the replacement of infinitive expressions after the preposition to ( as in 1 have n't seen it , but hope to ) and after the finite verbs which take an infinitive attribute without to ( as in I 'll come if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after forms of be and have , as in You were running faster than I was ; I have n't seen it , but Bill has . Zero-anaphora for nouns with an accompanying adjective occurs freely in English only for mass nouns , as in I like sour milk better than fresh . For other nouns we use the anaphoric one , ones , except after certain limiting adjectives . While some forms of simple anaphoric substitution seem to occur in every language , there are great differences of detail . The use of one , ones , is peculiar to English ; related languages of similar structure use zero-anaphora quite freely for nouns after adjectives , as , German grosze Hunde and kleine ' gro:se ' hunde unt ' klajne big dogs and little ones ' ; French des grandes pommes et des petites de grad pam e de ptit big apples and small ones . ' In some languages the subject in the full sentence-types can be replaced by zero-anaphora ; thus , in Chinese , to a statement like wo3 ' jury ' i2 khwaj ' pu ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response may be ' jury ' i4 ' phi ' mo ? Need one roll ( interrogative particle ) ? ' In Tagalog this happens in subordinate clauses , as in the sentence al ) ' pu:nu ? aj tu'mu:bu ? han'gar ) sa mag'bu:ga the tree ( predicative particle ) grew until ( attributive particle ) bore-fruit. ' 15. 6 . Perhaps all languages use pronominal substitutes which combine anaphora with definite identification : the replaced form is an identified specimen of the species named by the antecedent . This , we have seen , is the value of the English pronoun he , as in Ask a policeman , and he will tell you . Substitutes of this kind are often , but misleadingly , called " anaphoric " ; a better name would be definite . In most languages , including English , the definite substitutes are not used when the antecedent is the speaker or the hearer or includes these persons ; for this reason , the definite  | substitutes are often spoken of as third-person substitutes . They usually share various peculiarities with the substitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker . The English definite or third-person pronouns , he , she , it , they , differ for singular and plural replaced forms , and , in the singular , for personal and non-personal antecedents : personal he , she , versus non-personal it . We have seen that the difference of singular and plural is otherwise also recognized by the language ( as , for instance , in the inflection of nouns : boy , boys ) , and we shall see that the same is true of the difference of personal and non-personal . Within the personal class , however , the distinction between he used with a male antecedent , and she , with a female antecedent , is otherwise imperfectly recognized in our language ( as , in the use of the suffix - ess , ? 14.7 ) . The distinction , then , between the pronoun-forms he and she , creates a classification of our personal nouns into male ( defined as those for which the definite substitute is he ) and female ( similarly defined by the use of the substitute she ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division into sexes . In languages with noun-genders ( ? 12.7 ) , the third-person pronouns usually differ according to the gender of the antecedent . Thus , in German , masculine nouns , such as der Mann der ' man the man , ' der Hut hu:t the hat , ' have the third-person substitute er e:r , as when er ist grosz e:r ist ' gro:s he , it is big , ' is said of either a man or a hat , or of any other antecedent that belongs to the " masculine " congruence-class ; feminine nouns , such as die Frau di : ' fraw the woman , ' die Uhr u:r the clock , ' have the third-person substitute sie zi : , as in sie ist grosz , she , it is big ' ; neuter nouns , such as das klaus das ' haws the house , ' or das Weib vajp the woman , ' have the third-person substitute es es , as in es ist grosz . This distinction , unlike that of he and she in English , accords with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der : die : das the ' ) . The meaning of definite identification ? that is , the way in which the individual specimen is identified from among the species named by the antecedent ? varies for different languages and would probably be very hard to define . It is important to notice , however , that in languages which have a category of " definite "  | noun-modifiers ( such as , in English the , this , that , my , John 's , etc. , ? 12.14 ) , the definite pronoun identifies the individual in the same fashion as a definite modifier identifies its head noun ; thus , a he after the antecedent policeman is equivalent in denotation , except for the peculiar value that lies in the use of a substitute , to the phrase the policeman . We need mention only a few widespread peculiarities , such as the case , not very common in English , that the definite pronoun is spoken before its antecedent : He is foolish who says so . If the antecedent is a predicate complement after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normally it , regardless of number , personality , or sex : it was a two-storey house ; it 's he ; it 's me ( I ) , it 's the boys . Instead of an infinitive phrase as an actor ( to scold the boys was foolish ) , we more commonly use it , with the infinitive phrase following in close parataxis ( ? 12.2 ) : it was foolish to scold the boys . An actor-action phrase , such as you ca n't come , does not serve as an actor ; but does appear in close parataxis with it as an actor : it 's too bad you ca n't come . This anticipatory use of the definite pronoun extends , in German , to almost any actor , with the restriction that the pronoun comes first ; thus , beside ein Mann kam in den Garten ajn ' man ' ka:m in den ' garten a man came into the garden , ' there is the form es kam ein Mann in den Garten , where the use of es resembles the English use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plural , this German es accompanies a plural verb : beside zwei Manner kamen in den Garten tsvaj ' mener ' ka:men two men came into the garden , ' there is the form es kamen zwei Manner in den Garten . In French , the definite pronoun replaces an adjective : etes-vous heureux ? ? je le suis e:t vu cero ? ? za 1 sqi . Are you happy ? ? I am . ' A step beyond this , we find definite pronouns in marginal uses without any antecedent , as in English slang beat it run away , ' cheese it look out , ' he hot footed it home he ran home , ' let ' er go . We use they as an actor for people in general : they say Smith is doing very well . The commonest use of this sort is the pseudoimpersonal use of a definite pronoun as a merely formal actor , in languages that have a favorite actor-action construction : it 's raining ; it 's a shame . This may occur alongside a genuine impersonal construction ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genuine impersonal mir war kalt mi:r va:r ' kalt to-me was cold ; I felt cold , ' hier wird getanzt ' hi:r virt ge'tantst here gets danced ; there is dancing here , ' the definite pronoun es may appear as an  | actor , provided it comes first in the phrase : es war mir kalt ; es wird bier getanzt . In Finnish , the impersonal and/the pseudo-impersonal are used for different meanings : puhutaan there is talking ' is a genuine impersonal , but sadaa ' it 's raining ' contains a definite substitute actor ' he , she , it , ' just as does puhuu ' he , she , it is talking . ' 15. 7 . The definite substitutes in most languages are not used when the replaced form designates the speaker or the hearer or groups that include these persons ; in this case a different type , the personal substitute is used . The first-person substitute I replaces mention of the speaker , and the second-person substitute thou , of the hearer . These are independent substitutes , requiring no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I and thou substitutes , most languages use also forms for groups of people that include the speaker or the hearer or both . Thus , in English , for a group of people which includes the speaker , the substitute is we ; if the speaker is not included , but the hearer is , the substitute is ye . Many languages distinguish all three of these possibilities , as , Tagalog , which , beside a'ku I ' and i'kaw ' thou , ' has the plural-like forms : speaker only included ( exclusive first person plural ) : ka'mi ' we ' speaker and hearer included ( inclusive first person plural ) : ' ta:ju ' we ' hearer only included ( second person plural ) : ka'ju ' ye . ' Similarly , languages which distinguish a dual number , allow of five combinations , as in Samoan : I-and-he , " I-and-thou , " ye-two , ' ' I-and-they , ' ' I-and-thou-and-he ( - or- they ) , ' thou-and-they . ' A few languages distinguish also a trial number ( ' three persons ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye are , of course , archaic ; modern English is peculiar in using the same form , you , both for the hearer and for a group of persons that includes the hearer . Many languages use different second-person substitutes according to different social relations between speaker and hearer . Thus , French uses vows vu you ' much like English , for both singular and plural , but if the hearer is a near relative , an intimate friend , a young child , or a non-human being ( such as a god ) , there is a special intimate singular-form toi twa . German uses the thirdperson plural pronoun they ' for both singular and plural second person : Sie spaszen zi : ' spa:sen is both they are jesting ' and ' you ( singular or plural ) are jesting , ' but the intimate forms , used much  | like those of French , distinguish singular and plural : du spaszest du : spa:sest thou art jesting , ' ihr spaszt i:r spa:st ' ye are jesting . ' The meaning of second-person substitutes is limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in deferential speech ; instead , the hearer is designated by some honorific term ( your Honor , your Excellency , your Majesty ) . In Swedish or in Polish , one says , for instance , How is Mother feeling ? ' or Will the gentleman come to-morrow ? ' where the terms here italicized denote the hearer . Some languages , such as Japanese and Mala : , distinguish several substitutes for both first and second persons , according to deferential relations between speaker and hearer . The personal substitutes and the definite ( " third-person " ) substitutes in many languages group themselves , by virtue of common features , into a kind of closed system of personal-definite substitutes . In English , both sets he , she , it , they and I , we , you ( thou , ye ) , are atonic in the phrase ; most of them have a special accusative caseform ( me , us , him , her , them , thee ) ; most of them derive their possessive adjectives irregularly ( my , our , your , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these adjectives have a special form for zero anaphora ( mine , etc. , ? 15.5 ) . In French , the personal-definite pronouns have special ( conjunct ) forms when they serve as actors or goals of verbs ( ? 12.12 ) ; these have case-inflection for different positions , which is otherwise foreign to French substantives ; moreover , they underlie possessive adjectives , as moi mwa ' I , ' mon chapeau mon sapo ' my hat , ' while other substantives do not : le chapeau de Jean lo saapo d zun ' the hat of John ; John 's hat . ' Very commonly the personal-definite substitutes have special syntactic constructions . Thus , in English , German , and French , the finite verb has special congruence-forms for different persons as actors : I am : thou art : he is ; French noes savons nu savor ' we know , ' vous savez vu save ' you know , ' elles savent el sa:v ' they ( feminine ) know , ' ils savent i sa:v ' they know . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , in the Algonquian languages , an initial element ke- appears in the forms that include the hearer ; if the hearer is not included , ne- denotes the speaker ; if neither is included , the initial is we- , as , in Menomini : Table  | Samoan , with a distinction of dual and plural numbers , has : Table In many languages , personal-definite substitutes appear as bound forms . Thus , Latin had definite-personal actors or goals in the finite verb-forms : amo I love , ' amas thou lovest , ' amat he ( she , it ) loves , ' amdmus we love , ' amatis ye love , ' amant they love , ' amor I am loved , ' amaris thou art loved , ' amdtur he ( she , it ) is loved , ' amdmur we are loved , ' amdmini ye are loved , ' amantur they are loved . ' Some languages , in the same way , include both actor and goal , as Cree : nisa:kiha:w I love him , ' nisa:kiha:wak I love them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' nisa:kihikuna:n he loves us ( excl. ) , ' kisa:kihitina:n we love thee , ' kisa:kihitin I love thee , ' and so on , through a large paradigm . Likewise , in Cree , the possessor of an object appears in a bound form : nitastutin my hat , ' kitastutin thy hat , ' utastutin his hat , ' and so on . In all these cases , the third-person bound form may stand in cross-reference with a noun antecedent : Latin pater amat father he-loves ; the father loves ' ( ? 12.9 ) . The personal-definite system may be elaborated by distinctions of identity and non-identity , such as the difference of me and myself , where the latter form implies identity with the actor ( I washed myself , ? 12.8 ) , or the Scandinavian hans his ' and sin his ( own ) . ' These differences appear also in bound forms , as in the obviative forms of Algonquian ( ? 12.8 ) ; similarly , ancient Greek , beside an ordinary bound actor , as in ' elowse he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actor is at the same time affected by the action : e'lowsato he washed himself ' or he washed for himself . ' Other specializations are less common ; thus , Cree , beside a verb with actor and goal , such as ninituma:w I ask for him , call him , ' ninitute:n I ask for it , ' and a form with actor and two goals , ninitutamawa:w I ask him for it , ' has also a form with actor , goal , and interested person ninitutamwa:n I ask for it , with reference to him , ' that is , for his use ' or at his behest . ' 15. 8 . Demonstrative or deictic substitution-types are based on relative nearness to the speaker or hearer . In English we have two such types , for nearer and for farther away ; they coincide with the values of the limiting adjectives this and that ( ? 12.14 ) . Demonstrative substitutes may be dependent ( that is , they may refer anaphorically to an antecedent speech-form that names the species ) , or independent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object within the ( named or unnamed ) species . Demonstrative pronoun substitution , in English , is made by the pronouns this , ( these ) , that ( those ) , which differ , by class-cleavage , from the limiting adjectives , or by phrases consisting of these limiting adjectives plus the anaphoric one ( ? 15.5 ) . These forms are not ordinarily used to replace personal nouns ? for the anticipatory use in This is my brother ; these are my brothers can not be viewed as personal . The dependent substitutes in the singular are this one , that one , and the independent this , that ; hence we have the distinction between , say , of these books , I like this one better than that one , but , of unnamed objects , I like this better than that . In the plural , however , these and those are in either case used without the anaphoric ones . In French we can see a more differentiated system . There are three types of demonstrative limitation and substitution : a general type from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adverbs ci si for nearer position and la la for farther away . The forms of the limiting adjective , the dependent , pronoun , and the independent pronoun , are distinct : Table  | Table Thus : cette plume-ci set plym si this pen , ' de ces deux plumes , je prefere celle-ci a celle-ld da se d ? plym , Za prefe:r sel si a sel la of these two pens , I prefer this one to that one ' ; but , of unnamed things , je prefere ceci a cela sa si a sa la I prefer this to that . ' The pronouns without ci and la are confined to certain constructions : de ces deux plumes , je prefere celle que vous avez sel ka vuz ave of these two pens , I prefer the one you have ' ; independent : c'est assez s et ase that 's enough . ' Demonstrative substitution-types are not always fully distinct from definite , and , similarly , demonstrative limiting modifiers may merge with mere definite markers of the type the . ' In German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose forms are used proclitically as a definite article , der Mann der ' man the man , ' and with accent as a demonstrative limiting adjective , der Mann ' de:r ' man that man , ' and as a pronoun , der ' de:r that one . ' This last use , in German , is but slightly distinguished from that of the definite pronoun er e:r he ' ; the chief difference , perhaps , is the use of der ( not er ) in the second of two paratactic full sentences : es war einmal ein Mann , der hatte drei Sohne es ' va:r ajnma:1 ajn ' man , de:r hate Idraj ' z ? : ne there was once a man , he ( literally , that-one ' ) had three sons . ' Many languages distinguish more types of demonstrative substitution ; thus , some English dialects add yon , for things farthest away , to the distinction of this and that . Latin had hic for things nearest the speaker , iste for those nearest the hearer ; and ille for those farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but doubles the number by distinguishing also between in sight ' and out of sight . ' Cree has awa this , ' anal that , ' and o:ja that recently present but now out of sight . ' Eskimo has a whole series : manna this one , ' anna that one in the north , ' qanna that one in the south , ' panna that one in the east , ' kanna that one down there , ' sanna that one down in the sea , ' iuIa that one , ' and so on . Outside of pronouns , we have the adverbial forms here : there , hither : thither , hence : thence , now : then ; the th-forms , however ,  | merge with simple anaphoric use , as in Going to the circus ? I 'm going there too . Similarly , so ( and archaically also thus ) is both demonstrative and , more usually , anaphoric ( I hope to do so ) . Forms like ( do it ) this way , this sort ( of thing ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between substitutes and ordinary linguistic forms . 15. 9 . Interrogative substitutes prompt the hearer to supply either the species or the identification of the individual ; in English , accordingly , interrogative substitutes occur only in supplement ; questions . Of pronouns , we have the independent who ? ( accusative whom ? ) for personals and what ? for non-personals ; these ask for both species and individual . For non-personals only we have also the independent which ? asking for identification of the individual object from a limited field , but not for the species . The dependent substitutes , asking for the identification of the individual from a limited field , are which one ? which ones ? Outside the pronouns , we have the interrogative substitutes where ? whither ? whence ? when ? how ? why ? Interrogative verb-substitutes occur in some languages , as in Menomini we ? se:kewIl what sort is he ? ' The limitation of interrogative forms to certain syntactic positions is quite common . Frequently we find them restricted to positions in the predicate of a binary sentence-type . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are those things ? are features of this kind . In present-day French , the nonpersonal quoi ? kwal , what ? ' is scarcely ever used as actor or goal , but instead , figures as a predicate complement , appearing in the j conjunct form que ko , as in qu'est-ce que c'est ? k e s ko s Ei what is it that this is ? what 's this ? ' and qu'est-ce qu'il a vu ? k e s k it a vyi , what is it that he has seen ? what did he see ? ' In some languages the interrogative substitutes are always predicates of equational sentences , as , in Tagalog , ' si:nu ark nagbi'gaj sa i'jul who the one-who-gave to you ? who gave it to you ? ' or , in Monomini awe : ? pe:muhneti , who the-one-walking-by ? who is walking there ? ' 15. 10 . The various possibilities of selecting individual objects from a species are represented by all manner of substitute-forms , especially of pronouns . In English , nearly all forms of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones ( ? 15.5 ) or of substantive uses , by class-cleavage , of the same words . Thera  | are many distinctions , not always rigidly carried out , between dependent and independent substitution , and in the latter , between personal and non-personal classes . The various limiting adjectives differ in treatment ; these differences add another line of classification among them ( ? 12.14 ) . ( 1 ) Some limiting adjectives are , like ordinary adjectives , followed by one , ones to form anaphoric substitutes . We have seen that this is the case of the singular this , that and , under certain conditions , of which ? what ? It is true also of each , every , whatever , whichever , and of the phrasal expressions many a , such a , what a . Thus , we say he was pleased with the children and gave each one a penny . As independent substitutes we use this , that , which , what , whichever , whatever of non-personals only ; corresponding to every , we have personal everybody , everyone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) We have both simple pronoun use or combination with the anaphoric ones , one , in the case of either , former , latter , last , neither , other , such , and the ordinals , first , second , etc . The variants differ chiefly in connotation . Thus , we say Here are the books ; take either ( one ) . The word other forms a special sub-class , in that it has a plural form , others : You keep this book and I 'll take the others ( the other ones ) . In independent use these words serve chiefly as nonpersonals. ( 3 ) The remaining limiting adjectives are peculiar in not taking the anaphoric one , ones . Thus , we say : Here are the books ; take one ( two , three , any , both , all , a few , some , and so on ) . The independent substitutes show great variety . Thus , all is used as a non-personal : All is not lost ; That 's all . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly knows what to say . Several form compounds for independent use , such as the personal somebody , someone , anybody , anyone and the non-personal something , anything . ( 4 ) Several limiting adjectives show an eccentric treatment . The article the with the anaphoric one , ones forms a dependent substitute , provided some other modifier follows : the one(s) on the table ; otherwise it does not appear in pronominal use , and the definite pronoun serves instead . The article a in combination with another adjective does not influence the treatment of the latter : many a one ; another ( one ) . Otherwise , the article a is accompanied by the anaphoric one only in the emphatic form not a one . All other pronominal uses show us one replacing a : to  | take an apple there corresponds the pronominal take one . The determiner no is paralleled by the dependent substitute none , but ordinarily we use instead the combination of not with any ( I did n't sec any ) ; the independent substitutes are the compounds nobody , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution-types , the negative is , of course , represented in all languages , and often shows special peculiarities ; to it belong also the non-pronominal nowhere , never , and sub-standard nohow . In many languages , as in most forms of sub-standard English , these substitutes are accompanied by the general negative adverb : I ca n't see nothing . The numerative types ( all , one , two , three , and so on ) seem also to be universal . As to the selective types , however , there is great room for variety ; other languages have substitution-types that are not exactly matched in English . Thus , Russian ' ne-xto someone ' implies that the speaker can ( but does not ) identify the individual ( someone told me the other day that . . . ' ) , while xto-ni-'but does not imply this ability ( ' there 's someone at the door ' ) . Still another type , ' koj-xto implies that a different individual is selected on different occasions ( ' now and then someone tries ' ) . 15. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; thus , we have seen that interrogative substitutes in English and many other languages are confined to certain positions in the sentence . Some languages have special pronouns for predicative use . Thus , in Menomini , beside such forms as nenah I , ' enuh that one ' ( animate ) , eneh that ' ( inanimate ) , there are parallel forms which occur only as predicates ; the normal substitute appears in kehke:nam eneh he-knows-it that ( thing ) ; he knows that , ' but the predicative form in ene ? ke:hkenah that ( thing ) that-which-he-knows ; that is what he knows , ' or , in enu ? ke:hkenah that ( person ) the-one-who-knows-it ; that one is the one who knows it . ' These predicative forms vary inflectionally for the same categories as a verb , such as interrogative enet ke:hkenah ? is it that which he knows ? is that the thing he knows ? ' or surprised present enesa ? ke:hkenah ! and so that is what he knows ! ' and so on . Our relative substitutes belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the substitute indicates that the phrase in which it figures is an included ( or completive ) form . In English , the phrase has the favorite full-sentence structure ( actor-action  | construction ) , and is marked by the relative substitute as not constituting a full sentence . Our relatives who ( whom ) , which , where , when , that differ from other substitutes by class-cleavage . They , or their immediate phrase , come first in the clause . We have , firstly , the anaphoric type , that , and personal who , non-personal which : the boy who ( that ) ran away , the book which ( that ) he read ; the house in which we lived . If the relative substitute fills in its clause the position of verbal goal , prepositional axis , or predicate complement , we have here also a zero-substitute : the man I saw , the house we lived in , the hero he was . In ordinary speech , English relative clauses identify the individual antecedent ; in more formal style we have also non-identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carrying a big bag , came up to the gate . In languages with case-forms , the inflection of the relative pronoun is normally determined by the forms in its clause : I saw the boy who ran away ; the boy whom I saw ran away . In Latin , a normal form would be in hac vita quam nunc ego deg() in this life which I now lead , ' where the antecedent , vita happens to be in the ablative case ( as axis of the preposition in ) , and the relative pronoun , quam which , ' in the accusative case , as goal of the verb dego . However , languages with complicated inflection now and then show attraction of the relative pronoun into an inflectional form that belongs properly to the antecedent : the Latin form vita in hac qua nunc ego dego , with the same denotation as the above normal form , has the relative pronoun qua in the ablative case , concording with the antecedent , instead of the accusative case demanded by its position in the clause . Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace an indication of species : take what(ever) you want ; ask whom(ever) you like ; whoever says so is mistaken . In English such clauses are used also as paratactic modifiers of a full sentence : whatever he says , I do n't believe him . The same difference between dependent and independent use appears in our adverbial substitutes : dependent the time ( when ) he did it ; the house where we lived ; independent we 'll see him when he gets here ; we visit them whenever we can ; we take them where(ver) we find them .  | FORM ? CLASSES AND LEXICON 16. 1 . The meaningful features of linguistic signaling are of two kinds : lexical forms , which consist of phonemes , and grammatical forms , which consist of tagmemes ( features of arrangement , ? 10.5 ) . If we extend the term lexical to cover all forms that can be stated in terms of phonemes , including even such forms as already contain some grammatical features ( e.g. poor John or duchess or ran ) , then the parallelism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terms like the following : ( 1 ) Smallest and meaningless unit of linguistic signaling : phememe ; ( a ) lexical : phoneme ; ( b ) grammatical : taxeme ; ( 2 ) Smallest meaningful unit of linguistic signaling : glosseme ; the meaning of a glosseme is a noeme ; ( a ) lexical : morpheme ; the meaning of a morpheme is a sememe ; ( b ) grammatical : tagmeme ; the meaning of a tagmeme is an episememe ; ( 3 ) Meaningful unit of linguistic signaling , smallest or complex : linguistic form ; the meaning of a linguistic form is a linguistic meaning ; ( a ) lexical : lexical form ; the meaning of a lexical form is a lexical meaning ; ( b ) grammatical : grammatical form ; the meaning of a grammatical form is a grammatical meaning . Every lexical form is connected in two directions with grammatical forms . On the one side , the lexical form , even when taken by itself , in the abstract , exhibits a meaningful grammatical structure . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction ( duchess , poor John ) , and if it is a morpheme , it may still exhibit morphologic features ( a modified morpheme , e.g. men or ran , ? 13.7 ) ; in an unmodified morpheme ( man , run ) we may view the absence of grammatical construction as a positive  | characteristic . On the other side , the lexical form in any actual utterance , as a concrete linguistic form , is always accompanied by some grammatical form : it appears in some function , and these privileges of occurrence make up , collectively , the grammatical function of the lexical form . The lexical form appears in certain sentence-types or , if it is a bound form , in none at all ; it appears in certain positions of certain constructions or , if it is an interjection , in few or none ; it appears as replaced form in certain substitutions , or , if it be a substitute , as substitute in certain substitutions . The functions of lexical forms are created by the taxemes of selection which help to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , belong to a common form-class . The functions of lexical forms appear as a very complex system . Some functions are common to a great number of forms and define a large form-class ; for instance , the functions which define the English form-class of substantive expressions ( serving in the sentence-type of call , filling the positions of actor with a verb , of goal with a verb , of axis with a preposition ; underlying a possessive adjective , and so on ) , are common to an almost unlimited number of words and phrases . Different functions may create overlapping form-classes ; thus , the function of filling the actor position is common to substantive expressions and to marked infinitive phrases ( to scold the boys would be foolish ) . Other functions may be limited to a very few lexical forms or to only a single one ; thus , phrases with the noun way as center seem to be the only substantive expressions which function as adverbs of manner , with the interrogative substitute how ? ( this way , the way I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by class-cleavage ( ? 12.14 ) exhibit unusual combinations of function . Thus , egg is in English a bounded noun , ( the egg , an egg ) but occurs also as a mass noun ( he spilled egg on his necktie ) . Salt is a mass noun and accordingly underlies a plural only in the specialized meaning kinds of , ' but , by class-cleavage , there is also a plural salts ( as in Epsom salts ) with the meaning consisting of particles , ' in a class with oats , grits , and the like . Man is a ( bounded , personal ) male noun ( a man , the man , . . . he ) , but by class-cleavage is treated also as a proper noun , parallel in this with God , as in man wants but little , man is a mammal . The word one by a complicated class-cleavage belongs to five form-classes : as a determiner ( ? 12.14 ) it fulfils the requirement that bounded singular nouns be preceded by a  | modifier of this class ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerative it occurs with the definite determiners ( the one man , this one book , my one friend ) ; it replaces a with anaphora of the noun ( ? 15.10 ) when no other modifier is present ( Here are some apples ; take one ) ; it occurs as an independent pronoun for any person in general ' and in this use is always atonic and underlies the derivatives one 's and oneself ( one ca n't help oneself ) ; finally , it is the anaphoric substitute for nouns after an adjective , and in this use forms a plural , ones ( the big box and the small one , these boxes and the ones in the kitchen , ? 15.5 ) . 16. 2 . The grammar of a language includes , then , a very complex set of habits ( taxemes of selection ) by which every lexical form is used only in certain conventional functions ; every lexical form is assigned always to the customary form-classes . To describe the grammar of a language , we have to state the form-classes of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers assign it to these form-classes . The traditional answer to this question appears in our school grammars , which try to define the form-classes by the classmeaning ? by the feature of meaning that is common to all the lexical forms in the form-class . The school grammar tells us , for instance , that a noun is " the name of a person , place , or thing . " This definition presupposes more philosophical and scientific knowledge than the human race can command , and implies , further , that , the form-classes of a language agree with the classifications that , would be made by a philosopher or scientist . Is fire , for instance , a thing ? For over a century physicists have believed it to be an action or process rather than a thing : under this view , the verb burn is more appropriate than the noun fire . Our language supplies the adjective hot , the noun heat , and the verb to heat , for what physicists believe to be a movement of particles ( molecules ) in a body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its meaning " more than one " ( person , place , or thing ) , but , who could gather from this that oats is a plural while wheat is a singular ? Class-meanings , like all other meanings , elude the linguist 's power of definition , and in general do not coincide with the meanings of strictly-defined technical terms . To accept definitions of meaning , which at best are makeshifts , in place of an identification in formal terms , is to abandon scientific discourse . Class-meanings are merely composites , or , one might say , great- est common factors , of the grammatical meanings which accompany the forms . To state a class-meaning is to find some formula that includes the grammatical meanings in which the forms occur . An English finite verb expression ( runs , ran away , is very kind , scolded the boys , and so on ) occurs only in one position of one construction , namely as action in the actor-action construction ( John ran away ) . Even when it is used alone , it appears only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor . Now , we can state the meaning of the actor-action construction very roughly as A performs B , ' where A is the nominative expression ( John ) and B the finite verb expression ( ran away ) . This statement defines for us the meanings of the two positions ; the meaning of the actor-position is performer of B , ' and that of the actionposition is performed by A. ' Therefore , since English finite verb expressions occur only and always in this latter position , their class-meaning is the same as that of their one position , namely , performed by an object . ' If we define the class-meaning of the larger form-class of verbs as action , ' then the class-meaning of English finite verb expressions is ( action ) performed by an actor . ' When a form-class has more than one function , its class-meaning is harder to state , but is still merely a derivative of the grammatical meanings in which the forms occur . English substantive expressions occur , for instance , in the position of actor in the actor-action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer of an action . ' They occur in the position of goal in the action-goal construction ( hit John ) , with a positional meaning something like undergoer of an action . ' They occur in the position of axis in the relation-axis construction ( beside John ) , with a positional meaning of , say , center from which a relation holds good . ' They occur in morphologic construction with the possessive suffix ( John 's ) , with the positional meaning of possessor . ' Without listing all the other functions of English substantive expressions , we can say that the class-meaning common to all the lexical forms in this form-class is that which can be the performer of an action , the undergoer of an action , the center from which a relation holds good , the possessor of objects , ' and so on . Whether we can sum this up in a shorter formula , depends upon our resources of terminology ; for instance , we can sum up the class-meaning just given , under the term object . ' These instances suffice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as a basis for our work , but only vague situational features , undefinable in terms of our science . The people who speak English and keep their substantive expressions within the accepted functions , do not guide themselves by deciding whether each lexical form denotes an object . Formclasses , like other linguistic phenomena , can be defined , not i n terms of meaning , but only in terms of linguistic ( that is , lexicaI or grammatical ) features . 16. 3 . The form-class of a lexical form is determined for the speakers ( and consequently for the relevant description of a language ) by the structure and constituents of the form , by the inclusion of a special constituent ( a marker ) , or by the identity of the form itself . ( 1 ) A complex form is usually assigned to a form-class by its structure and constituents . An endocentric phrase , for instance , such as fresh milk , belongs to the same form-class as its head or center ( ? 12.10 ) . An exocentric phrase , such as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our example , the preposition in ) which determines its form-class . Thus , the formclass of a phrase is usually determined , at bottom , by the formclass of one or more of the included words . For this reason the speaker ( and the grammarian ) need not deal separately with each phrase ; the form-class of almost any phrase is known if we know the syntactic constructions and the form-classes of words . The form-classes of words are therefore fundamental for syntax . Our school grammar recognizes this : it tries , by a mistaken method , to be sure , to determine the form-classes of words , particularly the most inclusive of these form-classes ( parts of speech ) , and then shows how phrases are constructed . ( 2 ) Sometimes the function of a phrase is determined by somespecial constituent , a marker . For instance , in English , a phrase consisting of the preposition to and an infinitive expression , belongs to the special form-class of marked infinitive phrases , whose function differs from that of unmarked infinitive expressions , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and as attributes of nouns , verbs , and adjectives ( a chance to go ; he hopes to go ; glad to go ) . The determining adjectives form noun phrases which are distinguished by closure : this fresh milk can not take adjective modifiers as can fresh milk or milk ( ? 12.10 ) . Whenever a form-class of small extent determines a peculiar function in phrases , we may  | regard its forms as markers . Thus , our determining adjectives , our prepositions , our co-ordinating conjunctions , and our subordinating conjunctions , may be viewed as markers ; they are small form-classes , and the presence of any of their forms in a phrase determines something about the form-class of this phrase . Other examples of markers are the particles of Chinese or Tagalog ( ? 12.13 ) . ( 3 ) Finally , lexical forms may belong arbitrarily or irregularly to a form-class that is indicated neither by their structure nor by a marker . For instance , the phrase in case has the structure of preposition plus substantive and yet serves as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wait for him . The phrases this way , that way , the other way , the same way have substantive structure , but are used as verb-modifiers of the special sub-class ( manner ) that has the interrogative substitute how ? Similarly , quite a few English nouns and noun phrases serve as verb-modifiers in the when ? class , either alone or in phrases : Sunday , last winter , tomorrow morning . The form-classes of English words are largely arbitrary : there is nothing to tell us that man , boy , lad , son , father are male nouns , that run , bother are verbs , that sad , red , green are adjectives , and so on . In particular , of course , the form-class of every morpheme is arbitrarily determined . A complete description of a language will list every form whose function is not determined either by structure or by a marker ; it will include , accordingly , a lexicon , or list of morphemes , which indicates the form-class of each morpheme , as well as lists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 16. 4 . Form-classes are not mutually exclusive , but cross each other and overlap and are included one within the other , and so on . Thus , in English , the nominative expressions ( which serve as actors ) include both substantives and marked infinitives ( to scold the boys would be foolish ) . On the other hand , among the substantives are some pronoun-forms which , by over-differentiation , do not serve as actors : me , us , him , her , them , whom . One group of substantives , the gerunds ( scolding ) , belongs to a form-class with infinitives and with other verb-forms , in serving as head for certain types of modifiers , such as a goal ( scolding the boys ) . For this reason a system of parts of speech in a language like English can not be set up in any fully satisfactory way : our list of parts of speech will depend upon which functions we take to be the most important .  | One can often distinguish , however , between great form-classes like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose , tooth or of ox ( with irregular plural-forms ) . Large form-classes which completely subdivide either the whole lexicon or some important form-class into form-classes of approximately equal size , are caller I categories . Thus , the English parts of speech ( substantive , verb , adjective , and so on ) are categories of our language . So are singular and plural substantives , since these two form-classes , of approximately equal size , completely subdivide the form-class of substantives . In general , inflectional forms , what with the parallel occurrence in every paradigm , represent categories ? for instance , the various forms of the verb-paradigm , including the congruenceforms of finite verbs ( am : is : are or was : were ) and , crossing these , the tenses and modes of finite verbs ( he is : he was : he were ) . Not all categories , however , are inflectional . The selection of the pronouns he versus she divides our personal nouns into the categories of male and female ; yet there is no inflection or regular derivation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( count : countess , Paul : Pauline , Albert : Alberta ) or of entirely irregular derivation ( duck : drake , goose : gander ) or of composition ( he-goat , billy-goat , bull-buffalo ) or suppletion ( son : daughter , ram : ewe ) or merely class-cleavage ( a teacher . . . he ; a teacher . . . she ; Francis : Frances ) . Again , some categories are syntactic , and appear not in inflection , but in phrases . Such are the categories of indefinite and definite substantives ( a book : the book ) , or , in our verbs , the aspects ( wrote : was writing ) , completion ( wrote : had written ) , or voice ( wrote : was written ) . The categories of a language , especially those which affect morphology ( book : books , he : she ) , are so pervasive that anyone who reflects upon his language at all , is sure to notice them . In the ordinary case , this person , knowing only his native language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake his categories for universal forms of speech , or of " human thought , " or of the universe itself . This is why a good deal of what passes for " logic " or " metaphysics " is merely an incompetent restating of the chief categories of the philosopher 's language . A task for linguists of the future will be to compare the categories of different languages and see what features are universal or at least widespread . Thus , a form-class comparable to our substantive expressions , with a  | class-meaning something like object , ' seems to exist everywhere , though in many languages it is not an arbitrary class , like our substantive part of speech , but depends largely upon the presence of markers , as in Malayan or Chinese ( ? 12.13 ) . 16. 5 . Our knowledge of the practical world may show that some linguistic categories agree with classes of real things . It may be , for instance , that our non-linguistic world consists of objects , actions , qualities , manners , and relations , comparable with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our language . In this case it would still be true , however , that many other languages do not recognize these classes in their part-ofspeech system . Moreover , we should still have to determine the English parts of speech not by their correspondence with different aspects of the practical world , but merely by their functions in English syntax . This appears plainly in the circumstance that languages with an elaborate part-of-speech system always contain abstract forms ; they have parallel forms with the same lexical meaning for use in different syntactic positions . Thus , a verb like run or an adjective like smooth can not serve as an actor , but we have for this function the abstract noun forms run ( as in the run will warm you up ) and smoothness . It is an error to suppose that abstract forms like these occur only in the languages of literate peoples ; they occur in all languages that limit different form-classes to different syntactic positions . Linguistic categories , then , can not be defined in philosophical terms ; having defined them in formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . To show this , we need only glance at some of the more familiar categories . Number , as it appears in our singulars and plurals , seems to be close to some universal trait of human response ; yet , cases like oats versus wheat , or Epsom salts versus table salt , seem to have little non-linguistic justification . The categories of gender in English are close to our non-linguistic recognition of personality and sex , but even here some animals ( the bull . . . he or it ) and other things ( the good ship . . . she or it ) are variously treated . The gender-categories of most IndoEuropean languages , such as the two of French or the three of German ( ? 12.7 ) , do not agree with anything in the practical world , and this is true of most such classes . In the Algonquian languages ,  | all persons and animals belong to one category , an ' animate ' gender , but so do some other objects , such as ' raspberry , ' ' ket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other objects ( including , for instance , ' strawberry ' ' bowl , ' ' elbow ' ) belong to the other , ' inanimate ' gender . Sonro of the Bantu languages run up to as high as twenty such classes ; distinctions of number , however , are merged with the genderclassification . Case-categories , ranging from two , as in English ( he : him ) , up to twenty or so , as in Finnish , resemble various situations of t Irr practical world , but never with any consistency . Thus , in German , the goal of a verb is in the accusative case , as in er bat mich Ie:r ' ba:t mix ' he asked me ( for something ) , ' but certain verbs haver it in the dative case , as er dankte mir e:r ' dalkte mi:r ' he thanked me ' ; compare the Latin examples in ? 12.8 . The categories of tense have a surface rationality , especially in ri language like Latin , which distinguishes present ( cantat ' he sings ' ) , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cantdbit ' he will sing ' ) , but even here one soon finds that these categories disagree with our non-linguistic analysis : the " historical present " is used in I.:r1 in , as in English , of past events , and the meanings of the Latin tenseforms are mixed up with considerations other than relative time , The English categories of aspect distinguish between ' punctual ' action ( some grammarians call it ' perfective ' ) , envisaged as a unit ( he wrote the letter ) , and ' durative ' action ( some call it ' imperfeetive ' ) , which extends over a segment of time during which of Irer things can happen ( he was writing the letter ) . This distinction is nt best hard to define for the practical world , and in English suffers marked dislocations ; some verbs , for instance , appear persistently in punctual form ( I think he is there ; he is funny ) and are durat ivn only in special constructions or meanings ( I am thinking of him ; he is being funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects as English , certain verbs , such as ' eat ' and ' drink , ' appear per . sistently in durative form . A common verb-category that is lacking in English , is iteration , which distinguishes between an action occurring once and a ix% peated action , as , in Russian on be'al do'moj ' he was running home ' ( on one particular occasion ) and on ' begal do'moj ' h ? ran home ; he was running home ' ( repeatedly , e.g. every day ) . ' ' In English , iteration plays no part in the verb-form : he played tennis every r ( punctual ) and he was playing tennis every day ( durative ) are like he played a set  | Perfection contrasts contemporary , ' imperfectic ' action with ' perfectic ' action , whose effect is contemporary : he writes versus he has written ; he is writing versus he has been writing ; he wrote versus he had written ; he was writing versus he had been writing . The difference is scarcely definable in terms of practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has many modes , distinguishing various approaches of an action to its actual occurrence . Morphologically , English distinguishes between ' real ' ( he is here ) and ' unreal ' ( if he were here ) ; syntactically , English recognizes a whole series by the peculiarity of certain irregular ( auxiliary ' ) verbs which are followed by an infinitive without to : he will write , shall write , can write , must write , may write . We may observe that in these combinations the infinitive is rather persistently punctual , and only now and then durative ( I shall be writing ) ; in Russian , the future tense , which corresponds fairly well to our shall and will phrases , distinguishes aspect just as exactly as do the present and past tenses . The uses of different modes are tied up in many languages with differences of syntactic position and congruence . In English , for instance , the unreal appears only in clauses introduced by if or though , or in combination with the phrasal mode-forms ( he would help us , unreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the uses of the various modes of other languages , as , in French , je pense qu'il vient Za pa ? s k i vje ? ' I think he is coming , ' with the verb of the clause in the ' indicative ' ( actual ) mode , but je ne pense pas qu'il vienne Zo n pa ? s pa k i vjcn ' I do n't think he is coming , ' with the verb of the clause in the ' subjunctive ' ( possible ) mode . 16. 6 . We saw in ? 16.3 that the function of some forms is determined by their constituents or their construction . Any function that is so determined is said to be regular , and a function which is not so determined is said to be irregular . Thus , if we know that the words fox and ox are singular common nouns , wavering between non-personal and male personal gender , then we can say that fox has the regular function of combining with the pluralsuffix - ez in the form foxes ( since this function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that ox has the irregular tennis ( punctual ) and he was playing a set of tennis ( durative ) . In Latin , French , and modern Greek , repeated action and durative action are merged in one class : Prench it ecrivait it ekrive is both ' he was writing ' and ' he wrote ( repeatedly ) ; he used to write . ' In Russian , repeated actions are classed as durative , but , within the durative class , are distinct , at least for certain verbs , from single actions .  | function of combining with the plural-suffix -n . Linguists usually apply the terms regular and irregular to the form itself , saying , for instance , that the noun fox is regular and the noun ox irregular ; we must specify , of course , the function with respect to which these terms hold good , since in their other functions the nouns fur and ox are quite alike . By another extension of these terms , linguists apply them also to the resultant forms in which the functions appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is regular and the plural noun oxen irregular . The speaker can use a form in a regular function even when ho has never heard the resultant form : he may utter a form like foxes , for instance , even when he has never heard this particular plural . He can use a form in an irregular function only if he has heard it , used in this function : the form oxen is uttered only by speakers who have heard it from other speakers . In the description of it language , accordingly , regular functions are stated for whole formclasses , in the mass : we can state the regular plural-formation of English nouns without attempting to list all the nouns in the language . Irregular functions , on the other hand , force us to list all the forms of the class : ' we have to mention the noun ox as taking - en in the plural , and the nouns foot , tooth , goose as taking substitution of ij in the plural , and so on . If we insist on this distinction , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having heard it , is regular in its immediate constitution and embodies regular functions of its constituents , and any form which a speaker can utter only after he has heard it from other speakers , is irregular . Strictly speaking , then , every morpheme of a language is an irregularity , since the speaker can use it only after hearing it used , and the reader of a linguistic description can know of its existence only if it is listed for him . The lexicon is really an appendix of the grammar , a list , of basic irregularities . This is all the more evident if meanings are taken into consideration , since the meaning of each morpheme belongs to it by an arbitrary tradition . In a language like English , where each morpheme is arbitrarily assigned to some grammatical class , this feature also is an irregularity : the speaker must learn from experience and the describer must list the fact that pin is a noun , spin a verb , thin an adjective , in a preposition , and so on . This task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists only the kinds of irregularity that are not present in all  | the morphemes of a language , and the terms regular and irregular are used only of features that appear in the grammar . If we make this restriction , it is obvious that most speech-forms are regular , in the sense that the speaker who knows the constituents and the grammatical pattern , can utter them without . ever having heard them ; moreover , the observer can not hope to list them , since the possibilities of combination are practically infinite . For instance , the classes of nominative expressions and finite verb expressions in English are so large that many possible actoraction forms ? say , a red-headed plumber bought five oranges ? may never before have been uttered ; by the same token , however , we can not be sure that this is true of any particular combination which we may chance to hear . A grammatical pattern ( sentencetype , construction , or substitution ) is often called an analogy . A regular analogy permits a speaker to utter speech-forms which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analogy of similar forms which he has heard . An irregular analogy , on the other hand , may cover a number of forms , but a speaker will rarely utter a new form on the analogy of those which he has heard . For instance , the phrases at least , at most , at best , at worst , at first , at last are built up on the same pattern ( at plus adjective in - st ) , but the analogy is limited to a very few forms . In at all ( where the adjective does not end in - st and the sandhi is irregular ) or in do n't we have a unique analogy . When the automobile came into use , one speaker was as well able as another to form the compound automobile-driver , on the analogy of cab-driver , truck-driver , and so on ; a compound like cranberry , on the other hand , with its unique first member , is uttered only by speakers who have heard it . If we take meanings into consideration , we can say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species of bird to which it customarily applies , for the compound bears this meaning by an arbitrary tradition . A form like charlestoner one who performs the dance called charleston ' is formed on the regular analogy of dancer , waltzer , two-stepper , and so on ; a form like duchess ( ? 10.6 ) is unique . On the border-line we have cases like the feminines in - ess , which on the whole are limited to traditional forms : we say poetess , sculptress , but not *paintress ; occasionally , however , a speaker will extend this analogy , uttering such forms as , say , profiteeress , swindleress . Even our root-forming morphemes ( ? 14.9 ) have some flexibility ; hear- ing a form like squunch in a meaning step with suction-noise on wet ground , ' we can not tell whether the speaker has heard it or is using the analogy of skw- , as in squirt , squash , and - one , as in crunch . The regular analogies of a language are habits of substitution . Suppose , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orange , but that he had heard or spoken a set of forms like the following : Baby is hungry . Poor Baby ! Baby 's orange . Give Baby the orange : ! Papa is hungry . Poor Papa ! Papa 's orange . Give Papa the orange ! Bill is hungry . Poor Bill ! Bill 's orange . Give Bill the orange ! Annie is hungry . Poor Annie ! Annie 's orange He has the habit , now , ? the analogy , ? of using Annie in the same positions as Baby , Papa , Bill , and accordingly , in the proper situation , will utter the new form Give Annie the orange ! When a speaker utters a complex form , we are in most cases unable to tell whether he has heard it before or has created it on the analogy of other forms . The utterance of a form on the analogy of other forms is like the solving of a proportional equation with an indefinitely large set of ratios on the left-hand side : Table 16. 7 . The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tagmemes ( sentence-types , constructions , and substitutions ) . The number of morphemes and tagmemes in any language runs well into the thousands . In every language , moreover , many complex forms carry specialized meanings which can not figure in a purely linguistic description but are practically of great importance . The linguist can determine , for instance , that English compounds of the type blackbird , bluebird , whitefish , or phrases of the type give out , fall out , throw up , bear specialized meanings , but he can not evaluate these meanings , although in practical life they are fully as useful as any sememe.  | Popularly , the wealth of a language is supposed to depend upon the number of different words which it uses , but this number is indeterminate , since words are freely formed according to the analogies of morphologic construction . For instance , having counted play , player , and dance , shall we count dancer as a fourth word , even though it contains no additional glosseme ? If so , then the number of words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Shakspere used 20,000 different words in his writings , and Milton in his poems some 8,000 , we mistakenly conclude that less eloquent speakers use far fewer . It is an indication of Shakspere 's genius that he used so many different words in so small a volume of speech as is contained in his works , but this volume of speech is small compared to the amount which even a taciturn person will utter in the course of a year . The myths about peasants , workingmen , or savages who use only a few hundred words have no foundation in fact ; in so far as one can count words ( ignoring , for instance , the inflected forms of a language like ours ) , every adult speaker uses at least somewhere round 20,000 to 30,000 words ; if he is educated ? that is , if he knows technical and learned words ? he uses many more . Everyone , moreover , understands more words than he uses . The relative frequency of the various lexical and grammatical units ( morphemes and tagmemes ) in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal utterances . In the next chapters we shall see that our lack of such records is one of the impediments to the historical study of language ? for fluctuations in the frequency of glossemes play an important part in the changes that occur in every language . The frequency of most lexical forms is doubtless subject to a great deal of superficial fluctuation , according to the practical circumstances . A word like thimble , say , or stove , might not occur at all in long stretches of speech ; yet such forms as these are used by everyone when the occasion presents itself . The most frequent forms , on the other hand , both lexical and , especially , grammatical , are constantly demanded by the structure of the language . Such counting as has been done has been confined to words . It is found that the commonest words ( the , to , is , etc. ) make up a consistently high percentage of what is spoken . 16. 8 . The practical question as to what things can be said in different languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories . One language will use a phrase where another uses a single word and still another a bound form . A meaning that is categoric in one language ( as , for instance , plurality of objects in English ) may appear only under particular practical stimuli in another language . As to denotation , whatever can he said in one language can doubtless be said in any other : the difference will concern only the structure of the forms , and their connotation . What one language expresses by a single morpheme will in another language require perhaps a long phrase ; what one language says in a word may appear in another language tus a phrase or as an affix . Elements of meaning that appear in one language because they belong to some category , even though they are irrelevant to the practical situation , will be absent in another language . In English we say Pike 's Peak is high with a presenttense verb ; in Chinese or in Russian there would be no presenttense element in a similar message . It is a striking fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different languages , differ vastly in practical value . This is true even of closely related languages . Where we say ride , German says reiten ' rajten for riding on an animal , but fahren ' fa:ren for other kinds of riding , as in a vehicle . Where we say on , German says auf when the force of gravity helps the contact , as in on the table , ' but otherwise an , as in on the wall . ' Our morning matches the French matin mates , except when tilt morning is viewed as a segment of time during which something else can happen , as in I slept all morning ' or during the morning ' ; in this case French uses a derivative matinee matine . Even things which are easily defined and classified , receive the most diverse treatment in different languages . Nothing could be more definite than terms for simple biological relationship between persons . Yet , beside words corresponding to our brother and sister , German has a plural Geschwister ge'svister that includes both sexes , as in Wieviele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha:ben zi : ? , ' How many brothers and ( or ) sisters have you ? ' Some languages have here one word , regardless of gender , as Tagalog kapa'tid ; our brother corresponds to a Tagalog phrase kapa'tid na la'la:ki , where the last word means male , ' and our sister to kapa'tid na ba'ba:ji , with the attribute female . ' On the other hand , some languages insist upon relative age : Chinese ' kol kol elder brother , ' ' cjurjl ti4 younger brother , ' ' eje3 cje3 elder sister , '  | ' mej4 mej 4 younger sister . ' An even more complicated terminology appears in Menomini , which we can best elucidate if we use the term sibling to mean brother or sister . ' In Menomini the terms are ne ? neh my elder brother , ' neme:h my elder sister , ' nehse:h my younger sibling , ' neko : ? semaw my sibling of opposite sex ' ( i.e. my brother ' when a woman says it , my sister ' when a man says it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne:tekeh my sister ( woman speaking ) . ' The general term ni:tesjanak my siblings ' is used in the plural when the siblings are of both sexes and not all younger than the possessor . Terms of relationship not only vary as in the above examples , but also are used in situations that one can not define . The Menomini terms for brother ' and sister ' are used also for cousins , provided the related parents are of the same sex : a man says ne:hkah of his father 's brother 's son , and so on . Moreover , these and some other terms are inherited : my father 's brother 's son 's son is also ne:hkah . Consequently , the meaning really hinges on the consistency with which these relationships are remembered and recognized . In the same way , plant-names , for example , are perhaps nowhere used in a way that would be consistent with a botanist 's classification ? even aside from such vague terms as tree , shrub , bush , herb , reed , grass . Even in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviations . Our system of decimal numbers ( twenty-two , thirty five , etc. ) shows traces of a duodecimal or twelves system ( eleven , twelve instead of *one-teen , *two-teen ) . Other irregularities are formal , as two : twenty : second : half , or three : thirteen , thirty , third . Furthermore , the connotation of certain numbers like three , seven , thirteen , and of additional terms like dozen , score , gross , can not be stated mathematically . In Danish there is an admixture of a vigesimal or twenties system . In French one counts from sixty ' to seventy-nine ' without a special word for the intervening multiple of ten : seventy ' is soixante-dix swasant-dis sixty-ten ' ; seventy-one ' is soixante et onze swasant e onz sixty and eleven , ' and so on ; eighty ' is quatre-vingt katra veil four-twenties , ' and then one counts up twenty more to reach one-hundred ; thus , ninety-two ' is quatre-vingt douze katra veil du:z four-twentiestwelve . ' Peoples who have little use for higher numbers may use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by simple  | numbers only to three , ' and to use two and two ' for four , ' and so on . In other spheres which are subject to scientific analysis , this may still provide no gauge for the linguistic classification . Color , for instance , is a matter of frequency of refracted or reflected lightwaves . The visible spectrum is an unbroken scale of frequencies . Different languages use different color-names ( such as our red , orange , yellow , green , blue , violet , ? 9.1 ) for different parts of this scale . We should have a hard time deciding at what points on the actual scale the domain of each English color-name begins and ends . If we showed people colors in minute grades of variety , we should find that between ' the frequencies which were named consistently , say , as yellow and as green , there would be a border-zone , where the naming wavered . If we went outside the European culture-sphere , we should find entirely different distributions . For most of our meanings we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which relate to social behavior , such as love , friend , kind , hate could be defined in terms of ethnology , folklore , and sociology , provided these studies had reached a perfection and accuracy undreamed of today . Terms which relate to states of the speaker 's body that are perceptible only to him , such as queasy , qualmish , sad , gay , glad , happy , could be defined only if we had a minute knowledge of what goes on inside a living person 's body . Even all this would not suffice for linguistic meanings that have less practical bearing , such as categories of noun-gender or verbal aspect . There seems to be no practical criterion by which the gender of a noun in German , French , or Latin could be determined : to define the meaning of the episememe masculine ' in such a language would be simply to list the markers of masculine nouns and the nouns that belong arbitrarily to the class , and to say that whatever is common , in the practical world , to all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender-category . The same is true of the verbal aspects of English : the difference between wrote and was writing is so elusive and differs so much for different verbs and in different phrases , that the definer , after stating the main principles , can not do better than to resort to a demonstration by means of examples .  | WRITTEN RECORDS 17. 1 . The language of any speech-community appears to an observer as a complicated signaling-system , of the kind that has occupied us in the preceding chapters of this book . A language presents itself to us , at any one moment , as a stable structure of lexical and grammatical habits . This , however , is an illusion . Every language is undergoing , at all times , a slow but unceasing process of linguistic change . We have direct evidence of this change in the case of communities which possess written records of their earlier speech . The English of the King James Bible or of Shakspere is unlike the English of today . The fourteenth-century English of Chaucer is intelligible to us only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Alfred the Great , of which we have contemporary manuscript records , seems to us like a foreign language ; if we could meet English-speakers of that time , we should not understand their speech , or they ours . The speed of linguistic change can not be stated in absolute terms . A speaker has no difficulty , in youth , in conversing with his grandparents , or , in age , in conversing with his grandchildren , yet a thousand years ? say , thirty to forty generations ? have sufficed to change the English language to the extent we have just indicated . During these generations , it must have seemed to each London-English mother that her children were learning to speak the same kind of English as she had learned in her infancy . Linguistic change is far more rapid than biological change , but probably slower than the changes in other human institutions . T , ingjiistic change interestsus especially because it offers the only po ibiiitX of explaining the phenomenaoflanguage . Speakers acquire their habits from earlier speakers ; the only explanation of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we ask , for instance , why present-day speakers use the form dog for the animal canis domesticus , ' or , let us say , why they add the suffix - ez , z , -s to derive plural from singular nouns , the obvious  | answer is that they acquired these habits , in infancy , from the older people round them ; if we then ask the same questions about the habits of these older people , we are referred to the habits of still older people , and so on , back into time , without limit . If we could realize our diagram of density of communication ( ? 3.4 ) , in which every speaker was represented by a dot and every utterance by an arrow from the dot that represented the speaker to the dot or dots that represented the hearer or hearers , we should find that the network reached indefinitely back into time . In the normal case , then , the explanation for a speech-habit is simply the existence of the same habit at an earlier time . Where linguistic change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the existence of some other habit at an earlier time , plus the occurrence of the change . Our lexical habit , for instance , of using the word meat edible flesh , ' is not very old ; a few centuries ago , the word flesh was used in this meaning , and the word meat meant : food . ' The explanation of our present-day habit , in this case , consists in ( 1 ) the earlier habit , and ( 2 ) the intervening change . Since linguistic change never stops , it sooner or later affects every habit in a language ; if we know enough of the speech of the past , the second type of explanation will apply to every present-day speech-form . Since written records give us direct information about the speech-habits of the past , the first step in the study of linguistic change , wherever we have written records , is the study of these records . We today are so used to reading and writing that we often confuse these activities with language itself ( ? 2.1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use for any considerable length of time in only a few speech-communities , and even in these its use has been confined , until quite recently , to a very few persons . A speech-utterance is the same , whether it receives a written record or not , and , in principle , a language is the same , regardless of the extent to which speech-utterances of this language are recorded in writing . For the linguist , writing is , except for certain matters of detail , merely an external device , like the use of the phonograph , which happens to preserve for our observation some features of the speech of past times . 17. 2 . Writing is an outgrowth of drawing . Probably all peoples make pictures by painting , drawing , scratching , or carving . These  | pictures , aside from other uses ( ? 2.9 ) , sometimes serve as messages or reminders ? that is , they modify the conduct of the beholder ? and they may be persistently used in this way . The Indians of North America are skilful draftsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . Thus , we are told of an Ojibwa Indian who owned a long strip of birch-bark with a series of pictures , which he used to remind himself of the succession of verses in a sacred song . The third picture , for instance , represents a fox , because the third verse of the song says something about a fox , and the sixth picture represents an owl , because the sixth verse says , " It is an ill omen . " A Mandan Indian sent the following picture to a fur-trader : in the center are two crossed lines ; at one side of these lines are outline drawings of a gun and of a beaver , with twenty-nine parallel strokes above the picture of the beaver ; at the other side of the crossed lines are drawings of a fisher , an otter , and a buffalo . This means : " I am ready to trade a fisher-skin , an otter-skin , and a buffalo-hide for a gun and thirty beaver-pelts . " Records and messages of this sort are usually spoken of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The records and messages , like writing , have the advantage of being permanent and transportable , but they fall short of writing in accuracy , since they bear no fixed relation to linguistic forms and accordingly do not share in the delicate adjustment of the latter . We have no record of any people 's progress from this use of pictures to the use of real writing , and can only guess at the steps . In the use of pictures we can often see the beginnings of the transition , and traces of it remain in the actual systems of writing . Real writing uses a limited number of conventional symbols . We must suppose , therefore , that in the transition the pictures became conventionalized . The way of outlining each animal , for instance , becomes so fixed that even a very imperfect sketch leaves no doubt as to the species of animal . To some degree this is true of the pictures of American Indians . In actual systems of writing we often find symbols which still betray this origin . In the so-called hieroglyphic writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but realistic pictures , and many of them actually denote the name of the object which they represent ; thus , the picture of a goose ( drawn always in the same way ) denotes the  | word s ? ' which means goose . ' In Chinese writing , some of the symbols , such as , for instance , the symbol for the word in:t ' horse , ' still resemble a picture of the meaning of the word , and this is sometimes true of the older shapes of characters whose modern form shows no such resemblance . When the picture has become rigidly conventionalized , we may call it a character . A character is a uniform mark or set of marks which people produce under certain conditions and to which , accordingly , they respond in a certain way . Once this habit is established , the resemblance of the character to any particular object is of secondary importance , and may be obliterated by changes in the convention of forming the character . These changes are often due to the nature of the writing-materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Mesopot amian peoples still betray their origin in pictures , but for the most part this is not the case : the characters consist of longer and shorter wedge-shaped strokes in various arrangements , and evidently got this shape because they were scratched into tough clay . In t ho hieroglyphic writing of ancient Egypt the characters were carefully painted , but for rapid writing with a reed brush on papyrus the Egyptians developed a simplified and rounded version ( known as hieratic writing ) whose characters have lost all resemblance to pictures . Our own writing is ultimately derived from the ancient . Egyptian , but no one could recognize pictures in our letters ; as it matter of fact , our letter F still has the two horns of the snail which was pictured in the hieroglyphic ancestor of this letter . The other , more important phase of the transition from the use of pictures to real writing , is the association of the characters wit h linguistic forms . Most situations contain features that do not lend themselves to picturing ; the picture-user resorts to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , we saw the Indian drawing twenty-nine strokes above his beaver to represent the number of beaver-pelts . Instead of depicting the process of exchange by a series of pictures , he represented it by two crossed lines with the sets of traded objects at either side . The Ojibwa represented " ill omen " by an owl , in accordance , no doubt , wit h some tribal belief . When the picture-user was confronted by a problem of this kind , we may suppose that he actually spoke to himself , and tried out We do not know the vowel sounds of ancient Egyptian .  | various wordings of the troublesome message . Language , after all , is our one way of communicating the kind of things that do not lend themselves to drawing . If we make this supposition , we can understand that the picture-users might , in time , arrange the characters in the order of the spoken words of their language , and that they might develop a convention of representing every part ? say , every word ? of the spoken utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of this transition : real writing presupposes it . In real writing , some characters have a twofold value , for they represent both a picturable object and a phonetic or linguistic form ; other characters , having lost their pictorial value , represent only a phonetic or linguistic form ; purely pictorial characters that are not associated with speech-forms sink into subsidiary use . The linguistic value predominates more and more , especially as the characters become conventionalized in shape , losing their resemblance to pictured objects . The characters become symbols ? that is marks or groups of marks that conventionally represent some linguistic form . A symbol " represents " a linguistic form in the sense that people write the symbol in situations where they utter the linguistic form , and respond to the symbol as they respond to the hearing of the linguistic form . Actually , the writer utters the speech-form before or during the act of writing and the hearer utters it in the act of reading ; only after considerable practice do we succeed in making these speech-movements inaudible and inconspicuous . 17. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are first symbolized in writing . Systems of writing which use a symbol for each word of the spoken utterance , are known by the misleading name of ideographic writing . The important thing about writing is precisely this , that the characters represent not features of the practical world ( " ideas " ) , but features of the writers ' language ; a better name , accordingly , would be word-writing or logographic writing . The main difficulty about logographic writing is the providing of symbols for words whose meaning does not lend itself to pictorial representation . Thus , the Egyptians used a character that represented a tadpole , to symbolize a word that meant onehundred thousand , ' presumably because tadpoles were very numerous in the swamps . The Chinese symbol for the word
