Such unseemly things as rubber checks , accusations of " goldbricking " and confessions in the attorney general 's office seemed as far away as the man in the moon when last month a dignified , well-printed and well-written new business weekly called The Financial Observer appeared in Manhattan 's downtown section ( TIME , Feb. 15 ) . At $10 a year , The Financial Observer booked 1,000 subscribers , among them J. P. Morgan . Newsstand sales went to 9,000 a week . Backer of the Observer was one John Bruce Heath . His respectable and even eminent staff* understood John Bruce Heath was a ; big capitalist from Canada . Actually this compelling little personage with a soft voice and wonderfully persuasive eyes was not John Bruce Heath at all but John Neville . He had been jailed for fraud in Illinois , was wanted by the police of Boston , where he had mulcted various people of some $100,000 to start his financial sheet . Like Boston 's Charles Ponzi , he promised huge returns on funds entrusted to him for reinvestment , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims , who then hurried to pile in more &; more . But none of these outrageous facts was known to the Observer 's subscribers until last week . <P> The bad news began to break when an $8,500 Observer check for advertising promotion " bounced " from Manhattan 's Chemical Bank &; Trust Co . Since Mr. Heath had functioned as treasurer of Observer Co. , up to this point not a soul had suspected that the paper 's books would not bear auditing . Headed by Managing Director Eugene MacLean , onetime Washington Post general manager , the Observer editors promptly asked a court for an assignee to preserve the weekly 's remaining assets . Next thing the staff knew , New York State Assistant Attorney General Bernard Abramson was in the office on " an anonymous tip " looking over the ledgers , and shaking his head at what he saw . Neville , who had not been seen for several days , was soon found and arrested . He confessed his peculations to Mr. Abramson , exonerated all his Manhattan and Boston associates . By week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grand larceny , and the year 's prize story for crooked publishing was ready for an airing . <P> The financial flight which was thus arrested in mid-career began late in 1935 when Neville , who first had police trouble in 1926 , met grey-haired , respectable Miss Cecilia M. Bainton , a popular music teacher in the Boston schools . It was not long before Neville had Miss Bainton lending her name to The Bainton Associates , Inc. , which purported to be an investment trust paying 25% returns monthly . Hypnotic , honest-looking Neville convinced his clients that as a Wall Street wizard he could make this profit possible by trading their money in stocks . Mr. Neville further convinced everyone of his good faith by marrying Miss Bainton 's niece .
