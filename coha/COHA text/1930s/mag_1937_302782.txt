The most important piece of international collaboration since the League of Nations commissioned a joint **29;11831;TOOLONG Army to supervise the Saar Plebiscite ( TIME , Jan. 21 , 1935 et ante ) was the decision in London of 27 nations at the International Committee for Non-intervention to keep out of Spain further volunteers and ammunition ( TIME , March 1 ) . Last week the committee agreed how best to do this . The coast of Spain was divided into sectors , and part of the international fleet was assigned to each . To Russia was assigned patrol of the northwest sector of the Bay of Biscay , though it was clear that her few creaky vessels surviving from Tsarist days could never stand up to those storm-lashed seas . Russia refused the assignment , " saved face " by demanding to patrol part of the Mediterranean though it was equally clear that Dictator Mussolini would never allow Russian ships to ply Mare Nostrum ( " Our Sea " ) . This was all an elaborate diplomatic finesse , staged by Britain , who knew that Russia never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish her right to do so . <P> Up got the Portuguese delegate who declared that his country , too , refused to contribute to the International fleet , thus leaving Britain , France , Germany and Italy to do the job . These four powers resolved to take over the whole blockade from midnight of March 6 . Each ship will fly in addition to its national flag a " neutral blue pennant with a yellow cross . " Italy will patrol the eastern coast of Spain from the French frontier down past Barcelona and Valencia to Alicante . From that point Germany will patrol the southeastern coastline to Malaga . British ships will patrol from Malaga through the Strait of Gibraltar to the beginning of the Portuguese coastline . Over the Spanish-Portuguese land frontier 130 " international observers " will keep watch . French and British ships jointly will pick up the blockade on the northwest Spanish seas at Vigo where the Spanish coastline begins again , will patrol the Bay of Biscay around to the French frontier . France has already closed its Spanish land frontier , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pyrenees . Spain will thus be completely ringed in like a disease area . <P> On Spanish soil meantime last week the bloody war continued with neither side making much headway . The three-week-old struggle for the Madrid-Valencia road , the capital 's only outlet to the sea , raged indecisively . For the first time in five weeks , long-range shells from Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's White guns zoomed into Madrid , struck the long-suffering , U. S.-owned telephone building , killed a half-dozen citizens . From the Madrid deadlock Generalissimo Franco turned to strike at Valencia where the Radical Government is taking cover , sent an attacking force to Viver , 34 miles northwest of Valencia , while invading White planes dropped incendiary bombs on Valencia itself . At Oviedo the Reds gained their only success . Reckless Asturian miners paced the streets , lit dynamite fuses from their dangling cigarets , caused a stampede among the White band bottled up in the city whose condition last week was reported to be " critical . " According to neutral observers " the war is as far from ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
