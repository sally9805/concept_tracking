For a President to address a message to a Congressional conference committee is unconventional , if not utterly unprecedented . Precedents mean nothing to Franklin Delano Roosevelt . To Pat Harrison and Bob Doughton , chairmen respectively of Senate Finance and House Ways &; Means Committees , members of which were starting the ticklish job of compromising between the two tax bills passed by their respective chambers , he dispatched a 1,000-word letter , recommending in effect that the conference adopt the House bill which , unlike the Senate 's , retains at least a portion of the Administration 's pet undistributed profits and capital gains tax . Excerpt : " The repeal of the undistributed profits tax and the reduction of the tax on capital gains to a fraction of the tax on other forms of income strike at the root of fundamental principles of taxation . <P> " Business will be helped , not hurt , by these suggestions . <P> FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT "
