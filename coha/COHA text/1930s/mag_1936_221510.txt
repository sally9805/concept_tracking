For the first time since Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1917 , the legal base of U. S. credit was arbitrarily changed last week . Emerging from a sweltering all-day session in Washington , the Federal Reserve Board announced a 50% increase in reserve requirements for member banks , effective Aug. 15 . After nearly a year of public and private debate over the inflationary dangers of excess reserves , Reserve Board Chairman Marriner Stoddard Eccles had finally taken up the slack in the elaborate brake system provided by the Banking Act of 1935 to stop runaway credit expansion . <P> The slack lay entirely in the fact that the nation 's banks now have some $3,000,000,000 in reserves over &; above what they need to support their present business . That excess could support a credit expansion of at least $30,000,000,000 . It is the threat of such credit inflation that gives bankers like Chase National 's Chairman Winthrop Aldrich the jitters every time they think about it . And , through the mysteries of central banking , excess reserves are about to take another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Reserve Board estimating that the total will be about $3,400,000,000 by mid-August . This will be merely a delayed rise , since the real cause of mounting bank reserves is the flow of foreign gold to the U. S. <P> Chairman Eccles can do nothing to stop the inflow of gold , but he can do several things about the effects of gold imports . One of them is the power to boost reserve requirement as much as 100% . Another is to sell the Reserve System 's Government bonds , resulting in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in reserves . By raising the reserve requirement 50% , Chairman Eccles mopped up nearly $1,500,000,000 of the excess , leaving about $1,900,000,000 to worry about after Aug. 15 . And while $1,900,000,000 is a larger figure for excess reserves than ever recorded prior to 1935 , it could be more than wiped out by selling the Reserve System 's $2,400,000,000 worth of Government securities . Furthermore , with reserve requirements averaging 15% of demand deposits , the excess $1,900,000,000 will then represent not $19,000,000,000 of potential credit but less than $13,000,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an easy money policy . Easy money means cheap financing , government as well as corporate . And a $1,900,000,000 cushion of excess reserves guarantees low interest rates and high bond prices for some time to come . Nevertheless , to squash any widespread notion that it was deliberately moving for tighter money , the Board took pains to state that its move was an anti-inflationary step offering " further encouragement to sound business recovery and confidence in the long-term investment market . " <P> Interpreted as everything from a courageous demonstration of political independence to a smart New Deal bid for business votes , Chairman Eccles ' decision was generally approved by bankers big &; little . Excess reserves are pretty evenly distributed , but a few banks will feel the pressure of the Eccles brake and have to borrow to build up reserves to the new requirements . These bankers will undoubtedly howl " Deflation . "
