More than 7,000,000 U. S. citizens were temporarily mayorless , last week , when the chief executives ( or their delegates ) of 24 cities sailed for France . The cities were those which entertained transatlantic Airmen Costes &; Bellonte on their cashing-in tour last year ( TIME , Sept. 15 ) . The mayors are to be guests of the French Republic , to see the International Colonial &; Overseas Exposition in Paris ( TIME , May 11 ) and take a whirlwind junket through France . Entrusted to the mayors by the U. S. exposition committee was a bust of the late Ambassador Myron Timothy Herrick , carved from a beam of the original White House , to be placed in the Paris Hotel de Ville . <P> Oldest mayor in the party came from the smallest town . He was Alvin Parker Gray , 78 , of Pasco , Wash . ( pop . 3,500 ) . He said he was going to " team-up " with the youngest mayor , R. B. Marvin of Syracuse , N. Y. , who is 33 . Bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Boy " ) Miller was Mayor George L. Baker of Portland , Ore . Large , breezy , beetle-browed Mayor Baker lost no time in making himself the personage of the party . He wore a 10-gallon hat , was elected chairman of the delegation , gave out the big interview during the party 's two-day stay in Manhattan . Excerpts : " It may seem like taking a ham sandwich to a banquet , but you 'll notice that all of us who have wives are taking them along , too . The party is sure to be dignified and the ladies may lend some grace to an otherwise motley assemblage . All classes , kinds and politics are represented here , but we 're going to try to sink our political differences over there . " <P> Oldest Mayor Gray also had something to say . He bridled when Mrs. Gray , ardent W. C. T. U. supporter , told newshawks : " Liquor is wicked in itself , and the source of most of the world 's wickedness . " Said her husband : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just a Dry , she 's a Prohibition crank . Prohibition will never work , in my opinion . " He is proud that little Pasco has not had a murder in 30 years . <P> When the mayors get to France , where Boston 's Curley will join the party , Mayor William Frederick Broening of Baltimore will have $8,000 in extra spending money . Just before he sailed he decided to accept the back pay from a salary increase which his city granted him in 1927 but which he had hitherto rejected . <P> Set to watch the behavior of the 20 executives including Los Angeles ' Porter . Cleveland 's Marshall , New Orleans ' Walmsley , Atlanta 's Key , Milwaukee 's Hoan and Omaha 's Metcalfe , and mayoral representatives from New York , Chicago , San Francisco and Indianapolis , was a United Press correspondent . He slyly observed that " three Western mayors " were drinking in the ship 's bar the first day out , refrained from naming them .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
