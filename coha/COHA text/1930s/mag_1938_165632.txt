Eleven years ago , Rev. Paul Schulte , a strapping , blond German priest of the Roman Catholic order of Oblates of Mary Immaculate , founded the Missionary Communications Association , to keep missionary outposts of the Church in touch with the world . Its motto : Obviam Christo terra marique et in aera ( " Toward Christ by land and sea and in the air " ) . Lately , Father Schulte , a crack pilot who wears his Roman collar under his flying togs , has been in northern Canada planning an aerial transport service for missionaries in the Arctic . In Churchill , Manitoba last week he learned that Bishop Armand Clabaut had received a radiogram from the Hudson 's Bay Co. , 1,200 miles north in Baffin Land : FATHER COCHARD SINCE NINE DAYS VERY SICK ; TEMPERATURE 105 ; PAINS ON LEFT SIDE . FATHER REFUSING FOOD . PLEASE HELP . <P> For a flying priest , this was almost a routine appeal . But it was not so routine that Father Schulte , as he flew north with his mechanic , Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his activities . Father Schulte dashed 360 miles to Chesterfield Inlet , found the only doctor ill , pushed on , was forced down by fog at Igloolik , reached Baffin Land to find Father Cochard still living , bundled him into the plane . Reported Father Schulte to the Times , after he got his colleague safely to a hospital in Chesterfield Inlet : " Father Cochard was not troubled with airsickness and was very happy when I gave him oranges , a fruit he had not eaten in many years .
