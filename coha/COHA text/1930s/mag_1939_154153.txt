The Lou Tellegen as well as the Propaganda Minister of Germany is gimpy little Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels . His carryings-on with the actresses on whom he must pass before they may appear on the German stage or screen are a joke as well as a scandal in the upper circles of Naziland . <P> Among Nazi officials the bright-eyed Propaganda Minister is called " Little Doctor . " Year ago , in a Berlin film , a seductive Czech actress was asked how to get ahead in the world . Her reply was : " Go find a good doctor . " The audience , which guessed what doctor was meant , roared with laughter . The Little Doctor hurriedly withdrew the film . An added quirk to the situation was the fact that the Czech leading lady , Lida Baarova , was a particularly admired protegee of Dr. Goebbels . Last week , as Dr. Goebbels lay sick abed with what was officially reported as intestinal influenza , Lida Baarova 's friendship with the Little Doctor made a sensational tale in the U. S. press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Berlin tipster had taken " a peek through the key-hole or a glance through the transom of the Goebbels sickroom , " had seen the Little Doctor bundled in thick bandages- not the usual treatment for intestinal influenza . <P> From The Daily News Syndicate in Switzerland and International News Service in London came spectacular additions to the story . Dr. Goebbels had been beaten , it was said , within an inch of his life by friends of Actress Baarova 's husband . These friends , incensed because the husband had been sent to a concentration camp , had surprised the Propaganda Minister in Lida 's rooms , might have killed him had it not been for the intervention of Dr. Goebbels ' chauffeur . Frau Goebbels , one of Herr Hitler 's more prominent tea-pourers , was supposed to have chuffed off to Copenhagen for the divorce she has long wanted . <P> Because no reliable confirmation of this story could be got from Berlin , best guess seemed to be that it was an echo of an earlier , better-documented tale of the Doctor 's goings-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody , possibly Actress Baarova herself , had clouted Goebbels in the Baarova apartment . He did not make an appearance during the late August , visit of Hungarian Regent Nicholas Horthy , and when he made his brief appearance at the Nrnberg Congress in September , he was carrying the unmistakable vestige of a black eye . <P> Among some Berlin wiseacres there was gossip that Dr. Goebbels would be shorn of his power late this month by Fhrer Hitler . The Fhrer was said to be contemplating far-reaching changes in Nazi administration on January 30 , the sixth anniversary of Nazi rule . Having failed to give his usual Christmas broadcast to Germany 's children , Dr. Goebbels rallied for New Year 's , and in a firm , clear voice expressed the general feeling in Germany that 1938 had been a great year for the Nazis . Said the doctor : " Never has it been so hard to say good-by to a dying year as to 1938 . It was a magnificent year filled with victories and successes like none before it .
