The bulk of the leased farms are operated by share tenants , who are to a large extent under the direct supervision of the owner or landlord . 4 . Farming ? An Industry of Small Independent Units In farming , the unit of organization is small . In this respect farming is similar to the small retail trade enterprise and the local shop or neighborhood industries . In 1930 there were 6,288,648 farms , the average size of which was 157 acres . There was , of course , considerable variation in the size , but 80 per cent of all farms were 174 acres or less . The capital invested in implements and machinery in 1930 was $3,301,654,481 , or $525 per farm . The livestock was valued at $6,064,051,430 , or $964 per farm . The investment in land and buildings was $47,879,838,358 , or $7,614 per farm . Thus , the total investment in machinery , livestock , and fixed assets averaged about $9,103 per farm . The number of persons ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or less than two persons per farm . The primary power used on the farms aggregated 47,420,000 horse power units , or 74 horse power per farm . 5 . Farm Products Not Easily Standardized Another distinguishing feature of farming is the great difficulty attending the standardization of farm products . It is true that farmers may , to a limited extent , determine the character of their products . For example , it is possible , by selecting and breeding , to change materially the character of plants and animals . As a result of experimentation great improvement has been made in the form and character of many farm products . But standardization by such means is obviously not as effective as standardization by machine methods and processes . By use of machines ii is possible to turn out large quantities of articles identical as io shape , size , and quality . All iliat the farmer can do  | is to get the most uniform products possible by breeding , selection , and cultural methods , and then to sort or grade the products . This method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expensive . To be graded economically , agricultural products must be assembled in large quantities . And , as the output on the average farm is small , volume can be obtained only through some form of cooperative effort . To organize a cooperative may be an easy task ; however , when such an association is organized , it is difficult to manage it efficiently . 6 . Limitation of the Farmer 's Control over Production One of the well-organized elements of success in the management of any business enterprise is control of production . When production is not controlled or not controllable , serious maladjustments are likely to occur , as at times more products will be produced than can be sold profitably , and at other times not enough products are available when prices are high . Some businessmen avoid overproduction and underproduction by adjusting their production ( both as to total amount to be produced and the rate ) to anticipated demand . In fine , they estimate from available data the probable future prices and t osts , and on these estimates they decide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a rule , do not do this ; they react to prices at planting and breeding time . If the price of a specific product is high at planting time , the acreage will be increased ; and if prices are low , the acreage will be reduced . The farmer reacts in a similar way in reference to animal production . When prices of animals or animal products are high , farmers embark on an extensive program of expansion ; and , when prices are low , they restrict their breeding operations . When the large production comes upon the market , the prices are depressed ; when production is sufficiently curtailed , prices are high . The average farmer misses the market in practically every case . But even if farmers could anticipate prices and base their  | production on anticipated prices , they have not the same control over production as is normally exercised by the manufacturer . Weather is an important factor affecting agricultural production , and weather conditions can not be accurately forecast . Farmers must plan their production program on normal weather conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result ; and , of course , on the other hand , if weather conditions are unfavorable , underproduction may result . Industrial establishments often gain control over production through combination . That is , independent establishments producing the same or similar articles often merge their interests into one large corporation . With one large corporation , the control is centralized , and the production may be better adjusted to anticipated demands . Such a control of production usually results in a larger net profit than would be realized if each corporation operated independently . Control of production through combination , which is open to both manufacturing and commercial concerns , is not used , by farmers . Farmers do not associate themselves in groups for the purpose of control of production . It is a fact that farmers form cooperative marketing associations , but the object is not the control of production . The object is to market their products efficiently . Any profits thus realized are reflected back to the individual producer . This increase in profits tends to stimulate the farmer to greater production , and this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directors of a coopera five marketing association does not exercise control over the production of the individual members . If agricultural production is to be controlled , it must be controlled by the individual farmer ; and this , as has been noted , is a difficult thing to accomplish even under governmental supervision . 7 . Agriculture Subject to Great Risks Farming is constantly subjected to damage from excessive rainfall , drought , hail , floods , insect pests , and plant and  | animal diseases . To a marked degree , urban industries can protect themselves against weather conditions ; and they are not subject , to any large extent , to insect pests and plant diseases . Furthermore , many risks peculiar to urban industries are insurable , but insurance companies have found it difficult to work out a plan which will give farmers adequate protection at a reasonable cost . As a matter of fact , farm insurance is confined largely to fire and hail insurance . There really is no such thing as general farm insurance . The inability of the farmer to obtain protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard against extreme losses , he finds diversification of production the most effective . While diversification of this kind does not always prevent losses from plant and animal diseases , insect pests , and climate conditions , it does tend to reduce losses from these causes . Other means of avoiding losses have been developed . For example , plants have been bred that will mature within the usual period between , killing frosts ; others have been fired to resist drought and plant and insect diseases . These methods of adapting plants to conditions have often saved flouters from serious losses . In some instances , whole areas  | have been made prosperous following serious crop damage . Farmers also reduce losses by careful observation of weather conditions . By observing the normal occurrence of the last killing frost in the spring , and the first killing frost in the fall , farmers may adjust their farm operations so that damage from freezing will be minimized or eliminated . Losses because of seed sterility may be eliminated by testing seed before planting . However , when all of these various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable element of risk , and heavy losses occur annually . 8 . Financing of Agricultural Production a Difficult Task Because of the various hazards to which agriculture is subject . agricultural production is not easily financed . Credit based on crop production is hazardous , and , as a result , the interest rates are often high . In the case of livestock , credit must be extended over a period longer than a year , usually eighteen months to three years . Cattle , the basis of such security , may die , or they may be moved from place to place . For these reasons , the extension of credit on cattle , unless the farmer is well known to the creditor , is not readily obtained at reasonable costs . These difficulties do not apply to land . Land is fixed , and credit based on land may be easily obtained at reasonable costs . On the whole , however , even with the various facilities which have been recently provided by the Federal Government , the cost of agricultural credit remains high and is more expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professional Training of Farm Operators Limited Modern farming tends to differ markedly from urban industries in training required of the operator . Pioneer farming was a simple occupation . The essentials for success were good health , physical strength and dexterity , and ability to withstand for long periods of time physical hardships and isolation . Today the elements of success have changed somewhat . The general use of machinery in farm-  | ing has relieved the farmer of some of the hard labor , but , even so , physical strength is still a prerequisite . The fact t hat the farmer must produce for the market and must judge to some extent market demands has sharpened his intellect . The process of commercialization in farming has not gone far enough , however , to make him an alert businessman . The ordinary farmer can still get along after a fashion without a great deal of education . A survey of 2,886 farmers in eleven states shows that the education of a large percentage of farmers was less than the twelfth grade.13 These data and others which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the simple rudiments of knowledge . In recent years vocational education and extension work have added touch to the farmer 's knowledge of technical production ; but his knowledge of the principles of business , as founded upon economics , accounting , statistics , and psychology , is still meager and often of the crudest sort . 10 . Significance of the Characteristics The influence of the characteristics of farming on the action of farmers has been emphasized , but special attention should be given to self-sufficiency . With respect to this element , modern farming stands in sharp contrast with the modern capitalistic enterprise . The latter is not to any large extent self-sufficing . The labor used is hired , and the equipment and material necessary for operation are purchased in the open market . In short , the modern urban capitalistic business has to meet its expenditures or obligat ions from day to day or from week to week , as these obligations , as a rule , can not be postponed . In contrast , the farmer does not have to act in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the peculiar action of fanners . He responds , as several studies have revealed , to present or past economic conditions , rather than to antici- footnote ' Kirkpatrick , op. cit.  | paled events . To illustrate , the cotton farmer has invariably reduced his acreage when the price of cotton at planting time was low , and increased his acreage when the price at planting time was high . This action has , in the main , reduced his income , because it has been a factor in causing overproduction of specific crops in some years and underproduction in other years . The self-sufficing character of modern farming is unquestionably the principal cause of this , and it is argued that if the farmer were compelled under all conditions and at all times to pay a competitive labor wage , to pay market and competitive rates for power and materials , he would be compelled to practice economy , to organize his business on a scientific basis , and to keep it adjusted to changing economic conditions . But since the farmer is not forced to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market or to long-time trends in economic conditions which seriously affect his economic status . Another explanation of this behavior of farmers is found in the relationship of fixed to variable costs . In farming , the fixed costs constitute a much larger proportion of the total costs than do the variable costs ; that is , the cost of maintaining land , buildings , and equipment , together with the cost of labor supplied by the farmer and his family , usually constitutes a much larger proportion of the total cost than those costs , such as hired labor , seed , and fertilizer , which tend to vary directly with production . Hence , anticipated low prices may not result in any marked change in the farmer 's production plans . The reason for this is obvious : The fixed costs will not be greatly affected by normal changes in production , so that the farmer stands to gain if the anticipated returns are greater than the direct or variable costs . Or to state it differently , any excess in returns over the variable cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of this relationship between the fixed and variable costs that an anticipated rise in prices may he followed by an increase in farm output , but an  | anticipated low price may not bring about ally material decrease in production . If the total cost should vary directly with production ( that is , if all costs were direct costs ) , any anticipated change in price would immediately result in a corresponding change in production . However , since farm production costs are seldom , if ever , all variable , this kind of response does not occur . The farmer 's response , therefore , to anticipated prices will depend on the ratio of his variable to fixed costs . Where the fixed costs constitute a large percentage of the total cost , the farmer will not change his production plans in response to the anticipated changes in prices , unless these prices are likely to be higher than normal . When anticipated prices are likely to be below normal , he may not decrease his output . A marked decrease in output is likely to occur only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" This terminology has the advantage of brevity and the sanction of long usage . It should be pointed out , however , that the term is somewhat misleading , as it focuses attention on management to the possible neglect of organization . It is important to recognize the distinction between these two functions of the farm operator . Organization refers specifically to the function of creating the general scheme or plan of production , whereas management refers to the function of putting the scheme into operation and of making those adjustments in the business which are necessary in order to obtain the maximum economic returns from the farm business as a whole . f it this text , when the term farm management is used , it refers to both organization and management of the farm , unless otherwise stated . 1 . Various Concepts of Farm Management Farm management has been defined as an art , a science , and a business .

' Warren defines farm management as the science of organization and management of the farm enterprises for the purpose of securing the greatest continuous profit . ' Moorhouse is of the opinion that farm management is the study which deals with the business phase of farming . ' ' Holmes defines it as a study of the principles underlying the farmer functioning as a business proprietor . ' And according to Spillman , farm management treats of the business of farming from the standpoint of relative desirability of farming and other lines of business , the selection of the farm , the organization and equipment of the farm , and the farm operator . ' These varied definitions may be confusing and can be harmonized only when the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be properly considered as an art , a science , or a business . A science is usually defined as a body of truths systematized and arranged in such a way as to show the operations of general laws or principles . Such a body of knowledge is obtained through systematic study and research . To the extent that we are concerned with methods of collecting and analyzing data for the purpose of evolving general principles or laws peculiar to the economics of production , the subject of farm management may be considered as a science . When approached from this standpoint , it involves a treatment greatly different from that when approached from the standpoint of an art on the one hand or a business on the other . To treat the subject as a science would involve more particularly a statement of research objectives , the development of method of collecting and analyzing the data obtained , and the deduction or formulation of general laws or principles peculiar to this subject .

Department of Agriculture , Both  | management can be accurately called a distinctive science is a question which we are not called upon in this connection to answer . It may be said in passing that research and experimentation in this field have brought together a considerable body of knowledge from which have been deducted certain laws and principles that are useful in the operation of a farm and also in the determining of public policies . In the main , however , the principles are not peculiar to farm management but rather are part of the general science of economics . It is possible also and highly desirable to study farming from the standpoint of an art . The word art connotes skill or dexterity not only in the physical but also in the mental sense . The study of farming from this point of view would mean a careful examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their many farm tasks and chores . It would not be a study of the quality and quantity of various factors used in production and the effect of these on production , costs , and returns . I t would be rather a study of the theory and practice of the skills used in performing farm tasks . It is common knowledge that some farmers are able to do a given task more quickly , with greater ease , and in a better way than other farmers . We say that these farmers are skillful or artistic , since their movements appear almost effortless . Can these peculiar skills be studied and the results put into such form as will be useful to less skillful farmers or to young men mid boys just starting farming ? There is no question but that one engaging in such a study would encounter many difficulties . Investigations in scientific management would indicate , nevertheless , that such a study is not impossible and would yield fruitful results . However , the study of farm management as an art would require an approach somewhat different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production on the one hand or of a business on the other . footnote .1 business is usually thought of as an enterprise or-  | ganized and operated primarily for profit . Farming , according to this definition , would come within the category of a business . In the conduct of a farm enterprise , the farmer is an entrepreneur , and as such he should apply business principles to the organization and management of the farm if he expects to utilize his resources to the best advantage . It is from the point of view of a business that we shall treat the subject , and not from the standpoint of a science or of an art , except perhaps incidentally . That is , we are concerned chiefly with the problem of planning and scheming to the end that the farmer will be able to use his labor and capital to get the maximum net returns . It should be pointed out , however , that farming differs from the ordinary type of business . It has certain features that are not found in the ordinary commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business executive . These differences , considered in detail in Chapter I , are important and should be kept in mind in planning the organization and management of the farm . 2 . Farm Management and the Technical Sciences Some writers have attempted to elucidate their concept of farm management by comparing it with the technical agricultural subjects . Professor Boss , for example , differentiates between agronomy and farm management as follows : " How shall I grow corn is clearly an agronomy question . How shall I select and grow cattle is just as clearly a question in animal husbandry . But the questions , Shall I grow corn , some other crop , or cattle or hogs , are farm management questions . " This method of distinguishing between farm management and technical sciences is not , perhaps , incorrect , although it is rather simple . The actual growing of a crop or a class of livestock may not be purely technical . If the major objective is one of measuring the effects of the input  | on the physical output , the problem may be properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of the so-called technical sciences . For example , in the production of a given crop , as more fertilizer is used , other factors being held constant , the output will normally increase . In the feeding of livestock , if the amount of feed is increased , normally the weight of the animals or the flow of milk will be increased . This is purely a technical problem . ' But from the standpoint of the farmer , the relationship between the input and the output is more than a technical problem ; it is also an economic problem . The farmer 's interest lies in adjusting the inputs ( that is , in obtaining the combination of the various inputs ) so as to get the maximum net returns , not necessarily from any one figure specific crop or livestock product but from the farm as a whole . In short , the task of the farmer from the standpoint , of a business proprietor is to know the effect on the physical output of adding more or less of one factor , and footnote " Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss approaches IIu ? problem , Imt his position is by no menus clear .  | in being able to decide which of a number of combinations of input factors is or will be most profitable . The real ; distinction , therefore , between the technical sciences and farm management is that the former deal primarily with the relationship between physical inputs and physical outputs ; the latter , primarily with the problem of getting the most profitable combination of the various factors used in production . If there is any confusion as to this distinction , it may be clarified by a few illustrations . " Experiments with fertilizer usually show the effect of the additional fertilizer on output or yield . Increasing the amount of fertilizer on a given crop on a given type of soil increases the total production . This may be designated as an agronomy problem . The function of the farmer as a business proprietor is to decide at what point in the application of fertilizer it will best pay him to stop . Will he add x quantity of fertilizer , or 2x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technologist to experiment with the effect on output of the number of cultivations , the effect on output of the depth of plowing , and the effect on output of the number of sprayings . But it is the problem of the farmer as a businessman to decide whether or not to plow deep or shallow , to cultivate one or more times , to plant more or less seed , to use more or less feed . True , the farmer may add to his total output by increasing the number of cultivations , by adding more fertilizer , or by plowing deeper ; he may increase his milk production by feeding more heavily ; or he may increase the weight of steers by the same process . However , the farmer is faced constantly with the problem : Will it pay better to do any of these things , and if so , to what extent ? The question is economic in character and lies within the province of the farm economist , whereas the physical relation between input and output is essentially within the province of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | 3 . Farm Management and the Social Sciences To describe more accurately the nature of farm management , some writers have compared it with the social sciences , more especially with general economics and agricultural economics . Some authorities have been inclined to give farm management a distinct or separate classification from either general economics or agricultural economics . The classification of farm management as a distinct subject is based on the theory that farm management deals primarily with private economy , whereas other branches of agricultural economics are concerned chiefly with collective or public economy . Other writers object to this theory . They define agricultural economics as a science in which the principles and methods of general economics are applied to the special conditions of agriculture as an industry . In short , agricultural economics is an applied science , just as railroad economics or money and banking are applied sciences . And as the economic problems in agriculture are diverse , it follows that there are many more or less distinct branches of agricultural economics , such as agricultural credit , agricultural taxation , farm labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the like . The disciples of the second school do not . deny that farm management is a study in private economy , but they claim it is not confined solely to private economy . They hold that certain phases of farm management are affected by public interest , and they point out that in many eases the fanners ' actions are limited by public authorities . For example , in the production of milk for urban consumption , certain rules and regulations are prescribed for the production of milk in order to assure a sanitary product . Similarly , the farmers produQing certified seed for general distribution are normally compelled to comply with certain regulations laid down by the state . Regulations or legislation regarding i axat ion , 1 ariffs , prices , and credit affect  | the way in which the farm will be organized and operated . On the other hand , it is pointed out that such subjects as farm credit , farm taxation , and agricultural tariffs , while primarily of public concern , have their individual aspects . The individual farmer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his own tenure problems . It is impossible , so it is said , to make the distinction between agricultural economics and farm management on the basis of collective and individual economies . Therefore , farm management must be classified as a division or a segment of agricultural economics . 4 . Definition of Farm Management Distinctions of this kind are interesting and helpful , although they do not supply a precise explanation of the nature of farm management . A better approach to this subject may be made by asking this question : What are the functions of the farmer ? That is , what does he do ? What role does he play ? It is evident to everyone who is familiar with farming that the farmer performs more than one function . Warren recognizes this multifunctional nature of the farmer when he says : " The farmer is a combination of businessman , mechanic , naturalist , and laborer . " ' Gray recognizes this fact also when he enumerates the many qualifications the farmer must have . ' A simple enumeration of the various roles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , perhaps , that the farmer , in order to be successful , should have an expert knowledge of technical agricultural sciences and a flair for the natural sciences ; he should be an expert mechanic and a capable and industrious laborer . But a study of these functions does not properly belong in the field of farm management . If it did , then it would be necessary to write an encyclopedia on farming . There is , however , one function of the farmer that does relate directly to farm footnote W.u ? ren , op. cit. , p. 1 . ( 1 ' ; , , op. cit .. , pp. 29- 30.  | management , and that is the function of entrepreneurship . As a business entrepreneur the farmer acts as an organizer and operator of land , labor , and capital . His success as a business proprietor will depend directly on his ability to organize and manage these factors of production . Farm management , then , may be defined as a study of the ways and means of organizing land , labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill in order that the farm may be made to yield the maximum net returns . In a study of this character every factor is given consideration , whether agronomic , social , or economic . Information of all kinds is so much grist in the mill , and each kind is given attention to the extent that it may be useful in organizing and managing the farm to the end that all of the factors of production will be utilized to the best advantage ; that is , made to yield the maximum net returns for the farm as a whole .

Such a story belongs more properly to the history of agriculture . The purpose of this chapter is to trace briefly the development of farm management in the United States and in foreign countries from the beginning of the present century . 1 . The Development in the United States Beginnings in farm management . There was little work of a scientific character done in farm management in the United States prior to 1900 ; 1 however , some consideration must be given to certain cost studies that were conducted as early as 1845 by the Agricultural Section of the Patent footnote Warren , " The Development of Farm Economics " ; also Sigmund von Fmin niiorfer , " Development Methods and Results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office . That these studies partook of the nature of farm management is indicated by the objective stated by the Commissioner of Patent , under whose direction they were made . He says : 2 " Let our motto be the greatest amount of produce at the least expense . Profit is our object , and Illustration fru , n Bu. of .4qr .

According to Bennett , there were no less than a dozen such investigations made prior to 1902.3 Horner in his studies of governmental activities found few references to farm management in the early government reports . In 1867 there was a report by a ' special committee on farm management given in the annual meeting of the Maine Board of Agriculture . In this report the distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the report considered such subjects as " the size of farm , the exhausting quality of oat crop , effective measures to increase hay crop , should more beans and peas be grown , the efficiency of ox yoke , shall farm fruits and vegetables be cultivated more extensively , and the use of improved implements . " Although the attention given to farm management prior to 1900 was chiefly superficial , the interest in the subject grew as the farm problem became more and more acute . It was inevitable that agricultural leaders and students of farming would attempt to find causes and remedies for the conditions which existed . ' Excessive costs and economical production were advanced as the chief cause and remedy respectively for the farmers ' ills . But the first scientific study of costs was not begun until in 1902 . Willett M. Hays of the Minnesota Experiment Station was responsible for this initial study . He introduced a new method . The cost data were obtained not by questionnaire 's , as formerly , but by visiting at frequent intervals a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the information necessary to the compiling of production costs . The method became known as the " Route Method " of studying farm management problems .

About this time ( between 1902 and 1907 ) , Professor T. F. Hunt , an agronomist , was giving much of , his time and thought to the field of farm management . He began his work at the University of Ohio , where his lectures included material on the history of agriculture , public policy , and farm management . Hunt left Ohio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution his courses , although covering a variety of subjects , dealt mostly with farm management and included a farm management problem .

Finally , a detailed plan for its operation was projected for a five-year period . ' The work of Spillman , Warren , and Taylor . The work of Hays and his assistants together with the stimulating teaching of Hunt at Cornell led to the establishment of research work in fnrin management in the 1 k'partment of Agriculture . The leading spirit was W. .1 . , Spillman , who was originally a student of technical agriculture but who had diversified interests , having studied and written extensively in the fields of physics and genetics , as well as on agronomic subjects .

The appropriation bill of that year has the following phraseology : " To investigate and encourage the adoption of appropriate methods in farm management and practice . " Spillman 's work was confined , in the early stages at least , to a series of studies relating to the organization and management of farms which had been , according to Spillman , ' successful . Of these early studies A Model Farm ( Yearbook Separate 323 ) is typical . This publication is a brief but interesting description of a farm located in Southern Pennsylvania . In 1905 , the Office of Farm Management was set up , under the direction of Spillman , as a division of the Bureau of Plant Industry . From that date until 1915 , when this division was transferred to the office of the Secretary and called the Office of Farm Management , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking and methods of study were greatly modified by the work that G.

Warren 's fundamental idea was that the factors affecting success or failure of the farm could be discovered only by a study of a large number of farms in a homogeneous farming area . For this purpose he developed what was designated as the " Survey ' Method . " After some experimentation with this method , he published the results of a survey in 1911 . ? This bullet in , with its somewhat dogmatic conclusions , made a deep and lasting impression on the students and investigators who were working under Spillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations . The use of the survey method spread rapidly , and a large number of farm management bulletins appeared between 1909 and 1918 . In the meantime another investigator , who was to leave his imprint upon the research in the field of farm inanagement , had begun work in Wisconsin . This investigator was Henry C. Taylor , ho , encouraged by Professor R. T. Ely , turned his attention t the economic problems of the farm . He was especially interested in the subject of land tenure and farm prices . 11 is first notable publication is entitled Agricultural Economics . This book , consisting of thirteen chapters , deals largely with the problem of organizing and managing indiv idual farms . Taylor , whose work had become nationally known by 1915 , was destined to supersede Spillman in the Office of footnote " Warren , C. F. , and Livermore , K. C. , " An Agricultural Survey , " ( ' , , , , , 411 Th4110 , No. 3175.  | Farm Management . The change in leadership came about in this fashion . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cost data relative to producing farm commodities . The data were to be used to set the price of farm products by government fiat . The lay theory was that prices must equal the cost of production . With this idea David Houston , then Secretary of Agriculture , had little or no sympathy . In fact he opposed the gathering of cost data for such a purpose , especially by the method used by Spillman . Friction developed between the two , and Spillman was forced to resign . There then followed an investigation , at the suggestion of the Secretary , of the work of the Office of Farm Management by a committee composed of prominent men in the field of farm management research . ' The report of this committee was favorably received by Secretary Houston ; and Taylor , who was a member of the committee , was asked to assume the responsibility of directing the work of the Office of Farm Management . He took office in 1918 . In 1919 the name of the office was changed to the Office of Farm Management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Office of the Secretary , although not given the standing of an independent bureau . Taylor , while Chief of the Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics , and later as Chief of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics , very definitely influenced the research work in the field of farm management . He broadened its base by introducing new studies , gave it more definiteness by stating clearly the objective , and made the information more accurate by introducing approved statistical procedure in the analysis and collection of the data . Although Taylor did not write a great deal , his ability to direct research work became evident through the brilliant work of such men as L. C. Gray , O. C. Stine , O. E. Baker , footnote IT . S.

Recent developments . Since the formation of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics , the work of farm management has been modified , not so much in objective as in methods of research . The changes which have taken place are stated by Mr. Tolley as follows : " ' Let me mention first recent developments in farm organization and farm management research , and begin with type-of-farming studies . I ) r . Spillman ' 3 did much pioneer work on these studies using the results of the 1920 census of agriculture . Recent developments include a procedure for determining and portraying type-of-farming areas , the typical farming system or systems in each area , and the historical changes which have occurred . The procedure is based largely on the use of census data , and , if we can be content with a quinquennial portrayal of changes , it gives practically as complete and satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these studies . A considerable number of states , in which soil and climatic conditions are fairly homogeneous , have brought to a successful conclusion projects of this type . A procedure suitable for states or areas where there are wide variations in soil and climatic conditions is yet to be developed . Another phase of type-of-farming studies attempts to determine the comparative advantage of the existing types over other types that might have developed in an area . This phase of a type-of-farming ' study would , no doubt , often result in the conclusion that some type or types , ether than those actually found in an area , would be more profitable and of higher comparative advantage . The best study along this line that has been published to date is reported in Iowa Bulletin 259 . Another phase of type-of-farming studies involves determining why type-of-farming areas shift and why the systems of farming within an area change . Procedure for this phase is still in the developmental stage . footnote 12 Tolley , " Recent Developmeiis in Research Method and Procedure in Aericnlinrnl laonomics , " pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the staff of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics after a brief experience in agricultural journalism .  | Closely related to this phase of type-of-farming studies are the so-called elasticity of supply studies that have as their object measuring the groupresponse of farmers in their production and marketing programs to changes in prices and other factors . It has long been recognized that there is a fairly close relationship between changes in price and subsequent changes in supply of agricultural productions coming from a particular area or region or country , but attempts to obtain quantitative measures of this relationship are a recent development in agricultural economics . Already a number of worth-while studies have been made , some designed to show the relationship between the price and the supply of a product for the country as a whole , others dealing with a single area or region . In all of these studies the statistical method ? principally multiple curvilinear correlation ? has been used . That is , an accepted method has been applied in a newly developed line of research . The most serious handicap in these studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acreages of crops and numbers of livestock by small geographical units are scanty and often unreliable . Studies to date have dealt almost entirely with acreages and numbers of livestock . A procedure for measuring the relationship between changes in prices and changes in intensity of cultivation and feeding has not yet been worked out . Turning to the studies designed to show most profitable systems of farming and methods of production we find a noteworthy recent development ? in this country at least ? in the rather general adoption of the budgeting method of approach to the problem 14 Dr. Holmes has called this the Method of Estimation ; Dr. Black has called it the Method of Substitution . While this is a recent development in the United States the budgeting or " advance-estimate " method of approach has been used for a century or more in Germany . Dr. Walter J. Roth , who spent last year in Europe studying methods of procedure in farm management research there , says there is practically a unanimity of feeling on the part of German farm-management workers as to the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach it is necessary to study the results to be expected from the numerous possible combinations of enterprises and resources of a farm in the light of changing price relationships and in the light of the physical conditions under which production takes place as well as in the light of the managerial capacity of the operator and the practices he uses . In some research studies made to date too little attention has been given to the question of which of the many factors of production is most limited and around which the organization might most profitably be built . Most of the budgeting studies have been made on the basis of footnote , 4 The method of budgeting as developed in this country was first lirescatted by the author about 1922 in an address delivered at Asheville , North Carolina . Later it was presented in Research Bulletin No. 1 , Bureau of 1 ? conomie Research , N. C. State College . Raleigh , N.

There have been some significant recent developments in the procedure of determining input-output relationships and it is to be hoped that developments will continue until generally applicable results . are available . Procedure for measuring the managerial capacity of the farm operator , and for determining the relation between his ability to cope with the problems of proprietorship and the most profitable system of farming for him , has not yet begun to take form . 2 . The Development in European Countries Germany . Farm management , as a distinct study , is somewhat older in Europe than in the United States . The first indications of any realization of the function of farm management are found iu the writings of European agriculturists in the early part of the nineteenth century . At the outset , development was slow and hesitant , but important advancements were made during the last decades of l lie century . This was parI icularly true in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest development among the European count lies . It is to be noted , too , that , in Germany , the study is over a century old , dating back to the writing and works of Albrecht D. Thaer in the early part of the nineteenth century . Another early German writer was Heinrich von Thuenen , whose contributions were also in the form of new methods and subjects rather than of any direct , work . But during  | the latter part of the nineteenth century , the work begun by Thaer and Von Thuenen was revived and carried forward by other students , chiefly Von der Goltz , Kraemer , and Pohl . In the meantime , individual phases of the problem , especially systems of accounting and principles of proprietorship on large estates , had received special attention and had been developed extensively . In the last part of the nineteenth century Von der Goltz developed a new line of approach , considerably broader than that suggested by Thaer or Von Thuenen . Nevertheless it failed to develop fully the ideas later embodied in the writing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der Goltz , formulated a new approach to farm management . Aereboe 's experiences with the Division of Accounting of the Agricultural Society ( Berlin ) and as manager of various large estates were instrumental in forming his ideas and methods of approach . According to one of his principles he considers the farm as requiring a biological study . He stresses the mutual relationship between the individual farm enterprises , and discounts cost accounting as a method of approach to the problem of organization . Cost accounting , according to Aereboe , is an unsatisfactory and an insufficient method , because " it dissects the body of the farm in an anatomical manner , and in so doing kills it for the purpose of real study of economic efficiency . " 15 He does not deny the value of cost accounting entirely but suggests the use of it for control of farm business and not for the final measure of economic efficiency . Aereboe 's concept of the field as a whole is that " Farm Economics has to do with the farm as an organic entity in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the individual enterprise comes out , considering only the service to the whole . . . . High physical production from plants or animals never is an end in itself , but merely a means to an end . It must assign a disadvan- footnote 15 Stippler . " Philosophy of Aereboe as Related to Scope and Moil ul of Roseareh in Farm Management . "  | tageous place to one crop in order to give another one a better plan and thereby enhance the income from the farm . " In the individual phases of the study of farm organization Aereboe outlines ' some general principles : As a starting point for his investigations of farm organization , Aereboe takes first the existing accommodations ( resources of the farm ) and the available labor . All the existing accommodations must be brought into full utilization and in such manner as to make continued use of the available labor . After that he explains the combinations and correlations of the different methods of cultivation , the individual crops , and the means of utilization of all products in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explanation of the most suitable forms of organization for the best use of the factors of production , including the land itself . He investigates the different forms of organization from different angles and under varying conditions . Much space is devoted by Aereboe lo the influence of price upon the forms of organization and land utilization . Tn his discussions he consciously places the influence of the economic situation , especially the influence of sale prices and product ion costs upon the form of agriculture , ahead of the influence of natural conditions . On an extensive area and over a period of time the influence of the farmer is of greater importance than the latter . The discussion of the influence of the natural conditions upon farm organization includes the influence of heat , precipitation , soil , etc . This discussion is followed by explanations of the influence of the status of technique , of the legal conditions attending property rights , and of the distribution ; md location of the fields 16 In Germany today , we find a fairly well rounded field of farm management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Problems relating to other branches of agricultural economics , including marketing and land tenure , have been more pressing in their demands on the research worker , but the study of management as an economic approach has made rapid strides . German economists who are also familiar with American methods of approach consider the German approach as deductive and the American as inductive . Thus , Sigmund von Frauendorfer states : " On the German side , there is an intuitive ' grasp of truth and a never-failing sense for systematic arrangement . " In Germany there is , however , more ten- footnote I pages 601 ( 102.  | sion between the farmer and the scientist than in America , a tension caused largely by intellectual pride , which often makes collaboration between the two a peculiar problem . Switzerland . Ernst Laur , the principal farm economist in Switzerland , is an exponent of cost accounting as an approach to the farm management problem . In Switzerland , systems of accounting were in use during the nineteenth century , and were supervised by the Government or carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of these accounts in recent years , developed his theories at the same time as Aereboe developed his in Germany . But , unlike Aereboe , Laur took the problems of the small farmer as his basis for analysis of farm management problems and advocated independent cost accounting analysis 17 of individual enterprises as the foundation for business analysis and production guidance of the farm . His approach is of special significance because it is distinctly different from that advanced by Aereboe and also because it has been followed by many of the smaller countries in Europe , notably Denmark , Sweden , and Norway . The distinction between Aereboe 's and Laur 's ideas is well stated by Holmes : 18 These two Aereboe and Lauri are at considerable variance in their conception of the farm management problem , particularly the theory and practice of farm business analysis . Aereboe , who has held teaching and research positions in various German universities and has had successful experience in practical estate management , has for many years conducted a farm accounting service for the proprietors of German estates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large scale operator . On the other hand , Laur , for many years professor of rural economics at the Zurich Polytechnic , who as secretary of the Union Suisso des Paysans has supervised an account keeping service for Swiss peasant farmers and conducted researches in farm accounting and farm management , takes the problems of the small farmer as his basis for analysis of farm management problems . On the technical side Laur is ? footnote 77 it should be noted that Lnnr ' , , theories are not , unlike the early Anal. - lean works , especially those of Spillman , warren , and their disciples . " Holmes , " Farm Management " ' rages 112 113.  | an ardent supporter of detailed and independent cost accounting analysis of the various separate enterprises making up the farm business as the foundation for business analysis and production guidance ; whereas Aereboe conceives of the farm as a closely knit organism and regards the effort at financial analysis of the production of an individual crop or class of livestock as artificial and misleading . England . Interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young , a contemporary of Thaer , traveled widely and wrote much on farming . His published treatises based largely on observations made while traveling in England and on the Continent are concerned largely with farm proprietorship . In this there is a similarity to the case method of research today , but , of course , it is a much more shallow treatment . In England , as in many other countries , more urgent interest in other problems has taken the time of scientists who might have developed farm management . After the Napoleonic Wars , English agriculturists were deeply concerned over the tariff ; and , after that was settled , they were concerned with the problem of land tenure . Progress in farm management investigations has been relatively rapid , however , during the last few years . A number of research institutions which have considered farm management as a major problem have been set up . The Agriculture Economic Research Institute , organized in 1931 at Oxford University , is , perhaps , the most notable of these . Cost of production studies constitute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problems of broader scope have received minor emphasis in comparison to " costing , " as the cost work is called in England . It is not to be understood that the economists engaged in research do not use other approaches . C. S. footnote Orwin , one of the most prominent writers on agricultural economics in England today , in a discussion of the three methods of approach ? costing , the survey method , and financial accounts ? brings out the fact that all three aim nt the sane object : and at the same principles of analysis . There appears to he a growing interest in the statistical  | analyses and a demand that they be published in conjunction with the publication of recommendations from economists based on interpretation of statistical data . The " case " method has also been used and is considered of significance in some instances . Cost of production studies , however , retain their place of importance . Witness , for example , the concluding statement of Mr. Orwin in a recent article : " Clearly , for a great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much longer . I urge them to consider , each one for himself , in the light of his own circumstances , the possibility of the reduction of costs by concentration on the production of each commodity in the cheapest possible way , considered entirely by itself . In so doing , I assure them that I am not expressing an armchair opinion . I am drawing solely on the experience of men who are farming successfully in the English countryside today . " 1 ? One sees in this brief statement the stress put on cost of production , the anatomical manner in which the farm business is analyzed , and , at the same time , an illustrative use of the case method instead of the statistical analysis approach . Russia.20 The situation in Russia has been , since the Revolution , a highly dynamic one . Unfortunately , there is no book or article available on the specific subject of farm management , but sufficient material is available to develop a fairly satisfactory account of farm organization and management in the U. S. S. R. To understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude and point of view of the Russian leaders . Although the leading members of the Russian Communist Party are inveterate theorists , they are at the same time intensely practical . The chief aim of the Russian Communist Party is an increase in productive effi0 Orwin , " Cutting the Farmer 's Costs . " 20 Material on Russian farm management is widely scattered . See " Economic Life of Soviet Russia " by Calvin Hoover ; New Russia 's Primer by M. Ilin ; " Applied Marxism in Soviet Russia " by G. Tuckerman.  | ciency and the creation of environment suitable for the development and advancement of communism . Obviously , these objectives are not always in harmony , and the Communist leaders do not hesitate to sacrifice one temporarily to hasten the attainment of the other . This explains why their plans and counterplans go forward with such lightning-like changes . In the United States and other capitalistic nations the main objective of farming is to obtain the maximum net economic returns . If , for example , the medium-sized farms are more productive than large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate medium-sized farms . If agricultural cooperatives are able to operate more efficiently than private businesses , they should immediately be developed . 1 f they fail to accomplish their objective , they are abandoned . If mechanization of agriculture contributes to greater production and profit , it is employed ; if not , it , too , is abandoned . However , in Russia , large farms , collective agriculture , and mechanization are not merely means by which productivity may be increased ; they are objectives in themselves of equal if not greater importance than the increase in productivity . These objectives together with the extirpation of private property were , according to the Russian leaders , necessary to the creation of a communistic state . The acquisition of private property by the Soviet was by no means complete at , the close of the Revolution . It is true that a degree was promulgated to the effect , but the peasants ( muzhik ) were permitted to retain their land and control their production . Likewise , the class of comparatively rich peasants ( kulaki ) , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , and employed labor . In 1930 , however , Stalin thought that the time had come to eliminate capitalistic elements from farming . In the place of the individual agriculture the government demanded the setting up of collective farms ( kolkhozi ) of the artel type . This procedure was to get , rid of capitalistic farming . A sec-  | oudary objective was an increase in economic productivity . If economic productivity had been the major objective , then the kulaki , rather than the poor and inefficient peasant ( bedniaki ) , would have been the nucleus about which the new system would have been developed . According to the communistic doctrine , the environment most suitable to the flourishing of communism is a mechanistic one . The proletarian who is divorced from ownership must form , according to communistic beliefs , the basis for communism ; and all peasants must be brought within this class . Consequently , state farms ( sovhozi , ) were organized on a mechanized basis to serve as models for the kolkhozi . Tractor stations were set up to serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase productivity ; but again this was not the major objective of the change . The chief end in view was the creation of a mechanized rural environment and a development of the kolkhozi agricultural class . It is evident , therefore , that farm management in Russia is on a much different basis from that in capitalistic countries . Instead of one objective , the obtaining of maximum economic returns , there are in Russia three distinct but related objectives : namely , the extirpation of private property , the increase in physical productivity , and the creation of an environment suitable to the development and maintenance of communism . Soviet farms are divided into three classes : ( 1 ) state farms ( sovhozi ) , which are primarily utilized for demonstration purposes , although they furnish a convenient supply of grain for export purposes ; ( 2 ) collective farms ( kolkhozi ) ; and ( 3 ) such individual operations as are still carried on . There are three types of the kolkhozi , ( a ) the tovarishchevstvo , or comradeship farms , in which certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artel , in which farming operations are carried on collectively but in which the members live in their own houses and own their own consumption goods ; ( c ) the commune , in which not only farming but living is done in  | a collective fashion . Of these forms the artel is the most dominant . The communization of agriculture has not taken place as rapidly as the foregoing setup might indicate and certainly not as rapidly as has communization of industry . There are several reasons for this . In industry there already existed a small technical staff which could be called upon to assist the Soviet Government . Such a staff did not exist iii agriculture . Again the Soviet Government found that it could readily employ foreign technical aid in industry but was unable to obtain from foreign countries persons with experience and ability to carry on the agricultural program . hence , in carrying out the agricultural program many mistakes have been made . For example , many of the tractors for fanning purposes were shoddily built , and no staff was available to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators to run the tractors . As a result there were always , at least in the early stages of the program , a large number of tractors out of use . Another factor affecting the program was the suspiciousness of the peasants themselves , which resulted in a frequent killing and consuming of livestock . It was estimated that about one third of all of the livestock in Russia was lost after the agricultural program was announced . Several ludicrous attempts were made to overcome the meat shortage . For example , in or near many of the large cities rabbit farms were established . These enterprises , however , invariably failed because of the outbreak of disease for which there was no adequate control . To overcome food shortage , other ambitious plans were undertaken . In the case of wheat , more acreage was planted Haan could be cultivated , and yields fell disastrously . Also in the earlier years of the program inadequate crop rotat ion resulted in much damage from insect pests , plant diseases , and weeds . t must he said , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily . Livestock is increas-  | ing , and the government is making a strenuous effort to improve breeds of livestock by importing foreign stock . A trained , personnel is being developed for the handling of the tractors and other farm machinery . The individual strips have been abolished , and thus much land which was formerly wasted has been put into cultivation . The system of paying for labor in the kolkhozi has been changed . Instead of day labor unadjusted for skill required on all tasks , the labor today is now adjusted for the various elements of the work . Few other European countries have had significant independent developments . Problems relating to specific enterprises or parts of the farming system have received individual treatment , but advancement along that line can not be strictly considered farm management research . Systematic accounting under government or private supervision , political economy , marketing problems , and technical problems have diverted scientific agriculturists from any attack on farm management as a specific study .

As one observer has stated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one . ' This critic points out that the farmer does not keep books ; he does not prepare a budget ; he does not distinguish between personal outlays and outlays for crop and livestock expenditures . That the farmer fails to do these things is not surprising . As long as farming retains vestiges of selfsufficiency , it may be expected that farmers will be somewhat indifferent to the economic aspects of their business . Still , returns from farming are affected to a marked degree by economic forces ; and the alert farmers , of whom there are a considerable number , may gain much in the way of enhanced returns by a careful study of the forces and conditions affecting the organization and management of their farms . The subject will be introduced by a discussion of the nature of the problem of organization , leaving those problems relating to management for subsequent treatment . 1 .

Arrangements must be made for the disposition of production after commodities have been brought into existence . In farming , 1 his may mean the inclusion in the farm setup of various classes of livestock , as some farm products can not be marketed in their original form . Or , in the event that the products can be marketed directly , it might be more profitable to dispose of them through livestock . It thus happens that to produce a good requires something else besides the three primary factors ? land , labor , and capital . This something else is organization . More specifically , organization refers to the arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which these various elements are combined . Organization obviously includes also the acquisition of various factors of production , the selection of the line or lines of production , the size of the business , . and the choosing of the site or location of the farm with respect to the markets as well as with respect to the availability of the factors used in production . Then , too , there is the problem of checking on the results of production . This means that in setting up an efficient organization , provision should be made for records and accounts . In short , organization must provide for all of those things necessary to the production and marketing of a product . This complex thing which is called organization can not , of course , come into being of itself . There must be some one individual or group of individuals who are responsible for the existence of any business organization . This responsibility can not rest with the laborer , because laborers , as a rule , do not possess the necessary qualifications and in addition can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task falls to a rather definite class of individuals commonly referred to as business undertakers or entrepreneurs . The entrepreneur is the one who assumes the risks and receives any gains realized from a business .  | 2 . The Selection of the Lines of Production Because agricultural production is greatly affected by seasons , selecting lines of production is of particular interest ; and it probably is more difficult than it is in the case of many manufacturing industries . The problem scarcely arises , at least not in any serious form , when production can be carried on continuously and at a relatively uniform rate . But agricultural production is not carried on at a uniform rate throughout the year . There are periods of intense activity and periods of comparative inactivity . The seasonality of agricultural production prevents specialization to any large extent . The farmer , therefore , must , as a rule , engage in the production of several commodities in order to utilize his resources effectively . The decision of the farmer as an entrepreneur with respect to the selection of the lines of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The amount and character of his available resources . In some cases the quality of the land may be the important factor affecting choice of lines of production . In some situations the amount of labor supply may be more important than land or any other factor . Or it may be that equipment is the limiting factor . These may be , as will be pointed out later , interdependent . That is , the nature of the land may affect the use of machinery and labor , but here emphasis is placed on the extent or availability of any or all of the farmer 's resources . b . The nature of the physical condition . The physical factors of soil , topography , temperature , and rainfall affect the choice of farm enterprise . It is now well known that some soils are much better adapted than others to the production of particular crops . It is one of the tasks of the entrepreneur to know just what the soil requirement of each crop is and to make the best soil-crop adaption that the circumstances permit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various classes of  | livestock must be studied before the various lines are chosen . Topography affects the choice of crops largely through its effect on the type of machinery which may be used , although there are other things to be considered . For example , topography affects air drainage , and this , in turn , affects the crops which may be produced . ( See Chapter V , Section 1 , for a more detailed discussion of these factors. ) c . The distance from market and the type of transportation facilities available . These are factors of supreme significance in the selection of crops and classes of livestock . They express themselves largely through the cost of transportation . Some farm crops , because of the excessive cost of transportation , must be converted into livestock products . When this is the case , the choice of enterprise must of necessity involve various types of livestock . But the effect of cost of transportation may not be confined to those crops which must be converted into livestock products . It affects also the choice of all crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bulkiness and perishability , and t hose affect the cost of transportation . It is essential then to know what transportation costs are or are likely to be and how these costs will affect the return from both crop and livestock products before making the final selection of enterprises to be included in any given enterprise combina Iion . ( See Chapter V , Section 2. ) d . Market demand as reflected in the relative prices of farm products . It is the relative prices of farm products and not their absolute prices which are important in selecting enterprises . When price is the only consideration in choosing lines of production , an absolute uniform rise or fall of all commodities is of no particular significance in selection . Such a rise or fall will , of course , affect the net income but will not constitute the basis of selection . But when the prices of some , commodities rise or fall more rapidly than others , such phenomena are of importance . Other things being equal , the entrepreneur will do well to sc'Ierl those commodities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of falling prices to select those commodities the prices of which fall least rapidly . The movement in prices , then , is a subject which must be given particular attention by the entrepreneur if a wise choice of enterprise is to be made . Not only is this true , but such a study is essential if the enterprise combination is to be adjusted quickly with the changes in the relative prices of farm products . e . The character of the lines of production and the way in which these fit together . Farm enterprises may be competitive , supplementary , or complementary . When they are competitive , they compete with each other for the use of the factors of production . When this is the case , the entrepreneur will have to select those enterprises which appear to be most profitable . But this procedure is not always advisable because one of the several competitive enterprises may have a complementary relation with some other enterprise . By complementary relation is meant the power an enterprise possesses to assist in the utilization of another enterprise . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors of production , may be fed to hogs . Corn and hogs combined may be more profitable than tobacco . Farm enterprises may be supplementary or noncompetitive in that they do not compete for the factors of production , or if they do compete , the competition is not a serious problem for the entrepreneur . Oats and corn supplement each other in that they may be planted , cultivated , and harvested at different times during the growing season . Thus enterprises which possess this characteristic are often introduced into the scheme of production because they may enable the farmer to utilize resources which otherwise would be wasted . By the introduction of these enterprises land may be more fully utilized ; labor , which would be wasted , may be used ; and nonmarketable feed may be consumed profitably . Enterprises may be competitive in certain seasons and supplementary in other seasons or at different  | times in the same season . For example , corn and alfalfa often compete with labor during corn cultivation in June and again during silo-filling time . But corn silage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than compensate for conflicting demands for labor . f . The risk involved . Each line or continuation of lines must be viewed from the risks involved either from variations in yields or from variations in prices . g . Personal factors . The farmer will and should give some consideration to his own peculiar fitness for the production of the various lines open to him and also to his likes and dislikes . 3 . The Acquisition of the Factors of Production a . Land . A problem of increasing significance to the farmer is the acquisition of land . There was a time when land could be obtained free , or at a small cost . Indeed , the area of our public domain was so vast that the supply seemed almost inexhaustible , but the disposition of the public domain was so rapid that by 1890 good free land in the humid region of the United States had been practically exhausted . Soon after the private acquisition of these free lands , and more than keeping pace with our increase in population , farm lands showed , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The movement toward higher land prices means t hat farmers in general face a much more difficult problem of acquiring land now than they did a generation ago . Of course , farmers need not buy land in order to obtain control ; they may rent it , and many farmers do rent the land they footnote 2 For example , from 1850 to 1890 the average value increased from $11.14 Itt $2121 per acre , or an increase of 91 per cent . The rapid settlement of our public lands and the consequent overproduction of agricultural products with a general downward movement in prices of commodities resulted in the agricultural depression of thy ' early nineties . As a consequence , land prices did not increase ( luring the period from 1890 to 1900 . From 1900 to 19920 land prices increased rapidly . For the United States as a whole the increase was 257 per cent . Since 1920 prices have fallen . Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station , Bullclin 240.  | operate . But rents have shown a tendency to rise also . ' Whether a farmer rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents are rising or falling , the farmer has a real problem in the acquisition of land . This means that special attention must be given to the problems involved , such as the quality of the land , the location , the price , the terms , the time when a farm should be purchased , and the nature of the lease in case of renting . b . Labor . It has been pointed out that the farm family is the chief source of labor . ( See Chapter I. ) From this statement , however , it should not be understood that the farmer has no problem in obtaining labor . While it is true that as compared with industry the farmer hires comparatively little labor , he finds it difficult at times to command hired labor at prices which he can afford to pay . This being so , the farmer has the difficult task of making the prospective laborer accept lower wages than are acceptable in urban centers by providing such inducements as good food , pleasant living quarters , reasonable hours of work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare not usually exhibited by the urban entrepreneur . But these things may not be enough . The farmer will have to show expert judgment in handling his laborers and in the assignment of tasks in order that each laborer may have confidence in and respect for the farmer . Finally , the idea must always be kept before each laborer that his status as a farm laborer is only temporary and that the able , thrifty laborer may advance to tenancy and , finally , to ownership . It is by such means , honestly applied , that the farm entrepreneur may acquire efficient farm laborers and retain their good will and confidence . c . Capital . Faced with growing scarcity of land and labor , the farmers have turned increasingly to the use of capital in the form of fertilizers and improved machinery and equipment . The acquisition of these presents certain footnote " See IT . S. Department of Agriculture , Bulletin No. 1224 , p. 32.  | problems . Aside from the technological problems as to the kind of fertilizer and machinery best adapted to peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All forms of capital are expensive . Furthermore , the farmer , as a rule , does not possess the ready cash with which to buy fertilizer , machinery , and equipment . This means that he must use credit . But farm credit for the purchase of these factors of production is expensive . The farmer , of course , may acquire machinery and equipment by renting , but only to a limited extent . In the case of capital , as in the acquisition of land and labor , the farmer has a problem , and by no means an easy one , to solve . d . Entrepreneurship . In this connection , the acquisition of managerial ability deserves consideration . The fact has been mentioned ( Chapter I ) that farmers have not attended school to any large extent , and this , no doubt , has been a factor in fixing their present economic status . - The farmer has had to acquire his training in the art and business of management largely from experience . Normally , until after a long apprenticeship as a hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some neighbor , the prospective farmer does not get an opportunity to test his managerial capacity and efficiency . After this apprenticeship he may rent a farm ; and , if he has been successful in acquiring some resources of his own , including a ' good reputation , he may be able to buy a farm . In his new status as a proprietor his managerial ability is thoroughly tested . If he fails , he may be forced back into tenancy or even out of farming altogether . If , on the other hand , he succeeds , he may discover that the size of his economic unit is not well adjusted to his capacity as a manager . This may mean the renting of additional land or the purchase of a larger farm . Entrepreneural problems other than the problem of adjusting the size of the unit.to his capacity may , and usually do , present themselves . The proper solution of many organization and management problems is essential to the success of the , farmer 's business . Evidently , then , the ac-  | quisition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given consideration . 4 . The Scheme of Production The utilization of the various factors of production is affected to a marked degree by the general scheme or plan of production . In farming , partly because the size of the business is small and partly also because agricultural production is seasonal , planning of the production program is at once difficult and important . The various enterprises of the farm may compete with , supplement , or complement each other . In planning the general production program , therefore , these different relationships must be considered and taken advantage of . This may be done by ( a ) developing a definite but flexible cropping system , ( b ) by adding certain kinds of livestock enterprises , and ( c ) by developing a good farm layout . These can not be accomplished independently of each other . The cropping system can not be developed without consideration being given to the type of livestock which is to be maintained . The farm layout or arrangement of fields and buildings , as to both character and location , must likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of livestock enterprises . The farm plan must be projected and developed with the object in view of obtaining the maximum net returns from the business as a whole . 5 . The Combination of the Factors of Production This is a problem of paramount importance . It is a problem which every entrepreneur has to face , and the manner in which it is solved determines to no small extent the success of the business . The problem is a difficult one because it involves technical practices and economic principles . The problem of combining the factors is usually emphasized in the case of the individual enterprises . Such considerations as the amount , of fertilizer that should ) e used per acl.e , the number of nines corn should be cultivated ,  | or the quantity of feed that should be used per unit of livestock , all relate to the combination of the several factors . The combination of the various factors which appear " best " when viewed from the results obtainable from a single enterprise may not be the best when there are several enterprises all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer may find that it will pay to skimp on one enterprise and use the factors more freely on some other enterprise . It is for this reason that the results from experiments conducted on a single enterprise are often misleading . In many cases the farmer will reject , and rightly , the advice of the technical expert , because he finds it better to utilize a particular factor in some other way than that recommended . In combining the several factors , either in the production of a given crop or livestock product or in projecting the production for the farm as a whole , the farmer will be influenced by : ( a ) the quantity and quality of those factors over which he has control , ( b ) the relative cost of those factors , ( c ) the prices or anticipated prices of the resulting products , and ( d ) the various minimum technical requirements . If the farmer is short on land , for example , and can not obtain additional acreage , he may find it necessary to increase some other factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the cost of land is relatively high , he may find it advantageous to use more of the other factors on relatively few acres . The particular combination will also be influenced by the price of the product ; that is , the combination of the several factors will probably be changed as the prices of the resulting products change . Finally , the minimum technical requirements will affect the combination . In many instances there are minimum requirements in feed , seed , and fertilizer , below which it does not pay to go . The best results will be obtained if the farm business is so organized that production can be kept adjusted to the anticipated market demands . That , is to say , the whole business must be organized so that an increase or a decrease  | in production can be made at the proper time and at a relatively low cost . This is really a management problem ; but an organizer must set up an organization that can be operated at different capacities , without involving too many radical changes in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met by dividing the whole establishment into definite units , each unit being an independent one insofar as the production processes are concerned . If a decrease is desirable , one or more units may he shut down . Or again , the machines may be run at different capacities . Whatever methods or particular means are employed , flexibility in production must be provided for . Flexibility may be attained in several ways . One way is to organize the farm on what has been called the unit sysl cm . Taylor describes this system as follows : On the great wheat fields in California the unit may be based upon the combined harvester and thresher . This machine , the crew to operate it and the land , men , horses , and other equipment required to raise that amount of wheat which can be cut during the normal harvest period may here make up the unit of organization . In the Corn Belt of Central Illinois , where corn is the principal source of income , one can and a team of from two to four horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a corn cultivator suited to the horse power decided upon I Become the basic unit of organization . This same unit , with the addition of a grain seeder , a binder , and a mower will care for oats and hay in combined amounts equal to the area of corn handled . The area of corn which this one man and equipment can prepare the land for , plant , and keep clean for subsidiary purposes , becomes the unit of economic farm organization . One or many of these units may make up : a given farm , depending upon the managerial ability of the farmer , the conditions in the household , and the size of the family labor force . In t he Corn Belt a farm which will not employ one unit is clearly too small . To be of proper size the farm should make demand for one , two , three , or more of these units , but should not fall halfway between . A farm which is too large for one man and too small for two can not be economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are open to the farmer . Ile may often use machines which are not highly specialized ; that is , these machines may be used for more than footnote Taylor , Outlines of Apricultioalt Economics , p. 175.  | one purpose so that a change in production need not involve a radical change in equipment . Instead of using one large machine , he may use two or more of the same design but of smaller capacity . These smaller units can be added or abandoned , depending on whether or not production is to be increased or decreased . Buildings may be of such construction as to be readily adapted to changes in production . The cropping system may be made flexible by substituting a short rotation for a rotation which extends over a long period of time . The livestock production may be projected on a basis which will permit a decrease or an increase in relatively short periods . Whatever may be the means employed , the organization must be flexible in order that adjustments in production may be made in anticipation of changing market conditions . 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the farm are sold , there is in the case of most farms a sufficient volume of sales to make it well worth while for farmers to establish market outlets for the things to be sold . This does not mean that a sales contract is necessary , although there is often one . It means that the farmer should have a knowledge of market conditions ? the trend in production , the demand for the various agricultural products , and other market information which normally affects the production and disposition of farm products . Market connections for the things he has to buy are also important . He should know the approximate cost for which he can obtain his labor , seed , fertilizer , and other cost goods . 7 . The System of Records and Accounts The successful operation of a business of any considerable size requires a knowledge of present and past performances . This knowledge is best acquired not by depending upon the memory of those charged with the task of operating the business but through a day to day systeematic. recording  | of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records not only by enterprises but also by individual workmen . It may also mean time or machine records for the purpose of determining how long it takes an individual workman or a machine to do a certain operation . A record should be made of all receipts and expenditures not only on the business as a whole but by subdivisions of the business , such as departments or enterprises . These are not solely for the purpose of showing the loss or gain for the business but for the purpose of determining where losses were incurred or where gains were made in order that the proper steps can be taken to remedy any evident defect in 1 he operation or organization of the business . The need for adequate records and accounts is generally recognized in commercial and industrial business , but the vast majority of farmers keep meager , if indeed any , records of business . Records and accounts , however , are essential 1 o the successful operation and organization of a farm . Farm records and accounts , when properly conceived and kept , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production it will pay best to follow , ( b ) how to organize the lines of production so as to utilize to the best advantage the factors of production , ( c ) how to aid in making adjustments , and ( d ) how to give information which may be used in increasing efficiency . These do not , by any means , exhaust the use to which the data collected by accounting may be put , but they do indicate the necessity for the provision of an adequate system of records and accounts if the farm is to he run in a businesslike manner .

Bulletin 1224.  | Factors Affecting the Choice of Farm Enterprises THE selection of enterprises on a given farm will in general be governed by the law of comparative adyantage This law may be stated in terms of farming as follows : A farmer , in order to use his available resources to the best advantage , will produce those crops or classes of livestock for which his farm has a comparative advantage . There is considerable confusion as to the exact meaning of this law , because the word comparative is apparently not always understood . Often the idea is expressed that comparison is made between the same crops in different areas or on different farms in the same area , but this is not the case . The comparison is made between different enterprises in the same area or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinction clear . Iowa farmers specialize in corn production , not because Ibis crop can be produced more cheaply in Iowa than in some other section of the United States ? although such may indeed be true ? but because labor , land , capital , and management can be more effectively used in the production of corn than in the production of any other crop which may be grown . Even if it might be shown , for instance , that corn could be produced with less cost in the Cotton Belt , Ibis fact would have no significance to the Iowa farmer because it is not the cost between areas that is significant but the relative cost of producing different products in the same area . Those crops which can be produced with less cost within the area will have first choice on the farmer 's labor , land , capital , and management . Hence , Iowa farm-63  | ers find it more profitable to devote as much time as possible to the production of corn and then to supplement corn production with other crops or classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another example may be given : It is generally conceded that cotton can be produced more cheaply in Texas than in North Carolina . From this fact it has been argued that North Carolina farmers should not attempt to produce cotton but should grow other commodities . The idea is fallacious . While it may be true that Texas is in a more favorable position with respect to the production of cotton than North Carolina , the thing that North Carolina farmers are concerned with is the kind of crop or crops that might be grown in place of cotton . The question might be put in this form : What other crop or crops can the North Carolina farmer produce to a better advantage than he can cotton ? If there is no other crop that can be grown more profitably than cotton , then the farmers in North Carolina will continue to produce cotton even if the cost is higher than in Texas . In other words , what it costs to produce cotton in Texas has little or nothing to do with whether or not farmers in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas is sufficient to grow all of the cotton required for the world consumption at a price so low that cotton production in North Carolina will not cover supplementary costs , there is no point in comparing the costs of producing cotton in Texas and in North Carolina . In the event that Texas could produce all of the cotton required , at a price so low that cotton in other sections of the Belt would be reduced to a position where some other crop would be more profitable , then the cotton production in Texas would have some significance to the farmers in other areas . It is evident , of course , that any expansion of cotton production in Texas may reduce the net income of cotton farmers in other sections of the South . But until cotton production becomes so great in Texas and cotton prices become so low as to make cotton of secondary importance to  | farmers in other sections of the Sough , they will continue to grow cotton as their principal crop . The comparative advantage of a given group of a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm is determined by a number of factors . Some of these are physical in character , such as climate , soil , and topography . Others are economic , as the relative prices of various products and obviously the relative cost of producing the various commodities . Political policies of one kind or another usually affect the comparative advantage of crops or livestock products . Thus a discriminatory tariff may advance a product to a position of importance and relegate others to a position of unimportance . Social conditions , especially those affecting social customs and traditions , often have a peculiar bearing upon comparative advantage . 1 . Some Physical Determinants of Choice a . Climate . Climate plays an important role in both crop and livestock production . It rarely happens that two crops or classes of livestock have exactly the same climatic requirements for optimum production . By optimum is meant the peculiar combination of rainfall , temperature , humidity , and sunshine which will result in the maximum production as to both quality and quantity . The combina1 ions of climatic factors for optimum production are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainfall 1 hroughout the growing season combined with moderately high daily temperatures and a large number of partially cloudy days . Another crop may require an abundant rainfall throughout the growing season combined with moderately low daily temperature and a large number of partially cloudy days . To illustrate , cotton requires a long , rather hot growing season combined with frequent rainfalls fairly well distributed throughout the growing season and a large number of cloudless days . For optimum results in the case of colt on the rainfall should occur in the late afternoon or at night . Corn reaches optimum production when rainfall is  | abundant and when the growing season is relatively short and hot . Grass crops , as a rule , require a cool climate combined with an abundant rainfall and a large number of partially cloudy days . Grain crops differ widely in their climatic requirements . Oats , for example , require a cool , moist climate ; wheat requires a rather cool growing season , but it is not so dependent as oats upon the amount of moisture . Climate may affect crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the amount of rainfall or by marked changes in temperature during certain periods . For example , heavy rainfall coming at the time of harvesting of dewberries is usually disastrous . On the other hand , an occasional heavy rainfall during cotton harvesting season is not serious . The reason for this is simple enough . Dewberries are a highly perishable crop and must be harvested in a very limited period or they will become a total loss . Cotton , on the other hand , being a less perishable crop and having a longer harvesting season , is not seriously affected by an occasional heavy rainfall . b . Soil . The effect of soil on agricultural production has long been recognized . Some crops for optimum production require a light , dry soil ; others , a heavy soil well supplied with organic matter ; still others , a medium soil only fairly well supplied with organic matter . Corn , for example , requires a soil well supplied with organic matter and sufficiently heavy to retain plant food . This crop , of course , will grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the expense of production on such soils is usually too great for profitable production . Cotton for optimum results requires a light soil in which considerable organic matter is desirable but not absolutely necessary , as commercial fertilizers may be used to supply the necessary plant food . Grain crops , as a rule , do not require as rich a soil as does corn . If the land is too fertile , the grain crops tend to produce more straw than grain . And in the case of grain crops a rapid growth may cause lodging , thereby decreasing  | the grain output . Tobacco is a crop especially sensitive to soil conditions . The quality of tobacco is determined in a large measure by the type of soil . For example , the most desirable type of flue-cured tobacco is produced on light soil or on sandy barns having yellow or red subsoil with a small amount of clay . Burley tobacco reaches its best development in the limestone soils . Alfalfa is a forage crop requiring for best results a soil rich in lime . Other legumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not especially noted for their lime content . Other examples will occur to the reader . There is a correlation , which has long been noted , between the type of soil and the type of livestock . For example , the noted horse-breeding sections of the world are areas in which I he soil is well supplied with lime . c . Topography . Topography affects the production of some crops more than of others ; and today topography is more important than formerly . In the days when agricultural production was carried on largely by means of hand t cols , such as the hoe , the sickle , and the cradle , topography was not an important factor . With the advent of powerdrawn equipment , such as the gang plow , riding cultivator , and reaping machine , rough land , which was formerly tilled , has gradually been abandoned or devoted to an entirely different type of production . Wheat at one time was grown on the hilly farms of New England , but it is now no longer grown as the principal crop in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself admirably to machine methods of production in the stages of both seeding and harvesting ; hence , other things being equal , wheat will be produced on level or gently rolling land rather than on rough land or steep hillsides . In general , and as a result of the introduce ion of power machinery , in either small or large units , much of the rough land formerly cultivated has now been abandoned or is devoted to crops which require the minimum ' manna of care or to some crops to which such modern machinery can not be readily applied . Topography ex-  | plains , in part at least , why wheat production in the United States has shifted from the hilly terrain of New England to the level plains of the West . Topography is important for another reason . The type of soil on steep hillsides may be such that it is especially subject to erosion . When this is the case , the land must be properly terraced , put in sod , or devoted to some crop which will protect the land from washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , terraces are obstacles which interfere with the economic cultivation of crops ; hence , other things being equal , land which is terraced will be devoted to those crops which require a minimum amount of care and are not adapted to use of modern farm machinery . Courtesy of N. C ' . Dept. of A1/r. caption Livestock production is conditioned by topography . Some classes of livestock are better adapted than others t rough , hilly land or mountainous country . Sheep , as a rule , will do better than cattle on such land ; and goats , still better than sheep . Hogs are not wet suited to rough or hilly laud.  | 2 . Some Economic Determinants of Choice a . Cost of transportation . The peculiar relationship of transportation costs to the geographic distribution of production was first advanced in 1826 by the eminent German scholar Johann Heinrich von Thuenen in a classic treatise entitled Der Isolierte Staat . Von Thuenen observed that two classes of products tend to be produced near or adjacent to consuming centers : ( 1 ) Those products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those possessing a highly perishable nature . Conversely , goods possessing a high specific value or those possessing a durable character tend to be produced in areas remote from the market or from the consuming centers . Other things being the same , the distance from market tends to vary directly with the specific value and 1 he durability of the good . To illustrate his conception of the relationship of transportation to the localization of production , Von Thuenen conceived of a city located in the center of a plain . The soil and climate of this plain were uniform , and the means of moving goods was limited to that of wagons . Using the city as a center , Von Thuenen constructed concentric zones . In the first zone , or in that adjacent to the city , according to Von Thuenen , would be produced commodities which are bulky , that is , possessing a low specific value and which are of a highly perishable nature , such as truck crops . The production in the second zone would consist of less perishable and less bulky products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be potatoes , which might be classed as semiperishable , and milk , which is perishable but less bulky than such products as hay . This might be produced in the first zone in limited quantities . More concentrated products , or those having somewhat high specific value , and products somewhat less perishable would be produced iii the third zone . Examples of this are butter , cheese , poultry , and eggs . As the distance increased from the city , crops such as grain and hay might be produced  | and fed to livestock . Somewhere between the zone producing livestock and the first zone would be a territory devoted to the production of timber , because of the low specific value or the extremely bulky nature of this product . On the extreme outer edge of the area would be the range where livestock would depend entirely on native vegetation for support . To illustrate the effect of changes in transportation on the geographic distribution of production , Von Thuenen next conceived a river flowing through this uniform plain . The zones would no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , however , be divided equally by the city , the distance being greater above than below the city . This would indicate the effect of the flow of the stream on the shape and length of the zones , the theory being that it is much easier to transport products downstream than up ; hence , the distance which products would be shipped in any zone would be greater above than below the city . The Von Thuenenian theory is susceptible in a general way to proof . Around any large city are observed production zones more or less affected by the various means of transportation . Close to the city usually are found products which are relatively bulky or of a highly perishable nature . As the distance from market increases , there is a tendency to produce less bulky products or ones which possess a higher specific value , of which butter , cheese , condensed milk , powdered milk , and pork are examples . On the other hand , bulky products , such as hay , and highly perishable products , such as whole milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . In remote areas bulky products which may be marketed in their native forms are usually transformed into animal products or are changed from a relatively low specific value product into a relatively high specific value product . This change makes it possible for such products more readily to bear transport a.tion cost s . As a general rule , any change iii transportation costs  | affects the comparative advantage of agricultural products . Arbitrary changes in freight rates or rate discrimination may affect the comparative advantage . For this reason these changes are usually undesirable . b . The availability of producing agents . The comparative advantage of a farm enterprise may be determined by the relative abundance or scarcity of one or more of the producing agents . It may be true that the physical condition and other conditions of an area are well suited to the production of a given crop or livestock product , but such a crop or product may not be produced because it may require more capital than is readily available at a cost the farmers can pay . If such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital will not he produced or will be only in limited quantities . In general , when capital costs are high , crops and livestock will he selected not from the standpoint of largest long-time returns but from the immediate or short-time point of view . As a rule , when funds are limited , the production will tend 10 run to annual crops such as corn , oats , and wheat , which will be realized upon in one year or less , even if other crops requiring more investment may be adapted to the region . For the same reason , hogs and poultry will be preferred to milk cows or beef cattle . Poultry may be added to the farm enterprises cheaply , and the returns may be realized quickly . Hog production requires about eighteen months before returns are realized . Milk cows and beef cattle usually require from two to three years before there will be any income derived from them . Similarly , the development of enterprises may be dependent upon labor supply . For instance , an area may be ideal with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strawberries , but , unless the area has a supply of cheap labor which may be used during the picking season , the chances are that the area will not become noted for rt rawberry production . Land , as well as capital and labor , may be a limiting  | factor in agricultural production . As already pointed out ( Section 1 ) , various crops have markedly different soil , topography , and climate requirements . As a result of these varying requirements , some crops are much more limited than others in respect to the territory over which they may be grown . For example , cotton and corn are produced to a considerable extent over the same area , but the area , because of soil , climate , and other factors , is much more limited for cotton than for corn . Where these two crops compete or tend to compete for the same land , cotton , because of the limited territory , will be given first choice . This does not mean that corn will not find a place on farms largely devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it profitable to produce corn for home use , for feed for livestock , especially workstock , and in some instances for feed for productive livestock , especially hogs . Another illustration of the effect of limitation of land is found in the case of potato and corn production . Potatoes may be produced over a much wider territory than corn . That is to say , the land suitable to the production of corn is limited as compared to land suitable to the production of potatoes . It happens that where these two crops compete , the first choice is corn . And , as a result , potato production is forced outside of the area devoted to corn production , just as the corn production is forced outside of the area best suited to cotton production . The personal characteristics of farmers may set definite Iinrits to production . Unquestionably , farmers vary greatly in their attitudes toward crop and livestock production . A crop or class of livestock may be exceptionally suited to a given area , but at present it may be occupying a minor position simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this crop or class of livestock . And , unless fanners of the area become alert or are replaced by others who are , the enterprise will not be developed . In other cases , fanners may have an aversion to the production of verlain crops or livestock products . If so ; such products  | will not be grown even if economic and other conditions justify such a course . The experience of the farmer may be a factor affecting the production of a given commodity . Some crops , notably tobacco , and some livestock products require special training and experience . Unless farmers are able to acquire the necessary technique , products of such a character are not produced although other conditions may be favorable. c . Relation between enterprises . A factor of major significance in determining the comparative advantage of a crop or livestock enterprise and , hence , selection , is the relation between enterprises . Some enterprises compete or conflict for the resources of the farmer . Such enterprises Courtesy of University of Illinois Ayr . Ed p . Ma. caption are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same resources but not all at the same time . These may be called supplementary or nonco'napetinq eater  - -  prises . But this is not the end of the problem . Enterprises may possess certain features which make them valuable in that they contribute , or may be made to contribute ,  | to the productiveness of some other enterprise . When enterprises possess this feature , they are known as complementary enterprises . ( 1 ) Competitive Relations . Agricultural economists , in discussing the nature of competition among enterprises , usually emphasize competition for labor . But the fact should not be overlooked that enterprises may conflict also for land and capital . Competition for land arises out of the obvious fact that two crops can not , as a rule , be grown on the same land at the same time . Competition for labor becomes a matter of considerable concern if the peak load or demand for any two or more crops comes exactly at the same time . ( 2 ) Supplementary Relations . Farm enterprises may be supplementary with respect to all of the factors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one factor . A few examples will be given to emphasize the nature of the relationship . ' Land : ( 1 ) It is characteristic of some plants to feed deeply while others tend to be shallow feeders . If deep and shallow rooted crops can be grown in rotation , it is possible to secure a better utilization of the various elements of plant food . ( 2 ) Plants differ as to percentage of the various elements in plant food which they utilize . A better utilization of all the available elements may be brought about if crops which have different plant food requirements can be grown in rotation . ( 3 ) When two or more crops can be grown on the same land at the same time , there may result a more complete use of the I:ual . This may sometimes be true when a young orchard is planted to truck crops . The production of truck crops does not , as a rule , interfere in any way with the development of the trees , and on the contrary their cultivation may reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some areas two crops may be grown on the same land at different times in the same season . For example , in the cotton belt , , . oybeans or cowpeas may follow oats cut in June . Labor : ( 1 ) The addition of certain enterprises to the farm may be It means of utilizing labor more effectively . The inclusion of dairy rattle for example may provide a better utilization of family labor . The dairy herd might not be profitable if all the labor had to be hired . However , when the labor is furnished by the farmer 's family , the dairy herd furnishes a means of marketing the family labor . ( 2 ) A wood footnote Gray , Agricultural Economics , pp. 129-132.  | crop added to the system of production may utilize more completely the farm labor and equipment , as such a crop e an be harvested when the labor and equipment are not required for field crop or estock production . ( 3 ) The cleaning and disinfecting of seed on the farm during the winter in preparation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this same category would also fall the care and repair of machinery and buildings during the slack periods of the year . Buildings : As a general rule , the main or principal farm buildings may be used jointly by several crop and livestock enterprises . If the farm organization is highly specialized it may mean that some of the building space is not used at all or only part of the year . It is sometimes possible under such conditions to include in the farm organization an enterprise without incurring at the same time any extra building costs . Machinery : The addition of a crop to the farm organization may , in some instances , utilize to a better advantage the farm machinery . This is especially true of farm machinery which is not highly specialized , as harrows , plows , and discs . The addition of one or more crops to the farm organization may , therefore , effect a better utilization of such implements and machines . ( 3 ) Complementary Relations . It has been stated that when one enterprise contributes to the productiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this relation may be made clear by a few illustrations : ( a ) Crop and livestock may be complementary : ( 1 ) It is often feasible to add livestock to the farm organization for the purpose of utilizing unmarketable products , such as roughage , pasturage , damaged grain , or other crops which ordinarily can not be directly marketed at a profit . ( 2 ) One type of livestock may be added to the farm for the purpose of consuming products which otherwise would be wasted by another class of livestock . Hogs are often added to the farm for the purpose of utilizing the corn wasted by steers when the steers are being fed in the dry lot . ( 3 ) Again , one class of livestock may be added to the farm to consume the product of some other enterprise . An illustration of this is found when hogs or poultry are added to . consume skim milk produced on farms where cream or butter is sold . ( 4 ) When livestock is the main enterprise on a farm , manure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may pay the farmer ' to use the manure in growing crops which it would not pay him to grow if ' the manure were not available . ( b ) One crop may be complementary to another crop : ( I Sometimes legumes aid in the production of other crops by adding nitrogen to the soil . Wheat is often used as a nurse crop . ( This relationship , it , should be noted , is also supplementary , as two crops  | are being produced on the same land and at the same time , thus utilizing to a fuller extent the factors of production. ) ( 2 ) Seed from one crop may be used for subsequent crops . ( In part this is also a supplementary relation in that the preparation of the seed for the next year 's growth utilizes labor which would otherwise not be used . ) I:i ) Grain may not be profitable unless grown in rotation with tilled rops . By the introduction of tilled crops weeds are reduced , thus mproving the quality and the yield . The fertility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) Loss due to insect pests or plant diseases on certain crops may be prevented by adding crops to the farm organization and by establishing a definite rotation . In fact this is one of the main reasons for a systematic crop rotation . ( 4 ) By-Products . In this connection , the importance of by-products should be emphasized . In some instances , by-products may be disposed of in their native form , in which case they do not involve other enterprises , but as a rule they must be transformed before they can be sold . This means that the farmer must add some other enterprise , usually livestock , in order to convert by-products . Not infrequently farmers overlook the possibilities of such conversion . In many instances , no doubt , they have been deceived by the contribution of by-products to the net farm ncome as determined by the use of inadequate or faulty cost accounting methods . For example , it is the frequent if not t Ire common practice for farm cost accountants to charge such by-products as straw and skim milk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a market price less deducI ions for freight or cartage . In other instances , these byproducts have been charged to a livestock enterprise at their Bust of production , the cost being calculated by using the same cost rates for the by-products as for the main or principal product . Both methods may be wrong . But as a result of these accounting practices , the livestock enterprise iv usually " unprofitable , " when as a matter of fact the liveslock enterprise is making a substantial contribution to the net farm income . It is always , or almost always , desirable to convert by-products when any appreciable returns over and above the prime cost of conversion are likely to be realized .  | 3 . The General Law Governing the Selection of Enter-prises From the foregoing discussion it is evident that there are a large number of factors which affect the selection of farm enterprises . Indeed , these are so numerous as to constitute a perplexing problem to the student . It is advisable , therefore , to state the problem in more general terms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enterprise selection . It has been said that the selection of enterprises is based primarily on the general principle of comparative advantage . Farmers , of course , know nothing of such a law . However , they are governed by the relative prices of the various available products ; and relative prices are a reflection of all of the factors affecting comparative advantage , including all costs . Guided by relative prices , a farmer will select and combine those crops or livestock products from which he anticipates the maximum net returns . The order or sequence of selection is probably somewhat as follows : As he can not devote all of his available resources to the production of a single crop or livestock enterprise , the farmer will select first that enterprise which he believes to be most profitable or from which he anticipates he will receive the maximum net returns . However , in order to utilize the remaining available resources economically , he must add to this most profitable enterprise other enterprises of supplementary or complementary character so long as such additions augment the net income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplementary enterprises will be added in the order of their relative importance . Questions 1 . List the factors which affect the farmer 's choice of enterprises and his combinations of enterprises . 2 . Discuss the law of comparative advantage .

Explain why the common value attached to joint products is often misleading . 8 . Explain how farm enterprises are normally selected . References Adams , R. L. , Farm Management .

General Principles TWO related questions are involved in selecting farm enterprises : ( 1 ) What enterprises should be selected ? and ( 2 ) How should these be combined in order to utilize the available resources to the best advantage ? These two questions are the theme of this chapter . 1 . Methods of Selecting Enterprises The gross value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops . That is , of two crops , the one which gives the largest gross income should be selected . There is something attractive about this idea . Since the gross value is large , the faulty conclusion is reached that the net returns per acre must also be large . But a moment 's reflection will be sufficient to show that this is not necessarily the case , for the expense of production may also be large . Table 1 shows , for example , the relation of gross income to net income per acre . In some cases the gross income per acre is large but the net income relatively low . In short , there is no necessary relation between gross and net incoiue . Hence , gross value per acre is not likely to be a satisfactory basis of selecting farm crops . The net return from the enterprises has been suggested as the proper basis of selection . That is , the important thing is not gross return but net return . However , when an attempt is made to apply this measure , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate the net ret urn accurately . The value of many of the cost elements , such 11 ! 4 so  | family labor , has to be estimated ; and this , in many instances , is a difficult if not an impossible task . True , this difficulty largely disappears if the cost elements are used in approximately the same proportion for any two enterprises . But , even assuming that the cost can be calculated accurately , there are other things which must be considered . One enterprise may be more profitable than another in terms of money , but the less profitable one might have certain supplementary or complementary features not possessed by the enterprise which appears to be the more profitable one . This may mean , of course , that the returns have not been calculated properly because of the accounting practice employed . That is , in the calculation of returns Ilie supplementary and complementary features have been ignored in adjusting the cost rates . I n Table 2 are represented data showing the returns per acre and the returns per man hour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made on the basis of net ref inns per acre , oats would be eliminated . That is , the net return per acre for oats is $6.90 as compared with $18.50 fl ) 1 ' corn and $48.50 for tobacco ; but , if the oats were elim-  | inated from the farm organization , no doubt the net returns from the farm as a whole would be less . The reason for this is not difficult to discover . The oat crop at no time during the year seriously conflicts with either of the other two crops . In reality , then , oats supplement corn and tobacco production . That is , by growing oats , even if they are less profitable than corn or tobacco , resources are utilized at a time when they are not needed for the production of the other two crops . Nor is this all . Complementary features may also render the net return per unit , as normally computed , invalid . Some enterprises may have by-products which would be of no value unless utilized on the farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in areas removed somewhat from large cities . The manure produced by the dairy herd is a by-product and may be used in the production of ' crops which would not normally be grown unless manure were available . These crops may add materially to the net income of the farm as a whole . Evaluating the manure in such cases would indeed be a difficult task , and normally such an evaluation is not worth the trouble involved . Other illustrations could be given to show the inadequacy of net returns as a basis for enterprise selection . The difficulty arises , as suggested above , largely out of the method of accounting used . It is often impossible to evaluate properly the various cost elements , with the result , that net returns do not reflect the relative profitableness of an en-  | terprise . In the examples of oats , corn , and tobacco cited above , no doubt the labor for all of these crops is charged at the same rate , but evidently this is not fair to the oat enterprise . If the labor were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used at all . Some adjustment in the labor rate is evidently needed , but normally it is not made . Hence , the net returns can not be used in selecting enterprises , except where the enterprises are competitive and have the same complementary features . Net returns per unit multiplied by the number of units one man can operate appears to some a more reliable basis of enterprise selection than the net returns per unit . This idea arises out of the fact that whereas one enterprise may indeed be more profitable than another , it may also be true that more units of the less profitable enterprise can be produced per man , and thus , for the two to be reduced to a comparable basis , the net returns per unit in each case should be multiplied by the number of units one man can operate . If one man can operate 5 acres of tobacco or 40 acres of corn , then the net returns per acre should be multiplied in the case of tobacco by 5 and in the case of corn by 40 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the returns for corn per acre should be multiplied by 8 . For example , in Table 2 , the net return per acre for corn is $18.50 and for tobacco $48.50 . If $18.50 is multiplied by 8 , then the basis of comparison would be $148.00 for corn and $48.50 for tobacco . Evidently corn is more profitable than tobacco . But the assumption that for each acre changed from tobacco , corn can be increased 8 acres does not square with the facts . While it may indeed be true that a given farmer could operate 8 acres of corn for each acre of tobacco , in any given case a reduction of 1 acre of tobacco can not be accompanied by an increase of 8 acres of corn unless the farmer increases the size of his farm . Normally a reduction of one acre in one crop means an increase of one acre in sonic other crop . To increase the size of the farm in order  | to grow more corn in place of tobacco is not so much a problem in selection as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem of the size of the farm is somewhat different from that of the selection of enterprises although , as will be pointed out later , the two problems are , of course , related . Furthermore , this method does not eliminate the difficulty of determining net returns raised in the preceding discussion . Nor does it take into consideration the possibilities of supplementary or complementary features which one crop may possess . Thus , for example , corn may be fed to livestock , and the combination of corn and livestock may be more profitable than either one alone . One crop , such as tobacco , may conflict with some other crop , such as the small grain , whereas corn would be supplementary . Furthermore , the effect of corn-livestock combination on soil fertility would be a factor affecting choice . Obviously net returns per unit multiplied by the number of units one man can operate is not a reliable method to use . The net returns per hour or day of man labor has been advanced as one of the most satisfactory methods of selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two enterprises the one returning the highest net returns per hour of man labor should be chosen . Aside from the fact that the problem of calculating accurately net returns still remains , this method overlooks the fact that there is considerable variation among enterprises with respect to their demand on the resources of the farmer . Two enterprises might , indeed , return two different rates per man hour or per day , and if these two enterprises did not seriously compete for the time or other resources of the farmer , it would undoubtedly be advisable to include both in the enterprise combination of the farm . An example of the error which is likely to be made in using the net return per wail hour as a basis of selecting enterprises is illustrated by the data . in Table : 3 . This table shows that , on the basis of returns per day for nun labor ,  | corn , when fed to hogs , is more profitable than cotton , when cotton is worth 19.4 cents and pork 10.2 cents per pound . The return per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against $5.02 for corn when fed to hogs . Do these data menu that corn and hogs should replace cotton ? The quesI ion , of course , must be answered in the negative . Cotton mid corn can both be produced on the same farm . They conflict to some extent , but not seriously . It will be noted hat on the acre basis cotton is more profitable than corn . Assuming that for each acre cotton is reduced , an acre of corn is substituted , it is obvious that the net returns from the farm will be reduced as cotton is eliminated . The labor required to produce one acre of cotton in this case is , sufficient 10 produce four acres of corn . This . does not mean  | anything unless the farmer can increase the size of his farm ; but , as already observed , this is a different problem . 2 . Rules for the Selection and Combination of Enterprises From the foregoing discussion it is evident that there is need for a statement of the principles involved in enterprise selection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using his resources ( land , labor , equipment , and management ) so as to get the maximum net returns from the farm as a whole . To do this , he must combine the enterprises which are to comprise this organization in such a manner that the marginal net returns from each unit of resources shall be approximately equal irrespective of the enterprise upon which the unit is expended . If enterprises are not combined in this manner , the maximum net returns from the farm as a whole will not be obtained . Hence , the major objective in combining farm enterprises should be to distribute the various resources in such a manner that the returns from the marginal expenditure on each enterprise will be approximately equal . This principle may be better understood if reference is made to the basic law of diminishing returns . In Table 4 are presented data derived from an actual experiment , the object of which was to determine how the production of cotton would be affected by increasing applications of a mixed fertilizer . In Column 1 are the inputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outputs of lint cotton in pounds . For the purpose of this discussion the output has been expressed in values by multiplying the cotton poundage by 10 cents per pound . The results of this multiplication are shown in Column 3 . The cost of fertilizer is shown in Column 5 . This cost has been obtained by multiplying , the data in Column 1 by $2.00 , or at the rate of $40.00 per ton . These first two columns give the factual basis of the experiment from which data in the remaining columns are derived . In Colunui 4 is given the value of the added  | cotton produced from additional inputs of fertilizer . For example , in Row 0 , Column 4 is $50.00 , which means that t his is the value of cotton over no cotton at all ; whereas in Row 1 , Column 4 is $11.50 , which is the increase in value of cotton produced , when the first 100 pounds of fertilizer is applied , or the difference between $50.00 and $61.50 . All of the remaining items in Column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of fertilizer is shown in Column 6 and is constant at $2.00 ; that is , each additional unit of fertilizer costs the same amount . The difference between the gross value of cotton as given in Column 3 and the total cost of fct 1 ilizer as given in Column 5 is the net value of cotton  | above the cost of fertilizer . These data are given in Column 7 . For example , in Row 0 the value is $50.00 because no fertilizer has been used , but in Row 1 the result is $59.50 , which is derived by subtracting $2.00 , the cost of fertilizer , from $61.50 , the value of cotton produced . The same procedure is followed in obtaining the data in all of the other rows of Column 7 . Finally , the data in Column 8 , the successive net returns , are obtained by subtracting the data . in Column 6 from those in Column 4 . The essential parts of the information presented in Table 4 are shown in Figure 11 . The units of fertilizer ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the values , from the vertical axis . There are three curves : the first one , or the gross-value curve , is obtained by plotting the data in Column 3 against the data in Column 1 ; the second curve is the net-value curve , and this shows the coordinate points of data in Column 7 and Column 1 ; and the third , or successive net value curve , is shown on an enlarged scale in order to make it somewhat more legible . This curve shows the diminishing net values as an attempt is made to increase the production of cotton when the land area is fixed . The question may be asked , " How far would it pay a farmer , operating under these conditions , to apply fertilizer in the production of cotton ? " In this case the only cost considered is that of fertilizer . This being so , it is evident that the farmer will be justified in applying not more than 14 units of fertilizer to each acre . It is this amount which gives the maximum net returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of cotton is equal to the added cost . ( compare Column 4 and Column 6 , Row 14 ) . Hence , the maximum net returns are obtained when the added value is equal to the added cost . The successive net value curves in Figures 12 to 14 have been derived the same way as the successive net value curve in Figure 11 . In Figures 12 to 14 , however , the t of nl added costs have been subtracted successively from the  | added total returns from each enterprise . This gives the successive net marginal returns to the entrepreneur . The following rules based on these figures may be used as guides in the selection and combination of farm enterprises . Rule 1 . When there is one enterprise which is clearly more profitable than any other , develop this enterprise to the limit permitted by the available resources . This rule is illustrated in Figure 12 . The vertical scale represents the net value of additional returns ; the horizontal , the units of resources used in production . It is assumed  | that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise that is clearly the most profitable of a number of enterprises available to the farmer . The line El El is drawn in accordance with the theory that with each added unit of resource the marginal returns decline . If under the assumed conditions an attempt should be made to include in the farm organization any other enterprise , say E2 , the total net returns would be less than if the resources were used solely in the production of EI . In the case of enterprise E27 the first unit of resources would be less productive t lain the last unit used on El . It is clear then that a farmer would not attempt to introduce into his organization an ( enterprise such as E , but would concentrate on the product ion of E , .  | Rule 2. hf , in any given ease , an enterprise is not clearly the most profitable , the addition of supplementary enterprises may involve some reduction in the major enterprise below the maximum permitted by the available resource . When this is the case , adjust the enterprises as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whole increase . Rule 2 is illustrated in Figure 13 . In this case both enterprises Ei and E2 may be expanded to the maximum , that is , up to the point when all of the fixed supply of the resources is used . But the problem is to distribute the available supply of resources between these two enterprises no as to get the maximum net returns . The problem is solved  | by using OQ1 resources on enterprise E2 and 0Q2 resources on enterprise E , . It will be observed that OQ1 plus 0Q2 is equal to OQ3 , or the total resources available . There is no other distribution of the resources which will give equal marginal returns and , consequently , none which will give max ' in net returns . Rule 3 . When , in addition to the major enterprise , there are two or more enterprises which possess potential complementary features , choose those possessing these features if their inclusion in the farm business will pay for the extra cost and compensate for the extra managerial effort and risks involved . Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and E2 alone are considered , then the resources should be distributed as in Figure 13 . In this case OQ1 resources are used in developing E , , and 0Q2 in developing E , . If , however , Etc , a complementary enterprise to E2 , be considered , then the curve E , plus 2e may be drawn , which is the sum of curves E2 and E. , In this case then OQ4 resources will be used in developing E2 plus 2 , , and 0Q ' units of resources will be used in developing E , . For it is when this distribution of resources is employed that the marginal returns for each enterprise are equal and the maximum net returns obtained . Questions 1 .

Method of Substitution THE methods of selecting farm enterprises discussed in Chapter VI are defective and limited in their use . Net returns per acre may be employed when the enterprises are similar as to supplementary or complementary features or when they compete seriously for the resources of the farmer . Inasmuch as these conditions are seldom fulfilled , net rei urns are at best an unreliable basis of selection . For the same reason the net returns per man hour are also unreliable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be changed at will , an assumption which is not based on facts , the net returns per acre multiplied by the number of acres one man can operate is likely to lead to faulty conclusions . . Evidently , what is needed is a method that is free from these defects . Three alternative methods have been devised , and , although they are not wholly above criticism , they are useful . These methods are : ( 1 ) the method of substitution , ( 2 ) the method of direct comparison , and ( 3 ) the standard method . In this chapter consideration will be given to the method of substitution . In Chapters V I l I and IX the method of comparison and the standard method , respectively , will be presented . 1 . The Method of Substitution Briefly , the method of substitution consists of completely or partially substituting for the existing enterprises a different . combination of enterprises and of checking the effect of he changes trade on the total net income of the farm . The  | method has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast to the methods discussed in Chapter VI , it avoids the necessity of calculating detailed enterprise costs and net returns , a task which is exceedingly difficult and subject to inaccuracies . Furthermore , the method takes into account supplementary , complementary , or joint cost relationships which may exist among the enterprises included in the farm organization . This method may be explained best by using a concrete illustration . The illustration used has been taken from a study entitled " The Farm Organization in Southwestern Minnesota , " Minnesota Bulletin No. 205 , by G. A. Pond and J. W. Tapp . It should be said that Pond and Tapp were the first students of farm management to use the method of substitution . For the effective use of the method of substitution , certain fundamental information must be available : ( a ) the extent and condition of the available farm resources , ( b ) the normal basic material and labor requirements for the production of crops and livestock products , ( c ) the normal yields of the various crops and output of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors of production , such as land available for crop production , pasture , and woodland ; the number and kind of livestock maintained for productive purposes ; the number and kind of workstock ; machinery and tools used in production ; and the amount of labor , both family and hired , which is at the disposal of the farm operator . It is important that a careful appraisal be made of the condition and extent of these various factors , more particularly the conditions of the farm buildings , as to whether or not they are adequate to accouimodate any proposed changes in the organization of the farm . In order to determine whether or not a suggested plan can actually be carried out by the farmer or whether or not a particular enterprise will or will not fit , into a suggested plan , it is necessary to have accurate information on ba.sie  | requirements , such as the amount of labor , seed , and material requirements used in the production of the various crop and livestock products . It should be emphasized that these material requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , the yields and prices must be normal or those which are most likely to be obtained . Table 5 , for example , gives the normal labor requirements per acre for crops on typical farms in Southwestern Minnesota which were used in reorganizing the farm described here . Table 7 gives the material requirements for crops ; and Table 8 , the feed , material , and labor requirements for livestock . The yields and prices used throughout this discussion are shown in Table 6.  | On the farm selected to illustrate the use of this method , there were 184.5 acres of land , of which 134.5 acres were in crops , 43 acres in pasture , and 7 acres in farmstead . These data are given in Table 9 , together with the yield , the total production , and the disposition of the crops ? that is , whether sold or fed . Reference will be made to this table in the course of the following discussion . The buildings were sufficient to house all of the workstock consisting of 6 head of horses , 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 brood sows together with the pigs raised . ( See ' fable 10 . ) The farm was also fully  | equipped with machinery and tools for production of small grain , hay , and corn ? the type of crops produced . The man labor was supplied by the operator , a man hired from March to August , inclusive , and the operator 's wife .  | Since the net return for the farm as a whole is the measure of success used , it is necessary to know in any given case the financial returns for the original combination of enterprises . The direct sales of crops minus the direct expenses is usually sufficient ; because the fixed or overhead expenses are not in , any way disturbed by the changes in the crops and livestock . The assumption is that such substitutions as are suggested will not increase the fixed expenses of operation but will affect only supplementary costs . Hence , the amount of receipts from the sale of crops and livestock products together with a knowledge of the supplementary costs is sufficient for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises . For this farm , as shown in detail on page 101 , the sales from crops , oats and rye only , were $338 . The cash income from the sale of livestock products was much greater , aggregating $3,175 . The total cash income including the sale of crops and livestock products was $3.513 . The deductions for materials , services , medicines , and feed were $613 . The net cash income or difference between the total cash income ' of $3,513 and the total cash outlay of $613 is $2,900 . Although this net , income may be considered satisfactory , the important question is : Can the resources available to this farmer be utilized more effectively by changing 1 he combination of the farm enterprises ? Or what changes in the combination of the farm enterprises are necessary in order to augment the nei income ?  | 3 . Suggested Changes With this information relative to the organization of the farm and the net cash income , it is possible to make an analysis of the combination of enterprises used by the farmer and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis was made , it was found that the operator had not developed a definite rotation of crops . A study of the organization also showed that the small grain production was overemphasized and corn was underemphasized , causing a feed shortage . The production of pork was low relative to the amount of skim milk available for use . Certain suggestions naturally flow from this analysis . There was evidence that a reduction in small-grain acreage and an increase in corn acreage would make for a balanced rotation and , at the same time , provide for a sufficient amount of feed . With the same labor resources the corn and hay acreage could be increased . More pork could be produced by raising fall litters , but in this case it would be necessary , perhaps , to purchase more corn . On the whole , decreasing small-grain acreage and increasing corn and hay appeared advisable . To show what might be accomplished , two plans were offered . Plan Number 1 In Plan Number 1 the changes involve the elimination of barley and rye , a reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and hay . Table 12 shows the revised cropping plan , together with the distribution of feed . The chief changes made in the cropping system are : an increase in the corn for grain from 1,755 bushels in the original tau 2,520 , or an increase of 765 bushels ; the elimination of barley and rye ; the reduction of the oat crop from 2,100 to 1,764 bushels , or a decrease of 336 bushels ; and an increase of clover and timothy hay from 18 to 30 tons , or an increase of 12 tons . ( Compare Tables 9 and 12. ) //  | The suggested corn production is sufficient for feed requirements , with 565 bushels for sale . However , a small amount of hay must , according to this plan , be purchased . The livestock is not altered in any way ; neither are the overhead expenses changed . The difference in the probable net income , therefore , is due solely to the change in crop sales , to the feed purchased , and to the materials cost for the crop enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in the feed bill is $220 , and the decline in direct material expense is $1 ( compare financial statements ) . There is a gain of $202 in favor of the new plan . The financial statement is as follows :  | The suggested plan has several advantages over the old one . In the first place , the new plan increases the net returns $202 , which at 5 per cent means an increase in the value of the farm as a business unit of about $4,000 . The plan also provides for a margin of safety between the amount produced and the normal feed requirements . These changes are made without increasing the cost of labor . ( See Figures 15 , original organization , and 16 , suggested re- organization . ) Under the new plan 4,500 hours of regular labor for crops and livestock and 900 hours on miscellaneous crops , livestock , and maintenance labor are required . It may be seen from Figure 16 that the only time NvIret1 the labor requirements exceed lire strlrllly is in the corn-husking firm ' in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan Number 2 Plan Number 1 , although satisfactory , does not fully uli ( ize the available resources , especially the labor supply . ( Note Figure 16 . ) There is ample opportunity for expand-  | ing production without increasing the labor cost . The history of this farm shows that in one year 30 additional acres were rented and that the operator handled these additional acres without seriously reducing the crop yields . As one of the weaknesses of the original farm is the low production of pork in proportion to skim milk available , it is obvious that an increase in this enterprise might increase the total net returns . In Plan Number 2 it is suggested that pork production be increased by having the sows farrow in the fall and on a scale sufficient to produce 30,000 pounds of pork . In order to accomplish this , the corn and oat acreage must be increased . These suggestions could not be carried out on this farm unless additional land were acquired . As the 30 acres formerly rented were still available , it was suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus providing the necessary feed for the suggested expansion in the hog enterprise . The 30 additional acres acquired are to be used specifically as follows : corn , 14 acres ; oats , S acres ; clover and hay , 5 acres ; pasture , 2 acres ; and corn and fodder , 1 acre . The total suggested distribution of crop acres , yield , production , amount fed , and salable products is shown in Table 14 . The present buildings and machinery are adequate to take care of the increase in the hog enterprise , and the labor supply is sufficient to operate the added acreage . The rent  | for the additional land is paid for in corn and oats ( Table 14 ) . However , the suggested increase in the pork production causes an increase in the veterinary and medicinal expenses , and an increase in the crop production adds some to the crop expenses . ( See Table 15. ) caption The probable financial returns for Plan Number 2 are summarized below , and show the crop sales to be $88 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a total cash income of $4,063 . On the expense side the direct materials cost is 8473 , leaving a net cash return of $3 , - 590 . As the original plan returned $2,900 , the gain for the new plan is $690 . It should be noted also that Plan Number 2 is a gain over Plan Number of $488 . Plan Number 2 has certain advantages over both the original plan and Plan Number 1 . First , it calls for no additional resources except 30 acres of land , which may he leased , and some additional hired labor ; yet it brings a net return of $690 over the original plan . This increase in net returns is traceable to a better utilization of the labor supply as well as of the land and buildings . It also provides for a margin of safety in the ease of feed crops . Thus , in periods of ' low yields the farmer probably will need to Imy little , if any , feed for his livestock . ' I'Iris plan , however ,  | calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization and will make additional demands upon the time of the farmer . Such an expansion as suggested in Plan Number 2 is justified only if the farmer 's managerial ability is not being used to its full capacity . The method of substitution , as illustrated above , may be used effectively in increasing the farmer 's income . It goes to the heart of the problem and avoids some of the embarrassing questions that arise iii determining enterprise costs . A careful study of the facts collected permits the combining of the enterprise in the proportion which will utilize to the best advantage all available resources and gives also consideration to the supplementary and complementary features which any or all of the enterprises may possess . Questions 1 . How is the method of substitution used to determine whether or not a given enterprise should be included in the farm program ? 2 . Describe the procedure followed in this method . 3 . Appraise this method as to its practicability and simplicity in actual use . References Pond , George A. , and Tapp , Jesse W. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Minnesota Bulletin 205. 1923 .

Method of Direct Comparison S OME authorities object to the method of substitution discussed in Chapter VII . They prefer to use instead what is called the method of direct comparison when suggesting improvements in the organization and operation of a farm . According to this method suggestions relative to the organization or management of a given farm are based solely upon the experiences of a large number of farmers who are following the same type of farming as the farmer whose farm is the object of study . These authorities believe that adjustments based upon the experiences of successful farmers are more trustworthy than those made according to the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer who makes changes in his farming practices , the combination of his farm enterprises , the size of his farm , the yields of his crops , or any other factor , is more likely to meet with success if such changes are based upon experiences of successful farmers than he would it they are made according to the method of substitution . The fundamental theory upon which this conclusion is based is that farming practices followed by successful farmers have been subjected to all of the forces both economic and physical that are at work in a given area and are therefore more reliable than practices which may be derived from experimental data or which are purely the figment of the . imagination . It is only fair to point out that this criticism of the method of substitution is only partly valid . The changes effected by the method of substitution are not made without reference to the experience of other farmers or with-  | out reference to the economic and physical forces that work in the area . As a matter of fact , the changes suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . Furthermore , the changes are always in line with that which the farmer has been doing in the past . That is , it is seldom , if ever , recommended that a farmer do something entirely different from what he has been doing . On the contrary , it is recommended that he do a little more or less of the same things that he has been doing in the past . The suggested changes , however , are not based necessarily upon the records of successful farmers , unless it is thought that the farmer can in fact carry out such changes as might be suggested from a study of successful farmers . In short , the farmer 's capacity and efficiency are always considered in making adjustments . 1 . Basic Information Needed The use of the method of comparison involves , as does the method of substitution , the collection and analysis of statistics on farm organization and management . The data used are somewhat the same in both cases , although the methods used in collecting and in analyzing that data are quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively small number of farms , usually from 30 to 40 , are studied intensively , while in the case of the method of comparison several hundred farms are studied in an extensive manner . Specifically , the information collected for the method of comparison may be classified as follows : A. Resources : 1 . Land area . 2 . Farm buildings . 3 . Machinery and tools . 4 . Feed and supplies . 5 . Livestock . 6 . Labor available . B. Receipts : 1 . The sale of crops . 2 . The sale of livestock and livestock products . 3 . The value of farm products used in the home .  | 4 . Income from outside sources , such as the wages received for work off the farm . 5 . Increases in inventory . C. Expenses : 1 . Current operating expenses , such as hired labor , purchase of seed , fertilizer , feed , and so forth . 2 . Livestock , machinery , and tools purchased . 3 . Insurance . 4 . Depreciation of machinery and buildings . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each crop produced there is obtained : 1 . Acreage . 2 . Yield . 3 . Production . 4 . Disposition ? that is , sold , fed to livestock , or used in the farmhouse . E. Livestock record . For each class of livestock there is obtained : 1 . Number and value at the beginning of the year . 2 . The sales . 3 . Purchases . 4 . Number of livestock died during the year and value . F. Miscellaneous information : 1 . The location of the farm and distance from market . 2 . Name , age , and address of the operator . 3 . Soil type of farm and topography . 4 . Distribution of farm acreage , that is , area in crops , pasture , woods , and so forth . 5 . Breed of livestock raised . 6 . Description of farm family ? number , age , and education . 7 . The agricultural experience of the farmer ? the number of years a tenant , a part owner , and a full owner . S. Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , price paid for the farm , kind of accounts kept , if any , and so forth . 2 . The Method Used in Collecting Necessary Information There are two common methods used in collecting the required information ? namely , the farm management survey method and the farm account book method . When . the survey method is used , the information is recorded on a uniform schedule ( see Farmers ' Bulletin , 1139 , IT.S.1 ) . : A. I by trained enumerators . These enumerators , or field Wien , as they are usually called , obtain the data by personal interviews with farmers . The information is carefully checked  | for possible omissions and inaccuracies . After the corrections have been made and omissions , if any , have been supplied , the data are transferred to an office sheet . The office sheet is , in the main , a duplicate of the field sheet used by the enumerator , but in addition it provides for a summary of the farm business and for specific " efficiency " factors affecting the earnings . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made . When farm account books are used , the farmer is required to keep a careful record of his farm operations throughout the year . These books are usually audited or examined frequently in order to make sure that the information is being collected in the proper form . At the end of the year the books are collected , and the data are summarized and analyzed much in the same manner as is done in the case of the farm survey method . 3 . The Method of Analysis The method of analysis and the use of the data are admirably stated in a report by Messrs . Mosher and Case . The data used by these investigators were obtained by the farm account book method and included a study of 210 farms for a given year . Tables 16 , 17 , and 18 illustrate how the data are analyzed and prepared for the farmer 's use . In Table 16 is given information regarding capital investment , receipts , expenses , and net income . Column 1 of this table is reserved for the individual farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for various selected items for the 210 farms studied . In Column 3 are the averages for the 42 most profitable farms , or the most successful farms , and in Column 4 are the averages for the 42 least profitable farms . By using this table , a farmer included in the study may compare the organization of his farm with the average of all farms , with the most profitable , and also with the least profitable farms . In Table 17 are presented certain factors which affect income , such as the size of the farm , the yields , and the per  | cent of tillable land in higher , medium , and low " profit " crops . The first column is reserved for the farmer 's own record ; the second , for the average for all farms ; the third , for the most profitable or the most successful farms ; and the fourth , for the least profitable farms . Again , as in Table 16 , the farmer may compare his own record with that of the average , of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constructed for the same purpose as Tables 16 and 17 but is more complicated . The rate earned on investment is taken as the measure of success ( Column 1 ) . In Column 2 are the yields per acre of corn , oats , and wheat ; in Column 3 is the per cent of land in high-profit crops ; in Column 4 are livestock returns per $100 worth of feed for cattle , hogs , sheep , and hens ; in Column 5 is investment in livestock per acre ; in Column 6 , size of farm ; in Column 7 , per cent efficiency of man labor and horse labor ; in Column 8 are expenses per $100 gross income ; and in Column 9 is gross income per acre . It is suggested that by the use of this table the farmer may , in any individual case , compare his efficiency with the efficiency of all other farmers included in the study . This may be done by drawing a line across the table at a number measuring the efficiency of the farm as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Table 17 a given farmer 's rate of return is 8.8 per cent and his yields for corn , oats , and wheat are 90 , 70 , and 50 , respectively ; then , according to Table 18 , his yields for these three crops are above the average for all farms included in this study , for in Table 18 the index yields are 81 , 67 , and 45 , respectively . The farmer may make a similar comparison between the return he obtains from $100 fed to cattle , hogs , sheep , and hens and the return received by the average farmers . The analysis is not confined to simple comparison of the performance of the individual farmer with that of the average farmer . As suggested below in Table 17 , the various factors such as size of farm and crop yields are correlated with rate earned on investment , with labor income , or with  | a . Crop Yields . Good crop yields are , as a general rule , essential for good net farm incomes . Table 19 shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cooperators and the rates earned on the total farm investments . It should be understood that not all of the indicated increase of net income on the farms having higher yields of corn is due to the increased corn yield . The tendency is for the same farms which have good corn yields to have good yields of other crops , larger proportions of tillable land in the higher profit crops , and to have higher returns for feed fed to livestock . The rates earned on the different groups of farms were affected more or less by other factors such as per cent of land in higher profit crops and efficiency in feeding livestock . footnote Mosher and Case . Adapted from Second Annual Report of the Farm Bureau , Farm 11 ! ( maagemeof Service . Item  | It may be noted that each increase of ten bushels per acre of corn was accompanied by an increase of about nine-tenths of one per cent in the rate earned on the investment . On the average farm this meant that with each ten bushels increase in yield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for the farm . b . Value of Growing Profitable Kinds of Crops . It often happens that a farm , which has good crop yields and where efficient work with livestock is done , is relatively unprofitable because a large part of the tillable land is used in growing crops which do not give as good returns for the land , labor , power , and machinery as do other crops which might be grown . Table 20 shows the relation of the rates and the per cent of tillable land in the combined acreage of the higher profit crops of corn , wheat , alfalfa , sweet clover , and canning crops of sweet corn , peas , and pumpkin . The selection of corn and wheat as the higher profit grain crops , of caption alfalfa as the higher profit hay crop , and of sweet clover as the higher profit pasture crop for tillable land was based on long-time investigations of the Departments of Farm Organization and Management and Animal Husbandry of the University of Illinois . It will be noted in Table 17 that 48.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable farms was in corn . It is doubtful if it is ever wise to have more than 50 per cent of the tillable land in corn or any other one crop because of the uneven distribution of labor , difficulty of maintaining soil fertility , difficulty of controlling weeds  | and insects , and the risk of storms or other uncontrollable conditions which may seriously injure one crop but do little damage to others . It is apparent that those cooperators who are farming most profit al ) l are , in most cases , men who have almost done away with timothy undl blue grass on tillable land and have reduced the acreage of oats . c . Relation of Amount and Efficiency of Livestock to Farm , In comes . Efficient care and feeding of livestock are essential for the best , net . farm incomes . Those ftiruts having ; f snutll : mlount , o1 ' live-  | stock well handled had a larger net income than farms having large amount of livestock poorly handled . With the present favorable prices of livestock in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain to well handled livestock had net incomes about $2,000 higher than farms having small amounts of livestock poorly handled . ( See Table 21. ) d . Efficiency in the Use of Man Labor and Horse Power and Machinery . While the efficient use of man labor and of horse power and machinery are important as they affect the net farm incomes , no division of the farms into groups according to such efficiencies has vet been made . In Table 17 it is shown with more than double the gross income per acre , the 42 most profitable farms had the same labor cost per acre and somewhat lower horse power and machinery costs than were found on the 42 least profitable farms . This statement appears more significant since these records show that the actual value of man labor and the cost of horse and tractor power and machinery amount to over $11.00 an acre on the average farm , while the income amounted to only $20.74 an acre . e . Thrift ? Low Expenses in Proportion to Receipts . Some farms which produced good crop yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops and made a good return for the deed fed to livestock , and had low net incomes because the expenses were high in proportion to the income . In Table 22 the farms are grouped according to the total expense including the operator 's and family labor for each $100 of gross income . As was to be expected , there was a regular decrease in the rate earned on the investment as the expenses in proportion to receipts increased . f . Profitable Farming Requires Balanced Farming . In Table 23 is shown the value of doing at least fairly well in each line of farm work . Farms on which complete records were kept were divided into seven groups according to the number of the six factors named below in which each farm did more efficient work than the average of all the farms studied . It may well be noted that those few farms which were doing better than the average along all six lines of farm work earned 7.6 per cent on their total farm investments , while those which were below the average in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average farm investment , this meant a difference of over $4,000 . With considerable regularity , the rates earned on the seven groups of farms increased as the number of factors in which the farms excelled increased . Each operator may well study this report , first , to determine how his efficiency compares with the average in each particular ; - and , second , to learn the methods used on those farms which are operated more efficiently in each factor . g . Size of farms . The farms in this project vary from 40 to 640 acres in size . The type of soil is similar on most of the farms , ex-  | cept that a few more farms between 141 and 180 acres in size were on a lighter type of soil . The average rate earned on the investment by the different groups of farms varied only from 2.6 per cent to 3.1 per cent . With the exception of the farms from 141 to 160 acres in size the average rate earned varied from 3.0 per cent to 3.9 per cent . ( See Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rate earned is the farm between 181-220 acres in size . In general the farms of this size or smaller make a larger rate on the investment than larger farms . Small farms usually have a larger income per acre , and also owing to the disadvantage of a small size , these farms have a larger expense per acre . Even though a good return on the investment is secured , a good sized farm is necessary to give a large return to the individual farmer . There are some disadvantages of the smaller sized farms which , are clearly brought out in records on some of these farms . The ntimber of acres of crops worked with one man and one horse g adually. increase with the larger sized farm . Also , the expense er acre for farm improvements , machinery , and equipment , the value of all labor , and other expenses are higher on the small sized farms , and gradually decrease as the average increases . This is to be expected since many of the farm improvements and much of the machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acreage and the cost is not increased proportionately as the size of farms increases . The small farm to be successful must have a good-sized business . Some of the ways in which the operators of small farms are overcoming this disadvantage include : 1 . Keeping more livestock , especially dairy cows and poultry . 2 . Selecting crops that give a large return per acre . 3 . Canning crops , or , especially in some localities near good markets , truck crops are grown to advantage . 4 . Renting additional land .  | Many large farms are less successful because they are not so carefully organized and operated . Some of the common faults of large farms are : 1 . Land is badly scattered and not readily reached from the farmstead.  | 2 . Usually less livestock per acre is kept on large farms . 3 . A smaller percentage of the land is in legumes and too large a percentage of land is grown to oats or other low profit crops on many large farms . 4 . Yields are lower because less care is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many farms where much of the labor is hired .  | 4 . Criticisms of the Method The method of comparison , as illustrated above , has been . subjected to criticism by students of farm management . Unquestionably , the method has merit , as the alert farmer or the farm manager can use it advantageously . A comparison of the organization of a given farm with the best in the area will undoubtedly suggest changes which , if made , would lead to increases in the profits of the farm . However , there is no assurance in advance that such changes would lead to increases in profits . For example , suppose that the size of a given farm is 100 acres and that the size of the most profitable farms averages 200 acres . This would not necessarily mean that the 100-acre farmer should attempt to increase his farm to 200 acres . In fact , to do so might result in decreased rather than in increased returns , unless the farmer had the capacity to operate a 200-acre farm . The same might be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms show higher yields than the average or least profitable farms . Does this mean that the farmer whose yields are relatively low should attempt to bring his yields in line with those of the most profitable farms ? There is some doubt about this . An increase in yields usually means an increase in the expenditure for fertilizer or labor or both . Hence , on a given farm it would not necessarily follow , then , that an increase in yields would result in an increase in net income , as it is probable that the cost of getting the increase in yield would be in proport ion to or greater than the increase in yield obtained . The method of comparison could be improved if the given farm were compared to the most profitable farms of the same size , or to the most profitable farms having similar resources . Such an extension of the method has not as yet been made . However , the standard method presented in t he following chapter has been designed to correct some of the defects of the method of comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be noted also that  | the statistical technique used by Messrs . Mosher and Case is subject to criticism . The class intervals of most of the tables are unequal , and there is no evidence that in measuring the effect of one factor on net returns that the other factors have been held constant . Questions 1 . What is meant by the method of " direct comparison " ? 2 . How are the data collected for making a study of this type ? 3 . List and describe the main items on which comparison is made . 4 . Write a brief criticism of the method of direct comparison . References Nourse , E. G. , Agricultural Economics .

It is difficult to get them to make even the simple and obvious changes in their organization . They need a few standard enterprise combinations which are applicable to their conditions and to their own resources , that is , combinations set up so that they can see how the various enterprises fit together , what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made and the new combinations put into practice . The purpose of this chapter and of Chapter X is to show how such standard combinations may be developed and used by farmers in improving the organization of their farms . 1 . The Kind of Information Needed In every well-established agricultural area there are certain enterprises which farmers have found best suited to conditions of their soil and climate , or there are certain crops and classes of livestock which farmers have found to be most profitable . As this subject has been discussed at length in Chapter V , it is not necessary in this connection to discuss why this is true . The chief task is to select from the various enterprises which are or can be handled profitably those which will give the maximum net returns for the farm as a whole . Evidently in making a selection of this sort , it is necessary to study the organization of representa-  | tive farms ' and to obtain such other data regarding the area as may be necessary to set up the most profitable combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analyzing of the following information : A. For the representative farms : 1 . An inventory of all farm property at the beginning and end of the year . 2 . An accurate detailed map for each farm showing : a . The size , shape , and position of each field . b . The position of the fences , field lines , ditches , and roads . c . The location of the buildings . 3 . A crop history of the crops produced on each field for a period of five years . 4 . A daily record of the receipts and expenditures. 5 . A daily record of all farm labor by principal operations or tasks . 6 . A monthly feed statement by classes of livestock . 7 . A monthly statement showing farm products used in the home . B. For the area : 1 . Prices of crops , livestock , and livestock products for a period of years . 2 . Data on recent changes in acreage of the principal crops and in the number of the different classes of livestock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , land , and equipment . 4 . Experimental data for the area showing the effect of variations in the kind and quality of fertilizer on crop production . 5 . Experimental data showing the effect of various crop rotations on crop yields . 6 . Experimental data showing the effect of feed practices on livestock production . 7 . Farm management survey for a large number of farms showing the effect of farm practices and methods on crop yield and livestock production . 2 . The Analysis of Data When this information has been obtained , it is necessary to determine : footnote By representative farms is meant those which are typical of the area as to size , soil types , topography , crops grown , livestock products produced , and farm practices followed .  | a . Normal yields and prices for the various crops . Normal yields and prices are essential in projecting standard enterprise combinations , for these standards are set up from the long-time point of view ; that is to say , combinations are selected which will be most profitable over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yields which are normal rather than exceptional . b . Production trend . For the purpose of projecting standard combinations of enterprises , it is important , of course , to determine the general movement in crop and livestock production . Unprofitable enterprise combinations are made up in part of enterprises which are no longer profitable or are becoming less and less profitable . A standard combination must be based not only on those enterprises which are profitable at the time the standard is projected but on enterprises which are most likely to be profitable in the future . A study of trend in the crop acreage and in the number of livestock will aid in deciding which enterprises should be selected . c . Labor and material inputs for the various crop and livestock enterprises . Information on this subject may be subdivided as follows : ( 1 ) Man labor inputs by operations . ( 2 ) Horse labor ( hours ) by operations . ( 3 ) Power inputs , other than horse power , by operations . ( 4 ) Fertilizer inputs for each crop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) Feed requirements for each class of livestock . From this information may be calculated normal labor and material input requirements for each farm enterprise . d . Distribution of the man and horse hours used in the production of the various crops and classes of livestock . This must be done by farm operations . Such information is needed to determine how the various enterprises fit together and to determine what are the normal labor and power requirements for each enterprise .  | e . The farm practices and methods peculiar to the area . A well-considered standard farm organization can not be developed unless the economist is familiar with the farm practices peculiar to the area for which the standards are intended . A statement of the practices followed in the production of each crop and livestock product should be prepared . Note the following , taken from Minnesota Bulletin 205 , page 46 : Rye differs from the other grain crops grown in the Windom area in that it is seeded in the fall . All ground for rye is plowed . Only a small part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of it twice before planting and most of it is harrowed again after seeding . All is sown with a drill . Rye usually ripens a week earlier than oats and several days earlier than barley . It is either shock threshed or stack threshed , according to the practice of the farm . 3 . The Development of the Standards If the facts have been gathered and analyzed in the manner outlined above , standard farm organizations may then be developed . The various steps are : a . Group the farms studied according to size. ? A study of these groupings will usually show that farms having approximately the same available resources vary markedly in their net returns . In any given year these variations may be due to a number of causes : ( 1 ) variation in prices from farm to farm for similar products , ( 2 ) differences in yields , ( 3 ) variations in the efficiency of the management , and ( 4 ) variations in the crop-livestock combination . b . Select from each size group those farms which appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently utilizing the available resources to the best advantage . The final selection may be facilitated by an examination of labor distribution charts . These charts should show the actual man and horse hours distribution by enterprises and also the labor available . These charts footnote 2 Probably the area . devoted to crop production in most cases will prove the best measure of size .  | will indicate to what extent the labor resources are being utilized . ' ( See Figures 20 and 21. ) c . Develop a cropping system . Next , attention should be given to the development of a cropping system . For this task the organization of the better farms may be used as tentative guides . In developing the cropping system the kind , that is , the class , of livestock and the amount of each class which is to form a part of the organization should be kept in mind . The information relative to the farm practices should be reviewed in order to make use of the best practices and methods found in the area . For example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up if farmers would do more fall plowing , if fall plowing is possible and at the same time a desirable practice . Or , the practice of handling some crops might be possible in the area but used only in a limited way . The change in practice might permit the establishment of a better cropping system . All of the possibilities should be carefully explored and utilized to the extent permitted by the general experience of the farmers . In no case will it be advisable to vary far from the general accepted practices and methods . Yet , in many instances , there may be practices and methods which can be utilized to an advantage , even if they are not commonly employed . footnote There are many factors which may affect the rotation in addition to farm practices . It is not advisable , as a general rule , to maintain year after year the same acreage for each crop in the rotation . Changes in economic conditions 3 The standard for any size group can not , of course , use more resources than are normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of economic theory , inasmuch as factors can not be considered as fixed absolutely . But without attempting to answer this criticism , it may be said that for any given year the farmer may project his organization and estimate , as best he can , the resources which he will need . The resources of each group of farms give a tentative basis at least for estimating resources required for a standard . True , a better crop-livestock combination might be devised by using , in some cases , more of some one or several of the resources .  | may be such that it will pay to increase the acreage of the principal crop . This may or may not involve a change of the minor crop , but it usually will . Rigidity is to be recommended only in those cases when prices of the principal crop do not change greatly from year to year , or when the farmer does not know how to adjust his acreage so as to take advantage of price and cost changes . Many farmers react to prices at planting time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , they may increase their acreage of a given crop when it would be better to decrease it or to keep it constant . In such cases , a constant acreage for each crop in the rotation is clearly advisable , but a little reflection indicates that such a policy is not the most profitable one . In addition to basing the cropping system on and in accordance with the best practices of the area , there are certain points which may be observed : ( 1 ) Ordinarily , unless the experimental data indicate otherwise , alternate leguminous and nonleguminous crops . ( 2 ) Alternate , unless there is a good reason or reasons for not doing so , deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants . ( 3 ) Avoid , as far as possible , leaving land fallow . Follow a fallsown crop by a spring-grown crop . ( 4 ) Include in the rotation one or more clean-cultivated crops for the purpose of controlling weeds . ( 5 ) Include , in most regions , a sod-producing crop . d . Determine man and horse labor requirements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horse hour requirements for each crop should be charted . The total labor requirements should be checked against the man and horse labor normally available . It will be found usually that some adjustments in the crops will have to be made in order to avoid producing more of one crop than can be successfully handled by the available resources ( mostly labor ) at the peak load ; or it may be found , on the other hand , that adjustments need to be made in order to use more completely the available labor supply . e . Give the material requirements . A table showing  | the normal fertilizer , seed , and other material requirements should be prepared . The fertilizer requirements in any actual case will not , of course , correspond to the requirements shown in such a table , but the table will serve as a guide for the farmer whose soil and other conditions are typical . The closer these standard requirements are to the conditions of any given farm , the more useful they will be . Some farmers may find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their particular conditions . Such variations will always exist , and farmers should be encouraged to adjust their input factors to correspond as closely as possible to those which will give the best results . In making these adjustments , farmers will find the standard requirements helpful , since they are based upon the experience of actual farmers modified in the light of experimental data and of a study of the best methods and practices . f . Project the probable crop production . The probable crop production for the standard combination may be projected by using normal yields . Yields , of course , will vary from year to year . In some years the actual yield will be less and some years greater than normal . But , except in the case of feed crops , this will not be significant . In determining the amount and kind of livestock for the standard organization , some allowance should be made for the probable annual variation in yields of feed crops . The farmer may find it advisable to carry over or to sell some feed crops when he produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to buy feed crops when the yields are below normal . In years of large crops the animals such as hogs may be kept on feed longer than when feed is scarce . Whether or not such a practice will be profitable will depend upon the price of the animal products and the price of feed . When feed is cheap relative to price of animal products , it may pay to feed animals to heavier weight . If farmers can not , or do not wish to , adjust their feeding period , then they might adjust their livestock to the feed  | supplies . In years of heavy crop production , some adjustments may be made by purchasing or by raising additional livestock . In most communities this method has a limited use unless the crop shortage or surplus is peculiar to individual farms . If crop shortage or surplus is general , all farmers will be face to face with the same problem at the same time . When this is true , farmers will find it more difficult to adjust their livestock to the supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of livestock , if any , which is to form a part of the standard system . The relationship between the crop and the livestock enterprises is indicated in the previous section . It is evident that the distribution of these two classes of enterprises must be worked out simultaneously . In deciding the amount and kind of livestock which should be maintained , the organization of the successful farms should be used as tentative guides . Minor adjustments , of course , will be necessary and can readily be made . When the best combination , or what appears to be the best combination , has been decided upon , the amount and kind of livestock should be presented in tabular form . The number of animals in each class of livestock will depend upon the amount and kind of feed available and the technical efficiency of the production . With a given amount of feed available , the higher the requirements ( inputs ) per animal unit , the lower the number of units . The feeding requirements should be carefully worked out , and in no case should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well understood that as feed inputs are increased , the resulting animal product will iiicrease , but not necessarily , of course , at the same rate as the inputs increase . In the selection of the feed requirements , experimental data , whenever available , should be used . But in general the data are best presented as normal requirements for normal production or output . h . Determine the net income of the proposed organization . The final test of any enterprise eonibivation is the  | net income . The net income of the projected organization may be shown by the income statement . This statement consists of a list of items indicating the income of the organization and a list of items indicating the expenditures . The income is calculated by multiplying normal production by normal prices . The expenditures are calculated by applying normal cost rates to the items of variable inputs , such as fertilizer , hired labor , and feed . The difference between the total income and outlay is the farm income and indicates the profitableness of the enterprise combination under conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in production . In preparing the income statement , it is not necessary to evaluate the family 's or operator 's labor or to include an item for interest on investment . Family labor and operator 's labor are very difficult to evaluate , and their exclusion from the expense items can make no difference whatever with the results , nor can they affect the conclusions drawn relative to the effectiveness of the standard organization . As interest on investment is an arbitrary figure , its inclusion or exclusion will not affect the results . The income of the standard may be compared with the income of the successful farms having approximately the same available resources . The comparison may suggest certain modifications which should be made in the standard . If changes are made , a new income statement should be prepared . It often happens that a change which may appear to be desirable does not add materially to the net income and may not be worth while . 4 . The Usefulness of Standards The usefulness of the standard will be more fully discussed in the following chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said is that the standard organizations represent the best possible combinations of enterprises which can be projected on the basis of normal conditions . These st arulards are combinations of enterprises for a given  | amount of available resources . That is , the land is fixed , and the amount of labor is that amount which is normally available to farmers operating a given size of farm . The equipment is that which is normally required to operate a farm of a fixed crop acreage . In setting up the standards , the best methods and practices are utilized only to the extent that farmers will readily accept them . They are flexible in that there is a standard for each major size group . With a change in the resources available there is a change in the crop combination . It is assumed that the management is the same as far as efficiency is concerned ? a weakness of course but not a serious one . Variations in capacity are provided for by setting up standards for varying size groups ; that is , it is assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity than a man who can operate a forty-acre farm . These standards , therefore , sapply a pattern for farmers having a certain combination of resources by which they can modify their crop-livestock combination in order to obtain the maximum long-time net income . Questions 1 . If a survey were to ' be made of a given area in order to set up a standard farm for that area , what information would you suggest that the survey include ? 2 . If you were considering corn as a major enterprise , what specific facts would you need to know about it ? Beef cattle ? 3 . With a survey completed and the data in hand , what steps would you then take in setting up the standards ? 4 . State the advantages and disadvantages of a rigid scheme of rotation . 5 . State the general rules to be followed in setting up a crop rotation scheme . 6 . What is the final test of any combination of enterprises ? 7 . Wherein is this standard flexible ? Wherein fixed ?

It is obvious that the usefulness of this method , in any given case , will depend upon the similarity of the resources of the farmer and of the resources used in developing the standard . Comparisons for the purpose of making adjustments should be made , therefore , between the actual organizations and the standard developed from similar resources ; that is to say , the land in crops , the available labor , capital , and other factors should be the same or similar in both cases . As a general rule , the more nearly alike the resources the more useful the standard will be . 1 . A Standard Forty-Acre Farm ' The usefulness of the standard in adjusting enterprise combinations may be made clear by a concrete illustration . For this purpose a standard forty-acre farm will be used . a . Resources . Inasmuch as the actual farm to be reorganized is approximately forty acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken from the North Carolina Experiment Station , Bulletin 277 , " Planning the Farm Business , " by ( l . W. Forst er. 2 In this chapter the acreage in crops is considered the measure of Hi size of the farm . Some additional hand will be necessary for buildings , yards , lots , and pastures . Practically all of the farms in the an , a hate some hood already in paslinne or have land avnilalle which can be used for t his purpose .  | to describe briefly the organization of a standard forty-acre farm . In the area in which the farm is located , a fortyacre farm is normally operated by two men , or by family labor , including that of the operator , equivalent to two men , or approximately 4,500 hours of man labor . Two mules or two horses are required to do the farm work . Buildings required , other than the dwelling , consist of one small stock barn , four hog houses , one poultry house , and one machine shed . The farm machinery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Table 25 . The total investment in physical resources is $14,615 . ( See Table 26. ) b . Cropping system . The cropping system suggested is presented in Table 27 . It consists of 8 acres of cotton , 10 acres of peanuts , 20 acres of corn and soybeans , and 2 acres of oats followed by soybeans for hay . Rye , lespedeza , or vetch is suggested as a cover crop and should be grown on at least one fourth of the crop area each year . This disposition of the crop area is somewhat different from that of farms of this size . Normally , cotton occupies about 40 per cent of the crop area . In the case of the standard , the cotton acreage has been reduced to 20 per cent . Peanuts , the principal cash crop , usually occupy 25 per cent of the crop area . This same percentage has been maintained for the standard . Corn , on the other hand , occupies about 30 per cent of the area , but in the standard it has been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of explanation . Cotton acreage has been reduced because cotton prices had shown a tendency to decline when this standard was designed , and it was believed that this tendency would continue ; or at least cotton prices would remain at relatively low levels . On the other hand , while prices of peanuts have been declining , the rate of decline has not been as rapid as that in the case of cotton . Furthermore , there is need for more livestock , especially hogs and poultry , on most farms in the area ; hence , the corn acreage has been increased to maintain a somewhat larger number of animals .  | c . Utilization of labor . Attention has been directed thus far to the utilization of the crop land . A word should be said about the utilization of the labor supply . Because of seasonality of agricultural production , it is difficult to suggest systems which will utilize all of the available labor economically , and it should be emphasized that the object in setting up these standards is not to attempt to use all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kind  | Figures 20 and 21 show the distribution of man and horse labor and the extent to which the total available labor may be utilized . A more even distribution of this labor throughout the year might be obtained by reducing the acreage in the major crops and by increasing the corn and hay crops and the number of livestock . But to do this would reduce the net income , because , in this area , cotton and peanuts are normally more profitable than corn and hogs or dairy cattle . Hence , under the system of farming practiced , it is impossible to use all of the available labor . However , a fairly satisfactory use has been made of the labor , and probably the standard suggested provides for the utilization of all labor to a greater extent , than the enterprises  | used by the majority of farms of this size in the area . Certainly the standard suggests a better utilization of the labor than Farm " A " to be described . ( Compare Figures 20 and 21. ) d . Yields and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kinds of fertilizer recommended are caption used , result in yields somewhat above the average for the area . The fertilizers suggested are based in part , upon ex-  | perimental data and in part upon the experiences of the more successful farmers . The amounts per acre and the grades of fertilizers recommended are 800 pounds of 8 ? 5 ? 3 on cotton , 200 pounds of 8 ? 2 ? 4 on peanuts , 500 pounds of 6 ? 6 ? 3 and 50 pounds of soda on corn , and 400 pounds of 6 ? 5 ? 3 on oats . It is recommended that 200 pounds of land plaster be applied to peanuts at blooming time . ( See Table 28 . ) The yield objective ( see Table 29 ) is one bale of cotton per acre , 1,800 pounds of peanuts , 35 bushels of corn , and 2 tons of hay . These yields are not impossible as farmers in the area have obtained yields for specific crops as high as or higher than those suggested in the standard . Experimental work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical than those generally obtained by farmers . Most farmers in the area use an 8 ? 3 ? 3 mixture on all crops . For cotton production a side dressing of soda is made in addition to the 8 ? 3 ? 3 used under the crop . This practice is followed also with regard to corn , although it is not as general as in the case of cotton . The object of the side dressing is to add additional units of ammonia . While this practice is not wholly bad , it is believed that the fertilizers suggested above will give more economical yields . Cotton yields are , of course , dependent also upon the control of the boll weevil . This insect has been very damaging in some seasons , reducing yields materially . Dusting , the common method of control suggested , is not often practiced in this area .. It would seem , however , from experimental work that has been carried on that the control of the boll weevil is possible . It is recommended , therefore , that in addition to using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include in their practice dusting for the control of this pest . In dusting it is advisable for farmers to employ the most approved methods . ' footnote a For more specific information the reader is referred to Leaflet No. 27 issued by the United States Department of Agriculture . This leaflet gives the amount to be applied per acre , dusting equipment , and the cost of application .  | e . Prices . r1 ' he prices used , with respect huth to products intended for sale and lu things purchased , are based on the market trends . ' l'Iit'se prices may he considered , roughly , as normal or long-time prices .  | f . Livestock production . The question of how many head of livestock should be maintained is always an important one . In projecting the cropping system and the amount and kind of livestock , the objective is to set up that combination of livestock and crop enterprise which will result in the maximum net returns for the farm business as a whole . The number of livestock suggested for the fortyacre standard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy cows , 3 sows , 36 shoats , and 125 hens . ( See Table 30 . ) This number of livestock per farm of this size is somewhat larger than that followed in the area . It appears , however , that livestock production is underemphasized and that a moderate increase would be profitable . In attempting to decide upon the amount of livestock to be maintained in any given case , the farmer should remember that the number and kind of livestock can not be determined independently of the cropping system . A further question is raised ? whether to sell feed crops or to dispose of them through livestock . This may be illustrated by considering the relation between corn and hogs . Corn may be sold as grain or used as feed . The general experience in the area is in favor of hogs as the best type of livestock to utilize this crop , although to a limited extent dairy cattle may be used for this purpose . In either case , should the farmer feed all of his corn , or would it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder , or to sell all above that needed for workstock ? The decision in this matter will depend upon the prices of corn on the one hand , and the price of pork and dairy.prodncts on  | the other . It would probably pay to feed most of the corn when prices for hogs and dairy products are similar to those which have been used in the standard . The question of the disposition of the corn crop is one which can not be settled once for all . The farmer , therefore , needs to give attention to the anticipated market demands for corn and for dairy products and hogs . This question is discussed more fully in Chapter IV . g . Disposition of feeds . Table 31 shows the disposition of feeds to the different classes of livestock on the standard forty-acre farm . The way in which these feeds have been distributed does not provide ideal rations . However , an at- tempt has been made to provide rations which are in line with the farmer 's experience . Better rations could be provided if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how much feed , in any given case , a farmer is willing or able to purchase . It is obvious that it is useless to suggest a ration which would probably not be used by the farmer . This question , together with the question of kind and amount of fertilizer used , is partly a technical as well as an economic problem . Therefore , it is suggested that , the student , when using this method , consult the various publications available on these subjects . ' Inasmuch as yields will not be the same from year to footnote 4 See North Carolina Extension Circular No. 175 , pp. 74-95.  | year , it may be desirable to carry over a small amount of feed from years when crops are good . In other cases , it may be desirable to buy a small amount of feed in some years and to sell a small amount in other years . Such adjustments in feed supply will be necessary on practically all farms . The amount of feed suggested for the different classes of livestock is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of farms in the area under investigation . Minor variations from the amount suggested will often be found advisable . A good rule is to have some home-grown feed to sell , rather than to buy such feeds . This rule has been followed in setting up this standard . '  | h . Financial returns . The income statement for the standard forty-acre farm is shown in Table 32 . The farm income is $2,203 ; the rate of return on investment , 9.6 per cent ; and the labor and management wages are $1,153 . The farm income is larger than that received by farmers in the area operating farms of this size . Among the chief reasons for this are : ( 1 ) A better utilization of the farm resources exists because of a better than average combination of farm enterprises ; ( 2 ) the amount and analysis of fertilizer recommended are above the average ; and ( 3 ) there is more livestock and a somewhat better grade than is found on most farms . 2 . The Analysis of an Actual Farm As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards may be employed for the purpose of improving existing farm organizations , it will be necessary to describe the organization and financial results of one of the better farms in this area and to compare the organization and financial returns of this farm with the organization and financial returns of the standard . Finally , this actual farm will be organized as suggested by the standard , and the effects on the returns of the farm will be noted . a . Resources of Farm " A " . The farm selected for this purpose will be designated as Farm " A " , the organization of which is typical in many respects of farms of the same size found in the area . There are 156 acres , 40.3 of which were in crops distributed as follows : cotton , 2.26 acres ; peanuts , 17.10 acres ; corn and soybeans combined , 13.5 acres ; oats , 2.59 acres ; alfalfa , 3.364 acres ; and miscellaneous crops , mostly truck and gardens , 1.469 acres . The investment , at the beginning of the year , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 4 head of dairy cattle valued at $160 , swine valued at $195 , and poultry footnote 6 See C1wl ) Lrr 1IT for n livrussion of tII ( , se ronrrlils.  | valued at $65 . The real estate was estimated to be worth $12,765 , of which amount $8,000 was invested in land ; $600 was in machinery and tools ; and $132 was in feed on hand . The total resources were valued at $14,267 . The farm was operated by the owner , assisted by two sons and some hired labor . The total labor annually available approximated 4,475 hours . b . Yield and production . Detailed information regarding the cropping system , livestock , feeds , and production is given in Tables 33 to 36 , inclusive . Table 33 gives the acres in each crop , yield per acre , total production , and disposition . The farm produced 1,074 pounds of cotton , 1,608 First year . This crop failed in 1928.  | pounds of cottonseed , 30,600 pounds of peanuts , 415 bushels of corn , 40 bushels of soybeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oat hay , 31/ tons of peanut vines and 1 ton of stover were fed . The yields were , in the main , satisfactory and were somewhat above the average for the area . The farm was somewhat more heavily stocked than the average farm of this size . There were 15.73 animal units , of which 2.5 units were workstock and 13.23 units were productive livestock . ( See Table 34 . ) The production was fairly satisfactory . The livestock products amounted to an equivalent of 530 pounds of butterfat , 3,474 pounds of pork , 258 dozen eggs , and 441 pounds of poultry . ( See Table 33. ) c . Financial results . The chief receipts were $1,487 from peanuts , $384 from pork , $270 from milk , $221 from cotton and cottonseed , $113 from poultry products , $42 from butter , and $51 from miscellaneous sales . ( See Table 37 . ) Included in the receipts were farm products used in the home valued at $236 , making a total income of $2,804 . The total operating expenses amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; feed , $135 ; and taxes , $128 . The net farm income was $1,790 ; and the return to investment , $990 , or at the rate of 6.9 per cent . The labor and management wage , that is , the payment of the operator for his labor and supervision , was $777.7 d . Weakness of the present organization . The organization of Farm " A " is not as well balanced as it might be , as too much emphasis has been given to peanut production . A. better utilization of the resources can be attained by a footnote 7 The return to investment as calculated involves the assumption that the unpaid family labor and the operator 's labor are actually worth $800 . This assumption may or may not be correct . To the extent that it is incorrect , i.e. , should be valued higher or lower , the net returns to investment will be larger or smaller than 6.9 per cent . The same weakness is involved in the calculation of the labor and managemenl wage . In addition to estimating the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rate of return should be 5 per cent .  | reduction in peanut acreage and an increase in cotton and corn acreage . An increase in corn acreage would permit an expansion of the livestock , especially of the hog enterprise . The yields , as already noted , are , as a rule , satisfactory . However , the grade of fertilizer used ( 8 ? 3 ? 3 ) is not that recommended for this area and for the crops grown . Better yields could be obtained by using 8 ? 5 ? 3 for cotton , 8 ? 2 ? 4 for peanuts , and 6 ? 6 ? 3 for corn , instead of 8 ? 3 ? 3 for all crops . ( See Table 36. ) 3 . The Reorganization of Farm " A " A comparison of the two organizations described above shows t hat there is a difference in the net farm income of  | $413 in favor of the standard system . ( Compare Tables 32 and 37 . ) The chief cause of this difference is the better combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is placed on cotton production and less emphasis on peanut production . Also , more livestock is maintained on the standard than on Farm " A " . While the yields are ' higher on the standard than on Farm " A " , this does not greatly affect the net income . Prices are somewhat higher on Farm " A " than those used in the standard . The expenses are about the same for the two organizations . To determine the effect of the combination of enterprises alone on returns , the effect of variations in yields , prices , and costs must be eliminated . This could be accomplished by using the same yields , prices , and cost rates for both the standard and Farm " A " . But such a method would involve the assumption that the same labor , fertilizer , and other factors of production used would result in the same production on Farm " A " as on the standard . Obviously , this might not be true . The better way is to reorganize Farm " A " to correspond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then to use normal prices , the same fertilizer and labor inputs , and the same yields as those obtained on Farm " A " . This will show the net effect of organization on the income . This has been done , and the results are given in Tables 38 to 42 . In Table 42 the comparison is made between income statement of the original and Farm " A " reorganized . The net gain due to organization alone is $179 . While this is not a large sum , it represents an increase in the capital value of the farm of approximately $3,600 . Or , the increase of $179 in net returns means that the rate of return has been increased from 5.8 per cent ( using normal prices ) to 7.7 per cent , or a net increase of 1.9 per cent . It should be remembered , also , that the yields on the original farm might be improved somewhat by using the amounts and kinds of fertilizer suggest ed in the st andard and also by increasing the quality of the livestock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested for Ilse stain lard , the yields over a period  | of years could be increased without greatly increasing the expenses of the operation . 4 . Criticism of the Standard Method The standard method of selecting and combining farm enterprises is not above criticism . Frankly some students of farm management are skeptical of its usefulness . The criticisms are concerned chiefly with the apparent artificiality of the results and its theoretical deficiencies . The standards , it is argued , are not actual , but artificial , combinations of enterprises . This being the case , the farmers may be misled into devising plans for their own farms , based on some defective or artificial standard , which might be much less rather than much more profitable than the original . Although this criticism is valid , the critics have overlooked the primary purpose of the standards , which is to serve simply as a guide to the farmers and not to be adopted in toto . The farmer must , as an entrepreneur , use his experience and judgment in adopting a standard as a guide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this treatise has used the standard method for a number of years on his own farm and has found it not only reliable as a guide as to what can and should be done but also as a check on actual performances . Furthermore , it is helpful in establishing orderly procedures in management , especially when a plan based on the standard is accompanied by a detailed map of the farm . It should also be mentioned that the standards are not as artificial as they may appear to be . The data used in developing the standards are obtained from a study of actual farms in a homogeneous area and from such experimental data as are available . Also the plans devised for a given area follow closely those actually in use by farmers . They are , then , in no real sense an artificial creation , but they are workable guides for the organization and management of farms having similar resources as the standard and following approved practices .  | I , It is not advisable in the area to which this farm applies to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited market for butterfat . See standard 40-acre farm for recommendations Does not include vegetables . Work on reorganized farm can be done without hiring extra labor . A more serious criticism than that of artificiality is advanced relative to the theoretical aspects of the method . It has been said that in using normal labor and material requirements and normal prices , the marginal concept in the use of resources has been ignored or forgotten . ( See Chapter VI . ) That is , the critics of the theoretical aspects of the method state , and correctly , that there is no such thing as normal or " necessary " material requirements for the production of a crop and livestock product . The requirements for production , except perhaps for basic minima , will vary Vllll changing prices and costs , with the efficiency and ca ' , achy of the entrepreneur , and with a number of other conditions . To quote Benedict : It is customary to speak of " labor requirements " and of " feed requirements " as though these were fixed and unchangeable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of production and to the prices of items of input and output . Yet the study of diminishing returns in given enterprises has demonstrated that these are not " requirements " but rather particular factor combinations that have been established by rule of thumb for the enterprise combinations previously existing on these farms ; that the optimum inputs may be different for different price conditions , a point that has been little discussed for different combinations of enterprises . Thus the amounts and timing of labor inputs are judged largely by what they have been rather than on the basis of what might be an optimum relationship under a new set of conditions . There is , of course , a considerable element of flexibility in the farm labor situation which makes it possible for the farmer to adjust himself to errors of judgment which he may make in developing some new organization of the farm business , and he may change the so-called " requirements " to a better adjustment almost without being conscious of the fact that he is doing so.8 This criticism is beyond a doubt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed , however , without some reference to the theory of diminishing returns and of equimarginal net returns . In devising the standards to be used , a number of combinations based on the organization of farms in a given area are set up , and financial results are determined . That combination of enterprises for a given set of resources which appears to be most profitable is accepted as a standard . Roughly , then , the factors of production , assuming normal requirements and prices , have been used to the best advantage or have been distributed to the various enterprises in such a manner as to obtain equimarginal net returns . It is true , nevertheless , that data are not available in the form required by the theory of equimarginal net returns , nor are such data likely to be available in the near future . In the absence of such information it is well for the student to keep in mind these limitations of the standard .

There are , as a rule , two schools of thought among agricultural leaders with respect to this subject ? those who advocate diversification and those who advocate specialization as the solution of the farm management problem . No middle ground is tolerated , nor is there any wide-spread belief that both of these concepts may be correct , depending upon the conditions confronting the individual farmer . It is the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as the data are available , the true nature of the problem involved . 1 . Diversification and Specialization Defined and De-scribed The term diversified farnziny , as popularly used , has no definite meaning . The common connotation is that a farm is diversified when its organization includes several crop and livestock enterprises . That is , the larger the number of enterprises , the more diversified the farm . Accurately stated , however , diversification is a function of two things , ( a ) the number of enterprises , and ( b ) the magnitude of the income derived from each enterprise . A farm business might consist of one principal enterprise together with a number of supplementary and complementary enterprises , but , unless these other enterprises are in themselves a source of income directly , the farm is said to he specialized . ( ' oiuplete specialization is seldom found iii agriculture . Di- v ersification is the rule rather than the exception . But diversification is a matter of degree , not of kind . At one end of the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , complete specialization . There are , then , not two problems but rather two aspects of the same problem , that of obtaining the most profitable combination of farm enterprises for a given set of resources available or under the control of the farm operator ( see Chapters VII to X ) . It is convenient to recognize four different degrees of diversification or specialization. ' a . When a farm is organized for the production of a single commodity , and this commodity is the only source of income , the farm is said to be specialized . b . When a farm is organized for the purpose of turning out a single product as the chief source of income but has several complementary or supplementary enterprises which contribute indirectly to the farm income , the farm is said to be semispecialized. c . When a farm is organized to produce several commodities each of which is in itself a direct source of income , the farm business is said to be diversified . d . Finally , when a farm is organized to produce one main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the farm income , the farm is said to he sennidiversified. 2 . The Law of Comparative Advantage A discussion of the reasons for specialization and diversification necessitates some reference to the important principle of comparative advantage . It is the principle or law of comparative advantage which governs the farmer in his choice of enterprises . A general statement of the law is difficult because of the numerous factors , economic and physical , which are involved . ( See Chapter VI . ) How- footnote See ( ; rny , Introduction to Agricultural Economics . p. 123.  | ever , the following will do as a brief statement of the law : Each farmer will tend to produce those products for which his resources enjoy the greatest comparative advantage . It should not be understood that a given farm will be devoted exclusively to a single line of production , although this may be the case , but rather the farmer 's resources will be used primarily in that line of production for which the area , and more particularly his farm , has a comparative advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely his available resources , a farmer in a given area may find it advisable to add to his principal line other lines of production . These other lines of production will be chosen Illustration from Bu. of - Ayr . Econ. caption partly upon their complementary and supplementary characteristics and partly on the basis of their relative prices . In short , a farmer on a given farm will organize his resources so as to produce to the maximum that commodity for which the farm has a comparative advantage , and then , if there  | are any unused resources , these will be used on such other lines as will tend to increase the net profits . ( See Chapter IV. ) 3 . Reasons for Specialization The principle of comparative advantage , as already observed , governs the farmer in his choice of enterprises , but we can be somewhat more specific by giving definite reasons why farmers tend to specialize . a . In a given area , because of the peculiar character of soil , topography , climate , and other physical conditions , one product may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If this be the case , there will be a tendency for farmers to devote a large part , perhaps all , of their resources to one line of production . Cotton , because of climate , soil conditions , and labor supply , is one of the most profitable crops which can be grown in the Coastal Plain , although other crops can be and are grown in this area . But , because cotton is relatively best adapted to the existing conditions , that is , has a comparative advantage , it tends to force other products into secondary positions . Citrus fruit in Florida and California , corn in the Corn Belt , and wheat in Kansas and the Dakotas are other examples of products adapted to certain areas . b . Specialization may be a means of enlarging the farm business . On large farms it is often possible to perfect better field arrangements , to equip the farm more adequately , and to establish , to some degree at least , a division of labor , specialization of tasks , or specialization in operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise is more easily reduced to routine than a system consisting of a number of enterprises . The reduction of the farm operations to routine permits the manager to acquire special skill and knowledge relative to the main enterprise . ( I. Specialization may permit a farmer to give attention to methods of developing a market and of selling products .  | When one product is turned out , a farmer may follow more closely the market conditions than when a. number or variety of products are produced . The production of a special commodity may permit the development of a special trade , which will make the farm more profitable than will the production of several products . Moreover , when farmers devote their attention to the production of one commodity , it is easier to develop cooperative marketing than when several products are involved . A good illustration of this is to be found in cooperative marketing of citrus fruits in California and Florida , or raisins in California , and of dairy products Wisconsin . e . The availability of some element u1 ' 1n ? ollncl ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International /arrester Co . Fig. 23 . Specialization in agricultural production is promoted by highly specialized machines .  | be a factor in specialization . The relative scarcity of some one productive element is sometimes the chief factor in specialization . Young men just beginning to farm often find it necessary to specialize to a greater extent than the farmer who has been in the business for some time . For example , such a young man may not possess sufficient capital to buy livestock ; hence , he has to devote his time and attention to the production of crops . Later on , as he accumulates sufficient funds , he may find it advantageous to add livestock to his farm business . Sometimes the availability of labor may limit specialization . In some cases , such as in the growing of wheat , in the production of strawberries , and in the production of cotton , the acreage planted is limited to the amount of labor which is normally available at harvesting time . The larger the amount of available labor which can be obtained at reasonable rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the inducement to specialize . f . The type of machinery available affects specialization . When hand tools were common , specialization could not be carried very far . However , when certain machines became available , specialization became common . With the invention and perfection of the reaping machine and combines , it became profitable to specialize in the production of wheat and small grains . With the invention and perfection of spraying machines , fruit growing became profitable . Further specialization in cotton production can be anticipated if a successful cotton picker were to become available to farmers . g . Perfection of methods of manufacturing or of preserving products is a factor affecting specialization . The invention of machinery for condensing milk and for making milk powders tends to expand the market for these products . With the expansion of the market there is a tendency to specialize in dairying . Improved methods of handling beef and beef products also tend toward specialization in the product ion of livestock .  | h . Changes in demands may bring about specialization . As a rule , consumptive demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce . However , sudden changes in demand may bring about specialization of production , or the reverse . i . A change in tariff policy may be a factor affecting specialization . An increase in the tariff on goods which are normally produced in this country , but not in sufficient quantities to supply the domestic demand , will tend to bring about a higher degree of specialization . An increase in tariff on sugar , peanuts , and wool will tend , other things being equal , to make it more profitable to specialize in these things than if these products were on the free list . Illustration from b'arni Credit i:1m. caption j . Specialization sometimes provides more leisure than does diversification . When this is the case , farmers often engage in some other business ; or other businessmen often engage in farming . Thus , in many of the sections of the South , lawyers , physicians , and merchants may engage in cotton production because it does not demand careful supervision throughout the year .  | k . Specialization is encouraged by improved transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , encourage specialization . When transportation facilities are poor , the farmer finds it more profitable or even necessary to diversify . Just as soon as market facilities are adequate , the tendency has been to concentrate on the production of some one product or a few products . Refrigerator cars , rapid freights , good roads , and the advent of the automobile have all been factors affecting specialization in agricultural production . 4 . Reasons for Diversification While there are many factors operating in favor of specialization , the fact remains that , generally speaking , farming is characterized not by specialization but by diversification . The factors favoring diversification in agriculture may be briefly stated as follows : a . Seasonality is the chief factor affecting diversification of production . As production of crops is confined , as a rule , to a few months of the year , farmers find it advisable to add livestock or poultry to the farm business in order to make a better utilization of their resources . This is especially true if they have no outside alternative for employing their labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonality of farm work may be a factor bringing about specialization . For example , dairy cattle may be added to the farm business for the purpose of giving employment to farm labor during the winter , and dairy farming may be , , uid usually is , a highly specialized type of farming . b . Diversification is often the means of reducing risks . Weather is a factor which causes wide variation in agricult Ural production . A bad season may prove disastrous to a farmer who is engaged in a single line of production . In order to avoid loss due to variability in weather , farmers have resorted to diversification . The inclusion of several enterprises in the farm business is not always a means of reducing loss from weather conditions . Change in weather  | conditions may be as destructive to several crops as to one . This is especially true when the crops are advanced somewhat in growth . However , as crops may be planted and harvested at different times of the year , diversification in crop production does give some insurance against loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loss . It may happen that prices of a given product may be so low as to be disastrous . Diversification as a means of reducing this type of risk is based on the assumption that all prices will not be low at the same time . It should be observed , however , that market prices often move together . Hence , diversification is not a. complete method of insurance against loss due to changes in market prices . For example , in 1920 practically all farm products collapsed at the same time . As a rule , however , diversification does provide some protection against loss in changes of market prices . Diversified farming may be a means of reducing damage from insect pests and plant diseases . The production of several crops in. rotation may be a means of checking the damage which normally would result from these pests and diseases . c . The utilization of intermediates and by-products is a factor affecting diversification . Farmers may find it profitable to introduce enterprises for the purpose of transforming by-products into marketable products . Again , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oats , wheat , rye , and barley , the farmer may have the choice of marketing these directly in their native form or of transforming them into some type of livestock product . When the prices of livestock products are high relative to prices of intermediate products , the farmer will find it profitable to convert these into livestock products . On the other hand , when the intermediate products are high relative to livestock products , the tendency will be toward specialization . Improvement in the technical skill and methods of conversion of by-products or intermediate products makes the conversion of these more profitable . Hence , there will be a  | tendency under such conditions to utilize products formerly sold directly on the market or allowed to go to waste . d . Soil fertility may be maintained or increased by the production of several crops and of livestock enterprises . The improvement or maintenance of soil fertility is often a factor working for greater diversification . The feeding of crops to livestock results in the producing of manure as a by-product . The manure may be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under these conditions it may pay to produce a crop which would not be produced if the manure were not available . It should be pointed out that diversification is not absolutely essential for the maintenance of soil fertility . A highly specialized farming system , suer ' as dairying , may maintain the fertility of the soil as well as a highly diversified farm . Again , a farm may be highly diversified , and still the fertility of the soil may not be improved or maintained . Farms producing several grain crops are diversified , yet such diversification does not , of necessity , maintain or improve the fertility of the soil . e . Diversification often gives a better distribution of money income throughout the year . When farming , with the possible exception of dairy farming , is highly specialized , the income is usually received during a short period . Diversification , however , may distribute the income more evenly throughout the year . This is often desirable . The concentration of the income in one season may lead to extravagance or may encourage it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save when the income is received in small amounts throughout the year . f . Increase in transportation cost is a factor affecting diversification . An increase in freight rates tends to bring about diversification in farming . Freight rates may be so high on a given product that the farmer will be forced to abandon the production of it . For example , in many parts of the irrigated sect ions of the West , alfalfa is produced and shipped to eastern markets . However , an increase in freight Tales may cause the production of alfalfa to become unprofit-  | able and force farmers to resort to the production of other crops . Other things being equal , the higher the freight rates on those things in which the farmer is specializing the greater will be the tendency toward diversification . g . Change in demand may bring about diversification . A change in demand for the principal product may be a factor affecting diversification . If the demand for a principal or a main product increases , the tendency , as already pointed out , is toward specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases , the tendency is toward greater diversification , especially if there are other products which are competing strongly with the main product for a place in the production scheme . 5 . Diversification and Returns Farm returns are not necessarily a function of diversification or of specialization . Whether or not specialization will pay better than diversification depends on the combination of the various factors enumerated and discussed in preceding chapters . In general , it may be said that in any given region , when the conditions favor diversification , it will not pay , except occasionally , to specialize . On the other hand , if the conditions are all , or almost all , favorable to specialization , it will not pay to diversify . A general principle or statement can not be made which will hold for all conditions . Or , to state it in more definite terms , returns will not increase or decrease necessarily as the degree of diversification increases or decreases . A few examples will be presented to illustrate this fact . According to a study made in 1925 , specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . This fact is shown in Table 43 . As the area in tobacco increased , when other factors were held constant , the operator 's earnings increased . ' However , this footnote 2 Data were analyzed by partial and multiple correlation methods .
