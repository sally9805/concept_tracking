txt The individual report of the Bank of England 's economic expert on the industrial situation in Great Britain , cabled to THE TIMES from London yesterday , does not add much to what was already known . It has the merit , however , of discarding theories such as often obscure such a discussion , and of basing conclusions on visible facts . Summed up , Mr. CLAY ascribes the post-war troubles of Great Britain 's trade , especially in the export field , to basic changes which the war had caused in the whole world 's economic relations . In 1921 " industry was suddenly " faced with the necessity of adjust " ing itself to the cumulative effects " of six years of unnoticed change . " First of all , England 's inability in wartime to provide for her customary overseas markets had brought into existence manufacturing industries in other countries ? industries competing directly with Great Britain 's exports , and strongly fostered by protective tariffs . As one result , Mr. CLAY declares that " the Lancashire cotton industry , " although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a quarter of its pre " war markets : " Next , ' the world 's consumption of coal , formerly a backlog of British exports , is . now being extensively economized by new combustion processes and by use of substitutes . Yet England , like dether coal-producing nations , " continued to pour labor into the coal-mining industry , " at a time when there was " great need to get labor out of coal-mining and not " into it . " Finally , the habits even Of home consumers of British products had been grezaly altered by the heavy taxation left as a le4acy of war and by the " economic dislocation " of Nartime . At the same time , according to Mr. CLAY , the fall of British prices in the export trade since 1924 has still left those prices on the average 511-3 per cent above the pre-war level , while average prices for British imports are now only 18 per cent higher than before the war . He ascribes largely to this discrepancy the fact that the country 's export trade is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying at one and the same time , " Mr. CLAY asserts , " to induce the " world to buy more from us and to " charge the world more than the " world thinks our products are " worth . " For the most part , this is not a new view of the dilemma , although there will probably be some skepticism over the view expressed oX the discrepancy between export and import prices . In so far as this has resulted from the fact that ' raw materials , which England imports but does not export , notoriously fell in 1930 much faster than finished goods , it would not follow that it had put England further out of touch with the world markets . The London expert draws no very positive conclusions as to the way out . But he rather clearly intimates the necessity for " movement of workers from " declining to expanding industries , " the wiping out of debts , and the " reduction of prices and Wages " that pre-war distress would have " brought about . " In part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the essential fact will remain of the changed world market since the war for many staple products of British manufacture .
