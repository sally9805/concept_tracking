One night last week German Austrian storm troopers loaded 51 Jews , including an 82-year-old rabbi , into a Danube river launch , took them downstream to the point where Austria , Czechoslovakia and Hungary meet . There they dumped them on a stone breakwater in the middle of the swollen stream . All night they crouched on cold , slippery stones barely emerging from the water . <P> <P> Next morning the Jews ' cries and frantic waving of handkerchiefs attracted the attention of Czech villagers . A Czech patrol boat took off the penniless , ill-clad , hungry group . <P> Czech authorities fed and clothed the 51 , kept them sheltered in Bratislava for two days . But the Czechs feared that further charity to Jews would encourage Austrian Nazis to drive Jews in thousands over into Czechoslovakia . Therefore , the Czechs piled the Jews into trucks at night , dumped them over into Hungary . <P> Hungarian border patrols , after the Czechs hastily drove off , acted on the theory that the only thing to do was to dump the Jews back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the frontier strapping Greater German Nazis were more than ready to arrest , punish the tragic unfortunates for " illegal entry , " but 15 Jews broke away and made for the Danube . They eluded Nazi and Hungarian pursuers and managed to spend the night shivering on a sandspit . In the morning a French patrol boat took them aboard , compassionately anchored in mid-Danube , awaited orders from new Premier Edouard Daladier . <P> All this was a single , small , dramatic incident in what is apparently a ruthless Nazi drive to strip as many Austrian Jews as possible of their possessions , then further harass them by " expelling " them to neighboring countries which can not support penniless refugees , are forced to acts of " expelling " Jews back into Greater Germany .
