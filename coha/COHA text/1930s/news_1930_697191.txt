txt Denouncing as " unjust and impracticable " the present method , sanctioned by recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court , of appraising public utility property for rate-making purposes , Governor Roosevelt has vetoed a bill introduced on behalf of the Knight commission , following its survey of the public service law , to provide for a valuation of State-wide utility properties . " I am disapproving this bill because it tends to perpetuate the present valuation Muddle , which all agree renders effective regulaticn impossible , " the Governor wrote in his veto memorandum . " I am disapproving it because it is distinctly contrary to the proper principles of valuation , and , actually and literally carried out , it would in all probability produce higher rates than those which now burden consumers of public utility services . " The Governor called attention to the fact that the version finally sent to him for approval was the fourth reprint of the bill since its introduction . The bill bore the name of Senator Thayer of Franklin County , chairman of the Senate Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voted Against Bill . " The introducer himself refused to vote for this bill , on the ground that it was nothing like the bill for which he was responsible , " the Governor wrote . It is understood , however , that the real reason for Senator Thayer 's repudiating this and other bills of the Knight commission series bearing his name was that he is opposed to any changes of consequence in the public service law now in force . Governor Roosevelt quoted the report of Colonel William J. Donovan , chief counsel for the Knight commission , in which the broad statement occurred that present rate determination was largely a matter of " guesswork . " The Governor declares that the only solution lay in valuations based on actual cost . He said both the conservative majority and the radical minority group on the Knight commission , which owed its appointment to him , had agreed on the importance of valuation in the regulation of public utilities , and upon the vagueness and futility of the method laid down in decisions of the highest court in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor said , " in- dicates the utter hopelessness of trying to secure proper regulation if there is insistence upon guesses at valuation , according to lines laid down by the courts . " Favors Minority Plan . " The plans suggested by the minority of the commission , and proposed through bills introduced in the Legislature , provide the simplest approach to this major problem , " Governor Reosevelt said . " It attempts to meet it by providing for a complete valuation of all utility properties in the State , according to doctrines heretofore laid down by the courts , only as a definite starting point . " Thereafter all additions to the rate base would be on the basis of actual cost and no more . This would provide a definite and ascertainable rate base , always available in the bookkeeping entries of the companies . It would guard against all future inflations . " The majority of the commission recognized the advantages of this plan in terms of simplicity and definiteness , but expressed the belief that it would be declared unconstitutional . " Without seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan aside without even discussing it , and took up the original print of the valuation bill which is now before me . " This bill originally provided that the Public Service Commission should make a valuation of all the utilities in the State , in accordance with the court decisions . So far it followed the minority recommendations . " But its fatal weakness was that it provided that this tremendously expensive process should be repeated from time to time , and that regulation should never get permanently away from the unjust and impracticable present value basis . " Fair Value " Matter of Doubt . " The evidence before the commission shows that no one has a clearcut conception of the meaning of fair value , that no one can account satisfactorily for inconsistencies in its application in recent cases , and that no definite standard exists with respect to such factors as depreciation , going value , ' and the ' reproduction ' theory . It is inevitable that such indefiniteness in the very fundamental of rate control should produce constant controversy and litigation . " The present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain in service plant and equipment which have become obsolescent and inadequate . It promotes public utility speculation because of its indefiniteness . " The " absurdity of rate regulation on the basis which this bill would perpetuate , " the Governor said , was clearly demonstrated through testimony given before the Knight commission by the heads of the Consolidated Gas Company and the New York Edison Company . Both these lutility executives said , when examined . that their companies consistently refused to charge even the minimum rates to which they would he entitled on the " present value " ' hero y , as interpreted by the courts . Profits Enormous , He Says . " Every one knows , " the Governor said , " of the enormous profits to the common stockholders of these cornIpanies , many times more than a reasonable return on the actual cash linvestments made , and yet they say they are undercharging , according to the present value theory . " The recent New York Telephone Company case is a perfect example of the complete futility of regulation based upon so uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuation . " It has meant more than ten years of controversy . Even before the lattest development it had produced about 63,000 pages of testimony and 4,300 exhibits . It has cost the company well over $5,000,000 , which has , ' of course , been passed on to telephone users in higher rates . The attempt to guess at the fair value of the company 's property in 1926 resulted in six different conclusions , ranging all the way from $337,000,000 up to $615,000,000 . The telephone company itself produced two different guesses , about $100,000,000 apart . " The bill as originally introduced would have deliberately perpetuated these absurdities . The bill in its final form offers no way of escaping them . The present breakdown of regulation can not be corrected without laws which make possible the fixing of a definite rate base , determinable by definite rules of policy and of accounting rather than by guesswork . The only solution is to get on an actual cost basis . Attacks " Perpetuating " Evils . " As I have already noted , the proposals submitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition to such an actual cost basis . While additions to the original valuation would be on a cost basis , the initial valuation itself would be gradually worked out of the rate base through depreciation and retirement . In the end , certainty and fairness would be substituted for the present absurdity . " In contrast , the bill which I have before me does nothing to remove the evils of the present system . It practically gives statutory sanction to all tilt- t is unjust , unworkable and absurd in the present situation . " This bill is a complete acknowledgment of failure to meet the outstanding problem of regulation . It was passed during the last hours of the session in a form that was not even printed , so that few of the legislators voting on it really knew its contents . " It tends to perpetuate a system of regulation which does not regulate . It is not based on any recommendation of the Revision Commission , and can find no substantiation in the evidence submitted before the commission . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
