In 1930 Kentucky , tired of claims of dishonest election counts by precinct officials , passed a law requiring that four padlocks be placed on all ballot boxes , that the boxes be carried to county seats and counted there by county election boards on the day following the election . In 1932 that 24-hour delay did not keep anyone in the U. S. from knowing that Franklin D. Roosevelt had been overwhelmingly elected President of the U. S. the day before . <P> Last week , tired of waiting for election returns , Kentucky decided it would take no chances of holding up what promised to be closer election results for 1936 , passed a " quick count " election law to finish with other states on election night .
