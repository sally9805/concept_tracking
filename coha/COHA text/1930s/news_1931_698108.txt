txt Letters to the Editor The Hyena Could Not Object . To the Editor of The New York Times : For a long while I have felt as you do , That a baser description should be habitually applied to the murderous ruffians who prey on the great majority of law-abiding citizens everywhere . Now that you have issued a call , I should like to submit " hyena " as being a suitable appellation . The dictionary defines that loathsome beast as follows : " A carnivorous quadruped of the genus hyena , of nocturnal habits and subsisting chiefly upon carrion ; characterized ? ? by shaggy hair and a cowardly but ferocious disposition akin to that of the wolf . " There is nothing heroic or romantic in that name ; mention of it brings to mind a filthy , slinking beast of the night . It can scarcely be believed that any lad of even criminal tendencies would aspire to such a designation . ALOYSIUS L. SCHUSZLER . Brooklyn , Aug. 25 , 1931 . Taxes and Valuations . To the Editor of The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opposition to the extension of tax exemption for two years would be justified if we were in the midst of prosperity , but it may be questioned in these days of adversity . Thousands of small home owners will be seriously affected if the extension is not granted . Should the city decide not to continue the exemption , then it would be proper , almost peremptory , for the Tax Department to issue notice to all persons owning tax-exempt properties to apply , at a specified date , for a reduction in the assessed valuation . This would give them a chance to get their valuations down to a more equitable basis ; and while it might result in an increase in their taxes , the increase would not by any means be as considerable as it would if the present high assessed valuations remain on the record . L. RODNEY BERG . New York , Aug. 19 , 1931 . No General Mortgage Moratorium . To the Editor of The New Y ? CMOS : A letter published Aug. 31 from Peter Sigel says : " Lawson Purdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be sorry to have it believed that I made such a'recommendation . The statement is based upon an interview with me published in THE TIMES on . Aug. 19 in which the reporter quoted me as favoring such a moratorium , and quoted me further as follows : " Such a moratorium was virtually in existence today , for every sensible mortgagee would rather accommodate a borrower than foreclose if the latter had a good reputation . " That statement correctly reports what I said . I did not and do not favor any moratorium imposed by law . Each case must stand on its own merits . LAWSON PURDY . New York . Aug. 31 , SIMPLIFIED SPELLING . Inconsistencies Are Found In Professor Zachrisson 's New Spelling . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your recent editorial on " Simplified Spelling " ends with the query whether the existing script , in spite of phonetic deficiencies , may not after all be preferable to the reform alphabet proposed by Professor Zachrisson of Upsala . Since the new spelling has been boomed in London as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may I call attention to some of his many incon-sistencies ? He confounds the sound-values of " s " and " 1 , " and spells " present " phonetically , but " has , is " incorrectly . His alphabet fails to distinguish between the soft and hard " th " ; " the " and " orthography " being spelled alike . So is " ng " in " teaching " and " English " ; but " ng " has different values . The professor arbitrarily drops the mute vowel before a final " n , " spells " givn , " but ( horribile visu ) " eduekaeshon . " The two vowels in the word " English " sound alike and should be spelled alike . Mr. Zachrission 's " tuu " ( two ) would dovetail with " huu , " but he timidly clings to the traditional spelling " who . " The phonetic justification of his " nolij " and " foriner " is at least doubtful . What is praiseworthy in the professor 's self-defeating efforts is the sane policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English-writing peoples . Of course we must not expect too much from a spelling reform . In an ideal alphabet each letter would represent one sound only , and no sound would mate with more than one letter . One thing is certain , that English spelling is utterly inconsistent and needs a recast badly . " Ghost , laugh , night . though , " in a phonetic garb , would look somewhat like " gost , laf , nite , tho " ; " Greenwich , know , psalm , victuals " like " Grinich , no , sam , vitels . " A few years ago , when I lived in Kashmir , I prepared in the interest of a movement whose aim was to Latinize the various scripts of polyglot India the subjoined reform alphabet , which is far from phonetic but simpler and more scientific than Mr. Zachrisson 's script : a b c d dh e ei f g h i j k l m n ng o oi ou p q r s t th u v w x y z zh . Pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ( ch-air ) , dh ( th-en ) , e ( as in let her say ) , et ( height ) , g ( g-o ) , i ( as in it eat ) , ng ( so-ng ) , o ( as in on , cold , blood ) , of ( oi-1 ) , ou ( ou-t ) , q ( quit ) , th ( th-in ) , u ( as in p-u-t d-o ) y ( y-es ) , zh ( as in measure ) . C , j , q , x are compound sounds ( t-sh d-zh kw ks ) ; a , e , 1 , o , u represent thirteen sounds in the above script , which has no diacritical signs either , and had to make these concessions . Thirty-four symbols reflect forty-three sounds . ERNEST P. HORRWITZ . New York , Aug. 31 , 1931 . SAVING FOR RELIEF . How Can That Be Done , It Is Asked , by Adding to Unemployment ? To the Editor of The New York Times : The workings of the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the average citizen , but at rare intervals one plucks up courage to inquire as to the exact process of reasoning by which they arrive at their more brilliant decisions . I note in today 's newspapers that tile . city fathers have decided that $10,000,000 must be saved for unemployment relief this Winter . To accomplish this noble purpose they will start by dropping 469 employes from the payroll of the Board of Transportation , thus at one bold stroke saving $1,000,000 of the required sum  --  and to insure the saving they have resolved to employ no new men in any department . The only quarrel one may have with this decision is that it is not carried to its logical conclusion . If $10,000,000 are required , by the simple processes of elementary proportion one arrives , at the conclusion that by adding 4,690 people to the ranks of the unemployed the $10 , - 000,000 would be raised , or saved , and this could in turn be used to relieve the resulting unemployment . To put it still more logically , the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unemployed . Thia is especially true when those selected for sacrifice are engineers , who are preparing plans of works for many other hands to work on . ELLES M. DERBY . Brooklyn , Aug. 29 , 1931 . THE FORGOTTEN MAN . He Seems to Have Been Remembered in Providing Relief Funds . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Governor 's message to the Legislature , relative to unemployment relief , calls sharply to mind Professor William Graham Sumner 's essay on the " Forgotten Man . " In the message we read : " It seems logical that those of our residents who are fortunate enough to have taxable incomes should bear the burden of supplementing the local governmental and private philanthropic work of assistance . I b9-lieve that this tax should fall proportionately on all incomes , over and above existing exemptions ? ? ? in proportion to the benefits they receive and the prosperity they enjoy . " It is interesting to compare the foregoing words of the message with the following which appear in the British Labor party 's manifesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in THE Draw Yonx TIMES yesterday : " the financial interests have decided this country is setting a bad example to other countries in taxing the rich to provide necessities for the poor . " Said Sumner : " As soon as A observes something which seems to him to be wrong , from which X is suffering , A talks it over with B , and A and B then propose to get a law passed to remedy the evil and help X. Their law always proposes . to determine what C shall do for X or , in the better case , what A , B and C shall do for X. ? ? What I want to do ie look up C. ? ? ? I call him the Fergotten Man . Perhaps the appellation is not strictly correct . He is the man who never is thought of . He is the victim of the reformer , social speculator and philanthropist. * * * Whenever A and B put their heads together and decide what A , B and C must do for D , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and like it . There is rarely any pressure on D because he does not like it and contrives to evade it . The pressure all comes on C. ? ? ? He is always the man who , if let alone , would make a reasonable use of his liberty without abusing it . He would not constitute any social problem r.t all and would not need any regulation . ? * ? As soon as he is brought from his obscurity you see that he is just that one amongst us who is what we all ought to be . " He works , he votes , generally he prays  --  but always he pays  --  yes , above all , he pays . He does not want an office ; his name never gets into the newspaper except . when he gets married or dies . He keeps pro-. duction going on . He contributes to the strength of parties . He is flattered before election . He is strongly patriotic . He is wanted , whenever , in his little circle , there is work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He gives no trouble . He excites nq admiration . He is not in any way a hero . ? ? * Therefore , he is forgotten . All the burdens fall on him , or on her , for it is time to remember that the Forgotten Man is not seldom a woman . " The message estimates that the proposed increase in income tax will fall on approximately 300,000 persons , although in this State " thirteen million people face the problem of providing immediate relief . " That is to say , one person out of every group of forty-three or forty-four will bear the burden . The Forgotten Man seems to have increased to 800,000 men -- 4 and women . ROBERT E. WHALEN Albany , IV . r . , Aug. 2J , MM . The National Rifle Matches . To the Editor of The New York Times : As a reader of THE TIMES for more than fifty years , and during all these years being much interested in rifle practice , let me congratulate and thank you for the fine accounts you are publishing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am very confident there must be many others interested in rifle practice who are reading these accounts with great interest . No doubt you remember that during the World War General Pershing laid great stress on the American soldier 's being taught t ? use his rifle intelligently . It was necessary to teach the men how to shoot . Our country had been so largely built up and game had so greatly decreased that the average young American was no longer familiar with the use of the rifle . That General Pershing was right is proved by the fact that we heard that the results of our rifle fire against the enemy was so effective they thought we had many more machine guns than we really had . The meeting at Camp Perry , attended by so many from all over our country , will be a great factor in stimulating interest in rifle shooting , which is a clean sport , calling for good nerves and steadiness , and free from'any commercialism . OLD RIFLE SHOT . New York , Aug. 31 , 1931 . Measures Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The action of Dr. William H. Runcie , Health Officer of Freeport , N. Y. , in ordering all drug and candy stores to use paper cups and sterilize spoons and other utensils , in an effort to curb the infantile paralysis spread in Freeport , should be followed elsewhere . These places are the Mecca of all children during the Summer mon &is,; and as such may well be the sources of much infection . Drinking-fountains in parks might well come in for extra attention by the health authorities , and should be padlocked when not used with paper cups . Too often one sees groups of children around the " spouting variety , " putting their mouths right down on the metal nozzle , in quick succession . That germs are not rendered harmless by a flow Of cold water is a matter of common knowledge . LOUISE de WETTER . Roxbury , Conn. , Aug. 24 , 1931 . Curbing Taxicab " Gyps . " To the Editor of The New York Times : I think the Police Commissioner should be commended for his efforts to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers with their meter flags up . Of course , all of the blame should not rest on the cab , driver . Where a passenger connives with the driver to cheat the company , he is equally culpable , and it might help public morals if the passenger in the cab is given an opportunity to explain as to whether he connived with the driver or not . Any efforts made to reduce dishonesty among public or semi-public employes should be applauded . RALPH N. TAYLOR . New York , Aug. 211 , Mr. Colby 's Charges . To the Editor of The New York Times : Referring to ex-Secretary Colby 's charges last Monday night , Commissioner Mulrooney says they do not interest him , that what he wants is facts . Well , is n't it a fact that there are 30,000 speakeasies , more or leek in this city ? Is n't it a fact that not one of them could do business without protection ? Is n't it a fact such illegal places could not get protection without paying for it ? 0 . 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
