Down in flames amid a thunder of exploding bullets came Springfield , Ill. ' s huge , old National Guard Armory last month . Only clue to the $750,000 fire 's origin was a small boy in leather jacket and tweed cap who that morning had reported to the custodian a small blaze in the armory 's washroom . <P> Last week in a Springfield schoolroom officers found the boy . His name was Cecil Kiper and he was ten years old . Sullen with fright , he denied knowing anything about the fire until taken before Governor Horner , who used to be a juvenile court judge . There Cecil Kiper told how he had filled a bag with shavings , weighted it with solder , lighted it , thrown it on the armory stage . <P> " Why ? " asked Governor Horner . <P> " I like to see burning buildings , " said Cecil Kiper . <P> In St. Louis fortnight ago Mrs. Charles Fricke watched without concern her son Gustavo , 15 , crawl into the family living room on hands &; knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small brother Eddie . Gustave lay on the couch for a while , complained that his stomach was hurting , crawled off to bed . Next morning at schooltime he stayed in bed . About noon he crawled downstairs , changed his clothes . His father , home for lunch , noticed that his son was pale and glassy-eyed . <P> At a hospital that afternoon , just before he died , Gustave Fricke told what had happened . At school on Friday he had received a suspension notice , for truancy and general misbehavior . The notice ordered him to appear at the Superintendent 's office Monday morning with his parents . Sunday evening Gustave got his father 's revolver , went out to the garage , shot himself through the stomach .
