txt One week from the day that Congress convened the House passed today 1 and sent to the Senate the " united front " bonus bill calling for immediate and full cash payment of the adjusted service certificates of those veterans who wish payment at this time . The overwhelming vote of 356 to 59 was slightly more than 6 to 1 , but at that the opposition was stronger than veteran members would predict a few minutes before the roll call began . Nevertheless , the vote represented the greatest strength ever shown by bonus advocates during the years the problem has been before the House . Immediately after the House vote was announced Senate administration leaders began hurried conferences in an effort to find some conypromise for the bill that would meet President Roosevelt 's approval . Senator Harrison called a meeting of the finance committee for Monday to consider the whole bonus issue , including a proposal for issuance of bonds instead of cash . These bonds , however , would be payable on demand . The bill as passed by the House does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The measure approved by the record House vote today was the same as that approved by the Ways and Means Committee . In brief , it provides as follows : Immediate payment of bonus certificates of those veterans who wish cash at this time . Cancellation of all accrued interest in the loans obtained in the past by veterans , but no refund of interest previously paid by borrowers . Compound interest at the rate of 3 per cent on certificates held by veterans who do not wish cash , but who elect to continue their certificates in effect until the original expiration date , Jan. 1 , 1945 . As members voted in the House each name was checked by heads of the three major veterans ' associations , who sat in the gallery and frowned as the scattered " nay " votes were recorded . When the vote , which was corrected twice later , was announced , the group headed by Ray Murphy , National Commander of the American Legion , and James E. Van Zandt , National Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch to congratulate them upon their victory . " We are now going to try and get early action in the Senate , " Mr. Murphy said as he left the gallery . " The vote reflects the overwhelming sentiment in favor of immediate payment . " Statement by Van Zandt . Although Mr. Van Zandt expressed the view that " obstacles " would be encountered in the Senate , he issued a statement saying his organization would admonish the Senate to study the House vote and " Go thou and do likewise . " In the vote today party lines were split . There were 279 Democrats voting for the bill , including Speaker Byrns , who asked that his name be called ; 68 Republicans voted yes , 6 Progressive and all 3 Farmer-Labor members . The two major parties ran a close race in opposition , 31 Republicans voting against , while 28 Democrats opposed the bill . Six members were paired on the bill , ten did not vote , while the four vacancies brought the total to 435 . The absentees were Adair , Illinois ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kee , West Virginia ; Lewis , Maryland ; Schneider , Wisconsin ; Stewart , Delaware ; Thom , Ohio ; Thomas , New York , and White , Idaho . Twenty-four Democrats and five Republicans of the New York delegation voted for the bill , while three Democrats and ten Republicans voted against . The three Democrats voting against the measure were Mrs. O'Day , Sisson and Peyser . The latter was the only New York City Democrat who voted against the bill . It was the general sentiment , according to some leaders , that a bill incorporating the features of the Byrnes-Steiwer proposal , already before the Senate , would be the " compromise " measure that will be returned to the House . This plan moves up the date of maturity of the certificates from 1945 to 1938 , thus automatically , increasing the loan value to 97 per cent of the face value . It would also cancel accrued interest . Such a bill , some Senate leaders believe and have informed veterans ' organizations , would be signed by the President , who has insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment " measure . Senator Elmer Thomas , when advised of the vote , said that members of Congress " would be tarred and feathered " if they returned home without providing the means and manner of meeting the cost of paying the certificates . He is expected to introduce amendments providing for issuance of currency against gold and silver reserves . Another plan under discussion , and which is said to have been communicated to President Roosevelt , would provide for the issuance of negotiable bonds which veterans could cash or use as collateral for loans from banks or Ifrom the postal savings deposits . Cash Outlay Cost Estimated . Veterans ' leaders estimated the actual cash outlay necessary to meet the cost at about $1,000,000 , - 000 . An analysis given to the Ways and Means Committee read in part as follows : " The matured value of the outstanding certificates as of Jan. 1 , 1936 , is $3,463,000,000 . The estimated amount as of the same date on account of canceled interest is $290,350,000 . The value of the adjusted-service certificate fund as of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make cash payment with cancellation of interest is $2,282,350,000 . " The provision for paying interest on the face amount will act as an inducement to reduce the demand for immediate payment . There are some 494,000 certificates upon which no loans have been made . , The matured value of these certificates approximates $500,000,000 . " We feel that conservatively estimated there will be a reduction of more than $500,000,000 in present cash outlay otherwise needed for payment . " Thus , adding these two large items we have approximately $1 , - 000,000,000 of the amount which otherwise would be payable to the veterans , if all of them desired cash payment , which can be taken care of without present Treasury financing , on a sound fiscal basis with the result that to that extent there will be no immediate call for expenditure by the government under this bill . Thus $1,282,350,000 is the present cash outlay needed . ( " Even this reduced amount should not be considered in its entirety as an additional burden an the Treasury because of this legislation . The adjusted service certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates at their face maturity date of Jan. 1 , 1945 . " This sinking fund is the accumulation of annual appropriations thereto which , with the accumulation of compound interest , will or should , provide a sum equal to the face value of the certificates on 1 Jan. 1 , 1945 . " The estimated amount required to be in the fund on Jan. 1 , 1936 , is $1,535,000,000 . As stated above , the estimated value of the fund as of Jan. 1 , 1936 , is $1,471,000,000 . Thus there is a deficit in the fund of approximately $64,000,000 which should be there now for payment of the certificates . This deficit must be made up whether the immediate cash payment of the certificates is provided tor or not . "
