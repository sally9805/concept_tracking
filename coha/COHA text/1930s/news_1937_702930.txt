txt Appointment by the American Bar Association of a special committee of lawyers to assist private industry in assuming a larger share of social responsibility Is asked In a proposal before Arthur T. Vanderbilt , president of the association , here today . Made by J. IC . Javits , a New York attorney , the recommendation is based upon the premise that private enterprise has neglected responsibilities which Government thereupon assumed . Action on the suggestion can not be taken until the board of the bar association meets early next year , Mr. Vanderbilt said . " Lawyers are still the principal advisers of industry and finance . " Mr. Javits says in his proposal . " What is more , unlike economists , engineers and other technical experts , their advice is most often listened to . If there is , therefore , to be any consonance as between industry and finance and modern social ideas , the lawyer must be responsible for it . " The recommendations were made by Mr. Javits In response to an appeal by Mr. Vanderbilt to make " the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public interest , " " I believe it is Incumbent upon the association to take a leading part in educating its own members In the modern concepts on the following subjects , " Mr. Javits says : " 1 . The true relation of industry and finance to government . " 2 . The social responsibilities of industry and finance , " 3 . Lawful methods for discharging those social responsibilities . " 4 . Reappraisal of our organic laws , Including the Constitution , in the light of the development of the country into a state of society which may best be described as Industrialism . " Many thinkers believe that it Is only by the action of private industry in assuming responsibilities for social well-being which government has taken up that we can avoid some extreme in governmental regulation over private rights in our country , Communism and fascism may be indigenous to the countries in which they originate , but they are symptomatic of a world impulse which is common to all peoples , including our own . " The new leadership In industry , in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " Our legislators are still principally lawyers , " ' he continues . " So are many of the leading figures in the world of commerce and finance , and our judges are practically all lawyers , " Attention has been called to the alleged lessening of influence which the lawyer has upon public opinion and problems of the day . Bo far has it gone that even those high in government office have not hesitated to assail the intellectual leadership of the legal profession as unjustified , or as being twisted for self-serving or client-serving purposes . Affects Social Order " The inculcation of a deep-seated prejudice In the public mind against the legal profession can not put affect our whole social order . Lawyers are not only trained thinkers , but they are also disciples of fixed principles of human relationships . Without such principles , there is no democracy and no freedom . " In addition to personal leadership , lawyers also must help to save business morality and leadership , Dr. Javits told the Christian &lende; Monitor correspondent here . lie condemned " the case-hardened outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part for discredit suffered by business during the depression . " Owners of businesses are still the most substantial members in every community , " he said . " It is the rehabilitation of their business morals and ethics which the lawyer must take in hand . That rehabilitation he can only carry through effectively if he recognizes the new social obligations of business and advises business men how properly to fulfill them . " Because the influence of the lawyer is in the direction of solving governmental problems within codified law rather than by flat , it is highly impdrtant that the lawyer regain his position of Intellectual leadership , Mr. Javits believes . Otherwise , he says , there may be a sharp swing either to the right or left . " In the days of the agitation for American independence , in the drafting of the Constitution , and In the days of reconstruction after the Civil War , lawyers were the prophets , " he added . " There is sad need for such prophecy today . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
