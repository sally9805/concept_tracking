Mme. Lehmann is severe on the voice factories which turn out singers in two years , and contrasts this state ' of affairs ( fostered by ignorant or unscrupulous managers ) with the time when an eight-year course was required at the conservatories . She herself was so lucky as to have a mother who Could sing , and who was her first teacher . She began humbly , in operetta , and gradually became one of the leading grand-opera singers of her time , differing from most others in not being a narrow specialist , but an expert in Italian florid song as well as in the Wagnerian drama . This versatility makes her ideally qualified to pose as a teacher for singers in general . Beginners who have difficulty with their breath will be consoled on reading that the writer herself was very short of breath by nature , and will be interested in her method of overcoming this defect . Singers of more mature years will eagerly read what she has - to say about the secret of keeping the voice young . The hygienic hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are all based on personal experience . One of her topics is the reason why artists like to sing Wagner . There are also remarks on the duration of concerts , on applause , on . the behavior of audiences , and many other things of interest to music-loVers . While holding that " it is not enough to sing well ; one must also know how one does it , " Mme. Lehmann admits that there are exceptions . Patti could give no explanation of her art , but answered all questions concerning it with an " Ah , je n'en sais rien . " Daniel Boone . By Reuben Gold Thwaites . Illustrated . D. Appleton &; Co. 1902 . Daniel Boone ( 1734-1820 ) was an extreme type of our foremost frontiersmen . Born in eastern Pennsylvania , he moved far West with various halts , chiefly in Kentucky , and , keeping on the outer fringe , was in Spanish , service on the Missouri while it was still Spanish , his hunts extending far up that river . As an omnivorous Nimrod , buffaloes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was of that class who largely return to the hunting stage in social development . A capital shot , he easily believed that both his pleasure and his profit lay in the same line , and that he could best earn his bread as a hunter . Thus his ruling passion was a lifelong pilgrimage to happy hunting-grounds . He became as , migratory as Indians or game wheresoever furs could be discovered that were lightest in weight and heaviest in worth , for markets were distant and transport at best was by pack-horse . To Indians , who were dragons guarding the golden fleece he was after , he became an Indian . He out-Indianed them , and was too wily for their wiles . A chief had made him captive and purposed to burn him , yet , in fact , adopted him as his son . His strange career has been chronicled in a dozen books , which all have a Robinson Crusoe charm , and about his hairbreadth ' scapes clouds of legends or lies have . gathered , which a sketch like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed to clear away . The truth was romantic enough . This latest publication is first to show the exact date of Boone 's birth and many another suggestive fact . It shows us also for the first time Boone 's best portrait , and many significant autographs in facsimile , such as pages of field-notes of surveys and familiar letters , photographs of his last home , his monument at the capital of Kentucky , when he had been reburied there , with other realistic , not imaginary , scenes . It omits many irrelevant matters with which some preceding narratives had been padded , and defines Boone 's place among Western pioneers in the light of manuscripts which can be found only in the charge of its author . - - Having both hands full of biographic details , there was reason for the Wisconsin secretary to open his little finger .

Few books have so little need as has this finality to ask pardon for - being born .
