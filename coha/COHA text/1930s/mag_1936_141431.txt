U. S. teachers have had a full-fledged union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor since 1916 . Ten years , during which they lobbied earnestly for higher salaries , pensions and tenure laws , left American Federation of Teachers with only 3.000 members . Then Depression forced school boards to slash salaries , and by 1934 A. F. of T. had 302 locals . 35,000 aroused and militant members . Although it still represents less than 2% of the 2.000,000 U. S. schoolteachers . A. F. of T. assembled for its 20th annual convention in Philadelphia 's Hotel Sylvania last week to face all the problems that beset an important U. S. labor union . <P> Major concern of last year 's convention in Cleveland was William Green 's charge that A , F. of T. was riddled with Communism . Major concern of last week 's 500 delegates was William Green 's charge that Miner John L. Lewis ' Committee for Industrial Organization is trying to split A. F. of L. in two . <P> Some A. F. of T. locals enroll school clerks and typists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions . Lately Leftist members have urged the Federation to embrace industrial unionism completely by throwing its ranks open to charwomen , janitors , window-washers . Foreseeing trouble over that proposal , A. F. of T. 's conservative President Raymond Lowry resigned two months ago , left his increasingly pink union membership a free rein . <P> Last week President Adolph Hirschberg of Philadelphia 's Central Labor Union rose to plead : " Do n't take the attitude that officers of the A. F. of L. are enemies of the laboring man . Much damage has been caused . . . by this rift in the ranks . " Snapped Yale Professor Jerome Davis : " The A. F. of L. should never have suspended Lewis ' Committee for Industrial Organization without putting the question to the whole membership . . . . " ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) . Promptly passed by a unanimous vote was a resolution condemning the A. F. of L. 's treatment of Miner Lewis , endorsing the principle of industrial unionism . At that point the delegates abruptly reefed their sails , declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. F. of T. , whose members pay a maximum 40 a month dues , can not afford lobbyists in every State capital , must depend on the A. F. of L. 's regular lobby for legislative representation , must stay in the A. F. of L. 's good graces . Purred Secretary David Pierce : " By staying in the A. ' F. of L. we can make peace between the warring factions . " <P> Smoothest oration of the meeting came from stocky , aggressive Historian Louis Morton Hacker . Slickly observed he : " The Daughters of the American Revolution are the most dangerous enemies of the free schools in America . It is time these busybodies were told what their ancestors fought for . . . . Many of the members of the D. A. R. of today , had they been alive in 1776 , would have been Tories . . . . The American Revolution of 1776 was a popular uprising of the workers , and the labor unions of today are the true inheritors of this tradition . . . . " <P> Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. : " How ugly and uncivil ! I have never heard of Mr. Hacker. . . . "
