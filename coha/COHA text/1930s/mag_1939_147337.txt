When U. S. auto production started down hill last spring there was a steep and slippery grade ahead . With all four wheels locked , the industry slithered down from a top weekly production of 90,280 ( at the end of March ) and skidded to a dismal pace of 32,445 ( during the first week in May ) . Instead of crashing at the bottom , the motor industry stepped on the throttle , succeeded in topping an unexpected rise to 81,070 a week by the end of June . <P> Since then auto production has gone down a smooth grade to the late summer valley where the industry will change to its 1940 production models . Impatient for the next rise , the industry set the New York automobile show , which officially opens the 1940 model year , to begin October 15 , earlier than ever before . But even this did not satisfy the impatience of motormakers to get the fall selling season started . <P> Last week the first of the 1940 models had their previews . First to be shown were new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next day Hudson showed its new line , including a low-priced six , a new , more powerful eight . Nash and Willys-Overland followed . Chrysler will show its new cars next week . Ford , General Motors and Studebaker all expected to show their new lines well before the New York show . <P> Although only Packard had announced its prices at last week 's end , price cuts below 1938 's levels were likely to be made in other lines . Last spring , when the steel industry was bogged down in a soggy market ( TIME , May 8 ) , it pulled its production rate out of the bog by making concessions to hard-boiled motormakers ' buyers : an average of about $6 a ton below published price lists . The steel industry , more worried about production than prices at the time , also guaranteed its concessions to the end of this year . By piling up a big inventory of steel before this year 's end , U. S. motormakers can well afford to sell at lowered prices well into 1940.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
