Master showman of Relief is David Lasser , president of the Workers Alliance of America . Last week in Washington , Showman Lasser produced a tragedy in 50 acts , designed to show the Administration and Congress that instead of cutting WPA rolls the U. S. should furnish more jobs at better pay . <P> Present for the opening in smoky , smelly room No. 506 at WPA headquarters were Deputy Administrator Aubrey ( " Keep your friends in power " ) Williams , Assistant Administrator David K. Niles . Before them David Lasser interrogated 50 WPA workers brought on for the occasion from 26 States . One &; all declared that WPA wages are too low to keep body &; soul together , that they would leave Relief like a shot if they could get private jobs . They also attested that whether or not Reliefers are becoming a permanent class in the U. S. , they are certainly becoming a caste apart-shunned as poor credit risks by insurance companies , doctors , landlords . <P> More gravely than if he were picking Miss America , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1938 . As the No. 1 Missus of Relief , they named Mrs. Stanley Jorgensen of Provo , Utah . Provo merchants had chipped in $100 to pay her way to Washington so she could ask for more WPA money to go into storekeepers ' tills . Mrs. Jorgensen 's husband supports her and two children on $44 a month , of which he pays $15 for rent on a single room , $18 for groceries . A Mormon , Mrs. Jorgensen said her church 's famed work-for-relief system is a flop , declared an infant daughter died because of " the conditions I had to live under . " <P> Chosen Mr. WPA Worker was earnest , well-spoken Clyde Brown of Colfax , Iowa , who kept eight children on $44 a month until he was laid off a road project last fortnight . <P> David Lasser hoped his performance would influence Messrs . Williams and Harry Hopkins to influence Franklin Roosevelt to influence Congress to put up more Relief money . Harry Hopkins last week showed no desire to raise his rolls . Instead , he announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dependents fell 45,514 to 3,139,045 , having declined for five successive weeks from a peak of 3,264,907.
