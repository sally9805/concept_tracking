THE PROMISE A STORY BY JOHN STEINBECK N A mid-afternoon of spring the little I boy Jody walked martially along the brush-lined road toward his home ranch . Banging his knee against the golden lard bucket he used for school lunch , he contrived a good bass drum , while his tongue fluttered sharply against his teeth to fill in snare drums and occasional trumpets . Some time before , the other members of the squad that walked so smartly from the school had turned into the various little canyons and taken the wagon roads to their own home ranches . Now Jody marched seemingly alone , with high lifted knees and pounding feet ; but behind him there was a phantom army with great flags and swords , silent but deadly . The afternoon was green and gold with spring . Underneath the spread branches of the oaks the plants grew pale and tall , and on the hills the feed was smooth and thick . The sage bushes shone with new silver leaves and the oaks wore hoods of golden-green . Over the hills there hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloped madly , and then stopped , wondering ; lambs and even old sheep jumped in the air unexpectedly and landed on stiff legs , and went on eating ; young clumsy calves butted their heads together and drew back and butted again . As the gray and silent army marched past , led by Jody , the animals stopped their feeding and their play and watched it go by . Suddenly Jody stopped . The gray army halted , bewildered and nervous . Jody went down on his knees . The army stood in long uneasy ranks for a moment , and then , with a soft sigh of sorrow , rose up in a faint gray mist and disappeared . Jody had seen the thorny crown of a horny-toad moving under the dust of the road . His grimy hand went out and grasped the spiked halo and held firmly while the little beast struggled . Then Jody turned the horny-toad over , exposing its pale-gold stomach . With a gentle forefinger he stroked the throat and chest until the horny-toad relaxed , until its eyes closed and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deposited the first game inside . He moved on now , his knees bent slightly , his shoulders crouched ; his bare feet were wise and silent . In his right hand there was a long gray rifle . The brush along the road stirred restively under a new and unexpected population of gray tigers and gray bears . The hunting was very good , for by the time Jody reached the fork of the road where the mail box stood on a post he had captured two more horny-toads , four little grass lizards , a blue snake , sixteen yellow-winged grasshoppers , and a brown damp newt from under a rock . This assortment scrabbled unhappily against the tin of the lunch bucket . At the road fork the rifle evaporated and the tigers and bears melted from the hillsides . Even the moist and uncomfortable creatures in the lunch pail ceased to exist , for the little red metal flag was up on the mail box , signifying that some postal matter was inside . Jody set his pail on the ground and opened the letter box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Salinas Weekly Journal . He slammed the box , picked up his lunch pail , and trotted over the ridge and down into the cup of the ranch . Past the barn he ran , and the bunkhouse and the cypress tree . He banged through the front screen door of the ranch house calling , " Ma'am , ma'am , there 's a catalogue . " Mrs. Tiflin was in the kitchen spooning clabbered milk into a cotton bag . She put down her work and rinsed her hands under the tap . " Here in the kitchen , Jody . Here I am . " He ran in and clattered his lunch pail on the sink . " Here it is . Can I open the catalogue , ma'am ? " Mrs. Tiffin took up the spoon again and went back to her cottage cheese . " Do n't lose it , Jody . Your father will want to see it . " She scraped the last of the milk into the bag . " Oh , Jody , your father wants to see you before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly from the cheese bag . Jody closed the new catalogue in alarm . " Ma'am ? " " Why do n't you ever listen . I say your father wants to see you . " The boy laid the catalogue gently on the sink hoard . " Do you  --  is it something I did ? " Mrs. Tiffin laughed . " Always a bad conscience . What did you do ? " " Nothing , ma'am , " he said lamely . But he could n't remember , and besides it was impossible to know what action might later be construed as a crime . His mother hung the full bag on a nail where it could drip into the sink . " He just said he wanted to see you when you got home . He 's somewhere down by the barn . " Jody turned and went out the back door . Hearing his mother open the lunch pail and then gasp with rage , a memory stabbed him and he trottedaway toward the barn , conscientiously not hearing the angry voice that called him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , stood against the lower pasture fence . Each man rested one foot on the lowest bar and both elbows on the top bar . They were talking slowly and aimlessly . In the pasture half a dozen horses nibbled contentedly at the sweet grass . The mare , Nellie , stood backed up against the gate , rubbing her buttocks on the heavy post . Jody sidled uneasily near . He dragged one foot to give an impression of great innocence and nonchalance . When he arrived beside the men he put one foot on the lowest fence rail , rested his elbows on the second bar , and looked into the pasture too . The two men glanced sideways at him . " I wanted to see you , " Carl said in the stern tone he reserved for children and animals . " Yes , sir , " said Jody guiltily . " Billy , here , says you took good care of the pony before it died . " No punishment was in the air . Jody grew bolder . " Yes , sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient hand with horses . " Jody felt a sudden warm friendliness for the ranch hand . Billy put in , " He trained that pony as good as anybody I ever seen . " Then Carl Tiflin came gradually to the point . " If you could have another horse would you work for it ? " Jody shivered . " Yes , sir . " " Well , look here then . Billy says the best way for you to be a good hand with horses is to raise a colt . " " It 's the only good way , " Billy interrupted . " Now , look here , Jody , " continued Carl . " Jess Taylor , up to the ridge ranch , has a fair stallion , but it 'll cost five dollars . I 'll put up the money , but you 'll have to work it out all summer . Will you do that ? " Jody felt that his insides were shriveling . " Yes , sir , " he said softly . " And no complaining ? And no forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " " Well , all right then . To-morrow morning you take Nellie up to the ridge ranch and get her bred . You 'll have to take care of her too till she throws the colt . " " Yes , sir . " " You better get to the chickens and the wood now . " Jody slid away . In passing behind Billy Buck he very nearly put out his hand to touch the blue-jeaned legs . His shoulders swayed a little with maturity and importance . He went to his work with unprecedented seriousness . This night he did not dump the can of grain to the chickens so that they had to leap over one another and struggle to get it . No , he spread the wheat so far and so carefully that the hens could n't find some of it at all . And in the house , after listening to his mother 's despair over boys who filled their lunch pails with slimy , suffocated reptiles and bugs , he promised never to do it again . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . He was far too grown up ever to put horny-toads in his lunch pail any more . He carried in so much wood and built such a high structure with it that his mother walked in fear of an avalanche of oak . When he was done , when he had gathered eggs that had remained hidden for weeks , Jody walked down again past the cypress tree , and past the bunk-house toward the pasture . A fat warty toad that looked out at him from under the watering trough had no emotional effect on him at all . Carl Tiflin and Billy Buck were not in sight , but from a metallic ringing on the other side of the barn , Jody knew that Billy Buck was just starting to milk a cow . The other horses were eating toward the upper end of the pasture , but Nellie continued to rub herself nervously against the post . Jody walked slowly near , saying , " So , girl , so-o , Nellie . " The mare 's ears went back naughtily and herlips drew away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were glazed and mad . Jody climbed to the top of the fence and hung his feet over and looked paternally down on the mare . The evening hovered while he sat there . Bats and night hawks flicked about . Billy Buck , walking toward the house carrying a full milk bucket , saw Jody and stopped . " It 's a long time to wait , " lie said gently . " You 'll get awful tired waiting . " " No I wo n't , Billy . How long will it be ? " " Nearly a year . " " Well , I wo n't get tired . " The triangle at the house rang stridently . Jody climbed down from the fence and walked to supper beside Billy Buck . He even put out his hand and took hold of the milk-bucket bail to help carry it . The next morning after breakfast Carl Tiffin folded a five-dollar bill in a piece of newspaper and pinned the package in the bib pocket of Jody 's overalls . Billy Buck haltered the Nellie mare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he warned . " Hold her up short here so she ca n't bite you . She 's crazy as a coot . " Jody took hold of the halter leather itself and started up the hill toward the ridge ranch with Nellie skittering and jerking behind him . In the pasturage along the road the wild oat heads were just clearing their scabbards . The warm morning sun shone on Jody 's back so sweetly that he was forced to take a serious , stiff-legged hop now and then in spite of his maturity . On the fences the shiny blackbirds with red epaulets clicked their dry call . The meadowlarks sang like water , and the wild doves , concealed among the bursting leaves of the oaks , made a sound of restrained grieving . In the fields the rabbits sat sunning themselves with only their forked ears showing above the grass heads . After an hour of steady uphill walking Jody turned into a narrow road that led up a steeper hill to the ridge ranch . He could see the red roof of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear a dog barking unemotionally near the house . Suddenly Nellie jerked back and nearly freed herself . From the direction of the barn Jody heard a shrill whistling scream and a splintering of wood , and then a man 's voice shouting . Nellie reared and whinnied . When Jody held to the halter rope she ran at him with bared teeth . He dropped his hold and scuttled out of the way into the brush . The high scream came from the oaks again , and Nellie answered it . With hoofs battering the ground , the stallion appeared and charged down the hill training a broken halter rope . His eyes glittered feverishly . His stiff erected nostrils were as red as flame . His black sleek hide shone in the sunlight . The stallion came on so fast that he could n't stop when he reached the mare . Nellie 's ears went back ; she whirled and kicked at him as he went by . The stallion spun round and reared . He struck the mare with his front hoof , and while she staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew a thread of blood . Instantly Nellie 's mood changed . She became coquettishly feminine . She nibbled his arched neck with her lips . She edged round and rubbed her shoulder against his shoulder . Jody stood half-hidden in the brush and watched . He heard the step of a horse behind him , but before he could turn , a hand caught him by the overall straps and lifted him off the ground . Jess Taylor sat the boy behind him on the horse . " You might have got killed , " he said . " Sundog 's a mean devil sometimes . He busted his rope and went right through a gate . " Jody sat quietly , but in a moment he cried , " He 'll hurt her , he 'll kill her . Get him away ! " Jess chuckled . " She 'll be all right . Maybe you 'd better climb off and go up to the house for a little . You could get maybe a piece of pie up there . " But Jody shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mine . I 'm going to raise it up . " Jess nodded . " Yes , that 's a good thing . Carl has good sense sometimes . " In a little while the danger was over . Jess lifted Jody down and then caught the stallion by its broken halter rope . And he rode ahead , while Jody followed , leading Nellie . It was only after he had unpinned and handed over the five dollars and after he had eaten two pieces of pie that Jody started for home again . And Nellie followed docilely after him . She was so quiet that Jody climbed on a stump and rode her most of the way home . The five dollars his father had advanced reduced Jody to peonage for the whole late spring and summer . When the hay was cut he drove a rake . He led the horse that pulled on the Jackson-fork tackle , and when the baler came he drove the circling horse that put pressure on the hales . In addition , Carl Tiffin taught him to milk and put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was added night and morning . The bay mare Nellie quickly grew complacent . As she walked about the yellowing hillsides or worked at easy tasks her lips were curled in a perpetual fatuous smile . She moved slowly , with the calm importance of an empress . When she was put to a team she pulled steadily and unemotionally . Jody went to see her every day . He studied her with critical eyes and saw no change whatever . One afternoon Billy Buck leaned the many-tined manure fork against the barn wall . He loosened his belt and tucked in his shirt-tail and tightened the belt again . He picked one of the little straws from his hatband and put it in the corner of his mouth . Jody , who was helping Doubletree Mutt , the big serious dog , to dig out a gopher , straightened up as the ranch hand sauntered out of the barn . " Let 's go up and have a look at Nellie , " Billy suggested . Instantly Jody fell into step with him . Doubletree Mutt watched them over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sharp yelps to indicate that the gopher was practically caught . When he looked over his shoulder again , and saw that neither Jody nor Billy was interested , he climbed reluctantly out of the hole and followed them up the hill . The wild oats were ripening . Every head bent sharply under its load of grain , and the grass was dry enough so that it made a swishing sound as Jody and Billy stepped through it . Half-way up the hill they could see Nellie and the iron-gray gelding Pete nibbling the heads from the wild oats . When they approached , Nellie looked at them and backed her ears and bobbed her head up and down rebelliously . Billy walked over to her , put his hand under her mane , and patted her neck , until her ears came forward again and she nibbled delicately at his shirt . Jody asked , " Do you think she 's really going to have a colt ? " Billy rolled the lids back from the mare 's eyes with his thumb and forefinger . He felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't be surprised , " he said . " Well , she is n't changed at all . It 's three months gone . " Billy rubbed the mare 's flat forehead with his knuckle while she grunted with pleasure . " I told you you 'd get tired waiting . It 'll be five months more before you can even see a sign , and it 'll be at least eight months before she throws the colt , about next January . " Jody sighed deeply . " It 's a long time , is n't it ? " " And then it 'll be about two years more before you can ride . " Jody cried out in despair , " I 'll be grown up . " " Yep , you 'll be an old man , " said Billy . " What color do you think the colt 'll be ? " " Why , you ca n't ever tell . The stud is black and the dam is bay . Colt might be black or bay or gray or dappled . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white colt . " " Well , I hope it 's black and a stallion , " " If it 's a stallion well have to geld it . Your father would n't let you have a stallion . " " Maybe he would , " Jody said . " I could train him not to be mean . " Billy pursed his lips , and the little straw that had been in the corner of his mouth rolled down to the center . " You ca n't ever trust a stallion , " he said critically . " They 're mostly always fighting and making trouble . Sometimes when they 're feeling funny they wo n't work . They make the mares uneasy and kick hell out of the geldings . Your father would n't let you keep a stallion . " Nellie sauntered away , nibbling the drying grass . Jody skinned the grain from a grass stem and threw the handful into the air , so that each pointed , feathered seed sailed out like a dart . " Tell me how it 'll be , Billy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just about . Mares are a little more sensitive . Sometimes you have to be there to help the mare . And sometimes , if it 's wrong , you have to ? " he paused . " Have to what , Billy ? " " Have to tear the colt apart to get it out , or the mare 'll die . " " But it wo n't be that way this time , will it , Billy ? " " Oh , no . Nellie 's thrown good colts . " " Can I be there , Billy ? Will you be certain to call me ? It 's my colt . " " Sure , I 'll call you . Of course I will . " " Tell me how it 'll be . " " Why , you 've seen the cows calving . It 's almost the same . The mare starts groaning and stretching , and then , if it 's a good right birth , the head and forefeet come out and the front hoofs kick a hole just the way the calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good to be there , ' cause if its feet are n't right maybe he ca n't break the sack , and then he might smother . " Jody whipped his leg with a bunch of grass . " We 'll have to be there then , wo n't we ? " " Oh , we 'll be there all right . " They turned and walked slowly down the hill toward the barn . Jody was tor-tured with a thing he had to say , although he did n't want to . " Billy , " he began miserably , " Billy , you wo n't let anything happen to the colt , will you ? " And Billy knew he was thinking of the red pony Gabilan , and of how it died of strangles . Billy knew he had been infallible before that , and now he was capable of failure . This knowledge made Billy much less sure of himself than he had been . " I ca n't tell , " he said roughly . " All sorts of things might happen , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " He felt badly about his lost prestige , and so he said meanly , " I 'll do everything I know , but I wo n't promise anything . Nellie 's a good mare . She 's thrown good colts before . She ought to this time . " And he walked away from Jody and went into the saddle-room beside the barn , for his feelings were hurt . Jody traveled often to the brush-line behind the house . A rusty iron pipe ran a thin stream of spring water into an old green tub . Where the water spilled over and sank into the ground there was a patch of perpetually green grass . Even when the hills were brown and baked in the summer that little patch was green . The water whined softly into the trough all the year round . This place had grown to be a centcrpoint for Jody . When he had been punished the cool green grass and the singing water soothed him . When he had been mean the biting acid of meanness left him at the brush line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puling stream the barriers set up in his mind by the stern day went down to ruin . On the other hand , the black cypress tree by the bunk-house was as repulsive as the water tub was dear ; for to this tree all the pigs came , sooner or later , to be slaughtered . Pig killing was fascinating , with the screaming and the blood ; but it made Jody 's heart beat so fast that it hurt him . After the pigs were scalded in the big iron tripod kettle and their skins were scraped and white , Jody had to go to the water tub to sit in the grassuntil his heart grew quiet . The water tub and the black cypress were opposites and enemies . When Billy left him and walked angrily away , Jody turned up toward the house . He thought of Nellie as he walked and of the little colt . Then suddenly he saw that he was under the black cypress , under the very singletree where the pigs were hung . He brushed his dry-grass hair off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky thing to be thinking of his colt in the very slaughter place , especially after what Billy had said . To counteract any evil result of that bad conjunction he walked quickly past the ranch house , through the chicken yard , through the vegetable patch , until he came at last to the brush-line . He sat down in the green grass . The trilling water sounded in his ears . He looked over the farm buildings and across at the round hills , rich and yellow with grain . He could see Nellie feeding on the slope . As usual the water place eliminated time and distance . Jody saw a black long-legged colt , butting against Nellie 's flanks , demanding milk . And then he saw himself breaking a large colt to halter . All in a few moments the colt grew to be a magnificent animal , deep of chest , with a neck as high and arched as a sea-horse 's neck , with a tail that tongued and rippled Iike black flame . This horse was terrible to everyone but Jody . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smilingly agreed . But no sooner were they mounted than the black demon pitched them off . Why , that was his name , Black Demon ! For a moment the trilling water and the grass and the sunshine came back , and then . . . Sometimes in the night the ranch people , safe in their beds , heard a roar of hoofs go by . They said , " It 's Jody , on Demon . He 's helping out the sheriff again . " And then . The golden dust filled the air in the arena at the Salinas Rodeo . The announcer carted the roping contests . When Jody rode the black horse to the starting chute the other contestants shrugged their shoulders and gave up first place ; for it was well known that Jody and Demon could rope and throw and tie a steer a great deal quicker than any roping team of two men could . Jody was not a boy any more , and Demon was not a horse . The two together were one glorious individual . And then . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help catch a bandit in Washing . ton . Jody settled himself comfortably in the grass . The little stream of water whined into the mossy tub . The year passed slowly on . Time after time Jody gave up his colt for lost . No change had taken place in Nellie . Carl Tiffin still drove her to a light cart , and she pulled on a hay rake and worked the Jackson-fork tackle when the hay was being put into the barn . The summer passed and the warm bright autumn . And then the frantic morning winds began to twist along the ground and a chill came into the air and the poison oak turned red . One morning in September when he had finished his breakfast Jody 's mother called him into the kitchen . She was pouring boiling water into a bucket full of dry middlings and stirring the materials to a steaming paste . " Yes , ma'am ? " Jody asked . " Watch how I do it . You 'll have to do it after this every morning . " " Well what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mash for Nellie . It 'll keep her in good shape . " Jody rubbed his forehead with a knuckle . " Is she all right ? " he asked timidly . Mrs. Tiflin put down the kettle and stirred the mash with a wooden paddle . " Of course she 's all right , only you 've got to take better care of her from now on . Here , take this breakfast out to her l " Jody seized the bucket and ran , down past the bunk-house , past the barn , with the heavy bucket banging against his knees . He found Nellie playing with the water in the trough , pushing wavesand tossing her head so that the water slopped out on the ground . Jody climbed the fence and set the bucket of steaming mash beside her . Then he stepped back to look at her . And she was changed . Her stomach was swollen . When she moved , her feet touched the ground gently . She buried her nose in the bucket and gobbled the hot breakfast . And when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nose a little , she stepped quietly over to Judy and rubbed her check against him . Billy Buck came out of the saddle-room and walked over . " Starts fast when it starts , does n't it ? " " Did it come all at once ? " " Oh , no , you just stopped looking for a while . " He pulled her head round toward Jody . " She 's gain ' to be nice too . See how nice her eyes arel Some mares get mean , but when they turn nice they just love everything . " Nellie slipped her head under Billy 's arm and rubbed her neck up and down between his arm and his side . " You better treat her awful nice now , " Billy said . " How long will it be ? " Jody demanded breathlessly . The man counted in whispers on his fingers . " About three months , " he said aloud . " You ca n't tell exactly . Sometimes it 's eleven months to the day , but it might be two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jody looked hard at the ground . " Billy , " he began nervously , " Billy , you 'll call me when it 's getting born , wo n't you ? You 'll let me be there , wo n't you ? " Billy bit the tip of Nellie 's ear with his front teeth . " Carl says he wants you to start right at the start . That 's the only way to learn . Nobody can tell you anything . Like my old man did with me about the saddle blanket . He was a government packer when I was your size , and I helped him some . One day I left a wrinkle in my saddle blanket and made a saddle-sore . My old man did n't give me hell at all . But the next morning he saddled me up with a forty-pound stock saddle . I had to lead my horse and carry that saddle over a whole damn mountain in the sun . It darn near killed me , but I never left no wrinkles in a blanket again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a blanket but I felt that saddle on my back . " Jody reached up a hand and took hold of Nellie 's mane . " You 'll tell me what to do about everything , wo n't you ? I guess you know everything about horses , do n't you ? " Billy laughed . " Why I 'm half horse myself , you see , " he said . " My ma died when I was born , and being my old man was a government packer in the mountains , and no cows around most of the time , why he just gave me mostly mare 's milk . " He continued seriously , " And horses know that . Do n't you know it , Nellie ? " The mare turned her head and looked full into his eyes for a moment , and this is a thing horses practically never do . Billy was proud and sure of himself now . He boasted a little . " I 'll see you get a good colt . I 'll start you right . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse in the county . " That made Jody feel warm and proud too , so proud that when he went back to the house he bowed his legs and swayed his shoulders as horsemen do . And he whispered , " Whoa , you Black Demon , you ! Steady down there and keep your feet on the ground . " The winter fell sharply . A few preliminary gusty showers , and then a strong steady rain . The hills lost their straw color and blackened under the water , and the winter streams scrambled noisily down the canyons . The mushrooms and puff-balls popped up and the new grass started before Christmas . But this year Christmas was not the central day to Jody . Some undetermined time in January had become the axis day around which the months swung . When the rains fell be put Nellie in a box stall and fed her warm food every morning and curried her and brushed her . The mate was swelling so greatly that Jody became alarmed . " She 'll pop wide open , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's swollen abdomen . " Feel here , " he said quietly . " You can feel it move . I guess it would surprise you if there was twin colts . " " You do n't think so ? " Jody cried . " You do n't think it will be twins , do you , Billy ? " " No , I do n't , but it does happen sometimes . " During the first two weeks of January it rained steadily . Jody spent most of his time when he was n't in school in the box stall with Nellie . Twenty times a day he put his hand on her stomach to feel the colt move . Nellie became more and more gentle and friendly to him . She rubbed her nose on him . She whinnied softly when he walked into the barn . Carl Tiflin came to the barn with Jody one day . He looked admiringly at the groomed bay coat , and he felt the firm flesh over ribs and shoulders . " You 've done a good job , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to give . Jody was tight with pride for hours afterward . The fifteenth of January came , and the colt was not born . And the twentieth came ; a lump of fear began to form in Jody 's stomach . " Is it all right ? " he demanded of Billy . " Oh , sure . " And again , " Are you sure it 's going to be all right ? " Billy stroked the mare 's neck . She swayed her head uneasily . " I told you it was n't always the same time , Jody . You just have to wait . " When the end of the month arrived with no birth , Jody grew frantic . Nellie was so big that her breath came heavily , and her ears were close together and straight up , as though her head ached . Jody 's sleep grew restless , and his dreams confused . On the night of the second of February he awakened crying . His mother called in to him , " Jody , you 're dreaming . Wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with terror and desolation . He lay quietly a few moments , waiting for his mother to go back to sleep , and then he slipped his clothes on , and crept out in his bare feet . The night was black and thick . A little misting rain fell . The cypress tree and the bunk-house loomed and then dropped back into the mist . The barn door screeched as he opened it , a thing it never did in the daytime . Jody went to the rack and found a lantern and a tin box of matches . He lighted the wick and walked down the long straw-covered aisle to Nellie 's stall . Shc was standing up . Her whole body weaved from side to side . Jody called to her , " So , Nellie , so-o , Nellie , " but she did not stop her swaying nor look round . When he stepped into the stall and touched her on the shoulder she shivered under his hand . Then Billy Buck 's voice came from the hay loft right above the stall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and turned miserable eyes up toward the nest where Billy was lying in the hay . " Is she all right , do you think ? " " Why sure . I think so . " " You wo n't let anything happen , Billy , you 're sure you wo n't ? " Billy growled down at him , " I told you I 'd call you , and I will . Now you get back to bed and stop worrying that mare . She 's got enough to do without you worrying her . " Jody cringed , for he had never heard Billy speak in such a tone . " I only thought I 'd come and see , " he said . " I woke up . " Billy softened a little then . " Well , ou get to bed . I do n't want you bothering her . I told you I 'd get you a good colt . Get along now . " Jody walked slowly out of the barn . He blew out the lantern and set it in the rack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck him and enfolded him . He wished he believed everything Billy said as he had before the pony died . It was a moment before his eyes , blinded by the feeble lantern-flame , could make any form of the darkness . The damp ground chilled his bare feet . At the cypress tree the roosting turkeys chattered a little in alarm , and the two good dogs responded to their duty and came charging out , barking to frighten away the coyotes they thought were prowling under the tree . As he crept through the kitchen Jody stumbled over a chair . Carl called from his bedroom , " Who 's there ? What 's the matter there ? " And Mrs. Tiffin said sleepily , " What 's the matter , Carl ? " The next second Carl came out of the bedroom carrying a candle , and found Jody before he could get into bed . " What are you doing out ? " Jody turned shyly away . " I was down to see the mare . " For a moment anger at being awakened fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , finally , " there 's not a man in this country that knows more about colts than Billy . You leave it to him . " Words burst out of Jody 's mouth . " But the pony died ? " " Do n't you go blaming that on him , " Carl said sternly . " If Billy ca n't save a horse it ca n't be saved . " Mrs. Tiffin called , " Make him clean his feet and go to bed , Carl . He 'll be sleepy all day to-morrow . " It seemed to Jody that he had just closed his eyes to try to go to sleep when he was shaken violently by the shoulder . Billy Buck stood beside him , holding a lantern in his hand . " Get up , " he said . " Hurry up . " He turned and walked quickly out of the room . Mrs. Tiffin called , " What 's the matter ? Is that you , Billy ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Is Nellie ready ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll get up and heat some water in case you need it . " Jody jumped into his clothes so quickly that he was out the back door before Billy 's swinging lantern was half-way to the barn . There was a rim of dawn on the mountain-tops , but no light had penetrated into the cup of the ranch yet . Jody ran frantically after the lantern and caught up to Billy just as he reached the barn . Billy hung the lantern to a nail on the stall-side and took off his blue denim coat . Jody saw that he wore only a sleeveless shirt under it . Nellie was standing rigid and stiff . While they watched she crouched . Her whole body was wrung with a spasm . The spasm passed . But in a few moments it started over again , and passed . Billy muttered nervously , " There 's something wrong . " His bare hand disappeared . " Oh , Jesus , " he said . " It 's wrong . " The spasm came again , and this time Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulder . He heaved strongly , his forehead beaded with perspiration . Nellie cried with pain . Billy was muttering , " It 's wrong . I ca n't turn it . It 's way wrong . It 's turned all around wrong . " He glared wildly toward Jody . And then his fingers made a careful diagnosis . His cheeks were growing tight and gray . He looked for a long questioning minute at Jody standing back of the stall . Then Billy stepped to the rack under the manure window and picked up a horseshoe hammer with his wet right hand . " Go outside , Jody , " he said . The boy stared dully at him . " Go outside , I tell you . It 'll be too late . " Jody did n't move . Then Billy walked quickly to Nellie 's head . He cried , " Turn your face away , damn you , turn your face . " This time Jody obeyed . His head turned sideways . He heard Billy whispering hoarsely in the stall . And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jody looked back in time to see the hammer rise and fall again on the flat forehead . Then Nellie fell heavily to her side and quivered for a moment . Billy jumped to her , his big pocket knife in his hand . . . For a moment after he had finished , he held the little black colt in his arms and looked at it . And then he walked slowly over and laid it in the straw at Jody 's feet . Billy 's body shivered and his teeth chattered . His voice was gone ; he spoke in a throaty whisper . " There 's your colt . I promised . And there it is . I had to do it  --  had to . " He stopped and looked over his shoulder into the box stall . " Go get hot water and a sponge , " he whispered . " Wash him and dry him the way his mother would . You 'll have to feed him by hand . But there 's your colt , the way I promised . " Jody stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its chin and tried to raise its head . Its blank eyes were navy-blue . " God damn you , " Billy shouted , " will you go now for the water ? Wild you go ? " Then Jody turned and trotted out of the barn into the dawn . He ached from his throat to his stomach . His legs were stiff and heavy . He tried to be glad because of the colt , but the haunted , tired eyes of Billy Buck hung in the air ahead of him .
