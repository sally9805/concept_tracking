There are only half as many Protestants as Catholics in Bavaria , but those there are as stubborn as Scots Calvinists . Of all the 28 onetime independent Lutheran state churches of Germany , only two up to last week still held out against the whip-snapping of Adolf Hitler 's bullet-headed Realm Bishop Ludwig Mller ( TIME , Oct 1 et ante ) . This bold pair were the provincial churches of Bavaria and Wrttemberg . Though 95% of Wrttem-berg 's clergy had voted to support their anti-Nazi Bishop Theophil Wurm , the Nazi whip cracked early last week and Bishop Wurm , suspended last month , was permanently removed from office , placed under arrest in his home . That left only Bavaria and its Bishop Hans Meisser outside the fold . <P> Loyally Bishop Meisser 's flock stuck by him . Fortnight ago he went out to a mountain village to preach . Eight hundred hulking woodsmen filled the pockets of their leather breeches with stones and dared Nazi Storm Troopers to interfere . Then last week the whisper was passed about Munich : " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to say . " <P> The whisper reached Nazi ears . Because this little rebellion of southern Protestantism against Nazi regimentation might be the germ to infect the whole body of the Third Reich , Realmleader Hitler himself went quietly to Munich to watch developments . <P> Noon of the day of the scheduled sermon secret police and blackcoated S. S. Troopers suddenly piled into the residence of Bishop Meisser . He was placed under arrest , forbidden to leave his house , told that he had been removed as head of his diocese . Remembering lessons learned in last June 's " blood purge , " the S. S. Troopers were careful to offer no threats to the Bishop 's person , to give him complete liberty within the building . Bishop Hans Meisser puttered quietly up &; downstairs all afternoon . <P> Evening came and the hour for the momentous sermon . Huge crowds jammed every seat in St. Matthew 's Church and packed the streets outside . Suddenly guards discovered that the good Bishop was not in his study , nor in his bedroom , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact he was nowhere in his house . Slyly he had skipped through a back door and escaped the police cordon in a car bearing an Augsburg license plate . Squads of mounted police clattered up to St. Matthew 's Church , but the Bishop was already inside and in his pulpit . Few paid attention to what he actually said . The purport of the sermon was clear enough , a protest against government interference in religion . One phrase stuck . " Our church has been violated ! " cried Bishop Hans Meisser . <P> A wildly enthusiastic crowd hustled the brave Bishop into his automobile , swept the police and S. S. troops aside , trotted beside the car all the way to his house shouting " Heil Meisser ! Pfui Mller ! " Another crowd stayed by the church , solemnly chanting Martin Luther 's great " Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott ! " <P> From his secret headquarters in the centre of the city Adolf Hitler gave strict orders that nothing should be done that might cause violence . The hymn singing , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabres swinging they charged . Pates were split .
