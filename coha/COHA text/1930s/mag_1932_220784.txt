Noticeable in the comparatively small crowds that attend the A. A. U. boxing championships each year are certain shabby individuals who stand in the corridors of Madison Square Garden , munching on unlighted cigars , spitting thoughtfully . They are professional fight managers on the lookout for good material . They do not bother to look at most of the fights because they know before the tournament starts which fighters are worth watching . Last week the members of this group spent most of their time in or near the dressing room of Eddie Flynn , a Loyola University dentistry student who was defending his championship in the 147-lb. class . Flynn , a better boxer than most professionals , won his semi-final bout and then lay down to nap on a rubbing table while his trainer explained that Flynn was 22 years old and married , that he earned $60 a month as a janitor , that he had no intention of becoming a professional . Presently Flynn swung himself off the rubbing bench , walked out to the ring and retained his title in a three-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bozzano . <P> Amateur heavyweights , because they are usually youths who have grown too rapidly , are not likely to be as good as the men in the smaller classes . Among the 146 boxers in last week 's tournament , there were two exceptions to this rule : John Kilcullen , a 195-lb . Yale sophomore whom experts had picked to win not only the A. A. U. championship but the world 's championship at Los Angeles next summer ; and Fred Feary , a 20-year-old high-school boy of Stockton , Calif. , who bounces about the ring as lightly as though his 215-lb. body were inflated with air . Feary and Kilcullen fought each other in the third round of the tournament . In the second round Kilcullen knocked Feary down once and Feary knocked Kilcullen down twice . In the third round , Feary scored his 33rd knockout in 38 recorded fights . In the semifinal , he scored the 34th when the handler of his opponent . Jack Holland of New Orleans , took off his shirt and threw it into the ring . His opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet till the third round when Feary knocked him down for eight seconds and won the decision . <P> Other title-winners : <P> 112 lb .
