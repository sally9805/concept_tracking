txt Dr. William F. Doyle 's fight to defeat the government 's efforts to ascertain from him the names of persons with whom he split his $2,000 , - 000 or more in fees received for work done before the Board cf Standards and Appeals will be carried to the United States Supreme Court if necessary . This was revealed yesterday by Samuel Falk , one of Dr. Doyle 's attorneys , who told Federal Judge John M. Woolsey in open court that the case would be taken to the court of last resort on a writ of certiorari if the United States Circuit Court of Appeals should uphold Judge Woolsey 's order holding Dr. Doyle in contempt for his refusal to answer questions before the grand jury . The case was taken yesterday before Federal Judge Martin T. Manton of the Circuit Court of Appeals after Dr. Doyle 's bail had been fixed at $1,000 by Judge Woolsey in the absence of United States Attorney Tuttle . Judge Mentor notified Mr. Tuttle later that the Appellate Court would hear the appeal as soon as possible . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that argument will be heard either today or tomorrow . Mr. Tuttle told Judge Manton he would be prepared . to argue the case today " without briefs and without records . " Protest by Tuttle . Dr. Doyle , who had been adjudged in contempt by Judge Woolsey on Monday and ordered to present himself in court this morning , did so , accompanied by Mr. Falk and Alfred J. Talley , also his attorney . Neither Mr. Tuttle nor any one of his assistants was in Judge Woolsey 's court room when the matter came up . Judge Woolsey granted Dr. Doyle 's counsel 's motion for permis-. sion to appeal and fixed his bail at $1,000 . Dr. Doyle and his attorneys had started down ' one of the corridors in the Federal Building en route to a United States Commissioner 's office to arrange for the bail bond when they met Mr. Tuttle coming from another court room where he had been engaged in another case . When informed of what had occurred Mr. Tuttle told the attorneys for Dr. Doyle he would be compelled to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Judge Woolsey 's court room , where he declared that if the move by Dr. Doyle 's attorneys should prove successful and the argument on appeal be heard in the Fall , the effect would be the same as if Judge Woolsey had failed to order Dr. Doyle to answer questions about his split fees . Judge Woolsey then reconsidered his action and the matter of bail was left to Judge Manton , presiding judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals . Judge Manton paroled Dr. Doyle in Mr. Falk 's custody pending hearing on appeal and intimated he would arrange to have the argument heard as soon as possible . It was pointed out later that , should the Appellate Court uphold the contempt order and the , full bench of the Supreme Court have to hear the case , it could not be finally decided before next October .

It was endorsed by Dr. Doyle and cashed by him at the Flatbush Avenue branch of the Corn Exchange Bank the day after It had been issued . Mr. Tuttle disclosed , incidentally , that this was the bank in which Dr. Doyle had deposited $1,268,000 in the last six years . Mr. Tuttle 's investigation revealed , he said , that complaints of Fire Department violations had been filed against this store of Saks &; Co. as well as against their store at Thirtyfourth Street and Sixth Avenue . These violations , he explained , consisted of " alteration rooms " in each building in which dresses were altered . The company had been told that these rooms made " factories " of the buildings , that additional fire escapes would have to be installed and the interiors changed . Then , Mr. Tuttle said , Dr. Doyle was retained by Saks &; Co. with the result that the Board of Standards and Appeals decided no additional fire escapes would be necessary and that small partitions ? around the workers in the alterations rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possession was made out to Dr. Doyle by the Sobel Holding Corporation , Fifth Avenue and 110th Street , and was dated June 10 , 1927 .

The cashiers of the Flatbush Avenue branch and the main office of the Corn Exchange Bank have been notified to appear at Mr. Tuttle 's office for questioning . Crain Looks Into Garage . District Attorney Crain , who is also conducting a grand jury investigation into the Board of Standards and Appeals , directed this inquiry yesterday into matters connected with the erection of a garage at 152-184 Eighty-seventh Street , a permit for which was granted by the board in spite of determined opposition by property owners in that neighborhood . The Stanhope Estates , former owners of the property , according to Mr. Crain , had entered into negotiations with Alexander Geiger and two other men to sell the plot to them and also to obtain , in advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained Edward P. Doyle , who has previously been referred to as Dr. Doyle 's associate in his offices at 11 John Street , although the two Doyles are said to be unrelated to each other . Edward Doyle , Mr. Crain said , had been paid a $250 retainer and soon thereafter Dr. Doyle had been " substituted " for him . The Stanhope Estates then agreed to pay Dr. Doyle $15,000 for obtaining the desired permit , Mr. Crain asserted . The permit , applied for Sept. 7 , 1928 , was granted later by the Board of Standards and Appeals , Mr. Crain continued , and Dr. Doyle , who also had been paid a retainer of $250 at the outset , was then paid $6,000 more in the form of a check made out to Edward Doyle , but cashed by Dr. Doyle . The fee of $15,000 originally agreed upon , according to Mr. Crain , was later reduced by Dr. Doyle to $11,250 . The garage , it is alleged , was erected in violation of the zoning laws , which do not permit garages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Mr. Tuttle said he had already covered that very largely and was continuing his inquiries about it . Officers of the Stanhope Estates , he added , had been before the Federal grand jury last week . Witnesses before the county grand jury yesterday included Alexander C .. ; iger , Maxwell Crames , attorney for Stanhope Estates ; Congreve Jackson of the Stanhope Estates , and Joseph Golding , an officer of the corporation which owns the building at 25 East Eighty-sixth Street , wherein William E. Walsh , chairman of the Board of Standards and Appeals , is said to occupy a $4,000 apartment at a $1,500 rental unsecured by lease . Several city employes also were questioned . Appeals Board in Session . The Board of Standards and Appeals , although under investigation by two grand juries , held another meeting yesterday at which Chairman Walsh presided . Two cases in which Dr. Doyle was to have appeared for applicants were laid over , one until July 15 and the other until July 22 . In reference to each case Chairman Walsh read a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the fact that he was " engaged in Federal Court proceedings . " The first item was a building zone application by Joseph Goldberg , owner , to permit in a busines district the erection and maintenance of a gasoline station at the southwest corner of Hylan Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue , Grant City , S. I. The other matter was a reopening in which Dr. Doyle was to have appeared for Shaw &; Sanford asking that they be not restricted to one tenant in their building at 1,985-93 Jerome Avenue , the Bronx . Chairman Walsh made a reference to public criticism during consideration of a petition for variation on the part of the Fox Film Corporation affecting their building at 830-50 Tenth Avenue , 441-61 West Fifty-fifth Street and 450-56 West Fifty-sixth Street . Papers presented by the petitioners described the building as " fireproof . " In the argument it developed that the building had a wooden roof . " How do you explain this ? " the chairman asked . " We are being severely criticized as public officials by the press already . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing like this go through without question . We are accused of being too harsh . But in this case your papers say this building is fireproof and yet you admit that it has a frame roof . In my opinion you would have to be a magician to reconcile those declarations . " On motion of counsel for the petitioner the papers were corrected so that the building was described as non-fireproof ;
