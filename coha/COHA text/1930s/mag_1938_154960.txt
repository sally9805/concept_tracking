Franklin Roosevelt last week conducted a school for ambassadors . Home for a seminar on U. S. foreign policy were Hugh Wilson ( Berlin ) , William Phillips ( Rome ) and William Bullitt ( Paris ) . On the way from London was Joe Kennedy ( nominally on his way to Florida to spend Christmas with his son Jack ) , and called home from China was Nelson Johnson , who by traveling his fastest can reach Washington next month . <P> Messrs . Wilson and Phillips proceeded to teach the teacher . Both were alarmed at the sharpness with which Franklin Roosevelt-and U. S. public opinion-has slapped at Dictators Hitler and Mussolini , and by implication has frowned upon Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's policy of " appeasing " Fascism . Instead of being told that they should revamp their views to fit Washington 's , they persuaded the President to leave foreign policy out of his Chapel Hill speech ( TIME , Dec. 12 ) , and further to soften his democratic dander last week . <P> It was no secret around Washington , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly expressing views like those that Messrs . Wilson and Phillips held in private . For Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull were irritated by Joe Kennedy 's speech at the annual Trafalgar Day dinner of Britain 's Navy League , praising Neville Chamberlain for the Munich deal . To Secretarv Hull 's mind that excursion into British politics was as bad as if the British Ambassador to the U. S. had intervened in a scrap between Republicans and Democrats . <P> The problems of the President 's seminar on U. S. foreign policy were sharply pointed up by the arrival in the U. S. of an unofficial ambassador from Great Britain . The President took pains to say he would receive ex-Foreign Minister Anthony Eden as one more visiting Englishman . But it was perfectly clear that they would meet this week as one democrat talking to another in an autocrats ' world , for Mr. Eden quickly made it obvious that he had come to the U. S. as an apologist for Britain . Personable Mr. Eden had many an advantage for his job . Having quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain policy , he could talk easily to U. S. citizens who did not approve it . He also could expect respect for whatever he had to say , since Neville Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons last week that Mr. Eden was in the U. S. to express , unofficially of course , " the British view . " <P> The National Association of Manufacturers had promised Mr. Eden $5,000 and expenses to address its Congress of American Industry ( see p. 47 ) , and he was in fine fettle when he arrived in Manhattan. * With him was his blue-eyed , brunette wife . In his party also was Ronald Tree , M.P. , who served him as coach , buffer and expert on U. S. psychology . Ronald Tree is the Chicago-born grandson of Marshall Field . Thus guided , Anthony Eden endeared himself to street crowds , got along well with reporters . At the start of his speech at the Waldorf-Astoria , he said : " . . . This visit of mine . . . has no political significance whatever . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-official or even a sixteenth-part official . It is a visit of friendship . "
