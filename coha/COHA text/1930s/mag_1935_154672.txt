One sure way to rile an alumnus of Antioch College is to call his alma mater a trade school . Every Antioch student alternates work and study . For five to ten weeks he plugs at a liberal arts curriculum on the campus at Yellow Springs , Ohio . Then for an equal period he works in an office , store , factory , newspaper or at any job which appeals to him . Antioch 's President Arthur Ernest Morgan ( now on leave as chairman of Tennessee Valley Authority ) thinks of the work periods as a preparation for a full life and a substitute for the farm chores which bred resourcefulness in an earlier generation . <P> Heroes of Antioch are the students who do not rely on the college to find them jobs but go out and get their own . Early last month Undergraduate Anne Sibley climbed into a bus , started East . Since self-sufficient Undergraduate Sibley refrained from telling her Chicago parents where she was going , the Eastern Press was soon conducting a search . Last week the search ended on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Undergraduate Sibley 's job was to stand dumbly but alluringly beside the freaks while the barker was spieling . She worked from noon to midnight , earned $15 a week , lived with the tattooed lady . <P> Said the show manager : " She is just the type I need-tall , blonde and stately , with an air about her . " Heroine Sibley : " This has been worth a year at college . I 'm never going back . "
