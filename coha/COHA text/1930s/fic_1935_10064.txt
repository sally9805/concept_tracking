landlord . Fernet struggled to lift himself ; the doctor bent toward him . " This hunchback , " Fernet gasped , " he is trying to poison me . Already I have drunk four or five of his concoctions , and that is why I am in this condition . . . helpless . And he is lying when he says that I have eaten . I have touched nothing for three days . " The doctor laid the patient back upon the pillow . " Poison you , my friend ? And for what reason ? " " Because I laughed at him . In God 's name , Doctor , see thatyou keep a straight face in his presence or else  --  " The doctor patted Fernet 's hand and straightened the slidingbedclothes . By this time Minetti had come back . The doctor and the hunchback whispered together in a far corner . Minetti laughed and tapped his head . At the door Fernet heard the doctor say : " Just keep up the good work and the idea will pass . It happens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in again until the first of next week unless . . . " Fernet groaned aloud . " I must get away tomorrow . . . . I must get away tomorrow ! " he kept on repeating . By the end of the week the smell of food held no temptationsfor Fernet . Minetti stopped cooking . And when a glass of water was drawn from the faucet Fernet had difficulty in forcing his vision to answer the strain of a searching gaze . " When my sight fails me , " Fernet thought , dimly , " I shall either die of thirst or take the consequences . " When the doctor finally came again Fernet closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep . " He seems thinner , " remarked the doctor , as if he had made an important discovery . " Well , to tell the truth , " replied the hunchback , " he has lost his appetite . I have fed him milk and eggs but  --  " pIOI " There is nothing to do but be patient , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just rest and food . Even a little starvation will not hurt him . People eat too much , anyway . At this Fernet opened his eyes and broke into a laugh thatstartled even Minetti . The doctor looked offended . " Well , he is in your hands , " the old fraud said , pompously , to the hunchback . " Just keep up the good work  --  " Fernet laughed again . " He is hysterical , " proclaimed the doctor , with an air of supreme wisdom . " It happens that way very often in nervous cases . " And he walked out with great solemnity . " Ah , I have offended him ! " thought Fernet . " Well , now they will finish me  --  together ! " There followed days of delicious weakness . Fernet lay for the most part wrapt in the bliss of silver-blue visions . It seemed as if years were passing . He built shining cities , received the homage of kings , surrendered himself to the joys of ripe-lipped beauties . There were lucid intervals shot through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . But these were like waking momentsbetween darkness and dawn , filled with the halfconsciousjoy of a sleeper secure in the knowledge of a prolongedrespite . In such moments Fernet would stir feebly and think : " I must get away tomorrow ! " And there would succeed almost instantly a languid ecstasy at the thought that tomorrow was something remote and intangible that would never come . At times the hunchback seemed like nothing so much as a heartless gaoler who , if he would , might open the door to some shining adventure . Gradually this idea became fixed and elaborated . Fernet 's sight grew dimmer and dimmer untilpIO2he followed the presence of Minetti by the sounds he made . " He is jingling something , " Fernet would repeat , weakly . " Ah , it must be his keys ! He is searching for the one that will set me free ! . . . Now he is oiling the lock . . . . He has shut the door again . I am to be held awhile longer . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

When the time comes I shall fly out the window and leave him here  --  alone . Then we shall see who has the best of this bargain . " And all the silver-blue visions would steal over him again , to be pierced briefly by the arrival of the wizened doctor . " It is he who keeps me here ! " Fernet would say to himself . " If it were not for him I could fly away  --  forever . Well , presently even he will lose his power . " One day a strange man stood at his bedside . Minetti was there also , and the old fraud of a doctor . The strange man drew back the covers and put his ear to Fernet 's fluttering heart and went through other tiresome matters . . . . Finally he smoothed back the covers again , and as he did so he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him distinctly . " It is too late . . . . You should have called me sooner . He wishes to die . . . . There is nothing to be done . " " Yes , yes  --  it happens this way very often in nervous cases . " I have done my best . I have given him food and drink . I have even starved him . But nothing seemed to do any good . " " No , " said the stranger ; " it is his mind . He has made up his mind that . . . You can do nothing with a man when . . . " Fernet closed his eyes . " A man ! They think I am a man . What stupidity ! Can they not see that I am a bird ? . . . They have gone out . HepI03is locking the door again . . . I can hear the keys jingle . . Well , let him lock the door if it gives him any pleasure . The window is open and tonight . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A chuckling sound came to Andre Fernet and the thump of ecstatic fists brought down upon a bare table-top . " Without any weapon save the mind ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! " Fernet turned his face toward the wall . " He is laughing at me now . Well , let him laugh while he may . . . . Is not the window open ? Tomorrow I shall be free . . . and he ? . . . No , he can not fly  --  he has a broken wing . . . . The window is open , Andre Fernet ! "  | MARIA ESCOBAR was gathering a handful of pink camellias from the old bush drowsing against the west wall when she heard the tinkle of the bell at the garden gate . Only once in the entire seventeen years of her life had that bell been rung . The lock long since had rusted away to impotent senility and , for the most part , the gate swung back and forth , back and forth , in the lusty afternoon winds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing of the garden bell had ended in quite a flutter . Old Don Pedro Valencia , her uncle and her mother 's eldest brother , had come up from his native Chile to pay a ceremonialvisit to his sister . Although the gate had been blown wide open on that occasion , Don Pedro had scorned to enter under such easy and undramatic auspices . A bell at a garden gate was to be rung ; it was a prelude to a processional of welcome . . . . Maria remembered how she had run down breathlessly to the gate to find a little shriveled , fiery old man wearing a black cloak with scarlet at the collar , for all the world like a troubadour in a comic opera . Three retainers stood behind him , equally in cloaks . Don Pedro Valencia took off his wide-brimmed hat , made a sweeping gesture inMaria 's direction , bowed low , and fell over dead . . The doctors had dismissed the whole matter on the scoreof heart failure . But Maria 's mother , who always spoke her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of chagrin and disappointment . Fancy pulling a rusty bell in the hope of having a half score of servants escort him in triumph to the house only to find a chit of a girl , with two front teeth missing , respondingpI05to all his clatter ! . . . I know my brother . He was the world 's vainest man . " That was seven years ago . And now , again , the bell at the garden gate was ringing . Was this another relation from Chile bent on a pageantry of welcome ? . . . The tinkle came once more . Maria Escobar scurried to answer its summonsas she crushed the camellias against her breast where they made a splash of coral-pink gaiety . Looking down at them as she hurried toward the gate she thought , " If it is another haughty relation , I have at least some flowers to scatter in his path ! " And the grim memory of Don Pedro 's entrance into the garden was swallowed up in the whimsey of imagining these perfect blossoms crushed under the heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the main walk gloomy under the shadow of married cypress boughs bent and clipped into a vaulted hedge . The gate , swinging on its rusty hinges , loomed in a blaze of light at the corridor 's end . At first she made out only the blur of a waiting figure that had neither form , age , nor sex . But , as she came nearer , she saw through the iron grill work of the gate that a man stood there . And , coming nearer still , she discovered that this man was short like a dwarf and , nearer still , that his back was twisted and , nearer still , that he had an extraordinarily handsome face . She hurried forward and gained the gate just as the stranger was putting his hand upon the bell cord for a third time . He started back as if her sudden emergence from the gloom of the shaded walk had surprised him utterly . " Ah , " he sighed , as he took off his hat , " so you came at last ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more and then go on my way again , disappointed . It is hard for me to pass a garden and find myself shut out . " Maria Escobar was at an age when any circumstance , not overwhelmingly sad , became an excuse for mirth . " Shut out ! " she cried . " How absurd ! Why , this gate has been swingingp106open for twenty years . You can see for yourself that the lock is broken . " And she threw her head back charmingly as one peal of laughter after another issued from her throat . The hunchback , peering through the gate 's iron bars , stood watching her . His face was expressionless , but his two eyes held vivid glints of malice . She saw these sardonic lights and her laughter died . He opened the gate and stepped beside her . " I  --  I hope I have not offended you ! " she stammered . " By your laughter ? On the contrary . I feed on it . I devour it ! It is the very thing that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him . Just as I always shatter the glass from which I have drunk a rare wine . . . . What a beautiful old garden this is . Come , you must tell me all about it ! And you are lovely , too . Quite lovely . Is there no place where we can sit ? I love to sit in a garden under a tree and watch leaves fall . One by one . One by one . " She thought , " Shall I cry for help ? " He guessed what was running through her mind . " There , you are afraid of me ! Of me ! it is my turn to laugh . " But , as a matter of fact , he looked hurt like a child that had been wounded . She felt ashamed . " So you want to sit in a garden , under a tree , and watch the leaves fall . Very well , I know just the spot . " She went on ahead down the avenue of married cypresses . The hunchback followed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little to one side of the camellia bush were two benches and a round iron table . In the old days when the garden was in its prime the women of the family used to sit there in a circle , bending over their embroidery frames . Nearby , there was a niche in the stone wall which held a figure of Santa Barbara . It was a very gay , friendly figure in a bright blue cloak and head scarf . " I shall take this strange man there , " thought Maria. pI07 " Surely he can not harm me with a saint looking on . " A branch from an elm tree cast a pattern on the table top , but , for the most part , the tempered sunshine danced on a carpet of thin shadow . The hunchback sank down on one of the benches and tossed his hat upon the table . Maria Escobar sat upon the second bench opposite him , letting the camellias she was carrying fall into her lap . Even at noon the glinting sunlight was far from unpleasant as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not tell me that you live in this delightful spot alone , " said the hunchback . " Scarcely , " she returned boldly . " I have my mother and a cousin , Rosa Ortega , who tends her , and an old cook in the kitchen . " " Four women ! . . . Your mother is very old , is she not ? " " Old and ill . She scarcely ever leaves her room . " " We have not told each other our names . Mine is Flavio Minetti . " " And mine is Maria Escobar . " " Maria Escobar . Maria Escobar ! " He took out a little leather book from his pocket , and a stub of pencil . " Maria Escobar , " he said a third time as he wrote in the book . " You are writing my name in your book , " said Maria . " Why ? " He gave her an engaging smile . " I add it to the list of people who have laughed at me . People whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She should not have let him into the garden . Still , he must be harmless . He was looking at her intently , as if in expectation of an answer . She decided to be bold . " I have laughed at you , " she said gravely , " but you have not killed me . " " As if you could escape ! " he said . " I did not even laugh at you , " she found herself saying as she stripped one of the camellia blossoms of its leaves . " Ip108laughed at what you did , but not at you . Confess , it was ridiculous , ringing a garden bell when the gate stood open ! " " Everything in life is ridiculous ! " he answered testily . " Moreover , I do not scratch for motives . Laughter is laughter . I make my own laws and my own penalties . That is my right as a free person . Your right as a free person is to outwit me . " She had an impulse to rise and flee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child who ran from a savage dog and was torn to pieces . She looked at Flavio Minetti boldly as one by one she stripped the camellia stems of their superfluous leaves and laid them on the iron table . " I know ! You are trying to frighten me , " she said . He looked at his little book . " Maria Escobar ! " he repeated caressingly as he added a flourish to what he already had written . " As a matter of fact , " Flavio Minetti continued , as he slipped the little book back into his pocket , " this is not the first time I have seen you . Do you remember that Sunday afternoon following the Easter mass which they said in the old Mission ? I was passing by , very much as I was passing by this garden today , and I thought , Why not step inside and see what there is to see ? The mass is over and it will be pleasantlyempty and melancholy . ' Not that a church means anything to me . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are ghosts in them . " He dropped his glance and she crossed herself hurriedly . " I went in that Sunday looking for ghosts and I saw you , praying before a shrine . When you left I followed you to the garden gate . I would have rung the bell that morning but there were the figures of other people at the end of the cypress walk . A stooped woman , for one , with an attendant on either side  --  walking up and down , up and down . " " That was my mother ! " Flavio Minetti paid no attention to this remark . " A stooped woman with an attendant on either side  --  walking up andp109down , up and down , " he repeated ; " and just beyond the gate was the figure of a man lying face downward in the path . " He stopped quite suddenly and stared into space . Maria drew in a sharp breath . " Did he have on a black cloak with scarlet at the collar ? " " A black cloak with scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat with a wide brim ? " " The hat was in his hand . " " That was my uncle , Don Pedro . He died face downward in that path seven years ago . " " Naturally . I suspected that at once . You see , old gardens have ghosts in them also . I remember a garden in London . There was a beautiful woman in that garden , too . . . . I have often thought I should like to go back and see whether her ghost walks up and down its stone walks , between the primroses and hollyhocks . " " You mean she died ? " inquired Maria , timidly . Her heart was fluttering . " Naturally , since she laughed at me . " " You are ridiculous ! " cried Maria Escobar , sharply . " If you really go about killing people you should find a better excuse than that ! " " All excuses for killing people are ridiculous , " returned Flavio Minetti . " There was that Englishman , Wainewright . The friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maria Escobar laughed again . " Well , there is some point to that , " she answered , as she looked down at her slender legs . " Ah , " said Flavio Minetti , " you are vain like all women . But you are very pretty , too . I forgive you ! " And he gave her a warm , indulgent glance that made her think , " What rubbish he has been talking ! He is just a harmless creature with a warped back . How is it possible for him to kill . me ? It is just a joke he has  --  a warped joke like his back ! " Suddenlyshe felt sorry for him . " After all , he is one of God'sp110creatures ! " she thought and she asked him quite simply if he would not like a glass of sherry . " Sherry ! " he echoed , in a tone that left no question as to his delight . She left him , walking slowly into the house , to show that she was not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back she had two glasses with slender , twisted stems , upon a silver tray . A decanter was in the center , filled with wine the color of mahogany until the sun caught it and then it turned to fire . She poured one glass almost to the brim until it looked like a red tulip that had sprung up like magic . Flavio Minetti put out both hands to receive it . She merely covered the bottom of the second glass , raised it to her lips , and set it down again . But Flavio Minetti sipped and sipped , drawing in his breath , as if the wine 's fragrance was as precious as its taste . " This wine must be very old , " he said . " It has a rare perfume . It smells of summer . " " It is from a cask my great-grandfather brought from Spain . Some one put it in a far corner of his cellar , and it stood there for years unnoticed . " Flavio Minetti nodded his head . " Most fools toss off wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think nothing of its bouquet . " He passed the wine glass back and forth under his nose as he shivered with delight . " I can not imagine wine without fragrance . Nothing that lacks perfume has any meaning for me . Take those flowers on the table . They are beautiful , they are exquisite , but they are as dead as a woman without a soul . " Maria Escobar picked up a single camellia and gazed at it sadly . " I have often wondered why such a beautiful flower is without perfume . . . . You are right , it has no soul . " Flavio Minetti leaned forward and laid his glass upon the silver tray . " Come , I will give it a soul , " he said , as he put out his hand to her.  |p111She  gave him the blossom . He felt in an inner pocket and drew out a tiny leather case which he spread out on his lap . It contained a row of vials held in place by loops of leather . He slipped one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a single drop of colorless liquid fall into the coral-pink center of the camellia . The drop glistened momentarily like a crystal jewel , then disappeared . " There , " he said as he passed the flower back to her , " the miracle is accomplished . " She held the blossom on a level with her full , ripe lips and drew in deep breaths . She had never smelled a perfume so exquisite . It gave her a strange ecstasy . She knew that she was sitting in her garden , yet her spirit seemed floating up , up . Suddenly she realized that time and space meant nothing . Would she sit in this garden forever with a hunchback opposite her , watching the leaves fall ? . . . Yes , they were falling now , in spite of spring , harried to premature deaths by a cold wind from the sea . The figure of the hunchback , the leaves dancing in the sunlight , the shrine in the garden wall grew remote . . . . She came to her senses with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight . The seat in which Flavio Minetti had sat was empty . But the decanter of sherry and two empty glasses stood on the table . A camellia was in her hand , its petals blackened and shriveled . Remembering , she raised it to her nostrils . Its perfume was gone . All next day the memory of the perfumed camellia filled her with an exquisite longing . She kept the fading flower that had been ravished so quickly of its brief soul in a silver vase on a table beside her bed . She had a sad hope that some miracle would restore its lost fragrance . She wondered whether the hunchback would ever return to sit in the garden . If he came again would he bring the little leather case with its row of mysterious vials ? Her heart beat quickly . A week went by and she lost hope , but one morning she heardp112the ridiculous tinkle of the bell at the garden gate . She flew down the path , cool under its cypress hood . Flavio Minetti was waiting for her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never come again ! You thought that you would escape me ! " In the tumult of his return she scarcely noticed the irony that he put into these simple words . Her one thought was , " Has he brought the little leather case ? " Presently they were sitting as before under the branch of elm tree , the table between them . The early morning mist had parted , the sun came out warmly , white butterflies twinkled from flower to flower . He settled himself back in his garden seat as he threw his hat upon the table . A sigh of exquisite content fluttered from him . " This is the first time that I have sat in the sunshine since we parted , " he said in explanation of his delight . " And what have you been doing ? " she asked . " Reading an old book . It has all the secrets of the Borgias . . . . Ah , what wonderful people they were in that day ! What magnificent murderers ! Such skill ! Such subtlety ! Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have lived then . It comes over me like the fragment of a clouded dream that I must have been a jester in those days . In some ducal court . It was the service that they put twisted backs to , then . . . . I can see myself hopping nimbly from jest to jest , in cap and bells , making them laugh . Can you not see me  --  a misshapen thing capering grotesquely while they laughed ! How I must have hated them and their laughter ! How I must have envied my masters the power and skill to murder swiftly where they would . Have you never heard it said that all clowns shrink from the mob 's laughter ? . . . There was a famous clown in Paris who killed himself because he could not bear it ! What a fool ! What a fool , to kill himself and die unrevenged ! . . . Still , if he comes back again to earth asp113I have . . . who knows ! One has time to learn so many things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , tremulous with inarticulate longing . ' What did she care for the secrets of the Borgias ? Or the broken hearts of clowns ? Had he brought the little leather case with its row of mysterious vials ? " I sometimes think , " the hunchback went on , " that every person whom I kill must have laughed at me in that life when I had neither the skill nor the courage to undo them . I can see you  --  a slender princess , in the Florentine villa of your father , laughing as I made myself into a snug ball and , like a porcupine , rolled down the carpeted stairway leading to the throne . . . . Or were you the daughter of a French marquis new-come from Paris , or an Infanta of Seville with your black hair shrouded in a foam of lace ? . . . No matter , you laughed at me ! And your beauty stabbed me as harshly as your mirth . " Why could she not bring herself to ask him quite simply and naturally if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a lover abashed at speaking the precious name . But she had a lover 's slyness , too . " Did you provide souls , then , for the pink flowers in my hair ? " she asked . He shook his head . " In those days I had only the power to create laughter . " He looked at her with a strange satisfaction . " Is the cask of sherry empty that your great-grandfather brought from Spain ? " She did not answer him but she rose at once to fetch a decanter of wine . It was as if he had said , " Give me my heart 's desire and I will give you yours . " She came back with the decanter of wine and one slender glass upon its twisted stem . " One glass ? " he inquired challengingly . Still she said nothing . He rose and poured himself a brimful drink , leaning forward to inhale its fragrance . He sipped at the glass 's rim , then took it in his hands and held itp114out to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he half whispered . " Or has my ardor grown ? . . . What a strange thing desire is ! It feeds alike on bounty or impoverish-ment . " She knew , now , that he was worrying her , that he had the leather case tucked snugly away in his pocket . She gave the proffered glass a disdainful smile and shook her head . " It does not tempt me ! " she said . His eyes glittered . She could see that he had read her thoughts . He drank the wine with diabolical slowness . . . . At last , the glass was almost empty . Only a single drop glowed rubylike where stem and bowl met . " There is a wine in Munich touched with the scent of flowers , " he said . " The Germans drink it in May . It is too cloying for my taste , but you would like it . . . . I can not give you May wine but I can give this drop within my glass a breath infinitely sweeter . " He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the sight of it she trembled all over . " Is  --  is it the same perfume that gives dead flowers souls ? " " Not quite . I have worked all week to make this fragrance less fleeting . For hours , day and night , I have sought to imprisontaste as well as smell within it . " He uncorked a vial and let a crystal tear fall into the drop of wine . She snatched the glass from him , drawing great breaths from its shallowness . Presently she felt the wine upon her tongue . " It is tasteless ! " she said accusingly . He rubbed his hands together in glee . " Ah , what a greedy nose you have ! It leaves nothing for your other senses ! " " Give me more ! " she cried . " Do you understand , if I do not have more I shall die ! " " It will be the same in any case , " she heard him say . . . . The vial was against her hand and its moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bring her even a **26;2923;TOOLONG but she felt a murky content . All desire , all hope , all pain seemed fused into a dulled rapture . Flavio Minetti sat in the mottled sunshine drinking glass after glass of sherry . His lips moved and words escaped him , but she was not consciousthat they had meaning ; yet the cadence of his voice beguiled her like the drip of a fountain in the darkness . When he rose to leave she did not follow him through cypress shadows to the garden gate . She saw that he had left the vial upon the table . She struggled to rise , to call him back . She felt terrified at the thought of so much vicious ecstasy within reach . She heard the crunch of receding boots on the graveled path , the sad groan of rusty hinges , the feeble clang of iron striking against an impotent lock . She sat trembling , covering her face with her hands . The sight of the vial filled her with a strange horror . Suddenlyshe determined to smash it into a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaden weight to the table . But at the supreme moment her will failed . She drew away without so much as touching the object of her terror . Instead , with a supreme effort , she turned upon her heel and fled into the house . That night Maria 's mother said , " Something is amiss with my eyes . When I look at you , Maria , your face has a greenish color . I once had a duenna when I was a young woman who looked that way . She died soon after . They say an enemy poisoned her . " " God help me ! " thought Maria , but she said nothing . Before she went to bed she looked into her glass . Her mother was right ! She fell upon her knees and prayed fervently . Her prayers gave her peace ; she slept soundly until midnight . She awoke to the pain and rapture of longing . Her first thought was of the vial left upon the table in the garden . She had a sudden terror lest it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers . The jagged stonesp116in the garden path cut through her thin soles but she scarcely felt them . The sharp relief of finding the tiny bottle where the hunchback had left it made her giddy . Hugging the treasure close to her breast , she floated back to her room again . She lighted a candle and spread out a wisp of handkerchief upon which she let three drops of the precious extract fall . Then she threw herself upon her bed , covering her face with the fragment of linen steeped in this perfume of paradise . . .. The sun was shining in an east window when she awoke . As the days went by and the vial was emptied drop by drop Maria Escobar felt a sick terror . What would she do when the perfume was gone ? If only she had asked the hunchback where he lived ! But it was too late now . There was nothing to do but wait and hope for his return . Daily her mirror gave out disquieting revelations ; the note of green in her face deepened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flecked with black patches . She went about the house hugging the shadows , screening her face when either her cousin , Rosa Ortega , or the old cook came upon her . Every night at table her mother commented on the illusion of strange color that her failing eyesight gave to her daughter'sface . Rosa Ortega , in attendance , said nothing . She was a timid soul well schooled in the repression that is the acceptedlot of a poor relation and spinster in the bargain . But Maria knew from the frightened sadness of her glance that she suspected something was amiss . Finally one day this submerged soul gathered the courage to speak . Maria was sitting in the full glare of noonday before the iron table in the garden . For the past week she had been sitting there for hours , steeped in an idleness that was a curious mixture of apathy and disquiet . She scarcely owned it to herself , but she was waiting for the tinkle of the bell atp117the garden gate . Her cousin fluttered past like a bedraggled black bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her steps . " Maria Escobar , " she began with quivering respect , " you frighten me . For days I have been watching you . There is something unholy about you  --  there is something unholy in the way your eyes burn . I am a miserable creature , God knows , but I am not quite a fool . Nor am I old like your mother and given to blaming what I can not explain on my infirmities . When I see the color of the tomb in a young girl 's cheeks , I know that it is there and not in a trick of spent eyesight . . . . If your body is unsound let me send for a doctor . If it is your soul that is sick  --  there is a remedy for that , too . " At the mention of her soul Maria Escobar trembled . This disquiet made Rosa Ortega bold . For the first time in her life this timorous creature dared to speak freely what was in her mind . She came a step closer to Maria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she said : " I know the very day that this affliction came to you . I heard the garden bell tinkling and I saw you leading a twisted man up the path . An hour later he had gone , but I found you sitting where you sit now . I called to you , and you did not speak . " " How dared you ! " cried Maria Escobar , beside herself with rage . " How dared you spy on me ! " But Rosa Ortega stood there unabashed and unfrightened . " I called to you , and you did not speak ! " she repeated . " And in your face was a dreadful look . " She crossed herself piously . " A dreadful look such as people wear who have seen forbiddenthings . " Maria Escobar began to laugh . " Forbidden things ! . . . How little you know ! On that day I saw Paradise . " " Hush ! " said her cousin . " You must not say such things !  |p118To  sell yourself to the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You lie ! " cried Maria boldly , but inside she was quivering with fright . " I tell only the truth , " returned Rosa with the appalling calm of self-righteousness . " Your twisted friend came a secondday . But this time he did not escape me . When he left this garden I followed him . I followed him for blocks and blocks , and finally he halted before the door of cheap lodgings , and the stairway swallowed him up . I stood in the street bewildered . I was afraid to go farther . While I hesitated a youth came down the stairs . I thought , He can tell me what I wish to know . ' So I went up to him and said , Who is the hunchback that just went inside ? ' He shook his head . Only God knows . I lodge next to him and far into the night I can hear him moving about  --  making strange noises . Once I saw into his room . It was like the workshop of a chemist . But he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is either the . devil himself or he is in bondage to him . Have nothing to do with him if you value your soul . For myself , I am moving away tonight ! ' " Rosa Ortega threw out a look of triumph . For the first time in her life circumstances had given her the center of the stage , and she was squeezing her moment dry . As for Maria Escobar , she sat in a sly mask of silence . When she did speak her voice was shaken between apprehensionand hope . " You  --  you mean you know where he lives ? " she asked . " You could go to it ? " " Naturally . He lodges at the Hotel des Alpes Maritimes . " A strangled note of joy came from Maria Escobar . Her one thought was to be up and off in search of him . She made as if to rise , but a strange numbness was in her limbs . She fell back panting . " I am dying ! " flashed through her mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew to her side . " Maria , Maria ! " she screamed , shakingher.  | " Hush ! " commanded her cousin with sudden calm . " Hush ! Or my mother will hear ! . . . Listen to me , Rosa . You are a wicked woman . It is you who have sold yourself to the devil with your horrid thoughts . I have been dying for weeks  --  for weeks , do you hear ! There is nothing that can save me . But there is one who can grant me a brief respite from my pain . It is the twisted man you followed . Go to him and beg him to come once more and see me . Tell him how I suffer ! " " Oh , Holy Mother of God ! " cried Rosa , dropping to her knees . " Do not wait ! Go at once ! See how my hand is burning . I am on fire , Rosa . " " Maria  --  Maria Escobar , why have you not told me before ? Let me first go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-shriven ! " " Later ! when the pain is dulled , Rosa , my darling . . . . Go , I beg of you , or I shall die before even a priest can shrive me . " " Oh , Holy Mother of God ! " cried Rosa Ortega again as she rose and fled down the avenue of married cypresses and past the garden gate . Maria Escobar felt in her bosom and drew out the vial . It was almost empty . She lifted it slowly toward her face , as she threw her head back . She could feel her nostrils quivering . But all else  --  her arms , her legs , even her lips were numb . She sat there in a state of curious physical stupor but her mind glowed like an ember . Never had the colors in the garden seemed so poignant , and even its sounds were vibrant . She could hear the hurtle of falling leaves and the wings of white butterflies beating together . ' Within her , memory surged up in waves bathed in the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like lives she once had lived . She saw the splendors of courts in which she had moved , the brocades , the silks , the jewels she had worn . She listened again to the lutes of troubadors who had wooed her . From her balcony she threw garlands about the necks of re/turning conquerors . The hours she had suffered , the hours she had starved , the hours she had shivered in rags , the hours she had wept were wrapped in the glittering sheen of suprememoments of existence . And , yet , some superconsciousnesstold her that this ecstasy was as fragile as a crystal ball tossed into the air . It caught all the colors of the sun and sky , but one false move and it would lie shattered on the grass . Through all this gay fabric of the past ran one dull thread of apprehension . What if Rosa Ortega did not find the hunchback ? What if he had quitted his lodgings  --  or worse still , the town ? To be won back to life now ; to wake slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of living  --  the prospect made her heart stand still . Were minutes or hours or centuries slipping by ? She could not have said . Rapture cannnot measure time but it can hug it close . Maria Escobar let her two white hands flutter toward her breast as if to ' keep the flashing moments captive forever . She did not hear the tread of the hunchback or the flutter of Rosa Ortega 's skirts coming down the path . But , quite suddenly , they were before her like two enslaved apparitions . She turned her face toward Flavio Minetti : " Send my cousin away ! " she said . He spoke to the frightened kinswoman . She hesitated but presently she moved toward the house , sobbing . " Have you brought another vial ? " asked Maria . He opened a closed fist and she saw what she desired , warm within his grasp . They exchanged significant glances . " Well ! " she half sighed . He put the vial upon the iron table and took a step toward her . " Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the thresholdof death . A dozen drops more of this perfume and everythingwill be over . . . . Does not life call out to you ? " She shook her head.  | " You are ravaged , it is true , Maria Escobar , " he went on . " But I can still save you ! " " Save me ? " she echoed fretfully . " Must I laugh at you again ? " He shrugged . " I have a whim to reprieve you . It is my privilege . Think , you are young  --  a virgin . You have not yet lived ! " Waves of memory bathed in the silver of dead moons again swept her . " What is one life to me ? " she answered . " I can not shake you ? " " No ! " " So be it then , " he said . She saw him step back toward the table , she saw him lift the vial in midair . It caught the colors of the sun and sky as the crystal ball of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if it should drop from his hand and fall shattered on the hard surface of the table . " Quickly ! " she cried and she held out her cupped palm to him . She felt the cool drops fall one by one on her parched skin . She shivered with delight . When he had finished he restrained the impatient gesture of her arm . " I am going at once , Maria Escobar , " he said . " By the time I reach the garden gate everything will be over . If you repent you have but to dash the perfume on the ground . Or hold it up for the sun to devour ! " " I shall not repent ! " she answered in a whisper . He took off his hat and made her a bow as twisted as his back . She felt like laughing for the last time as he turned upon his heel and left her . Slowly she lifted her palm . Her head bent forward to meet it half way . . . . She heard the hurtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . A black cloak with scarlet at the collar came from the shadows of the married cypresses.  | SOMETIME ago , before such an American institution as a chop suey restaurant was transplanted from Broadway , New York , into San Francisco 's Chinatown , there lived in an upper chamber overlooking Grant Avenue a woman named Wong See . Now , Wong See was no ordinary Chinese woman . To begin with , there had been more Tong wars started over the possession of Wong See than ever had been attributed to any other cause . And , by the same token , more deaths lay indirectly to her credit . To attempt to analyze Wong See 's charms was futile  --  in occidental parlance , she had a way with her . And when you have said this about any woman , you have said all . This upper chamber , opening as it did upon a balcony green with potted shrubs , existed in its present state of splendorby favor of one Look Fong Ming , a gay young blade , quick with a gun and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would call a merchant , and he certainly did not toil for wages , and on the other hand he was not exactly an idler . How he came by his money , nobody in Chinatownknew , or , to be more exact , nobody disclosed . But his purse must have been a weighty affair since Wong See was an expensive luxury , and , although he had won her at the pistol 's point instead of prosaically buying her for the required pieces of silver , the fact remained that she had to be supported in the style to which she had been accustomed . Not that he lacked the power or brutality to support her in any style he chose , but there are some things which are not done , and indifferently maintaining such a treasure as Wong See is one of them.  |p126This  Fong Ming was a good deal like the usual run of males . An apple just out of reach intrigued him ; once it had fallen into his hands he lost a measure of his interest ; having bitten into the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw or give the damaged fruit away . Instead , he put it on the shelf , locked the door to the store-room and gave the key into the keeping of a trusted servant . In Wong See 's case , this trusted servant was a hideous old duenna , lacking a nose , named Shoo Shee . Now , an upper chamber , overlooking Grant Avenue hung with red and gold tapestries and smiling with lilies and almondboughs and asters in their season , was without doubt a delightful place . But , to say the least , it grew monotonous when sometimes a week went by without any companionship save a shriveled old hag who blew incessant clouds of smoke through two holes in her face . " Why does he not sell me , if he is tired ? " Wong See would demand of Shoo Shee . " I have brought as high as five thousand dollars and certainly my day is not yet over . " To which Shoo Shee would reply wagging her bald old head viciously : " What is five thousand dollars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for argument the discussiondied still-born . But thoughts are not so easily killed as words , and Wong See was not the woman to be scorned without a struggle . At first she wondered whether her charms were failing . But her mirror gave her beauty a good report . So she merely plucked out a truant hair or two from her eyebrows and penciled them afresh . On occasions she tried to awaken Look Fong Ming 's interest with a new arrangement of seed-pearls in her head-dress , or by painting her upper lip into an original and fantastic shape , or by a mincing walk achieved in lieu of lilyfeetby embroidered slippers set high from the ground upon teetering soles . She learned a new song , she dug up piquantpI27stories for his delight , she composed a poem , she even sang a hymn that she had acquired when she had been an inmate of a Christian Mission , but all to no purpose . Look Fong Ming 's visits grew less and less frequent , and Shoo Shee 's exhalations of cigaret smoke more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the diluted pleasures of reminiscence . She regaled the complacent Shoo Shee with tales of what previously had been her portion . " Would you believe it , " she said , " but when I belonged to the apothecary Mock Wah , he came twice a day , at noon to bring me seed-cakes and in the evening to surprise me with unheard-of gifts . When I was stolen from him and taken to Sacramento , six men died before I finally came into the possessionof Tung Ding . My last master gave me sixty pearls and half as many pieces of jade . Even at the Mission where I was concealed for three months the matron gave me hair ribbons and taught me to sing stupid songs in her language because she loved me . . . . And yet here I must sit from dawn to dark , with not so much as a bag of candied melon rind by way of knowing that my lord still favors me . " " Well , well , " the old crone returned , " if it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shall put a word in the ear of Look Fong Ming the next time he condescends to visit us . What shall I demand  --  slippers lined with fur . . . or a carved box for your eyelid rouge . . . or a jar of preserved ginger ? " " Demand ? " Wong See echoed incredulously . " That may be the way of some women , but it is not mine . I am poorly schooled in this business of begging favors . " At this old Shoo Shee smiled until her black gums almost cracked . " Fortunately for you , " she threw back , " the years are great teachers . You will learn , in time , like all the rest of us . I could tell you tales of gifts , also , if I had a mind to let my tongue click on until the end of time . You can not fancy that I have always been old and lacking a nose . Perhaps sixp128men have not died fighting for me . But I was wanted in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned in due season that it is much easier to ask than starve . " " You ! " Wong See retorted contemptuously . " What can you know of triumphs ! Did any of your masters go so far as to teach you to write ? Remember , I once had a scholar for a lover . He kept me in wretched style , it is true . But every evening he taught me how to paint a new character , until I knew enough to write him messages of love . . . . Yes , perhaps you will not credit it , but three times every day he sent a boy for these messages , until in the end he grew tiresome . . . . So I turned these shafts of love into weapons . I sat down at my table one day and I traced with my brush upon a bit of rice-paper these words : I am Wong See , the most famous slave-girl in ten days ' journey . And yet I am unhappy because I love you . Jue Num , the scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my balcony I dropped this bit of rice-paper into the hands of the first handsome gunman that passed beneath . . . . The next day the boy did not come at the appointed time . But , at evening , the handsomegunman did . . . . So I changed my dwelling place again . . . . You see , Shoo Shee , I am scarcely a fool , and I have more than charms to hold fast to . Look Fong Ming will do well to give a little heed to how badly he uses me . " At this , old Shoo Shee doubled up with derisive mirth , said : " Can it be that you will be dropping messages from this balcony , Wong See ? " To which Wong See replied : " What has been done once can be done again , Shoo Shee . All I say now is , let Look Fong Ming have a care ! One does not need to wait for ripened plums to fall from a tree when they may be had for a little shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she amused herself writing imaginary love messages to imaginary gunmen , while old Shoo Shee blewp129cigaret smoke through the two holes in her face and chuckled . Now , after a season , it came to Wong See that all this gossipingwith Shoo Shee was to very little purpose , so she held her peace . But she continued deliberately to write messages on rice-paper and as deliberately destroy them . In the afternoons , she would sit languidly upon the balcony , plucking at the wind-bitten camellias blooming in prim rows along the edge , gazing incuriously at the crowds below . Many who passed glanced up , trying to catch a glimpse of her face shaded by a sandalwood fan , for they had heard of the charms of Look Fong Ming 's woman . But they took care not to linger , for the wrath of Look Fong Ming was not a thing heedlessly to invite . So for the most part they went quickly on their way saying beneath their breaths : " Only a man as powerful as Look Fong Ming would risk his heart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Recalling , at the same time , the dark and sunless alleys which usually caged such birds of brilliant plumage . As for Wong See she marked them all , every one , against the time when she would write a love-message which she would not destroy . And , as the days crawled away without so much as giving her a glimpse of a man who could intrigue her fancy , she began to wonder . " Can it be that I am growing old , indeed ! " she would mutter . And the next day she would spend an extra ten minutes before her mirror , plucking her eyebrows again and putting a heavier pencil line along their fashionably scant length , snared by the sophistry that a youthful face would rejuvenate the heart also . But , as before , the afternoon would pass without profit . Finally , one day , she rose from her seat upon the sunlit balcony and went into the house . " Well , " said old Shoo Shee , mockingly , " are there no gallantsin the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wong See did not reply . She had not fancied that the old noseless crone had guessed her secret and she was at a loss how best to answer , but in the end she said boldly : " Why waste further time ? I have seen the face of every man , save one , who passes beneath my balcony . And I would not give so much as a feather from my jar of peacock tails for the entire lot . " " So ? " answered Shoo Shee . " I will wager that I can guess the man whose face you have not seen . He is a waiter at the Hang Far Low , and every day at three he walks under your balcony with a tray of food upon his head , for the family of the worker in gold who lives two doors to the south . " " You serve your master well , " Wong See replied with a sneer . " Since you lack a nose for sniffing out secrets your eyes have grown twofold . . . . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hang Far Low would scarcely be to my taste . " At this , Shoo Shee gave a sidelong glance . " May not a youth be lusty whatever his trade ? At least you must have seen that he is well favored in one particular . " " He has a shapely hand , " Wong See laughed back in spite of herself . " Ah , then , your eyes have not been idle , either ! " replied Shoo Shee . " One sees what one can , " Wong See said pensively . And with that she sat down before her brush and ricepaper . But instead of writing imaginary love letters to imaginarygunmen , she thrust the lacquered handle of her tiny brush between her teeth and sat staring at the red and gold tapestries on the walls . " How now , Wong See ! " cried the old trot . " Have you lost the trick of writing couplets ? " " One can not go far with a single hand , " answered Wong See , " even though it be shapely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " Can it be that she is my friend ? " thought Wong See . And straightway she dipped her brush into her inkwell of carved agate , covering the rice-paper with strange and fantastic symbols . The next day , sitting upon her balcony with windbittencamellias , Wong See watched anxiously for the passing of the waiter from the Hang Far Low . Long before she knew of his approach by the sunlight glistening on the pewter covers keeping warm the midday meal which he carried so nonchalantly upon his head . As he drew nearer she leaned slightly forward until the pearl pendants in her slick , black hair dangled like arrested snowdrops eager to spend themselves . When he passed directly beneath , she rose , bending with indiscreet curiosity over the railing . But his face was as before , hidden among the shadows cast by a square tray of unlovely regularity . Yet the hand was there , up-poised and shapely , resting lightly against the tray 's thick edge  --  a golden-yellow hand with fingers neither too blunt nor too tapering , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase . Wong See sat down again . " How comes it , " thought she , " that a waiter possesses so fine a hand ? I have seen men in the fish stalls and their knuckles were red and their fingers short and unhealthy looking from dabbling in water . And I have seen the hands of the men who pluck geese in the poultry shops and they have been equally unlovely . Yes , I have seen even the hands of waiters , but they must have been ugly like the rest , since I can not remember them otherwise . Yet this man has the hand of one who might be a carver of ivory or a worker in silver . It is a far finer hand than Look Fong Ming 's . And certainly neither the apothecary , Mock Wah , nor Jue Num , the scholar , possessed such shapely fingers . Nor did my lastp132master , who gave me sixty pearls and half as many pieces of jade . I would like to see his face . If his face but matches his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she repeated these thoughts to Shoo Shee , and the old woman replied : " For myself I would risk a great deal on a shapely hand . " With that , she handed Wong See the slender lacquered brush and the inkwell of carved jade . And Wong See sat far into the night tracing messages upon rice-paper that seemed never to quite suit her , since she tore them all up . But toward midnight she achieved one which brought a smile to her lips , and , when it was quite finished , she rolled it into a tiny ball and slipped it into the pocket of her outer jacket of blue silk , embroidered with butterflies . Next day when the waiter from the Hang Far Low passed beneath her balcony she dropped it cunningly upon the tray so that it fell between the glazed bowls with their covers of polished pewter . And as she watched his coarse-clad figure swinging down the street below her she thought : " Old Shoo Shee is right . . . . He has a graceful swing to his hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . And I am tired of men who have lived long enough to have tasted everything ! " When , on the following afternoon , Wong See caught the first glimpse of the waiter from the Hang Far Low swinging gracefully down the street , her heart gave a sudden leap . At once , she searched in the silk-lined pocket of her outer jacket , and drew forth a tiny ball of rice-paper . " A single message , " thought she , " may well be lost . But if he were to miss fifty I should continue to drop them upon his tray until he rewards me with , at least , a glance . " But , for all her reasoning , when he passed swiftly beneath her balcony without so much as an uplifted eyelid she could have cried her disappointment aloud . " Surely this second message will have a better fate , " shep133muttered as she dropped it skilfully between the glazed bowls with their covers of polished pewter . But the next day passed with as little profit , and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wong See knew no more of this man who walked daily beneath her balcony than the shapeliness of his hand . " What do you think , Shoo Shee , " cried Wong See in white-lipped anger , " can it be that he scorns me , the most famous slave-girl in ten days ' journey ? He had better take care . Look Fong Ming is quick with a gun . " " In my day , " replied Shoo Shee , " masters did not avenge such virtuous affronts to their mistresses . " " In your day , " Wong See snapped back , " women were fools ! You do not fancy that the truth will pull the trigger of Look Fong Ming 's gun ? However , I shall see the face of this man if it takes me a year and I drop enough tender messagesto beguile a hundred times his number ! " But when two weeks had passed without result , Shoo Shee said not unkindly : " When I go marketing today , I shall find out what is said of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And , locking the doors diligently , Shoo Shee pattered down the steps , while Wong See watched her disappear in the crowd below like some shriveled plum in a holiday cake . .. . Presently the old trot came back . " I have found out everything , " she panted . " His name is Ah Yok , and he is betrothed to the daughter of the worker in gold where he goes twice a day with his tray . They are to be married at the season of blossoming lilies . And he is not so humble as he looks . For they say , when the time is ripe , he shall have a tea-house of his own , with tables of teakwood and gilt carvings . " " Ah , so that is how matters stand ! " Wong See said too quietly . " A betrothed simpleton ! Who would have thought it ! "  |p134All  that afternoon , she sat upon her sunlit balcony shading her eyes with a sandalwood fan . But instead of searching in the crowds that passed below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , she looked for another . . . . Toward evening her patience was rewarded . From the gaping doorway of the house two doors to the south , darted a swallow-like figure . The worker in gold was coming home and his daughter was running toward him with a greeting . Yes , there could be no doubt that she was his daughter . For was not her hair twined with blossoms and twisted stiffly over one ear in the fashion of one who is betrothed ? " I have seen her a thousand times ! " muttered Wong See , between locked teeth . " A fragrant enough blossom in her way , but with an empty head . . . . Well , we shall see how long this Ah Yok can scorn me . Those who can not be bribed with favors may be driven with whips ! " And , instead of writing messages on rice-paper that night , she dropped a sweetmeat in a tiny bag of red silk , and old Shoo Shee , watching her , said : " What trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Wong See replied : " A trap for virtue . " And she smiled the smile of an evil woman who had been scorned . For several days Wong See kept the tiny bag of red silk hidden in the pocket of her outer jacket ; the dropping of a sweetmeat from a second-story balcony was not so simple a matter as sending a bit of rice-paper fluttering between glazed bowls upon a square and unlovely tray . It was needful to seize upon just the proper moment when the eyes of the curious were turned another way . For what could Look Fong Ming 's woman have to do with the betrothed daughter of an honorable man ? What , indeed ? ... No , Wong See had long since learned that to be discreet was to be successful , so shep135possessed herself in patience , enjoying the sun daily and seeming to do no more than scatter the petals of fading camellias down upon those who passed beneath her . But , to tell the truth , she marked everything that went on in the street below , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumed hair bunched primly over one ear . And the more she watched that figure the more bitter she became . " Fancy , " she would say , " this drab little sparrow is preferred to Wong See for whom dozens of men have died . . . . Well , she is not as ugly as she might be ! With properly penciledeyebrows and her lips done decently she might have an air . . . . Of course , she is young ! That can be safely granted . And men have not yet learned that for all its bloom an early plum is tasteless . . . . Well , there is nothing that can not be turned to account if one has a mind for it . " So , contenting herself with these reflections , she waited her time . Now , as the days went by , Wong See learned , among other things , that at the hour when the street was most deserted the betrothed daughter of the worker in gold went daily to her father 's shop to carry him a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportune time , waiting thus for her return from this errand , Wong See , leaning discreetly over the railing , cried : " Little swallow ! . . . little blossoming pomegranate ! . . . little butterfly of morning ! . . . see what I have saved from my store for you ! " And she tossed the tiny bag of red silk into the upraised hands outstretched to receive it . Then , as a happy laugh floated up , she put a discreet finger to her lips as if to say : " Tell nothing , and who knows what other delights may be your portion ! " At this , the little figure in the street below clapped her hands in understanding as well as pleasure , and was gone.  |p136But  Wong See , sitting languidly under the swinging red lantern that Shoo Shee always lit at nightfall , sat motionless for a long time . " How shall I tempt her next ? " she pondered . And as if in answer to her question , a seed-pearl rolled from her hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . " You shall be my next messenger , " she said , gazing fondly at the tiny bauble in her hand . But instead of a single pearl she strung a chain of them that night , while Shoo Shee looked on and chuckled . " A sweetmeat first and then a string of pearls ! " mused the old trot . " As I remember , I was captured with some such foolishness myself . . . . You may not believe it , but I was honorably betrothed once . . . . And but for some such trick , perhaps I would be now lording it over the unproved wife of a youngest son . " " Or you might be the barren slave of a more fruitful second wife , " replied Wong See , venomously . " It is hard to tell a tale that has never been written . " " You are right , " replied Shoo Shee . " Regret is the child of foolish hopes . . . . Yet , proving the right to a throne is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Presently , there came a knock on the door , and almost at once Look Fong Ming entered . " Well ! More gauds with which to deck yourself ? " he asked half-contemptuously , running the string of pearls through his fingers . Wong See shook her head and her voice was full of melancholy . " I am too old for further trappings , " she answered . " These are for a tender blossom that is only just budding . You should see her , Look Fong Ming ! She is like a bit of red coral not yet shaped to its full beauty . " Look Fong Ming lifted his eyebrows and he said :  | " Where does this treasure live ? " " Ah , " replied Wong See , " to know her dwelling-place will profit you nothing . She is already honorably betrothed . " And , with that , she put the pearls aside and talked of other matters . In some such fashion as the sweetmeat found its way into the hands of youth , so did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seven golden days Wong See 's balcony rained down treasures at the hour when the street was most deserted . Also , Look Fong Ming took to visiting the upper chamber overlooking Grant Avenue every evening as Wong See sat before her carved table devising fresh delights for the beguilement of virtue . At such times Wong See would say with quiet cunning : " Ah , Look Fong Ming , it is well you have not seen this ripening fruit for whom I nightly prepare gifts . An apple out of reach is a poor breeder of content . " Or , again , she would ask more playfully : " Were you asleep , Look Fong Ming , when this mist of the morning floated away and was lost ? You must have passed her a hundred times in coming hither . And you could have bought her for a song . . . . But , now , that is all over . " Look Fong Ming would sit silent and puzzled as men do when they can not put a finger on their desire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's empty chatter he would be gone . Then Wong See would laugh softly to herself and say to Shoo Shee : " Did you mark how melancholy my lord has grown ? Thus are all men in love with a shadow . Had I pointed this twitteringlinnet out to him at once he would not have given her a second glance . But , now , finding everything withheld except word of her , he comes every night to be fed with more emptiness . He will end by having her , mark what I say , Shoo Shee . Even if she proved as black as the ink in my agate bowl ,  | and toothless in the bargain , he would have her for the sake of vanity if for no other reason . " " And to what purpose do you plan all this , Wong See ? " Shoo Shee would ask . " One must pass the time , " Wong See would reply . Then would fall a silence , and before Wong See 's eyes would float the outline of a shapely hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think to herself : " Why did he not so much as glance up at me ? If he had but looked my way I would have forgiven him . Shall I write one more message and give him a chance to prove himself ? I have seen betrothed men in my day and they have not been so careful with their eyes . " Musing thus to herself she would end by saying aloud : " Shoo Shee , is there anything more foolish in the world than a woman ? " " Not unless it be a man , " old Shoo Shee would answer . And , at that , silence would fall again . Now , on this seventh golden day , Wong See let fall a gift more wonderful than all that had gone before . In a square box of red lacquer she placed a piece of flawless jade carved in the shape of a lotus bud and this she tossed from her balconyinto the up-flung palms of youth , saying as she did so : " Ah , little twinkling moon , little seed-cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you climb the steps to my threshold and warm my sunless chamber ? " But the head of youth shook sorrowfully . " That may never be , Wong See , for I am a woman honorably betrothed and you are but the slave-girl of Look Fong Ming . . . . Yet I would break even this rule if the man whom I am to wed had not warned me against you . " At this , Wong See 's teeth flashed cruelly white between her painted lips . " And what does this man who is to wed you say of me , little peachbloom of springtime ? "  | " He says that from your upper balcony you drop love messages for any and all who will be snared . . . And even he has not been overlooked . " " And did he read them to you , oh , little trusting wren ? " " Nay , he tore them into bits and laughed . " " Ah , little disturber of men 's hearts , he did as I fancied he would . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts directly into the hands of her who should receive them instead of dropping them upon a cluttered tray . " " Your master 's gifts . . . Came they not from you , Wong See ? " " Can a slave-girl write love messages ? And would she share gifts with her rival ? Think on these two things , daughterof coming fruitfulness , and if you know more , call softly at my wicket at nightfall . " With that , Wong See turned away quickly and went in and stood before Shoo Shee . " What did you drop today ? " asked the old woman evilly . " The seed of vanity , " replied Wong See . " And before the night is over it will put forth its first tender shoot . " And she took the seed-pearls and ornaments of sky-blue enamel and the coral blossoms from her hair and stretched herself contentedly upon her teakwood divan . After nightfall there came a scratching sound at the wicket and Wong See said to Shoo Shee : " Virtue is scratching my threshold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And old Shoo Shee pattered across the room and threw open the door upon a slender figure in a jacket of rusty alpaca . " I am Yang Choy , " said the visitor , " and my father is the worker in gold who lives two doors to the south . I have come to call upon Wong See . " And with that , Wong See stirred languidly upon the rice mats of her divan and called out :  | " Come in , little bird of twilight , and let me see if you are as beautiful as my master says you are . . . . Ah , yes , he is right ! Well , I have grown old , and if he must choose another it were well to have him snared by one who is worthy to be my rival . " " You must not talk so , Wong See , " said Ying Choy . " What can it matter to me what your master says ? I am honorablybetrothed to Ah Yok and even the Emperor of China himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the eyes of any who wish it . . . . But have no fear  --  Look Fong Ming is a worthy man . Since another has spoken for you he will be content . It is I who am sorrowful ! For I know now that my day is over and I could have loved you , Ying Choy ! But , the others  --  how I shall hate them ! Come , let me dress your hair ! I should like to see how splendidyou might be if things were otherwise . " Without any further word , old Shoo Shee brought every jewel that her mistress owned and together they brushed and combed and twined strings of pearls and ornaments of blue enamel and coral blossoms into the thick , black strands . And they painted the lips of Ying Choy in a strange and fantastic shape , and they rouged her eyelids , and penciled her brows , and they put on a splendid jacket of lavender , embroidered in seven colors , and slippers of apple-green . And when they were quite finished they led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill while Wong See said over and over again : " My master is right  --  you are as beautiful as a plum tree in its first blossoming ! No wonder he wrote you messages of love which never reached your ears . . . . And to fancy that all this might one day have been yours if only Ah Yok had not spoken for you ! Well , thus does Fate use us ! " As for Ying Choy , her lips said nothing , but her eyes asshe gazed at herself in the long mirror kept repeating : " Yes , I am indeed beautiful . . . . I am as beautiful as alily at the new year rising from a bowl of pure jade ! "  |p141Even  old Shoo Shee was moved to mutter in a corner : " Wong See , have a care ! This slender sprout is beauti-ful ! " Presently there came a tapping up the stairway and a step upon the landing . " Ah , " cried Wong See , " Look Fong Ming is upon us ! " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me out ! " she pleaded . " If my father knew of this he would beat me . " " Nonsense ! " cried Wong See . " You could not run through the street in all that finery even if I yielded it to you . . . . Look Fong Ming is not a seven-toed dragon . Stand up and let him see how well he chooses when he has a mind for it . At Wong See 's command , Ying Choy drew herself up proudly , and when Look Fong Ming entered he saw her standing in the yellow gaslight like the princess of some old tale . Slowly her eyes met his . She smiled , and suddenly Look Fong Ming moistened his upper lip . " Come ! " said Wong See quietly . " If you stay longer your father will be searching for you . " And in silence old Shoo Shee stripped Ying Choy of her gauds and finery , wiping her scarlet lips free of their color and brushing the penciling from her brows , until she stood again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple jacket of rusty alpaca . " Good-bye , Ying Choy , little stalk of dripping sugar cane , " cried Wong See sorrowfully . " Come again to cheer me , for my lord is not often with me . " As for Look Fong Ming , he gazed long after the retreatingfigure , until Wong See said : " What do you think of her ? Is she not everything I have claimed ? " " Everything and more ! " replied Look Fong Ming sullenly . For a long time not a word was spoken . Old Shoo Shee blew smoke through the two holes in her face and Wong See , from her teakwood divan , waved her fan languidly , and gazed up at the ceiling . Finally , Wong See laid her fan aside and said : " Well , my lord , what stands in the way ? " " Did you not say she was already betrothed ? " Wong See laughed softly . " Money has bought much since the world began , Look Fong Ming . " He rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a strange woman , Wong See ! I do not understand you . " In answer she turned her face away . " I am tired , Look Fong Ming ! That should not be hard to fathom . " He stood for a moment in the center of the room like a man suddenly bewildered , and the next thing he had departed , banging the door . Wong See turned her head toward Shoo Shee again . " They will refuse him  --  that goes without saying . " " What then ? " queried Shoo Shee . " Then , " declared Wong See , " the tale will really begin . " Before noon of the next day Wong See 's prophecy came true . Shoo Shee , returning from market with supplies and the gossip of the fish stalls , repeated the current tale to her charge . " It is said , " she began , " that early this morning Look Fong Ming went to the father of this fluttering sparrow and said , I will give you thus and so for your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an honorable man , The question is for Ah Yok to answer . If he can be persuaded to yield up such a treasure we will consider the matter . ' But Ah Yok flatly refused . You have not gold enough , Look Fong Ming , ' he declared , insolently , to make me the laughingstock of the tea-houses . I have set my heart on Ying Choy and she shall be my wife . ' "  | " And what did Look Fong Ming say to that ? " inquired Wong See . " Nothing . . . . He but took a gun from his pocket and polished the glistening barrel with one finger . At which Ah Yok smiled and walked away . " A long sigh came from Wong See . " This Ah Yok is more of a gallant than I suspected . . . . If he had only glanced up at me ! Ah well , he chose his path ! If it leads him into disaster it will serve him right . " And her upper lip curled cruelly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all my jade ornaments and my rings of gold . For , if I am not mistaken , Look Fong Ming will come running here with his tale , like a schoolboy thrashed by the master . Thus do men boast and cry out to us women in one breath . There is no limit to their conceit , either in their pride or their humility . They fancy that it matters not to us how the tale goes so long as we are privileged to hear the clicking of their tongues ! " True enough , Look Fong Ming came , almost before Wong See had finished slicking back her hair . " Can you fancy , " he cried out , " what has happened ? This swine of a waiter refuses to listen to reason . " " Yes , so I have heard , " replied Wong See , quietly . " What ? You ! Does gossip have a pass-key to your door ? " " No , " she replied insolently , " but laughter can float in at any window . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " cried Wong See . " You are not well . . . . Let us go out and sit in the sunlight . And then you can tell me more about this matter . So far , I have heard only the whisperings of envy . " So they went out together on the balcony seating themselves in the sun , and Look Fong Ming told his tale from beginning to end , omitting nothing , and when he had finishedWong See said between her teeth : " I can see the sunlight shining on the pewter covers of Ah Yok 's tray . He must be coming toward us . . . . Give me your pistol , Look Fong Ming , and then you will not be tempted . " But Look Fong Ming laughed and leaned far over the railing . Presently the figure of Ah Yok passed beneath , his lithe young body swaying insolently . " Bah ! " cried Look Fong Ming , " this is no place for my purpose ! What can one do to a man who screens his head with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a tempting hand , Look Fong Ming ! " whispered Wong See . " Mark its perfection ! See how it creeps over the tray 's dull edge . . . . I am curious to see the face of a man who has the courage to defy Look Fong Ming . . . . If the tray were scattered I should have my wish ! " " Well , " muttered Look Fong Ming , softly , " as you will ! " And , with that , he whipped out his pistol . " Quickly , Look Fong Ming , or he will be gone ! Even now his hand is in the shadow ! " Look Fong Ming took aim . . . . There came a flash , a clattering of falling dishes , two eyes raised in agony toward the balcony  --  a trail of dripping red upon the foot-worn pavement ! A whistle blew , followed by a hurrying of feet . And suddenlyeverything was calm again , as calm as a windless sea , with only a heap of broken dishes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . When the policemen arrived even Look Fong Ming had disappeared . Upon the balcony opening from an upper chamber the figure of a woman languidly stretched herself in the slanting sunlight , waving a sandalwood fan . And from her slender fingers fell a shower of spent camellia blossoms upon the blood-stained pavement below . The next day the fat men of the quarter laughed , holding their ample sides , and the lean ones sneered . But laughingp145or sneering the burden of their comment was the same . " What has come over Look Fong Ming , the perfect gunman  --  hewho was never known before to miss his mark ? Imagine , aiming for a heart and bagging nothing greater than a hand ! " Thus went the refrain up and down the street of the bazaars and in the market-place , until Look Fong Ming was sick to death of it . " Bah ! " he would cry , " what virtue is there in swift revenge ! May a man not play with his victim ? Wait , and watch me drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to decide that he has hidden long enough . " But on the second day when the rat ventured forth , tray poised upon his head , unsteadied by either a bandaged hand or a whole one , the counting-houses and the gambling clubs rocked with laughter . " It is you who have done this ! " Look Fong Ming said to Wong See . " If it had not been for your foolish whim I should have waited a convenient season . . . . But I must listen to a woman , and have myself made a mock of up and down the streets ! " " Well , " said Wong See , " why cry aloud further ? It seems your rat , as you call him , crawls into the open without beingsmoked out . Why stand upon my balcony looking down upon him ? You have but to drive him into a corner and the laughter of your enemies will cease . " " You are right , " he answered coldly . " And when I have settled with him I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something back of all this which I do not see . You are a clever woman , Wong See , and many men have danced to your piping . It is now high time you were repaid ! " And , with that , he took his gun from his pocket , polishing the barrel with a nonchalant finger , as he had done in the presence of Ah Yok . . . . Old Shoo Shee was still shivering when he was gone.  | " Come , thou old hag , " cried Wong See , " get me my lacquerbrush , and my inkstand of carved agate . For I have messages to write ! " Swiftly she covered a sheet of rice-paper with uneven symbols . And when the tray of Ah Yok passed empty beneath her window from the house of the worker of gold , she tossed a crumpled ball upon it . " What did you then ? " asked Shoo Shee between her chatteringgums . " I warned the simpleton to beware , and arm himself . We shall see whether he has wit enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me my blue jacket embroidered in butterflies and every jewel that I possess , for if I am not mistaken I shall have company tonight . . . . A man may withstand love , but loyalty is too strong for him ! " Toward midnight there came a knocking at the wicket . " Ah Yok is here , Shoo Shee ! " whispered Wong See , and she fell back upon her teakwood divan . But the old woman stood quaking in the center of the room . " What will my master say ? " she cried out . " He will kill us all , every one ! " " Nonsense ! " said Wong See . " Open the door , and have done with whimpering ! " But almost as they spoke there came a swift tramping up the stairs . . . shots . . . a cry or two . . . shuddering thuds in the passageway . After a long silence , Wong See raised herself upon her elbow . " Shoo Shee ! Shoo Shee ! . . . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and as many pistols spitting fire ! " Wong See lay motionless . " Ah , " she breathed , " both of them ! " And with that , she rose and sat down before her desk ,  |p147di|p|ping  her lacquered brush into the inkstand of carved jade . " Wong See , " whispered Shoo Shee in a frightened voice , " what do you now with such foolishness ? " " I but replenish my stock in trade , Shoo Shee . . . . Does not the seller of precious wares provide against the day of bartering ? There will be an hundred eyes turned upward toward my balcony tomorrow ! " Hearing this , Shoo Shee ceased her trembling and together they laughed slyly , in the fashion that all women laugh when there is no man to hear them.  | IN a rare spring morning , at a date when San Francisco 's Chinatown was still a thing of squalid beauty , Yat Chew , taking down the crimson shutters of his father 's fruit-stall , found his interest in his daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do with a woman would at once intrigue and trick you , especially if you had ever glimpsed Yat Chew ; for he was a well-favored youth , and your imagination would go out half-way to match his masculinecomeliness with equal feminine charms . To find his interest centered on such a woman as Shoo Shee , then , would be a trifle baffling . What was there arrestingto Yat Chew in the spectacle of a noseless old crone sittingupon an inverted tea-chest , in a somber doorway , puffingnonchalantly at a cigarette ? Could it be the remnants of a vanished grace , which clung to the shrunken figure , or the extraordinary insolence of her assumed indifference to life , or the competent way in which she blew clouds of smoke through the two holes in her face ? Or was it merely the fact that idleness on Shoo Shee 's part implied an unfathomable degree of roguery ? Yat Chew , arranging the mandarin orangesand plates of betel-nut in alternate rows , decided it was all these things , and more . Who of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of evoking a longing for piquant digressions from propriety ? He remembered well the first day he had seen her . His father , with a zeal for inculcating virtue , had pointed her out , saying , " Behold the fruits of iniquity . " But as a horrible example Shoo Shee had failed utterly . Herp149lack of both beauty and a nose had snared Yat Chew 's interestrather than his digust . He asked pointed questions , which his father answered with a far too admirable discretion . Who was this noseless female , where did she come from , and what was her calling ? Her name and birthplace were things of simplicity and directness , but her calling ! How was it possible for a prudent and venerable man properly to explain such a delicate circumstance to his son ? To say that Shoo Shee was a duenna was quite beside the mark ; that smacked too fulsomely of propriety . On the other hand , the term at the opposite end of the social scale was too baldly expressive . It was necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe flavor of Shoo Slice 's profession . And even then there were personal qualities that escaped definition . In the course of his knowledge of Shoo Shee , Yat Chew had known her to sit , as she sat this gilded morning , some half score of times in the dingy doorway and always with the same air of complete detachment . He had heard it rumored that she planted herself thus , in the path of an ebbing and flowing street-tide , as a testimonial to the fact that she was momentarilywithout a master . Whatever her object , he had observed that she rarely tarried long . A half-day usually sufficed for a public exhibition of her idleness . During that time she stood a veritable rock in a swirl of men that came and went without the strength to dislodge her . What magic finally swept her away was problematical . It might have been money or a sinisterpersuasion or mere caprice , singly or in combination , which decided her capitulation , for , if one could trust rumor , Shoo Shee was capable of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive appearance served to deepen her unholy fascination . Yat Chew , prosaically tending his open-air bazaar , under the watchful eye of his father , would feel in consequenceof Shoo Shee 's presence delightful and terrifying yearnings toward adventure . He looked forward to the dayp150when he might be in a position to bid for Shoo Shee 's services , though in what connection he was not too precise to determine . On this certain dew-starred morning in April the Fates seemed more than usually propitious for the accomplishment of the first step in his desires . His father had been detained at home in a domestic emergency ; Shoo Shee had been early to her post , and the knowledge of her presence had not yet turned the stream of masculine traffic in her direction . So much assured , what was the best avenue of approach ? By a curious trick of irony a fragment of wisdom from his father served his turn . " A man bearing gifts is doubly welcome ! " There remained , then , the precise expression of this maxim . Would Shoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her taste ? Or would lichi-nuts suitably dried be better ? Even as he pondered so momentous a question his glance traveled toward Shoo Shee , with her leg dangling at a rakish angle , topped by its flapping slipper of straw . She was rolling a cigarette between her crackled fingers . At once an inspirationseized him ; he hunted in an obscure corner of the cigarettecabinet and brought forth a fly-specked package . When or how or why a package of perfumed cigarettes with gold tips had found their way into his father 's stock had never been determined , but is there necessity for inquiring too closely into divine accidents ? Yat Chew at this particular moment was not concerned with origins ; he was young enough to take without question what the gods provided . But he was also young enough to be eager to cut an appropriatefigure . And somewhere in his make-up was an instinctivesense of fitness . So delicate a gift as he purposed was quite at odds with its shop-worn covering . He searched about for an appropriate container . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a little red lacquer box in which his father kept miraculous lozenges for the throat , and , dumping outp151its contents unceremoniously upon the shallow counter , he refilled it slowly , carefully , with the twelve gold-tipped delightsthat were to be Shoo Shee 's portion . Having tied the lid securely with a black-silk cord ravished from a fan , Yat Chew shook his ample sleeves down over his slender hands and crossed the street . " Flattery , " Yat Chew had often heard his father say , " is the keyhole to success . " Yet in the presence of Shoo Shee even so admirable an admonition seemed without profit . A close contact did nothing to improve his capacity for extravagant speech . But Yat Chew was too keyed to adventure to be totally cast down , so he began with as much grace as he could muster : " 0 ripening plum-branch of midsummer , why must you sit here devising your own delights when so humble a servant as I has that which will give you pleasure without labor ? " She gave a toothless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of red lacquer into her lap . " What nonsense have we here ? " she mumbled , loosening the silk cord . He drew back a little , watching the greedy curve of her mouth as she held up one of the cigarettes for critical inspection . " Who are you , " she demanded , " who comes thus , bearing gaudy pleasures to such a plucked old goose as myself ? Do you know how many summers have sped by since any gallant has seen fit to provide me with like vanities ? Come , you can not fool so seasoned a fowl . What purpose is behind so much pretense ? " She frowned darkly , but he saw that she was shaken with satisfaction , and he replied . truthfully : " There is no purpose , save to know and speak to wisdom . Shoo Shee is not a name to pass by with indifference . " She struck a match upon the sole of her upturned slipper and put the gilded cigarette between her shriveled gums.  | " You have the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  shebeamed ,  --  " but I am accustomed to more telling persuasions . Come , how much money is behind all this cajolery ? " " Money ? " he echoed , missing her intent . " Yes ; you are not so young as to imagine that love dances to no piping . I know a dozen twittering fledglings who would delight in the merest flutter of your eyelid , yet they are not without their price . And having captured them , you will still have their keeper to reckon with . I have my price also . " She gave a villainous chuckle , cocking her head sidewise , as she swept him with a lashless glance . " Only yesterday , " she went on , " the great Wo Lung came to me and said : Shoo Shee , what can you provide me in the way of novelty ? I am sick of all these Cantonese wrens , as drab as a morning in November . ' And I answered , by way of whetting the good man 's interest , What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained lukewarm , replying : That is a little far removed from my fancy . Still , if you can arrange a meeting , why  --  ' But at this I cut him short . If you can not trust my judgment , Wo Lung , let us say no more about it . But I can tell you this : five thousand dollars would be half as much as she is worth . And I would demand an equal sum for guarding her . There are too many greedy owls abroad , seeking for just such a nightingale as she . ' At this he pretended indifference , yet he answered : Make the sum three thousand , and I will chance it . As for your , guardianship , I have a worthy woman now who can keep the doors to a dozen cages securely fastened if need be . ' As you wish , ' replied I , but now you know my terms , suppose you either meet them or go your way . ' And at that he departed . But wait until he sees me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not bring him to my price by midday , why , I shall quit my profession or hire myself out top153another . " She threw back her head in a burst of obscene laughter . " What do you bid for my services  --  a penny or a bag of gold , little bearer of trifles to the aged ? " Yat Chew blushed furiously , but he was not to be caught unawares , so he replied with a curling smile that might have spelled either confidence or derision : " I have already staked my fortune . " He pointed to the box of red lacquer in her lap . " There it lies . " A flicker of admiration gleamed from old Shoo Shee at his ability to meet her banter half-way . She replaced the lid of the lacquered box , twisting the silken cord into place with her stiff fingers . " Good ! " she cried with assumed solemnity . " I shall remember that when old Wo Lung comes my way this morning . At least there is one man who covets my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sigh escape him . " Yes , but to very little purpose . What need has any man of Shoo Shee if he lacks both the cage and the linnet ? " She took the cigarette momentarily from her mouth , dismissinghim with a disdainful wave of her shriveled hand . " Well , as to that , " she answered , " one thing has been known to lead to another . " He returned to his stall to find his father in sour attendance . " Is it thus , in my absence , that you ally yourself with corruption ? " asked the old man , bitingly . " I am not one to inquire into the morals of a customer ! " replied the youth , tossing a piece of silver grandly into the till . His father narrowed his eyes , but retired to his bamboo stool with a grunt of satisfaction . Yat Chew took out a pinkand-greenplatter and piled sugared limes in a pyramid upon it . " A dancing-girl ! " he muttered , and at once the air seemedp154full of twinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can you tell me about Pieng-an ? Is it a province or a city or a mere fancy ? " " It is a place that can not concern you , " answered the old man , with stinging composure . Yat Chew gave his immaculate parent a sidelong glance . What delectable memories lay back of so decisive an evasion ? A dancing-girl from Pieng-an . The phrase hammered itself into Yat Chew 's brain , gaining force as usual from his father 's obvious discretion . At this point a customer intruded , a fullbloodedmale with a suspicious taste in candied melon-rind and sugared strips of ginger . Ordinarily , this would have meant nothing , but now Yat Chew smiled knowingly to himself , and he said in an undertone : " Is the lady by any chance from Pieng-an ? " The man started back darkly . " Do you take me for a Korean dog ? " he muttered between his teeth . Korean ! At least he had learned one of the secrets of Pieng-an ! No wonder the conservative Wo Lung had demurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But youth was not so prejudiced . A dancing-girl from Pieng-an ! There was something pungent in the mere anticipation . As for Shoo Shee , the stream of males was already tricklingtoward her , not either to her profit or theirs , it seemed to Yat Chew . His father dozed in the genial sunlight , so that Yat Chew 's interest in the other side of the street grew more and more unveiled . Toward noon , the ponderous Wo Lung came , greasy and loose-lipped , followed at a discreet distance by his two gunmen . At this point , Yat Chew 's father , waking from a final doze , rose and went home . Unhampered now by so much as a drowsing presence , Yat Chew watched the duel between Shoo Shee and her grudging patron with despairing interest . What would the outcome profit him in any event ? A stripling of the fruit-stalls could not even touch vicariouslyp155a circumstance within the reach of so opulent a merchant as Wo Lung . Even in pantomime the procedure proved a marvel of indirection . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy Wo Lung delivered himself of a gestureless harangue . In the end Shoo Shee shrugged , blowing two insolentclouds of smoke through the holes in her face , and Wo Lung , in an obviously apoplectic calm , turned on his flapping heels , and left . Shoo Shee gathered herself together with a certain senile grace and picked her way across the street . Yat Chew 's pulses quickened . He met her at the curb . " Master , I salute you ! " Shoo Shee said demurely , bending her warped back still farther . Yat Chew stiffened with the distaste of youth for mockery . " Why must you single me out for your shafts of derision ? " he asked coldly . " Derision ? " she echoed . " Did we not make a bargain this morning ? Well , the estimable Wo Lung has not met my figure . " " But certainly there were others . " " They were not to my taste . " " But I have no money . " " You said as much this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is that without remedy ? " " I have no room in which to lodge you . " " Are there no lodgings for rent ? " " You can not be serious . " " No ? Well , as to that , let me tell you one thing . When tonightyou put up the shutters of your stall , see to it that you are ready to receive me . For Shoo Shee is not accustomed to trifling . Do you imagine that I pick you out of half a hundred bidders for my services for the purpose of being waved aside ? " She withdrew the red lacquered box from herp156ample sleeve . " This , " she said , " is a testimony between us . If so likely a gallant as you can not play a game of chance , why , then , things have come to a pretty pass . " Yat Chew drew himself up proudly . " I but warned you , " he said . " Since you know every term of the bargain , there remains nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied she , " is more like it . At what time do you put up the shutters of your stall ? " " At ten o'clock , " he answered , bowing . " Good ! I shall be here at that hour . " She left without another word . He watched her melt into the writhing crowd . Could it be that she was serious ? In spite of his youth and the buoyant spring day and the prospect of a rare adventure , Yat Chew fell to shivering with apprehension . Shoo Shee was laughing at him ; of that he felt certain . But her laughter was of no great moment ; what he feared was the laughter of the market-place when the tale became a byword of the gambling-clubs . For the conviction grew that Shoo Shee would have the courage of her sportiveness , and cover him with confusion by presenting herself in all solemnity at the appointed hour . Even now he could hear the covert merriment of the crowds that would pass his stall , whispering as they went : " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yat Chew , who thought to buy the services of the great Shoo Shee with a dozen gilded cigarettes . And fancy ! He had naught for her to guard and not even a shelter for her head ! Truly his wits must be either dulled or addled ! " But , withal , there were moments when Yat Chew felt a ruffling satisfaction at having been singled out for so much as the ridicule of Shoo Shee . To have snared even a questionableinterest was something . If he could turn the old trot 's barbs back upon herself , he felt that his fortune would be mysteriously made . He was soaring aloft on some such mood when a voice broke in upon his flight ; he looked up , to find ap157thin-visaged , sardonic-looking person standing before him . " I am searching , " said the man , " for a noseless old crone named Shoo Shee . I have been told that she is to be found somewhere in this neighborhood . " " Only this morning , " Yat Chew replied , " she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having accomplishedher purpose , she left within the hour . " " You mean that she had secured a new master ? " Yat Chew smiled inwardly . " If you can trust her own report . " " Did you learn his name ? " A fantastic whim seized Yat Chew . " Assuredly . Her new master proves to be none other than myself . " The stranger drew back . " You ! " he cried . Yat Chew felt ruffled . " Well , and why not ? " Instead of replying , the man gave a stiff bow . Yat Chew , mollified at this silent flattery , went on , saying : " I do not wonder you are surprised . The truth is , my good fortune has taken me quite unawares . " He gave a nonchalantlaugh . " In fact , I am so surprised that at this moment I find myself without even quarters for my new condition . " " Well , " broke in the stranger , with a cold smile , " I should say that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing Shoo Shee had to do with the letting of a lodging . " Yat Chew rallied before this unexpected circumstance with a burst of fine disdain . " You must understand at once , " he demurred , " that my desire is not just for any lodging . That I wish for something suitable goes without saying . " The stranger shrugged . " I am ready to guarantee the finest chambers this side of Canton . "  | " But the difficulty is , " explained Yat Chew , falling back upon the next defense , " that I must have immediate possession . " Nothing could be easier , " his new and disturbingly obligingfriend returned . " I leave the city within the hour . " " But can you not see , " Yat Chew protested , " that an hour provides scant time for inspection ? It would be impossible for me to leave my stall unattended at this moment . " The stranger remained unruffled . " As to that , it will be necessary only for me to describe the delights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms are three in number . They set well back from the street , so you may be unafraid of intrusion . The main room is lofty , hung with dull green satin , embroidered in gold thread . The furniture is ebony cunningly inlaid with motherof-pearl . There are porcelains , of course , but of these I shall say nothing beyond the fact that even a barbarian would realize their worth . Shall I go into further details ? " Yat Chew put up a protesting hand , at the same time wondering how to extricate himself with dignity . " You might name your price . " The other mentioned a staggering sum , and Yat Chew repliedcalmly : " Your terms are almost suspiciously reasonable , my good sir . Yet how can even such a trifling sum be placed at your disposal within a short hour ? " " That , " said the man , warmly , " is of not the slightest im-portance . " " Do you mean , " gasped Yat Chew , " that you would leave a stranger in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any guaranty of good faith ? What do you know about either my integrity or my resources ? " The stranger gave a sweeping bow . " Your integrity shines through your countenance , and asp159for your resources , a man who can command the services of Shoo Shee needs no other report . " Yat Chew returned the bow . His last defense was gone , and with the composure of a man facing the inevitable , he replied : " As you please . Since you are determined to be incautious , let us say no more . " The stranger drew a key from his pocket and placed it in Yat Chew 's palm . " This seals the bargain . If you will give me your name , I shall instruct you later how to reach me . It is unfortunate for me that I must be off so soon . If such was not the case , I should take profound pleasure in welcoming you to your new quarters ; for I am curious to glimpse the bird of bright plumage which the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of youth always intrigues my interest . Did you say she was a Cantonese lily ? " Yat Chew shook his head . " A dancing-girl from Pieng-an . " The stranger moistened his lips . " I see I am in the presence of a connoisseur , " he returned , bowing again . But this time Yat Chew remained in an attitude of lofty and unbending condescension . With the departure of his questionable benefactor , Yat Chew shivered in sudden panic . The name which the man had left was not reassuring . What person living had not heard of Yee Sing , gambler , gunman , rake ? Shoo Shee was a simple matter compared to this fresh complication . It was easy to say , " Return the key with any explanation that seems fitting . " That might serve among pot-bellied tradesmen , but men who had dashing codes and spitting weapons to enforce them were quite another matter . Yat Chew knew enough of life to guess that one did not trifle with such as Yee Sing . And hard uponp160the heels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion with incredible swiftness , rendering the position of Yat Chew more and more inevitable and precarious . Suddenlythe sereneness of the April afternoon was tremulous with lascivious tattle . Could it be true that Yat Chew , a mere fruit-stall tender , had bargained with Shoo Shee for a certain lady of superlative talents and hired the chambers of the intrepid Yee Sing as well ? The gossip came even to the ears of Yat Chew 's venerable and irreproachable parent . " What nonsense is all this ? " he demanded . Yat Chew rose to the occasion upon the wings of a desperate courage . " Am I a child , that one can believe me incapable of hazard ? " he threw back loftily . His father 's only answer was a devastating grunt . So the afternoon wore on , with rumors darting and swirlinglike vagrant leaves , until the night fell , and the hour for putting up the red shutters of the fruit-stalls drew close . " What if Shoo Shee does not come ? " thought Yat Chew . He was divided between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something thrillingin the anticipation of leading her in triumph to the satinlinedchambers of Yee Sing . He had about given up hope when he saw her climbing the hill . His father was dozing upon his seat of bamboo . She came close , and the old man awoke with a start . Yat Chew 's heart was pounding , but he drew himself up to his full height . " It is well you came within the appointed time , Shoo Shee , " he said severely , " for if there is one thing above all else that I will not tolerate , it is tardiness in those who serve me . " She gave him a glance , behind which hid a thousand merriments , and she answered with proper humility : " Have I not trotted all the way to be beforehand ? Indeed ,  |p161your  temper is known to every one . It is said "  --  and here she made an obeisance to the old man , who had risen  --  " that in this you resemble your illustrious father ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a reverence , " that my inherited virtues do not stop there . " " Nay , " replied Shoo Shee ; " if we may believe all we hear , in his day he had as discriminating an eye for beauty as a certainyoung man whom I have now the honor to serve . " The old man stared , speechless , midway between incredulity and a dazed satisfaction . Yat Chew , seizing the moment as propitious for departure , announced grandly to Shoo Shee : " Doubtless you have heard of my good fortune . I have at great pains and expense been able to succeed to the lodgings of Yee Sing . Be good enough to follow me thither , at a discreetand respectful distance . " For a moment Shoo Shee 's eyes were lit with a veiled surprise , but , recovering herself , she answered mockingly : " Shall I not go and fetch the lady first ? " " You will do as I command you ! " replied Yat Chew , glowering down from his assumed dignity . Without another word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by the bent figure of Shoo Shee . After the dank , slippery stairway leading toward the chambers of Yee Sing , their green-and-gold splendor was overwhelming . And , as if this were not enough , every domesticdetail was in readiness , as if bargained for in advance . Smoked ducks , flattened to a genteel nicety , hung against the kitchen wall ; a tray of soy-bean cakes lay upon the table ; and freshly sprinkled shoots of wild mustard drained into the sink . A distinct , yet subtle , perfume hung over everything  --  theperfume of a gaudy presence that within the half-day had flitted through the somber gloom like a flashing bird in a jungle . A rouge-pot , opened , was before the mirror , and in a little box near it reposed every other aid to beauty ,  |p162which  is a woman 's prerogative . Something profoundly movingand melancholy settled down upon Yat Chew ; he was filled with faint , but disturbed , longings . Shoo Shee cast an incurious glance over everything , and announced emphat-ically : " The worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who , I wonder , among the gallants is polishing his gun to no purpose , with the game escaped ? " Her words recalled Yat Chew from his soft musings ; the air grew suddenly thick with intrigue . He threw himself upon an ebony divan pillowed with cushions of bright blue shot with yellow . Shoo Shee arranged his water-pipe and teacups , shaped like morning-glories , on a low stool before him . " Illustrious Yat Chew , " she purred between her evil gums , " There is but one thing lacking . Is it your supreme pleasure that I provide you with this missing delight ? " He reached for the pipe with leisurely dignity . " What price did you name ? " he inquired innocently . " I have no memory for such trifles . " She bowed lower to hide the smile of amusement cracking her shriveled face . " Five thousand dollars if you are prompt ; otherwise  --  " She finished by touching her head upon the floor . He blew reflective smoke rings upward . " I am not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has never been described . A dancing-girl from Pieng-an means nothing to me . " Shoo Shee lifted her wizened haunches and stretched herselfinto an easy attitude before him . " Ah ! " she cried , " this dancing-girl from Pieng-an ! If you had but seen her ! Slender and straight , like a tender shoot of bamboo . Her eyes are two moonstone pools , and her lips are as red as the silken tassel on a mandarin 's cap . When she walks , there is a rustle like the south wind , and countlessp163perfumes fill the air . Give her a fan , and she will divert you with a thousand gestures , or , lacking so much as this trifle , she has fifty postures for your edification . She can dart like a swallow in swift flight or rest with the grace of a caged dove . She can even sing , and upon a two-stringed instrument she can beguile you from any grief . Can I say more ? " Yat Chew leaned dreamily forward as if to catch a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could but see her ! " he breathed . " Is it not possible , O worthy tender of nightingales , to bring her to me , that I might ponder her worth ? I am not Wo Lung , to whom a money-bag or two means naught . " " Nay ! " cried Shoo Shee in sudden and vehement scorn , " but , like that greasy-browed son of evil , you are a shopkeeper ! And were I a goodly youth like you , I should say , Shoo Shee , bring her to me , and if I like , I shall have her for whatever I will . But if she falls by one eyelash beneath your description , you shall hear from me . ' It is thus that gallantstalk . " A smoldering flame of anger darted from Yat Chew 's eyes . " Was I a gallant when I won thy services , thou shriveled hag ? And hired I these rooms at the pistol 's point ? Nay , as a shopkeeper I came by them , and as a shopkeeper I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now fetch her here within a half-hour or thy old bones shall suffer ! " Shoo Shee concealed her smile beneath a cupped hand . She rose , tottering unsteadily . " As you will , illustrious master , " she answered . And saying this , she withdrew . Yat Chew leaned back upon the blue and yellow cushions , closing his eyes . He wondered whether he would wake presentlyto find that he had been dreaming ; in a half-truce with consciousness he lay without moving while a vagrant figure with eyes like two moonstone pools and lips as red as the silken tassel on a mandarin 's cap made a thousand gestures with a fan . He was roused by a violent knocking at the wicket . " Surely this can not be Shoo Shee ! " he muttered , a swift fear clutching him . He rose and peered out upon two shadowy forms , standing with averted faces . " Is Yat Chew within ? " he heard one say in answer to his query . " He stands before you , " he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well , " replied the speaker . " Our master , Wo Lung , waits below . He would speak with you . " " Let him come up , " answered Yat Chew , releasing the latch . He heard the asthmatic wheezing of Wo Lung drifting up the dank corridor . Presently there was a soft stumble and a smothered exclamation . Yat Chew crept to the head of the stairs . " Is there anything amiss ? " he called out cautiously . He heard the stifled voice of old Wo Lung float toward him . " Naught save this abominable stairway . " There was anotherstumbling sound , and , putting out his hand , Yat Chew drew Wo Lung 's ponderous bulk upward to the landing . " One would think , " cried the old man , " that these steps had been designed for the undoing of enemies instead of for the welcome of a friend . " Yat Chew bowed low . " That , " replied he , " is as the gods shall shape it . " He raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffy eyes twinkling in the gas-light , and at once these words that had been naught save idle banter became flecked with prophecy . He concealed his slight start of realization in a sweeping gesture of greeting.  |p165The  great Wo Lung moved haughtily past him , followed by his two faithful and sinister gunmen . " I am a man of affairs , " began the great Wo Lung , without even the grace to seat himself , " and I have scant time to waste on preliminaries . No doubt you have guessed the reason for this errand . " Yat Chew , dropping languidly upon his yellow cushions , drew a silken coverlet about his shapely thighs . He inclined his head toward the two guards standing at the back and a little to one side of their master . " Does a man bring gunpowder to a love-feast ? " he parried significantly . Wo Lung met the challenge squarely . " You may retire to the threshold , " he commanded , turning to his henchmen . They moved swiftly away . " Does peace keep violence within ear-shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolence . He saw a flicker of indecision on Wo Lung 's pasty face , and he went on with a sneer : " Truly , for a man of courage , you take unseemly precautions . You are like a fox-hunter turning your pack upon a hutch-bred hare . " Wo Lung took in a dull breath . " Wait below ! " he called out thickly . The echoes of four stealthy feet , slipping down into the street , broke a profound stillness . Wo Lung continued to stand . " Were I not a patient and generous man , " he began , " I should scarcely waste my time upon such an errand as I find myself on tonight . And were you older , I should let your own imprudence undo you . Since when has it become the fashion for a stripling of the fruit-stalls to cross swords with prestige and authority ? If you think to make me the laughingstockof the gambling-clubs , you have missed your mark . I am a man of peace , but I have facilities for conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blandly . " They wait below , do they not ? " Wo Lung smiled as he made answer : " Precisely . Yet I shall not recourse to violence until I must . What is your price ? " " My price ? " echoed Yat Chew , with maddening incredulity . " I am not aware that I have anything for sale . " A note of livid anger passed over Wo Lung . " You have a dancing-girl from Pieng-an , if report speaks truly . " " Ah ! So ! You have been misinformed , my worthy Wo Lung ! " " You mean that this dancing-girl from Pieng-an is  --  " " I mean she is not for sale . Still , since you have put yourself to so much trouble , it might be interesting to learn what you think this bird of passage is worth . A man of prudence will always give ear to a proper offer , even though he does not invite it . " " This morning , " replied Wo Lung , " her price was five thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yat Chew drew back , affronted . " Oh , my good sir , what can you think of me ! For so scant an advantage to give up this creature who is trained to divert a man with a thousand gestures of the fan ? " Wo Lung frowned . " Well , twice five hundred , then . " " A thousand extra for a maiden who knows fifty edifyingpostures ! Incredible ! " " Fifteen hundred . " " But , illustrious sire , you do not understand . This bird of paradise can even sing , and upon a two-stringed instrument she can beguile you from any grief . " " Two thousand . " " Ah , assuredly you do not know her qualities . When shep167walks there is a rustle like the south wind , and countless perfumesfill the air ! " Wo Lung remained darkly silent . " She is slender and straight like a tender shoot of bamboo . Her eyes are two moonstone pools , and her lips are as red as the silken tassel on a mandarin 's cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two thousand , five hundred , " he breathed . Yat Chew stood up . " Double the figure , and she is yours ! " " Do you fancy me mad ? " cried Wo Lung , his fat hands twitching at his sides . " Remember , money is not my only resource . " Yat Chew drew back as if to give his words a better aim . " Think you , " he sneered , " that a man who is the friend of so valiant a gunman as Yee Sing is altogether defenseless ? " A sudden pallor blanched Wo Lung 's cheeks ; the noise of pattering feet drifted through the wicket . The old man stiffenedlike one trapped . " Pray do not alarm yourself , " said Yat Chew . " ' T is Shoo Shee returning with the lady in question . " At that the door opened , and Shoo Shee stepped inside , followed by the dancing-girl of Pieng-an . The four stood in a tense moment of surprised silence , and presently the dry voice of Wo Lung broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chew put his hand to his eyes , for at that moment he felt the green and gold walls whirling about him . When he opened his eyes again , the dancing-girl from Pieng-an was drooping at his feet like a lily at the noondayglance of the sun . In her hair a wreath of silken flowers was held in place by pins of gold cunningly inlaid with kingfisherfeathers . Her jacket was blue , matching the frozen azure of her ornaments , and her glistening trousers faded from lavender to silver.  |p168He  bent down and lifted her up. " 0 beautiful one ! " he breathed . She hid her face in a silken kerchief of apple-green . " And thou , too , " she murmured . At this the voice of Wo Lung came drifting toward them like a cold vapor from the rice-fields . " Yat Chew , will you count that which I have laid upon your table ? I am impatient to be gone and take this daughter of ten thousand delights with me . " The dancing-girl from Pieng-an touched her forehead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had an impulse to lift her tenderly again , but the greasy smile of Wo Lung steeled him to a cruel discretion . He stepped violently out of his gentle imprisonment , thrusting her farther aside with a contemptuous foot . She lay prone and quivering . Yat Chew walked over to the table : A roll of crisp banknotesrustled upon it , and Wo Lung was fastening a depleted pouch upon his silken girdle . Yat Chew counted out the money with a cold curve of his lip , but he could feel his hands trembling . " Ten thousand ! " he cried mirthlessly . " For double the price you could not match her ! Nay , not in the whole world ! " The heavy jowls of Wo Lung became taut with satisfaction . " It was you who set the price ! " he observed drily . The figure of Shoo Shee thrust itself between them . " Remember , " she said , " I go with the lady , and I have myprice , too . " Wo Lung bent obesely forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 0 purveyor of indescribable sweetmeats , " he drooled . " Only make haste , and follow me . What I have paid for awaits delivery . " Yat Chew divided the sheaf of bank-notes into two exact piles . He handed one to Shoo Shee.  | " The score is settled between us , is it not , little mother of tranquillity ? " She gave him a covetous glance as he thrust the remaining plunder in the lining of his jacket . Yet her voice was bland , as the voice of one who had been outwitted fairly , as she said : " Did you fancy that Shoo Shee was one to deny a bar-gain ? " Wo Lung stirred with sluggish impatience . " Is further delay necessary ? " he demanded . " I would departat once , taking with me what I have purchased . " Shoo Shee roused the prostrate form upon the floor with a vicious prod ; the dancing-girl from Pieng-an rose , weeping . Yat Chew stood upright , clenching his fist . Wo Lung made a movement toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yat Chew , " permitme to escort you hence ! " Wo Lung turned two eyes green with suspicion upon Yat Chew . " Put yourself to no such trouble . My men wait be-low . " " Ah , but it is the stairway that is dangerous , worthy sir . Did you not stumble twice as you ascended ? " Wo Lung 's smile was wide with malice . " Being warned , my descent shall be cautious . Besides , have I not Shoo Shee to serve me ? " A glint of sardonic humor leaped into the eyes of Shoo Shee . " Aye , " she purred , " trust me to serve thee as thou deservest , 0 ponderous chief of the market-place ! " In answer Wo Lung turned like a huge snail to the doorway , beckoning Shoo Shee to follow . " If I were but a gallant ! " thought Yat Chew , bitterly . " If I were but a gallant and had a pistol ! " He took a threatening step forward . Shoo Shee halted him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment to see the dancing-girl from Pieng-an follow her jailers into the gloom of the corridor . But , instead , she stood like a silver pheasant arrested in its flight , and the ornamentsin her hair , flecked with the sky-blue of the kingfisher , shook tremulously . Yat Chew grew rigid , afraid to trust his senses  --  afraid that , were he to move , the vision might dissolve . Suddenly she lifted her fluttering hand , veiled in the silken sheen of her apple-green kerchief , as she commanded sharply : " Listen ! " A thud shakes the room , another , a score , quick reverberationsas of a gigantic ball striking obstructions in its downwardflight . Above the tumult the shriek of Shoo Shee calling out in deceitful terror , pattering of cautious feet on the pavements , the voices of Wo Lung 's gunmen shrill with panic and surprise , a police whistle , the silence of death . Can it be that the feet of sluggishness have been so swiftly and efficiently guided down the steps of destruction ? A door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her one would scarcely fancy that she had the strength to fling a starving kitten from curb to gutter . She slips in , closingthe door ; smoke is pouring from the two holes in her face . " He who climbs a dangerous stairway , " she says calmly , " must likewise descend by it . " Yat Chew releases a pent breath as he moves swiftly toward his happiness , saying : " Thou art a still pool of delight , in which the sky hath smiled . Thou art the dawn robbed of its chill . Thou art a budding plum-tree , waiting for the ravishment of the bees ! " As in a dream , the answer comes : " Thou art a red flame of tulips among the pale moonflowers , thou art the east wind , searching out the perfumes of the garden , thou art the midday sun drawing up the mists of morning . "  |p171A  sigh rises even from the withered bosom of the villainous Shoo Shee . " Thus , " she says , chuckling , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always . "  | THE widow of Hung Gow was marketing at the hour when the fleet foot of evil news overtook her house . She had gone to her task light-heartedly , thinking how best to please her fastidious son . All day she had been pondering his gastronomic preferences . Would he find a smoked duck to his taste or a bit of crisply roasted pork ? Or might a handful of dried shrimps content him ? Ah , these men ! she had thought , what sources of genial worries they were ! Who ever heard of disturbing one 's mind over a daughter 's fare ? Assuredly , it was scant satisfaction to serve food of any kind to a woman , to sit and watch her pick at her rice like a disconsolate sparrow , reserving her greatest enthusiasm at some unappointed season for a bag of melon-seed or a shred of preserved ginger . She , with three daughters , did she not know ? But to minister to the appetite of a male  --  ah , that was different ! Even his disgusts were lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bride , how she had thrilled to her husband'smeal-time ardors ! For Hung Gow , in his day , had been as lusty a diner as any gunman in all the length and breadth of San Francisco 's Chinatown . And he had lived lustily , too , in the end paying the price of certain philandering deviltries with his life  --  a pointless enough matter beside the fact that he had been to his wife , Wan Lee , not only a male , but a male worth feeding . Which made her loss the greater at his untimelytaking off and , by the same token , her pleasure and anxiety in her son 's desires the more profound . Happily for her , she thought , this son of hers was more the connoisseur and less the gormandizer . That he ate gravely andp173without haste was to Wan Lee a circumstance by no means as unsatisfying as it seemed . Thus , she argued , would he live  --  calmly , discriminatingly , moderately  --  to a ripe old age , blessingher with many grandchildren , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . However , she had a suspicion that her husband , had he lived , would have found little satisfaction in the studious decorumof his son , in his distaste for gunplay , in his pronouncedcontempt for all melodramatic flourishes . But , to repeat , all this filled the matronly Wan Lee with a large content . Effect , to her simple reasoning , bore a close relation to cause : Did one gather nettles from plum-boughs ? Then could violence spring from tranquillity ? As with us all , the wish was father to the thought ; and Wan Lee , being passionate to have her son , built up a solid wall of reasoning for his preservation . In short , she wrapped herself so tightly in her security that she drew the attention of the gods to her condition . And , looking at her , they laughed , which brings us the more speedilyto our tale . It was just the day for marketing  --  a February day with a crisp warmth wherever the gilded sunshine fell , but harboringshadows too cool for loitering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the choicest of wares on display , and everywhere the contagion of holiday bartering . Overnight , street-stalls had popped up like gigantic and gaudy mushrooms , sheltering seed-cakes and almond-blossoms and sugar-cane . Wan Lee passed by all this allure with incurious intolerance : Such trifling commodities might beguile a daughter , but scarcely a son . Therefore she made straightway for the markets , stocked to overflowing with more robust fare . She explored a fish-shop first , but found nothing that intriguedher , except a devil-fish , which proved quite out of reach of her purse . Smoked duck was equally an extravagance , thanks to the holiday demand , and dried shrimps of poor quality . But in the meat-stall of Yoke Moy she came upon such a crisp and freshly roasted pig , . strung up by his hind quarters for speedy dismemberment , that she threw all thrift to the wind and demanded of Yoke Moy himself the choicest cut possible . Yoke Moy , reaching for his cleaver , smiled blandly : " The choicest cut ! " he echoed . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sell brings a fair price ? " To which she replied vigorously : " Think you that I have lived to my age without knowledge ? The widow of Hung Gow is no twittering fledgling . " He poised the wide blade in midair , his almond eyes enlargingever so slightly . " The widow of Hung Gow ! " he repeated . " You have a son , have you not ? " She drew in a breath of pride . " For whom else do I purchasethe choicest morsel your shop affords ? I have a son in sooth , and if the gods be kind I shall continue to have him until my days are accomplished . " Yoke Moy looked away , intent upon the pig 's quartering . " This son of yours  --  is he a Suey Sing ? " " As his father was before him . " " A hazardous affiliation , " ventured Yoke Moy , " from all reports . " " By what token ? " " Have you so soon forgotten your own widowhood ? " " Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless mold . His son is of a more even temper . He is a youth of dignity . He goes not to extravagant lengths to provoke en-counters . " Yoke Moy continued to cut with vigorous strokes . " I have yet to learn that a timorous hare gains the consideration of foxes because of its gentleness . " Two spots red with indignation burned upon Wan Lee'sP175cheeks . " The son of Hung Gow has naught in keeping with cowardice , " she flared . " So much the worse , " replied Yoke Moy . Saying which he lapsed into a cryptic and soul-chilling silence . Coming out from Yoke Moy 's shop into the slanting sunlight , Wan Lee found the street curiously emptied of its holiday throng . Ten minutes before , what had been a scene of cheerful barter was now a dreary prospect , with here and there a few belated souls scurrying to cover . Even the keepersof the street-stalls were clearing their counters of blossomsand sweetmeats . Wan Lee , casting about for an explanation of this untoward change , lifted her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed its placid blueness . Obviously , then , the weather was in nowise responsible for this abrupt inanimation . Almost as her mind fluttered toward an alternative , she saw a squad of blue-coated policemen swing into view . Further speculation was useless : Wan Lee had lived through too many such situations to misread the signs . A sick fear , born of successiveand cumulative experiences , crowded her erstwhile serenity , and a vivid remembrance of the day which had accomplishedher widowhood flashed over her . It was thus on that day that the streets had been as suddenlycleared and as suddenly echoing with the tread of alien enforcers of the law . Not that a yellow carcass or two matteredto these white devils , but stray bullets , in their flight toward clan adjustments , had been known to wing , unwittingly , those of paler races and more anemic procedures . A wholesome scorn at the futility of these barbarians lifted her above her momentary depression . She recalled clearly how the quarter had swarmed with police after Hung Gow 's death ; even in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evidence of her husband 's importance . Yet , with allP176the law 's vigilance , eight lives had been snuffed out before the bloody war between the Suey Sings and the See Yups had been halted . She was wondering what tongs had lined up for battle today and whether a toll of life already had been taken when she saw the figure of the noseless Shoo Shee pushingtoward her . Ordinarily , so worthy a matron as Wan Lee would have scorned a curbstone encounter with such an infamous old trot , but in this instance curiosity rose above respectability . Who could gainsay this venerable hag 's capabilities in the direction of the latest news of brothel and gambling-house , and , by this same token , an authority on the mainsprings of most masculine animosities ? Thus it was that Wan Lee met the villainous Shoo Shee 's smile of greeting more than halfwayas she halted , saying : " It seems that there is naught but shuffling old women abroad . Can it be that the men have lost all taste for adven-ture ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her usual smile of derision was missing as she answered : " Surely one so concerned as yourself must by this time have heard the reason for so much scurrying to cover ; within the hour the Suey Sings and the See Yups have opened fire . " Wan Lee stilled the swift beating of her heart with a show of scorn . " That circumstance , " she made reply , " is as far removed from my concern as any I shall ever know . " " And yet , " said Shoo Shee , " your husband was a Suey Sing . " " To my sorrow . " Shoo Shee took in a fluttering breath . " And your son ? " Wan Lee felt stirred with an irrational resentment , and the identical defense that had answered a like challenge less than ten minutes before leaped to her lips : " My son 's ways are not the ways of his illustrious father . He is well schooled in tranquillity . "   " Which , " replied Shoo Shee sagely , " is as thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee felt herself trembling with a mixture of anger and fear . Why had she thus bared herself to the shafts of derision ? It was more fitting that she should be about her business of providing delight for her son than listening to his belittlement . Yet a certain pride held her to this chance encounter and she asked as calmly as she could : " Know you the cause of this fresh outbreak ? " Shoo Shee covered the wideness of her smile with a cupped hand . " The usual cause  --  a woman ! " " A bird of brilliant plumage ? " " None other than the distracting Yat Gee , for whom alreadyfive men have died . If rumor speaks truly , she was stolen from her master under cover of last night 's dark-ness . " " As I thought ! " replied Wan Lee bitterly . " It is for such empty-headed dolls that we wives are widowed ! And has toll been taken ? " " Aye , a Suey Sing has already answered for the theft of Yat Gee  --  a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abductionas the mother he leaves bereft . " Wan Lee felt her palms grow suddenly moist . " A young man , said you ? " " A young man . " " Who leaves a mother bereft ? " " Who leaves a mother bereft . " Wan Lee put out a hand to steady herself . " Heard you his name ? " " It has escaped me . But I knew his father before him . " Shoo Shee paused , and her cracked voice softened . " A youth , according to report , well schooled in tranquillity . " A blinding flash of realization swept Wan Lee . She could feel her eyelids fluttering as she drew back from Shoo Shee's instinctive gesture of commiseration . " Nay ! " she cried . ' " Do not touch me ! " Shoo Shee recoiled like one struck . " Think you , " she shrilled , " that , lacking thy honor , I am less a woman ? Compassionis not of necessity the hand-maiden of virtue . Come , let me lead you to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , Shoo Shee . Only be quick ! " Shoo Shee sprang forward eagerly , encircling Wan Lee with her thin , spent arms , and thus came the widow of the illustrious Hung Gow tottering to the threshold of sorrow . There were those who said that no woman within their knowledge ever had borne grief as lightly as Wan Lee . Outwardly , not even the serenity of her market hour seemed in the least ruffled by the murder of her son . But if this unnatural placidity occasioned remark , what could one say for her strange and sudden friendship with such a shriveled daughter of iniquity as old Shoo Shee ? It was not enough to meet the impious old trot among the bazaar , scandalizing the circumspect with their intimacy , but every night , at the appointed time , the cautious tapping of Shoo Shee came at the wicket , sending the three chaste daughters of Wan Lee scampering from the path of impropriety . To any who might have listened to the conversation which ensued , the secret of this strange association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shee bring gossip from the covert streams of life which could undermine what or whom it would ? And Wan Lee 's breast was filled with a vaguely destructive urge as she contemplated the unrevenged havoc which the gods had wrought for her undoing . Assuredly , justice moved slowly in these latter days . Within twelve hours , as she remembered , her husband 's murder had been met with equal violence , while now three days had passedP179without so much as a finger lifted in the defense of her household'shonor . " Were there no males in the mighty See Yup Tong worthy of sacrifice ? " she asked Shoo Shee repeatedly , with some show of scorn . Shoo Shee 's replies were not altogetherreassuring : from the meeting-room of the tongs came tales of difficulties , indecisions , differences of opinion . But underneath this discouraging information lurked a measure of reassurance . Many a word , dropped in the chamberof some gaudy daughter of delight or over the fan-tan table , could outmatch any official bulletin in prophecy . And Shoo Shee , with her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumblings filled with portent . If her ears did not deceive her , the storm would gain violence by very virtue of this prolonged calm . Thus for three days ran the burden of Shoo Shee 's encouragement , and on the fourth evening she came breathless to the door of Wan Lee with confirmation . " The man who must pay the penalty for the murder of your son has been picked , 0 worthy mother of three daugh-ters ! " Wan Lee simulated a dignified calm . " Why , then , do you not name him ? " she asked coldly . " Because my breath was for the moment spent with the haste of bringing such joyous news to you . Before the week is out the honor of your husband 's house will be satisfied . The name of him who has been chosen is none other than On Yick , the son of On Wo Low . What think you of the choice ? " Wan Lee stiffened with importance . " I think it could not be matched within a hundred miles of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my husband 's tong , I should send back word saying : Of a truth , the humble Wan Lee is this day honored above all women ! ' " That night , sitting upon her balcony opening from her sleeping-chamber , she saw this On Yick pass swiftly , and herP180satisfaction grew : A tall , upstanding youth , who almost equaled this son of hers offered up on the altar of a clan feud . A youth , if memory served her , who in his boyhood had romped with her first-born in childish amity up and down the cobbled streets . She felt no personal hatred , but she was schooled in matchingsuffering with suffering . Had not this On Yick a mother ? Let her feel the lash of bereavement . And , besides , what woman , being human , could have gainsaid the honor of having so mighty a family chosen to wipe out the memory of the See Yups ' last insolence ? For On Wo Low was their most distinguished member , and by the same token his firstborna fruitful branch ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee smiled when she thought of her  --  a woman with lily feet mincing between her daughters-in-law , a woman of circumstance , a woman of caste , a woman to be envied , and , yet , a woman as vulnerable to sorrow as the humble widow of the intrepid Hung Gow . Is it to be wondered , then , that Wan Lee was shaken with gusts of satisfaction ? For , of a truth , one must feed upon cold comfortif the fires of happiness have burned to ashes . And when , an hour later , she heard the uncertain footsteps of Shoo Shee again pattering up the stairs , she thought : Can it be that the honor of my husband 's house has been so swiftly accomplished ? " But her hopes were premature . Yet the tremulous Shoo Shee brought gossip of even greater import . Most extraordinarynews had seeped through the wall of secrecy with which the Suey Sings hedged in all proceedings of import . It seemed , so the tale ran , that on the morrow there would be dispatched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquaint that worthy matron with certain tong secrets . And , having fulfilled this part of his mission , to take counsel with the widow of Hung Gow as to the best line of action . " Never in my life , " declared Shoo Shee , " heard I such aP181circumstance ! A woman admitted to the deliberations of the Suey Sings ! What make you of it ? " " Either confusion or mischief ! " replied Wan Lee , with a note that betrayed upon which alternative her hopes rested . As for the unsavory Shoo Shee , a chuckle of satisfaction issued from her raucous old throat , for to her the scent of intrigueawaited the uncorking of either condition . All that night Wan Lee lay wide-eyed on her couch , shaken with mingled misgivings and reassurances , rising with the dawn to set her house in order against so distinguished a visitation . And , everything being accomplished , to sit with prim formality upon the teak-wood chairs in the antechamber , surrounded by her three daughters , herself rising to admitthe visitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected a venerable messenger , but when her glance rested upon the figure of a man midway between youth and middle age , she had a sinking of heart . This man was not intent on carrying formal honors to her house . She bowed him to a seat set between two teak-wood stands fragrant with lilies , dismissing her daughters with a wave of the hand . His preliminaries were full of prolonged and cautious advances , and as she listened to him commend her virtues and extol her husband 's valor , she felt the premonition of a wayfarer meeting the greasy smile of a bandit ready to despoil him . By the time he had reached the meat of his argument , she had almost anticipated it : Would a goodly sum from the coffersof the See Yup treasury serve the honor of her house as lustily as the death of On Yick ? She felt her cheeks burn with the heat of this indignity , and , rising in her seat , she answered him : " Does my husband 's tong think that the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bolt of silk ? " P182To which her unruffled visitor made answer : " Is it bought the less because the currency be blood ? " The question was confusing , but she rallied quickly . " The currency has been fixed these many years by custom . Who am I to gainsay it ? Are there no more men among you that you must shift the burden of your faint-heartedness upon the shoulders of a woman ? " The messenger rose and bowed , a questionable suavity in his voice . " We thought the shoulders of compassion broad . Men are not versed in mercy . But they have often great knowledge of expediency . And yet expediency is a weak thing in itself . Is it so vile to call pity into counsel ? " " Pity ! " she sneered . " Was it pity that widowed me ? And pity that bereft me of a son ? There is not money enough in all the world to requite me . " " Nor blood either , if you but knew it ! I am the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of fifty such would not add one jot to my happiness were he taken from me . " He gave a crafty smile . " How much more discerning , then , should you be , who have given suck ! " She looked at him scornfully , steeling her heart . " And yet , " she answered , " you say that men are not versed in mercy ! Nay , but they can make even mercy serve as a cloak to cowardice . And so you come fawning for justification to the widow of the boldest man who ever graced your tong , that you may say in the market-place : Wan Lee , the widow of Hung Gow , has persuaded us against our inclination . Havingbeen bereft of both a husband and a son , she has need of money ; the father of On Yick is rich . In such a dilemma we have no choice but to accede to her wishes ! ' It is thus that the tale will run , will it not ? " The messenger looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that is how it will run precisely . You are a wise and far-seeing matron , Wan Lee . This is why , ifP183you but cast your eyes in the direction I point , you can not fail to discern the truth . " Her sneer continued . " A truth drawn closer to your vision with the eye-glasses of expediency ? " He bowed very low . " The short-sighted take whatever means is nearest to clear up their infirmity . What does it matterhow the blind are made to see , so the miracle is accomplished ? However , one but muddies a pool with constant stirrings . Let us permit the issue to settle . I shall go back to my brothers and say that the widow of Hung Gow is un-decided . " " You will go back , then , 0 crafty messenger , with a lie ! " " What would you have me say : that Wan Lee cried no quarter ? That the shoulders of compassion are shrunken ? Are you ready , Wan Lee , to send a bullet speeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to command it and it shall be done ! " Wan Lee paled , and her voice shook . " What infamy ! What cowardice ! " she spat at him between her closed teeth . And thus he departed , smiling . For hours after , Wan Lee was shaken with impotent fury . Was it possible that she had ever fancied that the great house of On Wo Low had been marked for her honor ? An unqualifiedcontempt for all males possessed her . A woman admitted to the deliberation of the Suey Sings ! Sugar for thetrapping of even so wary a female as the lascivious Shoo Shee ! What would that toothless old emissary of evil say when she heard the truth of the matter ? But , as was to be expected , Shoo Shee knew not only the truth , but much more . She had heard just what pressures had been brought ; just what interests were to be served ; just what precedents were to be established by Wan Lee 's inspired decision to renounce vengeance for cash . For at last the power-P184ful Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to rid the quarter of all communal strife , and when the Six Companies spoke there were many attentive listeners . So , continued the wide-smiling Shoo Shee , the Suey Sings and the See Yups had met in friendly counsel , and , with On Wo Low 's consent , had chosen his son for an empty gesture toward satisfaction . " For , " said the sagacious in both camps , " we shall have the widow of Hung Gow to justify us and thus save our reputation for valiance ! " Fine specimens , truly ! Wan Lee 's eyes narrowed with malevolence . " And if I decidenot to justify them ? " she inquired . Shoo Shee rolled herself a cigarette . " In that case they must put through their program . Not even the Six Companies can make the Suey Sings the jest of the market-place ! " " We shall see , then ! " exclaimed Wan Lee . And , at that moment , the vision of her son came to her  --  the vision of her son as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accomplished . Days passed and still Wan Lee dallied with her decision . Nay , not the decision , but its confirmation . Did pity or cruelty lay back of this inaction . Did she watch the graceful figure of On Yick , swinging by her latticed window , dovelike or with the eyes of a hawk ? In either manner , perhaps , according to her mood . But , to be truthful , it was mostly as a hawk poised in midair for sudden swooping . There was a certain gluttony in her dalliance , the gluttony of a gormand sniffing the feast at the kitchen door . Thus did she nurse her vengeance made flesh in the person of youth , radiant and unsuspecting . She grew to know every curve in On Yick 's supple body , the tilt of his head , the flexible slant to his shoulders . Her eyes devoured his slender hands , strong in their tapering grace , the apricot-tint in his cheeks , the ivory gleam of his teeth when he smiled . Once she sent a lily-blossom hurtling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance . P185He mistakenly tossed an amorous look toward her window , and she withdrew quickly , shaken with sardonic laughter . If he but knew how he ogled death ! Ah , the joy of power  --  to know that one held life and liberty and happiness in the shadow of one 's hand ! To be a despot , like a princess in a tale , or a dowager empress , demanding heads and forfeits as she willed ! How confidently he tramped the cobbled streets , secure in the power of his father 's filthy gold ! The honor of Hung Gow 's house to be bought as easily as a wanton 's virtue ! And a foreign government , and the Six Companies , and her husband'stong itself hanging upon the decision of one lonely woman ! Did we say that pity at intervals stirred within her , like a vagrant breeze , clouding the surface of fathomless depths ? Only to die again , leaving a cold serenity . Had not her son walked in like confidence and grace , unsuspecting ? And had not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as radiant ? And when he smiled had not his teeth gleamed like ivory pavilions in the twilight ? And yet they had carried him into her bled white of every charm . Aye , but she would have her toll and more , for she would worry them all in the bargain ! But , if there was worriment , there was also great capacity for concealment . Outwardly the quarter resumed its holiday gaiety  --  proclaiming from the house-tops that animosities and feuds and vengeances were to hang suspended until the Newyearhad been accomplished . Thus did the powers gild the ugly possibilities behind Wan Lee 's indecision . There followed nights of revelry . The thin trickle of pipes blown upon the evening breeze , squeaking of fiddles , the dramaticclash of cymbals . Restaurants hoarse with laughter , and waiters swarming out at midnight , bearing square trays upon their heads , piled high with trivial food . Coats of plum-colored silk , and trousers the color of apple-orchards at their firstp186leafing . Twinkling ornaments in the hair of women , bracelets of pearl , rings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingfisher . Preserved strips of coconut , candied melon-rind , chunks of sugar-cane , limes frosted into a white sweetness . The bursting of strings of firecrackers suspended in long lines from tong-house balconies , showering the street with a chromatic splendor . And chief among the revelers was old On Wo Low , himself , attended by his stalwart son , making the rounds of ceremonial calls , clad in the glory of yesterday , with a redsilkbutton topping his shining hat , passing and repassing the screened windows of Wan Lee . And , at the appointed season , the women of On Wo Low 's household , his wife , in short , supported on either side by her daughters-in-law , pattering up and down with the painful movement of bound feet , also intent on calls and ceremony . Can it be that they have halted by the greasy flight leading to the lodgings of Wan Lee , widow of the valiant Hung Gow ? In truth , and not only halting , but mounting the stairs , preceded by a serving-woman bearing gifts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between satisfaction and misgiving . And that her three daughters crowd the passageway , twittering with excitement . The wife of the great On Wo Low bearing gifts ! Do they fancy that the widow of Hung Gow is a reed to be swayed by the south wind ? She sits motionless , a just and terrible Wan Lee , in her primmest teak-wood chair , while the wife of On Wo Low prostrates herself in all humility before her . And presently the gifts are spread upon the floor , as gifts are spread before a princess . The three daughters of Wan Lee stand upright against the wall , aping their mother 's immobility . Here is a box of red lacquer , with carvings half an inch deep , and a bolt of azure silk , and priceless tea , flavored with jasmine . And the trembling voice of a woman saying :  | " 0 worthy and compassionate Wan Lee , behold , you are a savior of youth , a drier of woman 's tears , a dispenser of laughter ! You are a fountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you are a lamp in a windy passageway ; you are a bankrupt and still your heart devises rich gifts ! Truly , there is not enough treasure in the world to measure my gratitude to thee ! " And another voice replying , cutting the air like a thin knife : " That being so , why trouble yourself with these gaudy and trifles ? Nay , put up your gifts ! " A movement of solicitation from the two fluttering daughters-in-law . The wife of On Wo Low rising upon her warped feet . " Nay , you but jest . Are not the terms agreed upon ? " " Verily , between men . But , happily for the honor of my husband 's house , I am not bound to their bargain . It seems at last that women are to have a hand . Well , so be it ! " " Shall they not do better , then , than the men before them ? Lost you a husband and a son at a woman 's command ? " " Nay , but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just and relentless Wan Lee , a stone cast in a pool sends out ripples without end . Thus will it be with you , whether you cast pity or destruction . " " Whether I cast pity or destruction is beside the mark . Will pity bring me back my son ? And will pity still the gossips of the market-place as they cluck like gaudy parrots over sunflower-seeds , saying as I pass : There goes the covetous Wan Lee , who for a bag of silver bartered away the honor of her husband 's house ' ? " " And does my son pay the penalty of gossiping tongues with his life ? " A prolonged silence with the lips of Wan Lee curling insolently : " Not if he be fleet of foot , 0 timorous mother ofp188On Yick ! Tell him at once my purpose and mayhap he shall be swifter in his flight than the bullet that shall speed toward him ! " The serving-woman , gathering the gifts into a silken kerchief , and the mother of On Yick answering proudly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of murder and the gossip of the tongs flew on swift wings through the quarter , what could one say for the speed with which it was reported that the wife of On Wo Low had humbled herself before Wan Lee ? In less than an hour the streets hummed with conjecture , turning the shufflingfeet of Shoo Shee toward Hung Gow 's household . Wan Lee met the old trot 's questioning with insolent pride . " And mark you , " she said , concluding her description of the encounter , " how swiftly this swaggering coxcomb will vanish . Tomorrow and I warrant he will not pass again below my lattice , as is his daily wont . " Shoo Shee lit a cigarette . " To stir a pheasant into swift flight does not insure a feast , " she observed , casting a falcon 's glance at the woman sitting opposite her . Wan Lee 's lips turned white . " One can slay much with ridicule , " she answered . " Even desire . Take care , Wan Lee , that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stirred to hot anger . " Permit me to order my conduct as I choose . If a pheasant in flight is more to my taste than one brought low , that is my concern ! " Shoo Shee coughed into her hand . " Irritation , " she returned with malevolent sweetness , " is the first sign of weakness ! " Saying which she withdrew , chuckling . Wan Lee sat motionless , staring into space . Was it possible that she had dallied so long , smacking her lips over prospects , that her hunger had become dulled ? Or had her perceptionsp189become profound ? Was there more satisfaction in the laughterof the market-place than in the grief of women ? A pheasantin full flight ! Suppose the bird refused to wing toward freedom ? The alternative set her to shivering , and she knew in that moment where her hopes lay . She sat all next day behind the lattice of her window , and he did not pass . Hourly her satisfaction grew . Would her son have fled , being warned ? Would her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely disturbed her , yet for the most part a weight seemed lifted from her heart . To hold out for the honor of her husband 's house and yet have Fate decide the issue peacefully  --  after all , that were the easier part . Yes , she was old and violence had lost its glamour . But pride still reigned . What whispering in the market-place when next she picked her way in quest of culinary inanities for her three simpering daughters ! The profound Wan Lee , honored by the consideration of her husband 's tong , whose single word could spell destruction ! The profound Wan Lee , before whom the lily-footed wife of the great On Wo Low had prostrated herself ; who had refused rich gifts and preservedher household 's integrity ! The profound Wan Lee , who had sent a powerful man 's son scurrying to exile ! The profoundWan Lee , whose son was slain . Aye , always at the bottom of the cup remained this drop of bitterness . But at twilight all her erstwhile conclusions came to naught , for who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yick , a proud , upward thrust to his shoulders and the apricot-bloom upon his cheek , glowing even in the dusk . Wan Lee felt sick and satisfied in turn . Satisfied ? Did she still hunger for the blood of On Wo Low 's first-born son ? Nay ; but a pride stirred her  --  a pride in youth who could flaunt death so fearlessly . For a woman is a woman under any clime or circumstance . And she knew now with what eyes the wife of On Wo Low , divided between agony and elation , looked down upon the spectacle of a son unafraid . For mothersare mothers the world over . And yet , now that she had drawn so close to courage , she trembled for it . Well , the issue was still in her hand . But she drew back from her weakness as one who comes suddenly to the edge of a precipice . Drat the youth and his bravado ! Could heroics give her back her son ? Nay , she must be stedfast , even though false security had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not surrender a secret hope , and so she sat behind her lattice waiting . And when he passed in the street below her at midnight , she crept out upon the balcony and threw him again a lily-stem . This time he halted , and , seeing her , he smiled insolently and would have been on his way had she not called softly : " 0 valiant and upstanding On Yick , can it be that thy mother has kept silent as to what I purpose ? If not , then let me plead with thee to be gone . For I am a woman , and I have been a mother , and I would preserve the honor of my house and thy life also . " He looked first at the street , and , finding it deserted , at her , pityingly , and he answered : " Would you have me less courageous than thy solitary and dauntless son ? Fled he from danger ? " She bent lower , so that not even the night could hear her whisper : " They flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What say you ? " " Did not my own lips whisper the truth of what they purposed ? " " Nay , that were not seemly . A man does not betray his tong thus lightly . " " I am of a younger generation . To me friendship comesp191first . And thy son was my friend . Did we not sit in school together ? And share our sugared coconut strips on feastdays ? How , then , should I let them plot his ruin unwarned ? " " Why did you not come to me ? Perhaps I could have persuadedhim . " He shook his head . " As my mother persuaded me ? Nay , thy son was worthy of the mother who bore him ! " " But you say : I am of a younger generation ? ' What to you remains then of all this ancient folly ? " " Pride remains , 0 worthy mother ! Else you would not lean thus upon your balcony persuading me to cowardice for the honor of thy house . " She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried softly , " pride is dead . And you have killed it ! Thus am I for the third time bereft ! " Another day and the quarter humming with released tension . It appears that everything has been settled . For has not the widow of Hung Gow three unwed daughters , and is not money needful in her condition ? So runs the official record . But , as usual , there are other whisperings abroad , whispers that grow into loud confirmations . Wan Lee is at heart compassionate , a benefactress ; the money to her is naught but a symbol of a slate wiped clean . Do any doubt this ? Then remember that she is the wife of Hung Gow and well trained in honor . The story leaps the confines of the quarter . Strangersapplaud ; the name of Wan Lee becomes for a day famous . A woman , single-handed , routing tradition ! Streams of visitors appear , knocking at her wicket : emissariesfrom the Six Companies ; an official in blue with gold braid from the foreign government ; On Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat-sleeve ; his wife , teetering between her daughters-in-law , bearing gifts , as before ; Shoo Shee , smirking , behind fresh villainies . But to none of these does the door fly open.  |p192Only  when at a certain musky nightfall comes a slender figure creeping up the stairs does Wan Lee so much as stir from her chair . Between the rifts in her lattice she sees youth tapping , and at that moment , in the kind blur of dusk , it might be her own son beating against her heart for entrance . And so she admits him.  | LILY GEE , making her way up Grant Avenue on any night in the year , was as dainty a bit of Oriental loveliness as one could possibly imagine ; and , what was more , she knew it . But that was not surprising ; twelve months or so of passingthe after-dinner mints in Tait 's Cafe gives even demure , almond-eyed maidens an air of disturbing self-consciousness . Not that any overwhelming compliments reached her from masculine lips ; it was the women diners who flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her case , the feminine rule of conservatism touching the attractiveness of others of their sex seemed inoperative , possibly because Lily Gee appeared safely outlandish in her Chinese trousers of palely figured orange silk and her black hair dusted with seed pearls . One could be confidently indulgent toward a bizarre little lady of Oriental forbears who incased her twinklingfeet in French boots and lit the dull yellow of her skin with a strand of Occidental ruching about the neck . Lily Gee had a desire to go further and wear skirts , like the children of the Chinese Presbyterian minister living next door to her father , but the fair Lily was hired for her trousersas much as anything . Devotees of a bastard Bohemia would have found nothing alluring in a Lily Gee conventionallyclothed . But she did insist on putting her hair in a braid , snaring it flamboyantly at the neck with a huge pink bow that contrasted strangely with the ornaments of sky-blue enamel just back of her ears . Yes , Lily Gee was dainty at any time , but never more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cafe into the glamour of a San Francisco night , washed to sudden blue-and-gold brilliance by a truant shower . The sidewalks were still lit with glistening moisture and Lily peered expectantly up and down O'Farrel Street before she decided to step with catlike caution from the security of a dry space near the doorway . The automobile flunkey at the curb grinned significantly . " Wot 's the matter , Lily ? " he called out raucously . " Ai n't Louie going to show up tonight ? I guess he 's gone and given you the hooks . Want a taxi ? " . Lily fastened her fox fur more securely at the neck . " Do n't get fresh ! " she flung back with lofty disdain . " Maybe he 's in that last mix-up , " the flunkey went on tantalizingly . " Say , wot 's the row anyway ? Another one of them tong wars ? Wot tong do you belong to , Lily ? Or do n't females figure ? " Lily threw him a glance of lip-curling disdain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we want to , " she retorted as she moved rapidly out of her tormentor 's sneering range . She was not exactly ashamed of her Mongolian ancestry , but there were times when certain racial phases irritated her , and this was one of them . A tong war more or less was nothing in her young life , but she resented being scornfully ridiculedconcerning it . She did n't care how many gunmen plied their ancient and dishonorable calling up and down the cobbledstreets of Chinatown . Had she been apprehensive for the safety of her own male kinsmen she might have felt differently , but her father 's tong was a notoriously peaceful affair . For years their plan had been to settle differences with their rivals on the basis of spot cash . In other words , the Hip Sens were unblushing pacifists , and all militant Chinatown recognized the fact and smiled broadly and with a fine disdain at the mention of their impotent name . But pacifists have their place in the scheme of things , and a tong with an empty treasury often found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatbelliedclan . But the real basis for Lily Gee 's petulance on this night in question was not so much a matter of being twitted on the tong score ; it struck deeper . Louie Fook had failed her for the first time in three weeks , and it was plain that little Lily Gee was a woman long before she was an Oriental . She was not afraid to go home from Tait 's Cafe alone , because , for all its reputation as a sink of iniquity , San Francisco has an extraordinarychivalry for women , yellow-skinned or otherwise ; but it was pleasant to have company and especially the company of Louie Fook . And it was pleasanter still to patter self-consciously past the gorgeous apothecary shops of Chinatownhanging demurely upon Louie 's arm , realizing what a wigging she must be getting from the conservative old men who sat stiffly in their teakwood seats and cast profoundly incurious glances at any and all who drifted by . Youth ever has a penchant for shocking its elders , and Lily Gee knew quite well that her course could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age she should have been wearing her hair in a stiff roll over one ear and twined with artificial blossoms as a sign that she was quite properly and honorably betrothed to a man of her father 's choosing , instead of running about at all hours of the night with a flippant and impious youth . And the girls , too ! How they must have envied her from behind the starched curtains of their upper chambers ! Lily Gee did not give up hope of seeing Louie Fook until she had accomplished the length of O'Farrel Street . There was still a chance that he would come hurrying out of the MarketStreet throng , but as she glanced rapidly about she knew that she was doomed to disappointment . Tonight she was not to have the satisfaction of exciting either disapproval or envy . Deciding to make her solitary flight swift , she swung up Grant Avenue with Occidental confidence , making none of the birdlike patterings upon the pavement that characterized the footsteps of older women of her race . Erect , confident , striking the ground firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained the first slight hill whereby San Francisco 's shopping district merges suddenly into the narrowerconfines of the Oriental quarter . It was a dull night and a dull hour , and Lily Gee was properly bored by everything . She was crawling languidly up toward the bazaars spread invitingly out for the beguilementof tourists when the noise of three distinct shots leaped toward her . She stopped at once . In a moment the almost empty streets were crowded . Hurtlingfigures swarmed past ; police whistles blew . And she remembered the sneering taunt of the automobile flunkey : " Say , wot 's the row anyway ? Another one of them tong wars ? " Feeling perfectly secure regarding the safety of her own clan , it was not surprising that Lily 's first thoughts were of Louie Fook . And , being feminine , it was less surprising to find these thoughts tinged with all manner of hectic fears . There was a disturbing note of prophecy in the automobile flunkey 's casual raillery . What if Louie Fook had been in the latest " mix-up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either her father or his first-born son could have been concerned in this affair of flying bullets and fleeing men . To be sure , Louie Fook 's tong was a tong of vigorous action ; the Sen Suey Yings were rich in melodramatic flourishes . But Louie Fook was of the new order  --  " Young China , " as he proudly explained to Lily Gee . He subscribed superficially to the tong code as a man not quite freed from tradition subscribesto standards which at heart he feels to be old and shop , worn . He went through the motions from a sense of obligation to the " old man , " as he put it with a pungent dash of Western irreverence leavening his ingrained filial piety . But Lily Gee ,  |p197in  the grip and luxury of apprehension , reasoned very aptly that it was not necessary for Louie Fook to be a participant to come to grief . A young , hot-blooded , upstanding shoot from the parent stem of the Sen Suey Ying would be a very temptingtarget for a gunman intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take Lily Gee more than a fraction of a minute to decide that Louie Fook was lying stretched out upon the slimy-green cobbles of some dank alley , bleeding to a slow death . Otherwise he would have met her . This last thrust of logic was unanswerable , and a curious fluttering betweenpride and fear at the thought sent Lily Gee flying on her way to act her part in the waiting tragedy . By this time the crowds were swarming like bees to their hiving . The air was thick with cries and oaths and hysterical laughter . Policemen suddenly sprang from the rich gloom to side streets ; rubber-neck tourists cowered in the lantern-hung twilight of mysterious doorways ; pasty-faced hop-heads opened their eyes in transient interest and wonder ; white women screamed . Only the Orientals of the quarter refused to be swung from a cool and impenetrable calm , excepting the flowerlike Lily Gee , who was a woman , and not only that , a woman who wore French heels and ribbons in her hair and went about with her cheeks shamelessly unpainted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old men of Grant Avenue seen her many a night and oft flaunting in the immodest fashion of white women up and down the shutterless street ? What then could one expect from such as she except swift feet and fluttering heartbeats and a mouth parted in frank fear as she pushed and clawed and scratched her way through the black mob until she came to a little clearing maintained by fear and the blue-coated arm of the law ? As she had expected , the prone figure of a man lay in a thick ooze of blood , the face mercifully screened by a carelesslyflung overcoat . Little Lily Gee waited her chance pa- tiently and , at the moment when the law 's back was briefly turned , she darted swiftly over the dead line and snatched up the coat . A murmur broke from the crowd . Lily Gee felt her arms caught in a steel-like grip . She stiffened herself . " What in  --  " the voice of the law was bellowing down at her . She looked up with a face as expressionless as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too quietly , " he is my father 's son . " The lips of the law grew less stern . " No ! On the level ? Your brother ? Say , will somebody take this little girl home ? This ai n't no place for her . " She felt a light touch upon her arm . She turned . Louie Fook was standing just outside that charmed circle . " Come , " he said in a low tone . An instinctive path opened to receive them . They walked on and on ; it seemed to Lily Gee as if they would never come to the journey 's end . At the door of her home she felt the quick release of Louie 's protecting arm . What ? Did he intend to leave her there ? Must she go up to her father  --  alone ? " Lily Gee  --  Lily Gee  --  " she heard Louie say with a curious singsong voice , " this will make no difference ; will it , Lily Gee ? We  --  you and I  --  we are young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , but she said nothing . She was thinking  --  thinking . Why should it make a difference ? she asked herself as she climbed the stairs . She lifted the old-fashioned latch and went into the house of her father . He was sitting erect in terrible dignity in one of the teakwood chairs ranged primly against the wall . On either side a thin line of old men kept him company . The question which her lips had framed died . It was not necessary to ask anything . She could see at a glance that the wings of evil news had been swifter even than the feet of compassion . She passed before her father into the next room ; she mightp199have been a hungry ghost for all the notice that he took of her . " Lily Gee  --  Lily Gee  --  this will make no difference ; will it , Lily Gee ? We  --  you and I  --  we are young China . " What did Louie Fook mean ? Ah , Lily Gee , little flower of the evening bazaars , little sweetmeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask such a question ? Does a youth of a friendly tong halt before the door of sorrow ? " Lily Gee  --  Lily Gee  --  this will make no difference ; will it , Lily Gee ? . . . " There , there , Lily Gee , little butterfly of midnight ! ' What does anything matter when your father waits in the outer chamber sorrowing . Take him his blackened pipe and fill it full of fragrant leaves and light it for him . He will not notice you , little fluttering moth without a mother ; but what does a woman expect in a household mourning for its first-born ? And make tea for the guests , Lily Gee , daughter of fear , and light the tapers before the shrine of your ancestors . " We  --  you and I  --  we are young China . " Are you , Lily Gee ? Are you young China , or the daughter of your father ? Are you young China , or the sister of your father 's son ? " Lily Gee  --  Lily Gee  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gee ? " After a season even grief spends itself and falls fainting into the solacing arms of custom . Thus at the end of a week did little Lily Gee begin again to pass the after-dinner mints at Tait 's . And on that first night Louie Fook came for her as usual , and they drifted by the gilded shops of Grant Avenue while prim lines of old men , dubiously incurious , watched their passage . But at the door Louie Fook left her , and presently she stood before her father . And her first thought was as she watched  |p200him  : " How long before they will tell him that I am seen every night with an enemy of his household ? " At least before the next night had died he must have had word of her indifference to the law of her people . But he said nothing  --  not a word . She breathed easier . Perhaps her father , after all , had the wit to see that Louie Fook was not responsible for the death of his first-born . An ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skimming through the evening paper at Tait 's , knew that even white people were not deceived by this calm . Everybody was waiting  --  and wondering and making scant prophecies . What was to be expected from a white-livered tong who paid cash for the privilege of giving offense ? Would a willingness to yield up their dirty yellow gold be matched by a willingness to receive it back , twofold , even though it be dyed with the blood of one of their first fruits ? Newspapers in search of colorful stores speculated by the half column upon the possibilities , warned visitors to buy their mandarin coats and gaudy bag tassels in the department stores , eschewing the musk-scented bazaars of Chinatown . And at night Lily Gee , hurrying home through the deserted streets , felt the arm of Louie Fook holding her tighter and tighter . His words were few , but she fancied that his eyes warned her , saying : " Draw closer , Lily Gee . Who knows what next will happen ? There must be a limit even to the patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for blood . The tong I belong to has done a grievous thing , robbing an old man of his delight . I am not afraid for myself , Lily Gee ; but you , trembling blossom of sorrow , what if a stray bullet should wing its way to your heart ? " How sweet it was , flying along in the thick gloom of tightly shuttered streets with fear on one side and Louie Fook upon the other ! What did feuds and street battles and waiting fathers matter then ? But at the end of the journeyp20Ithere stood always that doorway of parting , that threshold across which the feet of a Sen Suey Ying could not pass . And there was the quick heartbeat of pain at the dreary flight to be climbed , and the latch to be lifted , and the dreadful dignityof a bent father , sitting proudly with his pipe , and the accusing eyes of terrible old men , keeping company with grief . In the ghastly white midnight light of her bedroom she thought of many things  --  of this son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louie Fook and the wonderful clean yellow of his shapely hands , which fell so firmly upon her forearm as they walked defiantly past the apothecary shops ; of the customs of her elders ; of the strangely sweet love stories of white women which she chanced upon in the pages of stray magazines . Even at the public school she had heard tales of love and sorrow and devotion , lilting poems read by the teacher , whisperedromances among the girls aping their lily-white sisters , fragments of scenes filtering out from the moving-picture house near Pacific Street . And once she had gone on a Wednesdayafternoon to a play , a real American play that the teacher had recommended . She had wheedled her father into letting her have the money , and she had persuaded one of the daughters of the Presbyterian minister to do likewise . They had not understood all the words , because the people talked strangely . But Lily Gee knew what it was all about because the teacher had explained  --  a beautiful young girl  --  and a lover who was an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  street fights , and moonlit balconies , and smothered kisses , and a wedding , and finally death ! Ah , Lily Gee , daughter of a thousand memories , why should not you taste of these stolen delights ? You are not your mother , bowing three times before the threshold of her mother-in-law , eating her husband 's bread in sufferance until she can prove herself with a first-born son . Little server ofp202sweetmeats , you are not your mother , slicking her black hair into place with perfumed oils , mincing along the street , holding a fan in one hand and a gaudy silken kerchief in the other . Why does not your father call you before him and lead the man of his choice to you ? Why does he not sell you for a bag of silver as your mother was sold in other days at the first sign of her budding ? Is it because the money that you bring him weekly from the banquet halls of white men is pleasanter to his sight than a handful of gold that will melt quickly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lily Gee , darlingof ten thousand feasters , he must know that the pavementsof the town ring with the locked footsteps of his daughter and the son of those who have robbed him of his greatest treasure . Why does he not halt you as you walk through that meeting room of grief and tell you that such things can not be ? Your father is an old man , but it is not possible that he is afraid of you . Can it be that your father has a purpose in all this , oh , little maiden of wide-winged hair ribbons ? Would it be better if you trod your accustomed path more cautiously ? And do you never think of your father 's son , your brother , a green bamboo stalk cut down before its time ? Are there not other youths with golden hands and tapering fingers ? Is Louie Fook the only one whose eyes speak to you when everything is silent ? Your mother was a happy woman , Lily Gee . Your father did not quarrel with her even at your coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melon seed and placed yellow fruits upon the altar to her husband 's ancestors . And if she had lived she might one day have had a daughter-in-law for her profit and her delight . Yes , Lily Gee , your mother wore neither hair ribbon nor leather boots with high heels . And she was sold to your father for a bag of silver . Yet , Lily Gee , she was happier than you.  |p203Ah  , Lily Gee , little swallow of swift dartings , what is happinessto the sweet pain of love ? A week went by  --  two ; and still revenge slumbered . The western sky quickened to twilights brief but golden ; and in the counting houses of the wealthy the first forced lily blooms rose in disdainful purity from gaudy bowls strewn with shiningpebbles . Among the meat stalls , baskets of tender mustardshoots began to make their appearance , and here and there the window of a worker in jade was lit with a captive bough of almond blossoms . Presently the New Year would be at hand , the New Year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved in secret by the maidens . Even Lily Gee could not forget the beauty and glamour of those old days when the dull streets of the quarter flamed into sudden color . In those good times her father had brought out his jacket of stiff plum silk , and his trousers of faint green , soft and clinging , and his round hat with the bright red knob in the center . Then , also , her mother laid aside her drab covering of rusty alpaca and searched in the cedar chest for a dress of figured lavender brocade , and tiny slippers of purple embroidered in pink , and a fan of painted peacock feathers . Then there was feasting , and lanterns swinging before every door and window , and the noise of bursting firecrackers showering the pavements with fragments of crimson and green and yellow . They lit lanterns still , and sold goldfish and seed cakes and shining strips of sugared coconut from curbstone bazaars ; but it was all a pale reminder of what had gone before . And Lily Gee , walking home one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of her people : " Do you remember the season of blossoming lilies when we were children ? " " Yes , but that was foolishness , " he answered with a sneer . " The American New Year is better . "  |p204Lily  Gee said no more . But she had seen an American New Year at Tait 's , and she wondered if it were better . Ah , yes , of course , it must be . American men did not sell their daughters for bags of silver , and they did not feast apart from their women , and they did not have tong wars . Therefore everything they did was better , much better . Louie Fook was right . And when white women and white men loved it was forever , to the death , as it had been in the play . Thus would it be with Louie Fook and herself . For they were young China , and young China listened to no one , not even to its fathers . And the fathers knew it and held their peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where Louie Fook dared to mount the stairs with her and cross the threshold of her father 's house ; but in a little while everything would be right again . Her father was forgetting his grief , and the outer chamber was no longer the meeting place of old men . Instead they were drifting back each to his old haunt , and presently her father would go out at nightfall and smoke his pipe with the others . Yes , when that happened she would know everything was right again . But what makes you so pale , little daughter of perfect content ? Were you not dreaming , upon the arm of Louie Fook , as you passed the Hang Far Low Restaurant ? Or was that indeed the figure of your father upon the balcony , far above the street , peering down at all who passed by ? Can it be possible that he wished to see , with his own eyes , the shame of this daughter of his who has not so much as a thought for her slain kinsman ? Quicken your step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if your father is not in his accustomed seat , toying wantonly with his grief . Say your farewell quickly and halt in terror before you lift the latch . There , now it is over , and you are inside ! Dark ? Well , what does that signify ? Perhaps he is sleeping . Light the yellowgas flame and search for him  --  everywhere . No , he is notp20Ssleeping . He has gone out . He has gone to the balcony of the Hang Far Low . But what of that ? Is it not because his grief has spent itself ? Then why should his eyes be searching , searching the crowd in the street below ? There , do you hear his step on the outer landing ? Calm yourself , Lily Gee . Remember you are young China , and they have taught you in the schools of the white men to die for your love , if you must . What is your father 's son to you ? He would have married in due time and taken no thought of your fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . It has come at last . He is forbidding you  --  telling you that you mustnotDo not waste words on him , Lily Gee . He is an old man , and he would not understand . He thinks by your silence that he has frightened you ; he fancies that you are a timorous little mouse like your mother . What will he do tomorrow night when , from that balcony above the street , he sees that you have disobeyed him ? Well , fill his pipe and let him smoke in peace , for he is an old man , Lily Gee , and he was good to your mother . Yes , each year at the time of spring flowers he bought her a pearl ornament for the black band of silk across her forehead , and for you pieces of dripping sugar cane and candied melon rind . Ah , Lily Gee , pale blossom of weeping spring , it is not easy to love in the fashion of white women ! On the night following Lily Gee , distributing sweetmeats to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips . The men passed that smile by , but the women understood and whispered words of banter mixed with wistful envy . And one woman asked for his name , but Lily Gee shook her head and went her way , hugging her secret close . Her love may have showed through her smile , but her purpose was more deeply hidden.  |p206Who  , of these white women before her , could suspect what magic had been so suddenly wrought ? Who of these white women , feasting at the same table with their men , could know the long journey she had accomplished with the swift wings of love ? It was nothing to them to decide upon defying their elders . Their fathers did not lie in wait upon a lantern-lit balcony , waiting to slay the man of their choice . Now that she had made her decision her spirit flamed to white heat . Louie Fook had said rightly on that night of tragedy : " We are young China . " Ah , but he could not have suspected how she was to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ! How closely she snuggled to him when he called for her ! How sweetly slow they sauntered up between the white-lit shops of Grant Avenue ! With what ecstasy her heart beat as they drew nearer and nearer the familiar street of her own people ! For was she not nearing the proving ground of devotionand did not every woman long passionately to be put to that test ? She saw her father from afar . He was leaning forward upon the balcony railing of the Hang Far Low , puffing idly at his bamboo pipe . He was a kind man , this father of hers , when the mood was on him , and yet he was standing there waiting  --  waiting  --  waiting  --  for just the proper moment to snuff out the life of a youth who had done him no harm . Why do you not turn up a side street , Lily Gee , little white pigeon of love ? Why do you tempt the weapon in your father'shand to sudden fire ? You love this man at your side and yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father has not seen you . Stop a moment before the windows of Fook Wo 's shop and see the thick , white shawls embroidered with equally white clusters of roses . And here are tiny boxes lacquered in gold with storks upon them , and screens of ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl . Ah , wait just a moment , Louie Fook ; not so fast ! Didp207you ever see greener jade or more wonderful phials of streaked agate ? And those flapping slippers lined with fur  --  would they not be warm on these chill mornings of spring ? Turn your eyes sidewise , Lily Gee , and mark your father well . Do you think he has seen you yet ? Is there still time to go another way in all pride ? For shame , Lily Gee ! Of what are you afraid ? Had you not planned to show two men your mettle tonight ? Louie Fook would sneer at your fear if he knew of it . He would walk proudly by that overhangingbalcony of death with a smile . He would scorn slinking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do him violence . No , Lily Gee , better to put the matter to the test and have done with it . Show your man at once that you are young China . After that anything and everything may happen . Cross the street cautiously , Lily Gee , for the cobbles are slippery with early dew . There , now he has seen you ! He has stopped smoking ; his pipe has dropped from his hand . He is fumbling in the wide reaches of his sleeve for something . Yes , he has found it ! Now , at this moment , Louie Fook has looked up . He , too , sees what is going on ! What ! Can it be possible that he is pulling away ? Will he attempt to run ? What folly ! No , Louie Fook , do not be a fool ! If you run he will shoot you in the back ! Here ! Have you no faith in Lily Gee ? See what she is doing . She is stepping between you and the gleaming pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of young China are unafraid . There , now it is over ! Her father will not shoot even a daughter of his own house . Faster , faster , Lily Gee , get home quickly . Your father will beat you , but what of that ? You have proved yourself to your father and your 1over and nothing else matters . How pale the lips of Louie Fook are ! He must be trembling at the thought of what you were ready to sacrifice , little moth of candlelight ! Press him close to your heart and tell him to be- gone . For you will see him tomorrow , and then all the things that are unsaid will blossom into sweet words . You were wise to send him on his way , for there are your father 's footsteps . Crouch in a far corner of the outer chamberand let him beat you as he will . What ! Can it be possible that he has no lashes for your slender back ? No , Lily Gee , he will not beat you ; he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after tonight , you are less than a woman to him . He would have beaten your mother for good cause , but he loved her . Rise up , Lily Gee , and go into your own room . You are not a pleasing sight to your old father . What was that sound as you passed close to him ? He is spitting , Lily Gee , greeneyeddaughter of falseness  --  he is spitting after you as you go by . It would have been better if he had beaten you . But no matter . You will see Louie Fook tomorrow , and perhaps you and he will go away together . Ah , how proud he must be of what you have done ! There followed three long days and nights , three days of sick expectancy and three nights of stark disappointment ; for Louie Fook did not show his face either upon the streets of Chinatown or before the revolving doors of Tait 's Cafe . It could not be possible that he was afraid . Oh , no , Louie Fook was young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be ill . Lily Gee pondered and checked her sighs and let the hot tears gather when she closed the door of her room upon the eyes of the curious . Now as she passed the apothecary shops of Grant Avenue on her way home from work she fancied that the old men gave her something more than a passing glance , and she was quite sure that some of them rubbed their hands in satisfactionat seeing her thus alone.  |p209Now  the feast of blossoming lilies , the season of the New Year , drew on apace . Street stalls sprang up overnight along the curb , and for a short time the spirit of other days seemed to crowd the drab commonplace of the present into pallid obscurity . Mounds of sugar-dipped citron and candied lemon peel glistened under the electric lights ; diminutive goldfish beat their lacelike fins against the dull imprisonment of shiningtin cans ; enormous seed cakes stood out in rows of delectabletemptation . There were moments when Lily Gee , passing before this panorama of dying tradition , felt all the sweet simplicity of far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patter of sea-blown showers upon loosely swung canvas stall tops , punk sticks crumbling piously before crimson and green clad gods , glimpses of shrines piled high with yellow grapefruitand flaming oranges  --  what had new China to offer in place of all this ? And the answer came as quickly  --  love ! Ah , yes ; but where is Louie Fook , little dove of sudden mourning ? At home her father no longer kept to his place close to the wall , smoking his long , gnarled pipe ; instead he went about as he had done before the weapon of a Sen Suey Ying laid his house low in the dust . He saw her in the morning when she brought him tea and rice and again at the midday meal ; but he said nothing . Only when her back was turned she heard him spitting audibly between his scornful teeth . Once , Lily Gee had an impulse to seek out Louie Fook , to the extent of standing before his father 's house and calling his name softly . But the impulse died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a sudden end . Lily Gee , making her way down Grant Avenue to her evening work , came face to face with Louie Fook . He did not see her until she was almost upon him , and she fancied that for a moment he was ready to turn his back and flee . Still he managed to smile , and she said as quietly as shep210could : " Have you nothing to say to me , Louie Fook ? " He gave a glance at the jostling holiday crowds . They were before the doorway of the Hang Far Low . " Let us go upstairs , " he whispered . She put her hand in his , and they climbed two long flights . But the crowds were here also , packing themselves into every available nook , sipping their tea , and cracking li chee nuts . He looked about in weak dismay . " We can not talk here , " he said . She released her hold and crossed over to the open door leading to the balcony . A passing cloud was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted . She beckoned him . What will he find to say to you , Lily Gee , daughter of false hope ? It can not be that he has been ill ; no , he has too much bronze color in his cheeks for that . There , he has come out to you ! He is leaning against the wet balcony rail . Step closer to him , Lily Gee , so that you will not miss a word of what he is saying . What ? His " old man " has forbiddenhim ? He is not afraid , of course ; but his father has warned him thatSo this is young China ! Will you go back silently tonight , Lily Gee , and let your father spit again at your passing ? The son of your father is dead , Lily Gee , cut off before his time . Do you remember him , lying upon the gray-green cobblestonescovered with a black cloak ? It was on that night this youth of sweet words said to you at parting : " This will make no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I  --  we are young China . " And now it appears that his father has forbidden  --  No , do not laugh , Lily Gee , but think of your brother , and your father who has no second son , and the blood that is upon the head of these murderers . Well , you are young China , Lily Gee , and if love has failed you there are other ways to prove your mettle.  |p211He  is smiling at you , Lily Gee , as he leans dangerously against the slender balcony rail , smiling and asking you if you do not understand ? Yes , you understand perfectly . Your " old man " is shrewd , Louie Fook , and he cautions you well . Who knows , even now as you stand leaning dangerously against the railWait for one moment , Lily Gee ! Do you no longer love ? What difference does that make ? You are young China , and this man is a Sen Suey Ying who does as he is told . This man is a Sen Suey Ying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to thrust him back suddenly andWhat was that snapping ? Can it be that the rail has given away so quickly ? And that dreadful cry ? And the crowds hurryingin the street below ? Push your way out at all costs , Lily Gee , for you will be late to work . Remember , there are sweetmeats to be passed after the diners have eaten their fill . That snapping sound  --  will it never leave you , little spent candle of love ? Was it really the sound of a shattered balcony rail or was it your breaking heart , oh , clouded moon of joy ? You are home once more , Lily Gee . Here sits your father in his teakwood chair against the wall , smoking . And on every side sit , the old men who sorrowed with him . They have heard about the snapping rail at the Hang Far Low ; you can tell that by the silence which falls as you enter . But do they know everything ? Walk by your father swiftly and see if he spits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is this upon the table by your little bed , Lily Gee , daughter of your father ? Four pieces of gold and a wristlet of jade , and tiny oranges with a strange flavor , and a half score of blossoming lilies . It is the New Year , Lily Gee , and your father is a kind man . Did he not give your mother sweet perfumesand a ring of silver ? Ah , Lily Gee , take the bright ribbons from your hair and the seed pearls and the blue ornaments of enamel . And twist the thick strands into a stiff coil and bring it over your ear . And slick your truant locks into place with the oil that your mother used . For at last you have been spoken for  --  and the name of the bridegroom is sorrow . Do not cry aloud , Lily Gee , little flower without a butterfly , for your father may hear you in the outer chamber , and he will think that you do not like his gifts . See , on the table before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jade  --  and tiny oranges with a strange flavor  --  and a half score of blossoming lilies ! Your mother would have sung far into the night at such good fortune . But you are not your mother , Lily Gee ! Your mother was a happy woman ! She was never the avenger of her father 's house.  | THERE is a great deal of loose talk about racial differences . One is always hearing , for instance , about how hard it is for a white man to understand a man with yellow skin . One of the greatest differences alleged is in the matter of romantic love . Because Asiatics have a common-sense approach to marriage , it is assumed that they feel neither passion nor sentiment . And , yet , if you have lived all your life in San Francisco , as I have , you will know that all Chinese gangster warfare has at its root two things  --  women and opium  --  with the emphasis very decidedly on the first commodity . Take our old cook , Fook Gow , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little river town near Canton . About once every five years he took a twelvemonth off to go and prosaically visit them . But all this did not prevent him from dying before he was fifty over a bright bird of plumage whom he had seen and coveted . She was such an expensive baggage that he lacked her market price ; granting , of course , that her owner had been willing to yield her . So he took her forcibly one night at the point of a pistol . A week later he was found lying face downward in a pool of blood upon the slimy cobblestones of Spofford Alley . I was a youth then , and not given to analysis . But I have thought a hundred times since about Fook Gow and his last romantic flight which had ended in death . Especially does it come to my mind whenever I hear one of my countrymenp214comment on the dark , mysterious , inscrutable ways of his yellow brethren . Dark , mysterious , inscrutable they may be , but so are the ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was this frequent pondering on a much debatedand misunderstood question that made me the more ready to get at the root of the malady which suddenly descended on my serving man , Chung Bong . Bong was in his very early twenties , an American-born Chinese with a traditionalup-bringing that had retained for him a few qualities which make oriental servants of the old order the best in the world . He was still under the thumb of parental authority , for one thing . Every month his venerable father , a worthy merchant who owned and operated a chemist shop in Chinatownpaid me a ceremonial visit . He inquired first into my health and the state of content and then would proceed to cross-examine me as to the merits and shortcomings of his son . It was only upon extreme provocation that I ever admitted any of Bong 's delinquencies . But whenever I did , the fault was immediately rectified . I am a bachelor and frequently dine alone . In this way , I acquire a habit of talking to the men who serve me . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transitional type reaching out toward a wider horizon even though his feet were still planted more or less firmly upon familiar ground . I remember my first question . It was the first question that one always puts to youth : What did he propose to do with his life ? Like many a young man , his plans were nebulous except on one point  --  he was determined not to enter his father 's chemist shop . It was this decision that had bound him over to me , apparently . His father , unable to cope with his positive mood , had yet been able to control his negative disinclinations . Since Bong could not make up his mind what he wanted to do , the old man had made it up for him . It took very careful prodding to discover why he was so determined not to become a chemist . But in the end thep2I5truth came out . He had no faith in the efficacy of bundles of dried herbs for curing chills and fever . And the magic of virginal deer-horns in case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to discover for what ills his father sold the powdered sea-horses or the liquid from preserved rattlesnakes which are features of every chemist shop in Chinatown . But at this point Bong would always withdraw . Doubtless he felt the claims for these agencies too ridiculous to betray . His stand raised him infinitely in my eyes . He had enough character to decline to subscribe to a formula in which he had ceased to believe . But I knew that he was passing up a remunerative business and I shamelessly tried to argue him into compromising with his principles . " After all , " I used to say , " powdered sea-horses and virginaldeer-horns are no worse than a lot of the sugared pellets that pass as cures in an American drug-store . It is all ninetenthsmagic , anyway . People merely want something to believe in . A chemist 's business is to supply that something . It does nobody any harm ! " But to my delight , Chung Bong remained obdurate . " I must decline , " he answered in the gravely correct English that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit in which I have no faith . " We talked of other things , naturally . About religious beliefs , whether or not he was interested in sport , about his taste in women . I discovered that he still maintained a reverencefor ancestor worship and that he was a member of the basket ball team at the Chinese " Y. " But his taste in women was nebulous . He was shy and scornful on that subject all in one breath . His father had arranged a marriage for him with the youngest daughter of a craftsman who wrought settings in soft gold for jade and crude pearls . She was fourteen and still going to public school . He had seen her several times . He thought that she might make a very suitable wife.  |p216Beyond  that I could not get him to talk on the subject of women . Whether his disinclination arose from reserve or indifference I could not have said . He was old enough , certainly , and handsome enough to have been caught in the toils of sex . He was taller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no hint that he would ever be the sleek , rice-bellied man of affairs his father was . Different food , different amusements , a different continent was subtly beginning to mold a new race in Chung Bong  --  lengtheningthe flank , lifting the cheek-bone , rounding the eyes . But it was his complexion that was his chief glory , not sallow nor pasty yellow , but tinted warmly like a sun-ripened apricot . At the end of a year with me , he had become a priceless servant . He was always cheerful and busy . Not being of the generation that smoked opium , he never had moments of torpid moroseness . He cooked , swept , tended the garden and seemed the most contented youth in the whole world . I used to envy him . But he irritated me , too . I mean , I had a sense that youth ought to have less tranquillity , less evenness , less acceptance of fate  --  if one could so impressively designate the humdrum routine of keeping my neckties pressed , setting my table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , Chung Bong went to pieces . He burned my morning toast , let the ash trays go a week without emptying , allowed my pet dahlias  --  and his , too , for that matter  --  to die for want of watering . I remonstrated , cajoled , threatened , I told his venerable father , as a last resort . But to no purpose . I was on the point of dismissing him when I discovered something that hitherto had escaped me . Chung Bong was undoubtedly ill . I questioned him . He admitted that he felt badly . " Where ? " I inquired . " I can not say , " he answered . " I feel indisposed "  --  he made a sweeping gesture with his slender hands  --  " everywhere  --  all over ! "  |p217I  sent him to my physician . He was questioned , thumped , tested . Finally my doctor called me up . " There is only one thing the matter with that precious Chung Bong of yours . He is love-sick ! . . . Now do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen hundreds of cases . The best thing for him to do is to marry the girl . " Of course , the doctor was right . Once my eyes were opened to Chung Bong 's malady , I wondered that the truth had escaped me . There was nothing the matter with my servingmanexcept love , which means that everything was the matter with him . I worked for two weeks to wring a confession from him . Finally I wore him down . He had seen her at a banquet  --  an elaborate affair given by one of the richest members of the Six Companies . It had been a banquet for males , with female companionship as a matter of course in its later and less decorous hours  --  the first such , I gathered , that Chung Bong had ever attended . The lady of his fancy was a gaudy , little painted doll who had brushed past him once or twice , on her way to serve her lord and master of the moment with champagne . Her name was Woo Dip , which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close to Chung Bong as she dared without giving offense to the heavy-jowled gentleman whom she had been hired to beguile . It was a story as old as the world -- a callow youth dazzled by splendor and consumed with desire for the jeweled fruit which hung too high above the enchanted garden wall . That , reduced to a single sentence was his story . But there must have been Woo Dip 's story , too . One had only to look at Chung Bong to realize that something beside mere wantonnessmust have stirred Woo Dip 's discreet vibrations . Marriage , as my doctor had suggested , was one way to cure a grand passion  --  perhaps the most effective way . But there are halfway measures . And , knowing something of the life to which Woo Dip was committed , I fancied that a halfwaymeasure might not be a too remote possibility . I made a discreet and heavily veiled suggestion to Chung Bong to this effect . The dignity of his reply made me blush . " I wish Woo Dip for my wife , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered my chagrin by replying : " But , I thought you were already betrothed . Has the matter arranged by your father for the daughter of that worker in gold been called off ? " " Do you think that I can marry her , now ? " He hesitated for my reply and since I had none ready he finished : " Would you ? " " I am not a Chinese , " I said . " Neither am I , " he answered coolly . " I was born in San Francisco  --  as you were . I am an American . " By this time I had recovered myself . I was not going to be put out of countenance by a callow youth bent on swaggering . " Very well , then , according to American standards you will know how impossible it would be for you to take this Woo Dip out of the sort of life she has been leading and be happy with her . . . . Oh , for a time , perhaps , but I am thinking of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " " I do not follow you there , " returned Bong blandly . " Severalof San Francisco 's most prominent men have marriedsimilar women and founded most respectable families . " " Who told you that ? " I inquired defensively . " My father , for one . When he was accumulating money with a view to engaging in the chemist business , he worked for such a family . The sons and daughters now move in the best society . " Chung Bong 's statement was only too true . But his fatherp219would not have mentioned such backstairs gossip , even under provocation . I realized I was indeed dealing with a new generation , so I said quite frankly : " If you feel that way about it , what is to prevent you from buying Woo Dip in the open market ? She must have her price . " He shook his head . " It is hopeless . She is the property of a woman named Yick Foon . " " And what is there hopeless about that ? . . . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuated to give her up . " " Yick Foon 's price would be staggering . . . . She deals only in girls of the highest excellence . I could never hope to save enough to put down even a first payment . " " I know a number of officials whose duties take them into Chinatown . This Yick Foon might yield to pressure . " " I am afraid not . . . . You do not know Yick Foon 's power . She is said to have every official in the city upon her payroll . " " Rubbish ! " I cried . " I am not talking about petty officials I am talking about  --  " " I am afraid it is all the same , sir . " I did not know whether to be amused or angry . But the woe in Bong 's eyes made me suddenly pitiful . " I shall see my friends , just the same , " I promised . Chung Bong withdrew , bowing . I could see that he placed not the slightest faith in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repented of my promise to Chung Bong . A pretty spectacle I would make of myself , running around town , trying to arrange for the purchase of a Chinese slave girl ! Or , to put it more truthfully  --  trying to obtain possession of a slave girl by polite blackmail . I decided to begin by making some discreet inquiries re- garding the invincible Yick Foon . I went first to a judge , who referred me to the Chief of Police , who referred me to a captain on the Chinatown squad . Did he know a woman named Yick Foon , who dealt in human chattels ? He certainly did . A clever baggage if ever he saw one . For five years officials had been trying to get the goods on her . Even the Presbyterian Mission women had been unable to rescue a single one of her girls . Which was saying something , since it was not often that a girl brought to their attention eluded them . Remembering Chung Bong 's intimationsof graft in connection with Yick Foon 's activities I said scornfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department to make ? I mean , to confess being outwitted by an ignorant Chinese woman ? " " Ignorant , did you say ? . . . Why , Yick Foon speaks five languages . I do n't know about the rest , but her English , anyway , puts mine to shame . " " How would one go about arranging an interview with her ? " The Captain laughed . " The same way that a man would go about arranging an interview with a mountain quail . " I left his presence tingling with piqued curiosity . I made other inquiries  --  from an immigration official , from an interpreter , from an insurance broker with a white mother , who operated in the quarter . They all said the same thing : There was not one chance in a million of a white man obtainingan interview with her . My pursuit of Yick Foon began to take on the excitement of a fox hunt . Chung Bong grew thinner , more hollow-eyed , more neglectful of the ash trays and the pet dahlias . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have continued my pursuit of Yick Foon . By this time , sheer curiosity was drivingme forward . I wanted to see this woman for her own sake.  |p22IFinally  one day I ran into a streak of luck . I had a lawyer friend , named Minton , out to dine with me . The dinner was worse than usual . Bong had burned the steak to a crisp , boiled the peas until they were a watery mess and baked a pie that would have shamed a June bride . I apologized to my guest and told him Bong 's story . Then I mentioned Yick Foon and my pursuit of her . " I think I can arrange an interview for you , " he said when I had finished . " You say the boy first saw his inamorata at a banquet given by a member of the Six Companies ? Well , I have been doing legal business for that organization for years . They can bring pressure to bear upon this Yick Foon , if anybodycan . " But even then it was not as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six Companies were unobliging but Yick Foon stood firm . She had made a point never to have any contacts with white men . She was suspicious of them all . I must say I applauded her wisdom and resoluteness . Finally , I wrote her a letter myself , which I intrusted to Minton , which he intrusted to an agent of the Six Companies , who intrusted it in turn to Yick Foon 's emissary . In it , I told her very briefly Chung Bong 's story , assured her that my purpose in seeing her was merely to arrive at possible terms for making my serving-boy happy , and begged her to believe me to be a gentleman of honor who would scorn any betrayal of her trust in granting me an interview . At the end of a week , word came that she would see me on Monday night at eleven-thirty o'clock . I was to meet a guide a quarter of an hour earlier at the Hang Far Low , a Chinese restaurant on Grant Avenue , and he would escort me to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiss , if , the last stages of the journey , it were deemed necessary to blindfold me . Needless to say , I dispatched an immediate answer . It was to the effect that . I had every confidence in her judgmentp222and would submit to whatever conditions she thought advisable . My first concern was to decide upon a suitable present to take to Yick Foon . I knew the Oriental character well enough to realize that a gift was always accounted a graceful prelude to any performance , however serious . One fact concerning Yick Foon remained vague  --  her age . A woman could have told me at once , but every man who had seen her gave me the most indefinite sketch of her personality . Indeed , no two agreed . After a great deal of stewing , I decided to present her with a fan . Here was something that would please any woman , Chinese or otherwise , no matter what her age . And , of course , she must have a fan of Occidental make  --  somethingthat she could treat as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops in town . I must have looked over fifty or more fans  --  silk fans , gauze fans , fans made of ostrich plumes , Spanish fans , Persian fans , even a Japanese fan stamped with Sho-gun crests . In the end , I decided on a Watteau fan all shepherds and shepherdesses , exquisitelace , ivory sticks . Incongruous ? No more so than a sandalwood fan in the hands of one of my own countrywomen . I made a great point of the way it should be wrapped up . The Chinese are great sticklers for this and the container in which their gift arrives is often more exquisite than the gift itself . Promptly at eleven-thirty on Monday night , I entered the lower floor of the Hang Far Low . My precious gift was under my arm . A young man came forward , a very grave young man with thick tortoise shell spectacles astride his nose . He asked me my name and when I told him , he said : " I am Mr. Chang . . . . I am to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p223I  bowed . He struck out ahead . I followed , at a discreet and dignified distance . We went down Grant Avenue , past butcher shops with smoked duck hanging in the widows ; past vegetable stalls full of mustard sprouts , and soy bean cakes arranged in trim piles ; past the headquarters of merchants who imported Cantonchina , bolts of azure silk and preserved ginger in bluegrayjars ; past the chemist shop of Chung Bong 's father with its display of dried sea-horses , and pickled reptiles . Then Mr. Chang turned west and we began to climb the hill . We came , finally , out of the gaudy lights to a sinister looking lane . Mr. Chang halted . " If you will permit me , " he said , and without further ado began to bind my eyes with a cherry red silk handkerchief . I stumbled along a cobbled surface , one hand upon the shoulder of Mr. Chang . Finally my guide said , " We shall turn in here and begin to mount stairs . " I felt him swing round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There followedpoundings upon a door , shrill cries , the lifting of a heavy latch . As the door closed upon us , I felt myself enveloped in sultry air , heavy with the smell of camphor chests and sandalwood . " You may remove the bandage , " said Mr. Chang . I put up my hand and whipped off the cherry red hand-kerchief ! The room in which I found myself was in a pleasant halfgloom , but at once Mr. Chang switched on a series of lights which revealed its tempered splendor . The walls were entirelyhidden under hangings of apple-green satin embroidered in gold thread , the teakwood chairs and tables were chastely carved , the ornaments of irreproachable age and taste . There were no flowers in the room , but before a series of glass doors opening upon a balcony , stretched an exquisite line of jars filled with artificial flowers fashioned out of mother-of- pearl , coral , crude turquoise and crystal . The room was undoubtedly a combination boudoir and living-room because in a far corner stood a carved bed with curtains , and near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unguent jars . A tabouret drawn close to the bed held a red , lacquered tray upon which stood a spirit lamp for toasting opium and a pipe . I was studying this last significant item with more than a casual eye when I saw a portion of the apple-green hangings part . A slender hand and wrist imprisoned in rings and braceletsfirst made it appearance , followed by the completely dazzlingpersonality of Yick Foon . Her costume was too intricate for a mere male to grasp , but the outer jacket of pale blue silk lined with white fur , and her crown-like headdress from which hung veil-like strings of seed pearls were the first detailsto stamp themselves upon me . " How stupid ! " she said , advancing with an outstretched hand . " I should have been here to welcome you . . . . " I touched her fingers . She withdrew slowly , fixing me with a glance half humorous , half quizzical . " Ah , but I live a tiresomelife ! Arranging , arranging , always arranging for others ! " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She sat down before the mirror , and began to remove her headdress . I must confess she left me completely speechless . I had been prepared for an intelligent woman but I had not counted on a beautiful one . She was tall and of a larger frame than any Chinese woman I had ever seen and , as she began to rub off her elaborate make-up , very much as an actress would who had received you in her dressing-room , I saw that her skin was clear and healthy and the contours of her face youthful . The silence grew oppressive , awkward . Finally , feeling that I should say something , I shot out stupidly : " Permit me to compliment you on your English . . . . Notp225that I was unprepared to have you speak correctly . But , you have none of the stiffness , the constraints  --  " She turned and faced me . " You mean I speak colloquially , " she interrupted . " Well , I ought to . I had an English governess for ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wo n't you sit down ? " I was on the point of doing so when I remembered my gift . Advancing with a low bow , I laid the box in her outstretched hands . " Oh , how charming ! " She sat down and began to unwrap it . " They do all this very well , now , " she went on , indicating the huddle of discardedtissue and ribbon at her feet . She drew out the fan silently and opened it , opened and shut it , opened it again to the point where a beribboned shepherd was serenading his lovely shepherdess . She looked up at me  --  her eyes full of eagerness and delight . " Watteau ! " she breathed . " How did you guess that I should adore it ? " I felt myself blushing . It was too ridiculous to have this Yick Foon behaving like a young debutante , this Yick Foon who trafficked in flesh and was reputed to have every official in San Francisco 's Chinatown under her thumb . " I am delighted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little stiffly . My manner must have recalled her . She closed the fan with a sharp click . " And , now , " she said . " Let us get down to business . It seems you have a young servant who would like to possess one of my girls  --  which one , for the moment , escapes me . I was confident that nothing ever escaped Yick Foon , momentarilyor otherwise , but I answered very promptly and amiably : " I believe she goes by the name of Woo Dip . " " Oh , Woo Dip ! " She pursed her lips together . " My very greatest treasure . She earns more money than any five of thep226others put together . Still , if I get my price I have always made it a point to  --  " " What is your price ? " I interrupted bluntly . " Oh , I should say that three thousand dollars would be fair . " I studied my finger nails . " Well , you must realize that a young man who earns fifty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . " " I have cheaper girls . " " But my dear lady , if it were just a matter of a girl he is already provided with one , by his father . They were to have been married as soon  --  " " You mean that he wants Woo Dip  --  to marry her . But that is ridiculous ! Woo Dip is an ornament . She is a plaything . She is not the woman that a man marries . . . . You see , to be quite frank , I had an idea that it was you , yourself , who wanted to make a purchase . I fancied that all this talk about a servant was a blind . I should n't for one moment have wasted your time and mine if I had thought the issue concerneda schoolboy who earned fifty dollars a month , " she looked at me brightly . " Is he a very good cook ? " " He was until he saw this wretched Woo Dip . Why ? " She opened the fan demurely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  that is all . " I smiled . " It might be worth it , if Chung Bong were the only house-boy in the world . " " Precisely . I wonder that you did not figure that out at the very start . " " Well , to be quite frank , I am a silly old sentimentalist . Even males sometimes get caught by the match-making fever . . . . After all , no man is insensible to heart-break . This boy of mine is in a bad way . " She ignored my picture of suffering . " Would you like to see this Woo Dip ? . . . It might be a revelation to discoverp227how slight a circumstance can throw one of your sex into a blue funk . " " No , I am not the least bit interested . " " I admit it would be a waste of time . She is just an empty doll . If you bought her for him , in two months he would be burning your toast and oversalting your soup again out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her beyond a year . She is one of those females that have no wearing qualities . You understand . " I sat back in my prim teakwood chair and studied her . There was something extraordinarily bitter underneath the surface of her most railling remarks . My scrutiny must have been touched with rudeness for quite suddenly she lifted the Watteau fan to her face , shutting out everything but her baffling eyes . The effect of these almond-shaped orbs , looking out at me over the edge of a Watteau shepherd serenading his lady love was incongruous , extraordinary . " Well , " she challenged , " where do you want me to begin ? " I stammered apologies but she cut me short . " Oh , do n't protest . Naturally , you want my history . You want to know why I had an English governess for ten years , why I recognize a Watteau fan when I see one , whether there is any truth in the story that I speak five languages . " She closed the fan again . " I am only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " These things can be easily inferred . . . . Quite frankly , what baffles me is your choice of a trade  --  your profession . " She looked at me shrewdly . " You mean that as a compliment . Thank you . But a woman must live , you know . And we do what we can . . . . My mother died when I was a baby . My father was a wealthy Chinese merchant  --  a Harvardgraduate , to be precise . He grew to be very powerful in his province  --  a sort of contact man , if you will , for foreign firms and even governments seeking trade privileges and concessions . Naturally , with his contacts , with his training , he had advanced ideas . He gave me every educational ad-vantage . " She drummed upon the arm of the chair with her long painted finger nails and cleared her throat . " When I was fourteen , a war-lord came stamping through the country with his foul horde . My father closed the gates of his courtyardagainst them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ended by battering the gate down and running my father through with their swords . Then they snatched me from the arms of my English governess and dragged me screaming before their leader . Perhaps , you can guess the rest . " " Yes , I think I can , " I admitted . She brought the fan into play again , this time to shade her eyes . " At fourteen , then , I was the plaything of a filthy brute . But he soon tired of me and a year later sold me to a dealer in women from Canton . I passed from hand to hand until I at last found myself in San Francisco . How I finally won my freedom is unimportant . But I had intelligence . I learned how to meet men on their own ground . As I am meeting you tonight . . . . There you have the whole story ! " " No , " I said gravely , " not quite . There still remains unansweredyour choice of a profession . " She gave a shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said bitterly . I looked at her sharply . " No , I do n't think that explains it , quite . I should say that one climbs slowly out of a black pit . " " If at all , " she amended as she stood up . " If at all , " I agreed , matching her uprising . She put out her hand . " Good night . " " Good night . It 's been more than a pleasure  --  it has been a privilege to meet you . But , I 'm sure , I do n't know what to do about Chung Bong . I 'm quite certain he will die on myp229hands . If he does , I 'm going to send the bill for his funeral to you . " " Send him to me , instead . I think I can cure him . " " Are you serious ? " " Quite . Serious and consumed with curiosity . In fact , I 'm almost as curious to see this Chung Bong of yours , as you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously became flesh . I plunged my hand into my pocket and withdrew the cerise handkerchief . Yick Foon shook her head . " That will not be necessary , now . You are a man of honor and we are , therefore , friends . " I took her hand and kissed it . " Tomorrow night at this same time , " said Yick Foon smiling , " Mr. Chang will be waiting at the Hang Far Low for Chung Bong . That is , if he is prompt . " " He will be at the Hang Far Low on time if I have to bring him myself , " I answered . I went home very much elated . I was convinced , of course , that Yick Foon intended to yield up the delectable Woo Dip to my serving boy . The whole interview had been a marvel of Oriental indirection . Had she meant to do this all the time ? Were my avenues of approach powerful enough to make her wish to placate me ? Or was she acting upon sheer whim ? An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had she no lovers ? Or did every warm impulsefreeze into the steel weapons of revenge against a life that had betrayed her ? It was strange that a woman so blessed with humor should take the thrusts of fortune savagely . I told Chung Bong at breakfast . After that , my house might as well have been rid of his presence for all the service he rendered . But I forgave him . Since I had given my word that he would be at the Hang Far Low at the appointed hour , I took him down , in my car . He was dressed with scrupulous care for the occasion , in a blue serge suit and a brown fedora . I found myself wishing that his supple slenderness had been clothed in the lavender trousers and quilted jacket of brocadedplum silk that his forefathers had worn on feast days . But I had little doubt that even in the stiff ungainliness of blue serge , he would be more than desirable in the eyes of Woo Dip . I even fell to wondering what the sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would be pleased  --  that she would have a feeling of truant virtue at the thought of voluntarily thrusting Woo Dip into the arms of so personable a young man . The prompt and studious Mr. Chang was on hand to greet us , and I watched the two drift down the street with as much satisfaction as ever Juliet 's old nurse took in maneuvering to bring two lovers together . I was at the breakfast table fifteen minutes ahead of schedule next morning . Chung Bong came in with his usual grave quietness and laid the newspaper beside my plate . " Good morning , Bong , " I said , hopefully . " Good morning , " he repeated and walked calmly back into the kitchen . I looked after his retreating figure in amazement . One might have thought , under the circumstances , that he would have lingered a moment for my cross-examination . He must have known that I was consumed with curiosity . Ah , well , doubtless he was a little embarrassed ! . . . When he came back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back with my eggs but he was as stolid and uncommunicativeas the most traditional Chinese figure in a mystery melodrama . But one thing did not escape me  --  the fact that , for the first time in weeks my breakfast was cooked with irreproachable skill . I let him depart in silence after he had poured my coffee . But once I had finished , I rang the bell furiously . He came in , breathless , convinced no doubt , that Ip231was about to find fault with the eggs or the toast or the stickiness of the marmalade jar . I folded my newspaper deliberately . " Well , " I said , moving my chair back from the table , " what happened last night ? " He gave me a little bow . " Thanks to you , sir , I had a very pleasant evening . " A very pleasant evening . He was discreet to say the least ! But I was n't in the mood for discretion . I wanted details  --  respectable or otherwise . " Are you still as passionately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Woo Dip at close range ? " He bowed again . " I did not see Woo Dip last night . " " You did not  --  Oh , I understand . You merely talked about her . " I do n't know why I felt relieved but I suppose a puritan heritage flares up occasionally . " No , I do not think her name was mentioned . We seemed to find so many other interesting things to talk about . " " You mean Yick Foon and yourself . " " Yes . " " You are right . She is an extremely interesting woman . . . . And what , may I ask , just what did you talk about ? " A look of shyness came over his face . " I 'm afraid I talked a good deal about myself . " " And Yick Foon ? " " Well , she asked questions , mostly . She seemed to be very much interested in me  --  in what I thought , in what my hopes were . . . . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a shrug . " I knew , once , but that was a long time ago . For instance , when I met Yick Foon , she told me the story of her life , she did n't ask for mine . " " She must have had a very interesting career , sir . " " She has , " I said drily . " The next time you see her , you might ask her to tell you about it . " " I will , sir . "  | " You talked about your hopes . " " Yes , sir . " " And they did not include Woo Dip ? " " Well , I ca n't explain it , sir , but when Yick Foon asked me what my hopes were , somehow  --  " " Somehow , " I interrupted , " Woo Dip went completely out of your head . I can quite understand that . . . . Have you some coffee out there in the kitchen ? " " Yes , sir . " He bowed again and left me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with a bang against the table . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " I muttered . A week went by  --  two weeks . I asked Chung Bong no more questions . It really was n't necessary . One had only to look at the alert content in his slanting eyes or to watch the speed with which he cleared away the last black coffee cup and climbed into his blue serge suit and brown fedora hat to guess the truth . After all , I told myself , my chief concern was the prosaic matter of having a well-ordered house . How that end was achieved did n't matter . . . . The fact that it had been achieved was unmistakable . Chung Bong 's service was irreproachableto the point of monotony . Not even an occasionallapse gave my superiority scope . His venerable father was in the seventh heaven of delight at the good report which I was forced to give him , and went away to tell the father of Chung Bong 's affianced bride what a paragon of virtue he would one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt uneasy and cheap . It was all very well to assume indifference to the morals of an alien people en masse but a particular case was a particular case . There was no gainsaying that . And , besides , I did have a respon/sibility . Chung Bong 's father had left him trustingly with me , if not precisely in my care . He might not exactly have expected me to ennoble his son with pious examples or repetitionsof ethical maxims , but he certainly did not expect me to contribute to his delinquency . I do not think I would have been so covertly uneasy if I had had the slightest idea that Woo Dip was responsible for Chung Bong 's new and devastating content . After all , an empty doll with no wearing qualities might serve in the end to set Chung Bong 's feet firmly back in the path of respectability . But to fall into the hands of anybody as intelligently vicious as Yick Foon was another matter . I thought of her lasciviously beautiful apartment , the lamp for toasting opium before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against all males . I saw Chung Bong ruined beyond recall and I felt thoroughly ashamed of my hand in the matter . Not only ashamed but enraged at the ease with which Yick Foon had taken me in . I was old enough to have known that no man is a match for an embittered woman . On the whole , these twinges of conscience were fleeting . When a man turns fifty , his personal comfort is apt to rout so quaint a conceit as concern over his servant 's morals . But even in the matter of personal comfort I was to reap an empty harvest for , one morning , Chung Bong having poured me a second cup of his incomparable coffee , said : " I am leaving you the first of the month . " I laid down my coffee cup . " Indeed ! That is very strange  --  your father said nothing to me about it when he called last Friday . " I saw Chung Bong stiffen . " I am leaving on my own account . It is a personal matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to be calm . " May I ask what you are going to do ? " " Yes . I am taking a position in a hotel out of San Francisco . " He mentioned Walnut Grove , a river town in the asparagus country . " It will pay me very well and I can save money . " I was enraged to a point of sarcasm . " Save money ! You must be thinking of getting married . " Then without waiting for him to reply I said bitingly , " Permit me to congratulate you on coming so quickly to your senses . " Chung Bong lifted a napkin from a plate of toasted brioche heavy with melted butter . But he said nothing . I took a piece of brioche and bit into it viciously . I knew Walnut Grove well enough , filled with huddled lines of Oriental gambling clubs and bagnios ministering to coolies who worked on the delta lands . It was to these gambling clubs and bagnios that opium was shipped , and San Francisco slave girls were deliveredwhen the bloom had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foon was planning , now , with my respectable serving boy , Chung Bong , as a confederate . A generation ago the problem would have been easy : I should have sent for Chung Bong 's father and that would have been the end of the matter . But I saw clearly that times had indeed changed . Chung Bong 's acknowledgment of parentalauthority was a pleasant fiction that he maintained only when the issues involved were of no moment to him . Likewise , the old confidence between master and slave  --  or master and hireling , if you prefer  --  was a thing of the past  --  the economy of his explanations proved that . He was leaving me on the first of the month , what had inspired his move was none of my business . I must confess I felt hurt . Chung Bong owed me more than that . And , damn it all , I had grown fond of him . I decided to attempt to see Yick Foon . Surely she must have a code , a sense of justice  --  a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my sex but there were plenty of masculinep235targets for her to shoot her poisonous dart at without destroyingan innocent youth . The night that I had departed from her presence minus the silken kerchief over my eyes , I had taken care to mark attentively the approach to her lodgings . I knew that I could find them again but would I find her ? Late morning would be the best time to make the attempt , I thought . Her afternoons and especially her nights would be too filled with the demands of her profession . I dressed very carefully and soberly . I knew the Chinese respect for dignity and I felt that the formality of spats and a cane would not be lost on even so callous an Oriental as Yick Foon . In the end , I felt a little pompous and ridiculous , like the baritone father in " La Traviata " seeking out Violetta in her sylvan retreat . The nearer I drew to Yick Foon 's dwelling , the more convincedI became that my trip would come to nothing . It was inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past wickets and barred doors and sentries , much less be admitted to her presence . So I contented myself with planning a next move as I climbed the musty passageway up which Mr. Chang had piloted me less than a month ago . As I halted before the faded crimson door at the head of the stairs , I almost doubted that any splendors lay beyond so shabby an approach . Had I dreamed the satin-lined boudoir of Yick Foon , and the row of porcelain jars filled with flowers wrought in crystal and jade , or the red lacquered tray with its sinister pipe and toasting lamp ? Had I dreamed even Yick Foon herself , with her outer jacket of pale blue silk lined with white fur and her headdress from which seed pearls fell like a thin veil of frozen dew before her eyes ? I beat upon the door  --  once , twice  --  a third time . I heard a pattering sound and , then , a woman 's voice said clearly and in perfect English : " Who is there ? " " A visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Yes  --  but whom ? " I was sure , incredible though it seemed , that it was Yick Foon , herself , speaking . " It is I  --  Chung Bong 's master , " I answered . I heard the latch lift . The door swung open . A drab female figure in a shiny alpaca jacket and trousers stood in the doorway . I looked at her sharply . It was Yick Foon . Part of my dream already had dissolved . I never realized until then how much artifice enters into a woman 's allure . Divested of her silken trappings , her rings , her bracelets , her seed-pearls , Yick Foon was a little gray wren who might , momentarily , have stopped stirring a pot of rice for her lord and master 's midday meal . She gave me her hand without affectation and drew me to the inner passage and shut the door . " You caught me just in time , " she said . " Tomorrow I should have been gone . " By this time we stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its magnificence . But not a trace of splendor remained . A room , I decided , as I looked at these stark walls , was like a woman  --  it needed adornment to give it point . A half-dozen packing poxes stood about corded with bamboothongs . Into these I had no doubt were piled the applegreensatin hangings , the jars of porcelain sprouting jeweled blossoms , the teakwood divan curtained with silk . You caughtme just in time . Tomorrow I should have been gone . Assuredly . To the river country whence they shipped fading slave girls and opium for the delectation of brown coolies and toothless old men who cooked for harvest crews . I felt a distinct repulsion . " You knew , of course , that I was leaving . " Her voice recalled me . " I know it now , " I said , waving my cane toward the packing boxes . " Chung Bong was discreet . He told nothing except what was absolutely necessary.  |p237I  congratulate you on having chosen such a prudent partner in crime . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should not have told you . " " Perhaps not . But the less one says about such a squalid business the better . " I looked sharply at Yick Foon . She was laughing at me . Not with her lips but with her eyes , with her lifted shoulders , with her clasped fingers . My voice rose in irritation . " A great Englishman once said that vice lost half its evil by losing all its grossness . I  --  " " It was Edmund Burke who said that , " hastily interrupted Yick Foon . " I  --  I never quite believed it . But I do today . Somehow , here , " I swept the room again with my cane , " you made your vicious life seem shot through with a kind of beauty . Perhapsit was gross but it did n't seem so . But selling dope and damaged goods to beasts  --  Bah ! " I stopped to recapture my self control . " What you do with your life is of no moment . I mean , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . But , I 'd think you would be more sporting than to trap a youth who was sent to you in all innocence . " " Innocence ! " Yick Foon lifted her eyebrows . " He may have come to me in all innocence , but he was not sent in any such fashion . From a man of your age , that is a bit too thick . Come , now , confess , what was your motive in sending Chung Bong to me ? " " I wanted to see him happy . I wanted to sec him marry the girl of his choice . " She gave a laugh . " What a hopeless romanticist ! . . . Well , is n't he ? " " Is n't he what ? " " Is n't he marrying the girl of his choice ? " " You mean that Woo Dip  --  " " I do n't see where you ever got the impression that Woo Dip was the girl of his choice . "  | " I only know what he told me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me archly . " He never mentioned her to me . " A sudden light began to dawn . " Do n't tell me that you are going to marry him ? " " Why not ? " Her tone was defiant . I hesitated and then said quite brutally , " Well , for one thing , I should n't think a husband would fit into your scheme of things . I should n't think that a husband would be exactlyan asset in your business . " " Suppose I gave up my business ? " I glanced skeptically at the dismantled rooms  --  at the packing boxes corded with bamboo thongs . " So that 's it . . . . Wo n't you find the role of wife in a California river town a little boring ? . . . " She did not answer and I rapped one of the chests with my cane . " Well , at least you 're taking your splendor with you . That ought to help some . " She shook her head . " I 'm taking nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still did not believe her . " But what 's to become of the girls  --  Woo Dip and the rest ? " She shrugged . " Packed off respectably to the Presbyterian Mission . All except Woo Dip . I sent Woo Dip to the Catholics . She was much too decorative to be a Protestant . " " What an extraordinary woman you are ! " " Are n't we all ? . . . I mean , one never knows . " A look of strange innocence had settled on her face . " Areyou really very much in love with Chung Bong ? " I inquired . " Do n't ask silly questions , " she said . I gave her my hand . She pressed it warmly . " I said I was leaving everything behind . That was n't quite true . " She went over to a window ledge and picked up a slender oblong box which I recognized . She took out the Watteau fan and flung it open . The beribboned shepherd was still serenading hisp239lovely shepherdess . " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a wretched sentimentalist , " I chided . " No more than you . " " But I 'm an American . " She looked at me gravely . " And I 'm a woman , " she answered.  | THE first week in August was a memorable one for Dan Simpson . It was then that he went down to Potterville and brought back Janet Horner to share his bed and board , and it was then that he saw Fate setting in motion its plan to destroy ignobly his lifelong enemy . Many a night , secure in the possession of the palely lovely girl beside him , he would waken to the clamor of the sheriff and his hounds , floating toward him on the clear mountain air . Sometimes Janet would waken , too , and cling to him in terror . " ' Tai n't nuthin ' , honey , " he would whisper . " Jest old Buck Donald running down Tony Luna . It beats all how that greaser can hold out ! " And he would chuckle at the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August high altitudes breed frosts . But his humor held something sharper than mere amusement . He felt the malignant satisfaction of a man who could hate and hate profoundly . Tony Luna was to him a varmint that it was pleasant to corner and worry to death . If , when he awoke , the hounds were still baying and the day promised to be hot , he felt renewed satisfaction . Unless Tony had managed to bury himself in a cool thicket near a stream-side , a hot day in the California mountain country could be even worse than a frost-bitten night . There were countless slopes where a man could tramp for hours amid overhanging boughs of fir and pine and cedar that should have yielded streams , as dry underfoot as the white desert country east of Mesquite . For the soil was powdered lava and greedily drank up snow-banks . While in the canons , ravished by successive fires and reclaimed by stunted manzanita and buckthorn , the sun at noonday became a pestilence that only foul buzzards could endure . Once or twice the clatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of saddling his horse and joining in the chase . But a highlander 's contempt for the law dissuaded him . He would have leapt into the saddle to ride down an enemy and shoot him full of holes , but he was too much a Simpson to turn over the meanest of his foes to the sheriff . By inheritance loyalties and feuds were to him personal issues . His parents had been Kentucky mountaineers before they had trekked West in the gold rush , and their parents beforethem . And there had been dim talk in the family circle of Scottish highlands further back . But while Dan Simpson 's code would not let him aid the law , he hoped in Tony Luna 's case that the law would captureits man . For he never remembered a time when there had not been bad blood between them . At the district school , at their first rodeo , at the faro table , at crap games , drunk or sober there had been always a rivalry that went beyond mere competition  --  a hatred fundamental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too gallant an ending for such vermin . If it had not been , he would have shot it out with Tony beforeeither of them had come of age . But gallant ending or no , he would most certainly have shot it out with Tony for daring to lift his eye toward Janet Horner , if she had not dissuaded him . Funny critters , these women ! They could shrink from a man and yet plead for him . If he had thought for a moment that  --  But he did n't think it , he always told himself , with a laugh to still the rage brewed by even the most innocent of suspicions . He had frightened Janet with the vehemence of his crossexaminationon that first day when he had read Tony 's lovep245for her in a glance that only a jealous man could have interpreted . " Has he ever made sheeps ' eyes at you ? " " Sheeps ' eyes  --  do n't be silly ! " Has he ? " " No . " " Has he ever spoken to you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same  --  " " You know what I mean . " " No . " " Has he ever touched you ? " " Touched ! " " With his hand ? " You mean  --  " " Jest that . Has that greaser 's fingers ever  --  " " No . " His heart was still pounding in nasty panic as he snatched her into a rough embrace . " He 'd better not ! " was all he said . But the vision of Tony 's sun-dried fingers laid even lightly against the creamy whiteness of Janet 's skin had pursued him from the moment he had put such a possibility into words . And like all imagined things this at last came true at a Fourth of July celebration in Potterville , when Janet was Goddess of Liberty . Dan had n't cared much about seeing Janet sitting up on a throne and hauled through Main Street for Mexicans and Indians to smirk over . And he cared about it less when he saw her in her white silk gown with arms and throat bare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was so beautiful that , being in love and being a miser , he wanted her for himself alone . But it had been too late to change anything . The best he could do was to ride beside the glittering float and screen her as much as possible from the gaze of the lascivious . But he could feel their eyes burn through him , and once a bold voice cried out for him to move his horse forward so all might see the goddess with hair as yellow as the spiked circlet of gold which crowned her . He glanced sidewise to find the lips of a Basque shepherd from Crane Flat framing a repetition of the request . He made a movement toward his hip pocket . The voice died to a frightened mumble while Dan 's friends on the sidelines cheered faintly . At this moment , one of the horses drawing the float began to rear and plunge about . Dan Simpson used his spurs effectivelyand was at the frightened animal 's bit in an eye 's twinkling . A dozen eager hands flew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw a sight which shook him to white-lipped rage . Tony Luna was helping Janet down from her throne  --  his sun-dried fingers pressing blackly against the soft white curve of her arm . Tony Luna 's crime had been a particularly foul one . Up by Heron Falls there had lived for years an old Mexican woman named Chiquita Mareno . She was a toothless hag , but there was talk of her beauty in the days when she gave her favors freely for gold nuggets which the miners panned out of the shallow pools of Heron Creek . There was likewise gossip of a box of these nuggets buried under the knotted pine floor of her cabin . Dan Simpson had known her always . He used to stop and smoke a Mexican cigarette with her when he drove cattle up to Big Meadow for summer grazing . On such occasions she never failed to fetch him a drink of tequila . It was vile stuff and burned even a throat hardened to grappa and moonshine , but Dan Simpson used to down it with a flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll always have your health and beauty , senorita ! " Whereat she would smile a cracked smile that displayed her purple gums and rate him soundly for a liar and a thief.  |p247The  last time he had passed her cabin was the morning before his wedding day . He was coming back from Big Meadow whither he had gone this time to sell two heifer . lives to a homesteader who was clearing ground for a mountain farm . As usual he drew rein and halloed gently . I le halloed twice  --  a third time . Then he got down off his horse to investigate because he saw that the senorita 's cabin door was open and he knew that she could not be far away . 1 le was right . She was no further away than the inside of her cabin where she lay quite dead in a pool of blood . She had been stabbed six times and near the door was the villainous two-edged knife that had done the deed . The floor of the wretched room had been torn up and the dirt underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look twice to guess part of the tale . The woman had been slain by one of her countrymen  --  thebloody knife on the threshold proclaimed that  --  slain by some wretch who had believed the old wives ' tale of her buried treasure . Dan Simpson waited only long enough to be quite certain that the woman was dead . He disturbed nothing  --  not even the knife clotted with blood . He leapt to his saddle and viciously spurred his horse 's belly , turning him in the direction of Potterville . He came back in the early afternoon with Sheriff Donald and his son . Buck Donald took one look at the knife . " I reckon we 've as good as hung our man , " he drawled . " I know that knife . Tony Luna won it from me at a crap game the last time we had a rodeo at Potterville . " He stopped and turned to Dan . " Want to go with us and run him down ? " " Who  --  me ? " Dan Simpson 's tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't nuthin ' I 'd like to do better , " he half lied . " ' Cepting I calculated on gettin ' married tomorrow . " " Then , that lets you out ! " said Buck Donald . " I reckon it does ! " returned Dan.  | There came the morning when the hounds ceased their baying . Dan said to Janet : " Well , I reckon , they caught Tony Luna at last . What d'yer say if we ride down to the turnstilenear China Gulch and watch ' em bringing him in . From the sound of them dogs yelping jest afore they quit , I 'd say they got him somewhere between Heron Falls and Big Meadow . . . . They oughter be at China Gulch any minute , now . " Janet was at the stove frying salt pork . She had her back turned to her husband . " You go ' long if you want ter . I got some work ter do . " " What kind o ' work ? " " I picked a mess from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em into jam . " " Yer can do that tomorrow . " " Well , if it 's another hot day  --  " " Put ' em in a cool place , they 'll keep all right , " he broke in , anticipating her excuse . She carried the frying pan to his plate and scraped the golden brown slices of salt pork into it . " Well , there 's still plenty to do around here even if I do put off jam making . . .. Maw 's coming up next week to look things over , and you know how Maw is ! " She ran a hand caressingly over the stubble of his chin , to soften the sting of her implication that his cabin was not in the state to meet her mother 's critical eye . He caught her fingers and pinched them playfully . " Yer do n't mean ter say yer ai n't got this ole shack fixed up yet ? . . . Why , for most a week , now , yer ai n't done nuthin ' but slop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't dry out till Christmas . " She sat down and poured herself some coffee . " That ain'tp249nuthin ' to what I 'm a-going to do before I get through .. . . Yer just wo n't know this place ! " He looked into eyes smiling eagerly at the prospect of convertinga cattleman 's cabin into a home , and his heart warmed anew toward her . " I do n't know it , now , " he teased . " If yer keep on I 'll be out bunking with the horses . " " Oh , " she mocked , " so you 're talkin ' about running out on your wife , already ! " You started it ! " he chaffed . " Me ? " " Sure thing . Only bin married , a week and the first time I want my wife to go skylarkin ' , she turns me down  --  cold ! " " Skylarkin ' ! You got a funny idea o ' skylarkin ' , Dan Simpson  --  ridin ' down to see a man brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures like women should feel that way . But he wanted her to go along , nevertheless . He wanted Tony Luna to see her , standing beside him , as the sheriff drove him to his doom . " Yer ai n't goin ' ter see a man brought in for murder ! " he threw at her scornfully . " Well , even if he was a dog  --  " She broke off and caught at a stray wisp of hair . " He ai n't even that . No siree ! Dogs do n't tear folks to pieces unless  --  " " Do n't they ? Paw once had a shepherd dog that  --  " " You know what I mean ! " he interrupted impatiently . She stirred her coffee , her lips pressed tight . Finally she said : " It do n't do ter hate any body that much . " He shoved his chair back and rose , hitching up his trousersbelligerently . " Why not ? " he demanded . " Because it do n't . . . . It kinder comes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " I ai n't afraid . Hating a varmint like Tony Luna ca n't bring me nuthin ' but luck . " He walked to the door . " Are you coming with me , or ain't yer ? " He saw a flicker of indecision in her eyes . " Suit yerself ! " he finished coolly . She half-rose in her seat . " If yer want me  --  " " Course I want yer ! " He crossed the room and drew her toward him , turning her lips up to his for a kiss . " Dog-gone if you ca n't tease a man ! " The day promised to be warm but the air was still fresh , like a spring day in the foothill country . Already the sun was bringing out the smell of pines and firs . Janet 's horse came trotting out of the barn down the lane-like road to where Dan stood holding the bridle of his horse in one hand and the wide-swung gate in the other . Dan Simpson was an exception to the ordinary run of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower foothills . He had his range of foothill country , to be sure , with a bunkhouseon it where he made a shift of living from October to March . But his heart was in the little patch of ground that had been his father 's farm up here where one could feel night 's refreshment even in the blazing month of July . He loved the view from the rickety porch hanging crazily to a cabin of slabs turned silver-gray by forty years of wind and weather . He loved the field of timothy to the west , and the orchard of twisted apple trees and even the potato patch which he hired an old half-breed Indian to hoe . Sometimes he felt a little ashamed of this preference . It savored of softness . What traffic did a cattleman have with fields of timothy , and apple orchards , and potato patches , and cool mountain nights ? Cowboys were born to the hot , sunburnt hills that were mere stepping stones to the green sierra beyond . They were born to the smell of red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolness of sluggish water holes.  |p251But  Dan Simpson was not the lord of ten thousand indifferentcattle that were sleek or gaunt at the caprice of the skies . He preferred a picked herd which he counted by the hundreds , instead . And when the sun smote the lower ranges and seared them to a tawny yellow , he mounted his horse and drove his cattle up to green pastures . So , in a measure , he justified his preference for highlands . But , this morning , looking at Janet 's pale glory as she rode past the open gate he felt his preference justified by something more than the sleek content of a hundred or more head of grazing cattle . Janet might have been born in the palpitantfoot-hill country , but she belonged to the mountains . There was something serene and cool about her beauty . It was not made to burn and shrivel in the hot dusts of a foothillsummer . He closed the gate and hopped into his saddle . Janet drew rein and waited for him to come up with her . " Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " Oh , the road ! " she cried eagerly . " It 's longer . " He drew his brows together . Had she chosen thus in the hope of being too late to see Tony Luna drive by ? She smiled at him : " And then we can ride side by side . " He felt the quick beat of a foolish joy in his heart , as he checked his horse always impatient to be in the lead . And then we can ride side by side . Funny what a few words could do to a man . Well , it did n't matter now if they were late for the grim procession . The horses broke into a trot . Dan 's mount kept forging ahead . " Hey , there , Broncho ! " warned his master . " Ai n't yer got no manners ? Or no ears ? Ai n't yer jest heard a lady choose us for traveling companions ? " It shore gave a man a grand feeling to have his woman want him by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to know that she trusted him , looked up to him . It made a man feel sorter solemn , too . Made him wonder whether it would always be that way  --  whether he 'd always be a figure to be proud of . Course if she knew some things ! Shucks , as men went , he would n't stack up so bad ! Side by side ! Side by side ! The cadence of Janet 's last phrase hummed through his mind with the hoof beat of the horses . Side by side ! Side by side ! He began to think of the future . In the fall when he drove his cattle down to the foot-hills again , would he take Janet into Potterville for the winter or fix up his bunkhouse on the range ? He 'd have to ask her . Not now  --  there was something about the silence between them now that could n't be shattered . It was too happy a silence . The bunkhouse as it stood was n't much . But it had an oak tree a hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it blazed with ten thousand wild blossoms . Suddenly he thought of Tony Luna . After all , there was n't any need to miss the show he 'd come for . This would be the last time he would ever see him , perhaps . It would be like looking at a dead enemy in his coffin . He glanced at Janet . Her gentle beauty caught at him again like a magic thing and made him ashamed of his thoughts . But the next instant , the dark mood overwhelmed him , and he said with the suppressedeagerness of a child impatient to be early for a fete : " Let 's speed ' em up ! " He did not wait for her reply , but digging the spurs into his horse , they flew ahead . In a second , her horse was by his side . Thus they galloped until they reached the turnstile above China Gulch where their road and the road from Heron Falls met . Dan swung to the ground and lifted Janet down . A drippingspring mired the road at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin can that some wayfarer had left for any who passed and lacked a drinking cup . Dan held the can under the crystal trickle until it brimmed over , offering it to Janet . She shook her head , and he gulped with a primitive content while she ran her fingers along a fringe of moss from which the water dropped.  |p253He  put the can back in place and glanced searchingly down at the moist roadway for evidence of fresh hoof-marks . " Ai n't nobody crossed here this morning , " he announced jubilantly . She turned away from the refreshing touch of the moss bank , and her lips framed a reply that trembled and died . But he saw a look in her eyes which made him know that in her heart she was saying : " I 'd hoped we were too late . " At that moment a clatter of hoofs and the sound of voices broke suddenly upon them . " They must jest have come ' round the bend near Filmer 's Point , " he said excitedly . She caught at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dan did the same thing with his animal . The sounds came nearer , oaths , a horse 's whinney , the muffled yelp of a hound . . . . Presently the cavalcade hove in sight . Tony was sitting on a horse led by Jim Donald the sheriff 's youngest son . His hands were tied behind him . Buck Donald came after , his rifle across his saddle . A couple of deputies followed with a dozen footsore hounds bringing up the rear . Janet shrank against the moist flanks of her horse . The animal turned his head curiously but he did not stir . Dan stepped into the middle of the road . Jim Donald drew rein . The clatter of hoofs against hard pan ceased abruptly . The horses stood twitching their legs against the pest of flies , the dogs with dripping tongues sank down and began to lick their torn paws . The sheriff wiped his forehead with his coatsleeve and took a chew of tobacco . " Waal , " he drawled , with a nod toward the prisoner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet for the first time his face turned red and he lifted his hat . Dan looked at Tony . He had never seen a sorrier sight . The wretch 's knees gaped bleeding through torn denim overalls , his shirt was in shreds . For a mouth he had a festering slit that disclosed a blackened tongue and his head , raw with wounds from thorn and brier , was a feeding ground for monstrous horse-flies . But his eyes blazed scornful fire , and he met Dan Simpson 's gaze without a tremor . For the fraction of a second , Dan felt a gust of pity but his softness passed . He had only to think of the six horrid wounds in the withered body of the old Mexican woman to steel himself against even a truant compassion . The men began to dismount , laving their brows in the cool drip from the spring , drinking deeply from the shining tin can . Refreshed , they squatted down on their haunches , ready for a bit of neighborly gossip . They talked of the antelope that Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen that Ben Truman was building at Rocky Ford ; of the two-headed calf that a maverick cow on Folsom 's range had given birth to . They talked to Dan , awkwardly ignoring the presence of a woman , except to keep their speech free of oaths . All this time Janet kept her place at her horse 's side , and all this time Tony Luna sat uprightupon his mount , without a quiver , suffering the swarm of flies upon his wounded head and swollen lips . From time to time , Janet would steal a glance at this misery and as quickly drop her eyes . The men were not interested . Finally , the thin trickle of conversation gave out . With one movement the men straightened themselves , moving amid a rattle of spurs to their horses . The horses , eager to be gone , shook their manes and stamped their feet ; the tired dogs began to rise wearily . As the last man swung into his saddle , Janet left her post and moved hurriedly toward the spring . She took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a flash , Dan realized what she intended to do . He met her halfway as she advanced toward Tony Luna , the water spilling over because of her trembling hand . " Here , " he said , " I 'll give it to him . " He took the water from her and carried it to Tony 's side.  |p255The  prisoner leaned forward inviting him to hold the drink to his lips . Dan lifted the can higher and in that moment the two men 's glances met . A look of dreadful venom flashed from Tony 's eyes . He stooped lower , as low as his bound arms would permit , and , with a hissing sound , spat moistly in Dan Simpson 's face . The can clattered to the ground . Dan made a move toward his hip pocket . He felt Janet 's hand upon his shoulder . He turned to her . She was holding out a handkerchief to him . He bent down to her as she took the bit of spotless linen and wiped the malignant drool from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned again to Tony Luna sitting erectly in his saddle , a noxious smile parting his cracked lips . " So , yer wanted me to shoot yer , eh ? " he said with a slow drawl . " Nothin ' doin ' , my friend . I 'll get ten times the kick seein ' yer hung ! " On the first of September , Dan got a chance to drive fifty head of cattle into Nevada and sell them at an advanced price . The purchaser wanted fifty head of sleek cattle in a hurry , and since no herd from the lower levels could match the green-pastured drove that Dan owned , an offer was made to him . He fingered his hat awkwardly , like a boy begging a favor , when he told Janet about it . " You shore brought me luck , honey , " he said , as a soothing preliminary . " I got a chance to clean up some easy money . . . . Only I got ter be gone ten days or so . . . . D'yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yer while I 'm gone ? . . . Or mebbe yer could go down ter Pottervilleand visit a spell with her . " " I could n't do neither , " said Janet decisively . " But , honey , what 'll yer do ? Yer ca n't stay here , alone . "  | " I shore can . If I 'm married to a man that 's got ter go running off here there and everywhere , why I guess I jest naturally got ter put up with it . . . . Leastways , I ai n't goin ' back to Potterville and my maw  --  and me not married a month . " He knitted his brows . He could handle a male or a horse that balked but a balky female stumped him . " Yer mean ter say yer goin ' ter stay in this here shack , alone . " She went up to him with a pretty swagger , her hands clasped behind her . " No , I never said I was , I said I could ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see  --  " He broke off in boyish perplexity . " Of course yer do n't ! " She put up her lips and brushed his with a kiss . " I 'm agoin ' with you , yer old silly ! " " Waal , of all things ! " He caught her to him and kissed her fiercely . " D'yer really think  --  I ai n't sure it 's anything you 'd like , honey . Fifty head o ' cattle kick up a devil of a lot o ' dust . And them trails when yer git into Nevada ai n't anything else but ! " " I told yer I was goin ' and goin ' I am ! " Janet insisted . " I ai n't never been over into Nevada . Besides , I always wanted a honeymoon trip . " " A honeymoon trip ! Driving fifty ornery critters into Nevada a honeymoon trip ! Shucks ! " But he was tickled all over . After all , he had married a gal ! For a week he 'd been disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luna his cheeks had burned . To be humiliated before Janet ! That had rankled . He 'd carried it off with a swagger but it had burned him up just the same . He 'd been wondering what Janet had thought about it  --  whether or not she had  --  He could n't quite put into words just what he thought had been the effect of Tony 's insult on Janet . But he felt uneasy . He did n't have to wonder any more . She wanted to go with him . . . along a dusty road , behind two hundred hoofs kicking up the dust !  |p257That  was telling him what she thought about him , all right ! But that very day he got a summons to appear at the Court House in Potterville to testify in the case of the People of the State of California vs . Tony Luna . " Shucks ! " he said , showing the paper to Janet . " I guess that about finishes our honeymoon trip . " Janet knew nothing about the law , but like every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not prepared to surrender that quickly . " Maybe yer can get out of it some way ! " she ventured . " Get out of it ? Me ! Yer forget  --  I was the man who found the old woman . " " Well , go in and see Buck Donald . . . . After all , it ai n't jest a honeymoon trip . Yer 'll lose the chance to sell them cattle . " He was unpersuaded , but he saddled his horse and rode down to Potterville that afternoon . " Shore there 's a way out , " said Buck Donald . " We 'll jest take your deposition . There wo n't be nuthin ' to the trial , anyway . It 'll be over in a day  --  two at the most . " And so they went around to Jim Clark the notary and Dan signed a paper in his presence full of words like inasmuchand whereas , and the thing was done . " Too bad yer . agoin ' ter miss the fun , " said Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be back fer the hangin ' , " laughed Dan . He was more in love with Janet than ever . She had a head , that girl . If it had n't been for her he 'd have lost a good sale . There was no need for Dan to have had any misgivings about Janet standing the trip into Nevada . She met every difficulty , every discomfort , like a thoroughbred . Almost from the start the sun beat down upon them with sardonic fury and the dust rose in choking clouds which grew denser as they left the firmer ground of the mountains and plunged into the gray-green desert powdered with fine sand . Wind storms swept upon them and often they made camp upon a site with only a brackish water hole to recommend it and yield them squalid refreshment . But through it all Janet kept her temper and , what was the most amazing thing to Dan , her trimness . She had a trick of binding up her hair to shut out the dust ; even when they lacked water she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh to his kisses . But if the going had its hard moments , the return was a sheer delight . There was a moon , and so they traveled at night in a white light that shamed the day with its silver enchantment . The only dust , now , came from the hoofs of their horses traveling so swiftly that it flew behind like the scarf of a dancer in a breeze . They saw the moon set wanly , and the dawn come with blazing vehemence as they urged their steeds forward to the next water course . If the stream was pure and rippling , they plunged nakedly into it and , thus refreshed , slept in a green shadow of willows until the heat of noon roused them . Never had Dan felt life so keenly , so completely , so sensuously . Every care , every rancor faded from him . The past was forgotten , the future was not even an anticipation , only the present touched him . An introspectiveman might have challenged such profound happiness but Dan Simpson merely accepted it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high sierra showed faintly to the west . " We 'll soon be home , " said Dan with curious grimness . " I 'm sorry , " replied Janet . He looked at her soberly . " So am I  --  but I did n't think a woman  --  " She caught his hand . " We 'll never be alone , again , " she said.  |p259And  almost as an answer to this prophecy , a faint puff of desert dust moved out of the western horizon . It crawled nearer like an ominous cloud across the face of a fair day and the two felt a gust of strange foreboding as they rode forward to meet reality coming toward them . It proved to be Buck Donald and his son driving a dozen head of unbroken horses into Mesquite for a rodeo . " What 's the news ? " asked Dan perfunctorily , for the first time in his life resentful of a world from which he had briefly escaped . Buck Donald took the inevitable chew of tobacco . " Waal , lemme see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Baptist meeting house in Potterville 's burned up last week . An ' Tony Luna 's been convicted . " Dan Simpson sat silent in his saddle for a moment . He was surprised to discover how far away in ten days all these familiar things could fade . Even his hatred for Tony Luna had become numbed . " How long was the trial ? " he said finally . " Two days . " " Been sentenced ? " " No . Judge Belshaw 's bin sick . . . . He 'll hang all right . Ai n't nuthin ' to that . . . . That greaser 's shore got it in fer you . Says he 'll get yer yet . . . . " Dan felt a flush of sluggish anger creep into his face . " Get me ? " he sneered . " Dead or alive he ca n't touch me . " " Mebbe not . . . . But a dead greaser is a safe greaser . They do n't fight in the open , like men . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get yer , off guard , like he did the time yer offered him that drink . " Dan 's free hand gripped the pommel of his saddle . " I ai n't afraid ! " he said between closely locked teeth . Buck turned to his son . " Guess we better be hittin " er up if we want ter make Mesquite by sundown . " He started his horse , then , as if remembering something he had left unsaid ,  |p260he  drew rein . " I almost fergot , " he drawled out . " Bill Green 's bin lookin ' fer yer . He jest ca n't seem ter wait till yer get back . " " What does he want ? " " He 's got wind of this here cattle deal of yours . He says yer the most likely fellow this side o ' Ogden . Wants ter take you into partnership . " Dan laughed dryly . Old Bill Green , the county miser . He had no use for him but it fed his pride to know that such a shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't the slightest intention of being anybody 's partner , much less Bill Green 's . " Well , we 'll see ! " was his noncommittalanswer . Thus dismissed , Buck swung the tip of his lariat across his horse 's flanks . " So long , " said Dan . " So long ! " answered father and son in chorus . The cloud moved on but its effect lingered . Dan and Janet touched their horses lightly with their spurs and rode on in silence . But this time it was not the silence of a completely happy present : The past was with them again , and , in a vague , dim way the uncertainty of the future . . . . They met other wayfarers as they neared the green hills and home  --  some of them strangers , some of them old settlers whom they had known all their lives . There were shepherds with their flocks and grizzled old miners with pack burros hunting for pockets of gold in the blunt , scarred hills of the desert , and cowboys riding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and campers returning from the trout streams . The strangers asked directions and about the condition of the road ahead , the old settlers stopped to talk and gossip . Always before the old settlers went their way , the talk would fall upon the trial of Tony Luna . " He 's sure got it in fer you . . . . " would be their parting shot to Dan.  |p261Only  once did Janet make any comment . It was after a sheep-herder from Crane Flat had delivered himself of the same monotonous observation and disappeared in a blur of dust vibrant with the bleat of lambs . " I 'll be glad when he 's hung ! " she said with sudden passion . Her vehemence surprised him . But , curiously , he was only half pleased . On the whole , he liked her compassionate mood better , and , moreover , he wanted her to think him superior to any enemy . If she had n't been present when Luna had . . . He should have shot him down , then , as he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , nothing could wipe out the memory of that insolence . When a man spit in your face he left you defenseless  --  there was no indignity profound enough to match it . She had seen a man spit in his face  --  not covertly , not cringingly , but proudly . And she was afraid of that man . Afraid for her husband . She would be glad when he was dead . Not out of revenge , but out of a feeling of relief . The thought rankled Dan Simpson . The day that Dan rode into Potterville with the money that he had collected from the sale of his cattle , he heard something that disappointed him mightily . The judge was well again and he had appointed the day for sentencing Tony Luna . The clerk at the bank told him the news , adding by way of speculation : " I wonder where he 'll be hung ? " " You wonder where he 'll be hung ? " echoed Dan . " Sure . San Quentin or Folsom ? " Dan stared for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to him that Tony Luna would besent away to one of the State prisons to be hung . The visionhe had had in mind when first the notion came to him wasp262the vision of a horse thief he had seen strung up to the limb of a cottonwood tree at Mesquite when he was a lad of fifteen . He had fancied vaguely that the hanging of Tony Luna would be something direct and primitive like that . A hangingat San Quentin or Folsom made all the difference in the world . He saw Buck Donald , back from the rodeo , and asked him about it . Buck allowed the hanging would take place at San Quentin . And , at that , it might not take place for weeks or months . The arm of the law these days reached out slowly for its victims . " San Quentin ! " snorted Dan in supreme disgust . " Why a man ai n't got time to trek way there to see a hanging ! " " Waal , the next best thing , " drawled Buck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him sentenced . " " It ai n't the same , " returned Dan , chewing viciously at his plug of tobacco . " Seen Bill Green yet ? He 's still lookin ' fer yer , " said Buck changing the subject . " Waal , if he wants me , he knows where to find me , " Dan answered as he started unhitching his horse . " I 'm too busy ter hang around this here town waiting fer old man Green ter talk turkey . " He swung into the saddle . " See yer Wednesday , " said Buck . " I should n't wonder . " Dan lashed his horse with the end of his lariat and sped away . So he was not to see Tony Luna hung , after all ! He felt like a child cheated of a questionable pleasure . He had n't intended to ride back home so quickly . He 'd planned to bask for an hour or two in the town 's approval of the deal he had just put over and to have the satisfaction of seeing old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before noon to the surprise of Janet deep in the mysteries of making a heap of blue calico into a dress . " Anything wrong ? " she asked . " No  --  nuthin ' to speak of , " he laughed back grimly . " Exceptin ' they ai n't agoner hang Tony Luna for mebbe four orp263five months . An ' when they do , it 'll be too far away fer me ter see it . San Quentin . Can yer beat that ? . . . But , I 'm goin ' in Wednesday ter see him sentenced . I ai n't goin ' ter be cheated o ' that fun . No , siree . " The scissors in her lap came clattering to the floor as she rose : " Do you really think  --  I mean is it safe ? " " Safe ! " Dan 's voice rose in irritation . " I would n't be afraid o ' Tony Luna if I was alone unarmed in the same room with him an ' him with a dirk and six-shooter on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but there have been times  --  Seems ter me I remember hearing paw tell about a prisoner who shot a man down in a court room , once . . . . Tony 's tricky , jest like Buck Donald said he was . . . . He shore was the last time yer saw him . " Dan flung his sombrero upon the table with a force that brought a recoil from Janet . " We wo n't talk any more about it ! " he almost shouted . " I 'm goin ' in next Wednesday and that settles it . " The day was hot  --  ninety in the shade somebody said  --  and the court room was squirming with a crowd hungry for drama . Dan sat rigid not deigning to lift the sombrero from his lap and use it as a fan , but every once in a while he caught a tiny wave of air from the handkerchief which Janet tossed back and forth . He had n't expected Janet 's company . Indeed he had n't wanted her to come . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found her beside him intent on the same task . He had made no protest because he knew if he did that , he 'd have the whole subject of Tony Luna 's covert strength brought up again . He did n't want to be warned against Tony Luna again . Who in hell was this greaser that everybody was afraid of him ! Even Janet 's presence in the court room was a reproach . She had n't come because she wanted to  --  she 'd come to sort of protect him . She had n't said so , but he knew  --  to protect him like a mother protects a child . He saw this in just the sly movements of her handkerchief in his direction so that he could get a fragment of the refreshment it was creating . To protect him just because she had once seen a man spit in his face ! . . . When a side door opened and Tony Luna came in hand-cuffed to Buck Donald , she made an instinctive movement of her body that seemed to put herself between Dan and Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget ? The judge came in , and everybody rose . He sat down and with him the entire court room , everybody but Tony Luna and Buck Donald . They stood a little to one side of the judge 's bench , Buck Donald studying some papers and Tony letting a dispirited glance roam about the room . All his defianceseemed to have fled . Dan felt like laughing . So this was the man that everybody was afraid of ! He threw a sneering smile at Janet , then lifted his head to turn a glance of contempt on Tony Luna . Their eyes met again , as they had done that day at the turnstile above China Gulch . But this time only a dull light burned in the eyes of Tony Luna . He was beaten . He was afraid . He did n't have any fight left . There were a few court preliminaries and then the judge began . Buck Donald moved squarely in front of him dragginghis prisoner with him . Their backs were now turned toward Dan and Janet . The judge began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the usual formula . Was this , that and the other thing in order ? Had any one any objections to offer before sentence was pronounced ? He looked squarely at Tony when he said this . There was an immediate hush throughout the room in spite of the routine tone of the question . For every one there had seen Tony Luna 's back instinctively stiffen . Something in the look that Tony Luna gave the judge must have surprisedp265him for he repeated the question slowly and with emphasis . Again there was a hush and then Dan heard Tony Luna speaking : " You mean judge that I can speak  --  that I can have something to say ? " The judge nodded . " If you wish . " " Then I tell you , judge , theese murder  --  I did not do theese murder . The man who does theese murder is here today in theese court room . As God and Our Lady ces my judge he sits here at theese moment laughing at me . . . . When I come in theese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ees best to say nothing . They weel hang you anyway . You are just what they call a greaser . You have no friens . Besides , theese man he has just married a girl  --  a beautiful girl that you know always  --  a beautiful girl who brings you water when you have thirst . ' So you say to yourself : What ces the use ? you weel die , anyway , so why make her cry ? ' " The voice stopped . Dan Simpson took a deep breath . Then he looked at Janet : she was folding and unfolding the little white handkerchief in her lap . He wondered vaguely if it were the same little white handkerchief that had wiped Tony Luna 's foul drool from his face . " But , today , " Tony began again , " when I come and see heem sitting here , smiling at me , I think : Tony Luna , you must tell , anyway . You must tell whether they hang you or not ! You must tell , because maybe it ces not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crook ! ' Ah , that ees what he ees judge  --  a crook ! " The voice rose with triumph . " For what he do , judge ? He kill a woman and steal her money . Then he come in weeth my knife , my knife that he steal from me and he says : See what I find at Chiquita Moreno 's cabin ! ' " The silence fell again . Dan thought : " Why does n't everybodylaugh ? " The judge leaned forward . " Have you finished ? " he said to Tony Luna .   " No . I catch my breath , judge , but I do not feenesh . Theese man , he come weeth my knife and say : Tony Luna have killed Chiquita Moreno . ' But when I am brought here for trial do he come ? No , judge . He ride away . He ride away and send paper which says I have done theese things . Because he ees afraid  --  he ees afraid for God will strike heem dead . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung but it ees no matter . I have told the truth and I am not afraid . " Again the judge spoke . " But you have not named the man . Tony Luna shrugged magnificently . " Hees name ? . . . It ees no matter . He knows and God knows . It ees enough . " Buck Donald stepped a little to one side , the prisoner moved with him . Dan felt Janet 's hand fumbling for his , he stiffened . A woman gave an hysterical laugh . The judge rapped sharply for order , and then , clearing his throat , began to pronounce the sentence of death on Tony Luna . Dan and Janet were among the last to come out into the bright sunshine . They stood uncertainly on the court house steps , for a moment self-conscious and filled with a curious shyness . Dan was wondering who would start the " joshing . " Who would be the first to call out : " Hello , murderer ! " bursting into wild guffaws . He welcomed it and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another looked up and saw him standing there beside his wife he could feel a progressive silence run through the crowd . Men nodded to him as he passed among them . " Hello , Dan ! " they said . That was all :   " Hello , Dan ! " turning away , almost as they said it . After all , if they could n't make a joke of it saw the spare , mean figure of old Bill Green standing a little apart from the throng , trimming the leaves from a willow switch to use upon the back of his shambling horse . He went toward him  --  first , because old Green was the only man in sight with whom he had definite business , and , second because Green was alone . He wanted an excuse to talk to somebody . He walked so quickly that he felt Janet falling instinctively behind . Bill Green looked up : " Hello , Dan ! " he said and dropped his eyes instantly to the willow switch again . " Old Green , too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined not to be put out of countenance . " Buck Donald says you were looking for me , " he began lamely . Bill did not raise his eyes . " I was  --  last week . . . . But things has changed . I 've got other plans . " Dan brought his teeth together with a snap . " What the hell  --  " he was beginning . Then , suddenly , he realized . There was nothing he could say . The more he talked , the more he explained , the more he argued , the worse it would be . He turned away without another word and found Janet . She was waiting in the palpitant sunshine of the road , driven out of the shade of the digger pines around the court house by the crowd 's indifference . . . . They found their horses and turned their faces toward home . For the first half-hour neither spoke a word . It was Janet who broke the silence . Dan had been longing to hear the sound of her voice but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Tony Luna ! Was n't he ridiculous ! " she began , inadequately . He felt a great surge of resentment sweep over him . All the rancor and repression of the morning came chokingly to his lips . " Tony Luna ! Tony Luna ! " he mocked . " Can'tp268anybody talk about nuthin ' but Tony Luna ? . . . Goddam but I 'm sick of him ! " A little shiver ran through Janet . But she said nothing and he could feel in the silence that dropped like a sharp sword that he had cut himself off forever from the comfort only Janet could give him . No matter what happened , now , this thing would always stand between them . When they came to the turnstile above China Gulch where the short trail flew up the hillside , Dan kept his horse in the path of the road . He would have welcomed a quick journey home but he remembered that Janet always liked the long way round so that they could ride side by side . It had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in , it had been so even this morning in spite of their hurry to be in time to hear Tony Luna 's sentence . But as he gave his horse the spurs and felt the animal shoot forward , he saw that Janet was no longer by his side . He drew rein and looked back . She had headed her horse toward the trail . " I think I 'll take the short cut home , " she called out to him . " I got some chores to do . " He hesitated . But she did not look back to see whether he was following her . He urged his horse forward again . The long way or the short way home  --  it did n't matter , now : Tony Luna had spit at him again , but this time not even Janet could wipe his face clean .   ONCE for a few weeks between jobs I worked in the box-office of a ten-twenty-thirty house out in the Mission District of San Francisco . I tell this not by way of apology but merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which follows . It had been a cold , rainy winter and the office without sufficient heat . We had a coal-oil stove , as 1 remember , and ceilings that figuratively reached to the sky . The result may not have been zero weather but it gave a very good imitation . Californians have a way of blandly freezing just because the sun is shining , and they freeze in rainy weather , too , because rainy weather is supposed to be warm weather . But during this particular February , neither the sunny days nor the rainy days were tempered with any dash of mildness . So between shows I kept the glass slide before the ticket window closed . One night about six o'clock , just as I was waiting for the proprietor to relieve me , I heard a tap on the pane . I looked up , expecting to see a prospective ticket purchaser . There was no one . I went on sorting tickets , thinking some street urchin had been playing me a trick . The sound came again , this time a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The outline of a weatherbeaten hat came into view and next the face of an old man was raised to mine . A slender hand pushed back the hat ; two faint blue eyes confronted me . " I wonder if you could spare me a quarter . " The voice was thin but distinct . " It is raining again . " What roused my interest was the absence of any whine in the man 's tone . His hope that I might aid him and his state- ment about the weather lacked both pathos and emphasis . I said , " Are you hungry ? " He shook his head . " I am never hungry but a man must eat . " " Never hungry ! " I was young and my voice rose incredulously . " Oh , once perhaps . When I was a youth and life stretched before me . " " You have n't fared so well since those days , eh ? " I do n't know why I questioned him since that never had been my custom in such situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely denied an old man . " Oh , I 've always had a roof over my head and three square meals . " " That 's something ! " I returned in a baffled voice . " Yes , you 're right  --  that is something . " " A roof and three square meals all these years . And , now , you 're broke . " He answered my implied question very simply . " It was the roof of a penitentiary . I was sent up for life but last month they let me out . . . . I stood staring foolishly at the two faded eyes that by this time seemed to have receded past any recognition of their color . " Sent up for life ! " I echoed . " How long did you serve ? " " Forty years . " " Forty years ! Good God ! " At that moment the proprietor came in the door . " Wait for me on the corner , " I said to the old man . " I 'll be with you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the swiftness and instability of a ghost . I said good evening to my boss , put on my hat and went outdoors . The rain was coming down with cold , stinging determination . The old man was waiting for me at the corner.  |p271We  went into a Greek chop-house where most people in a hurry took short orders at the counters  --  one of those chophouseswhere a T-bone steak , French fried potatoes , coffee and pie are the rule . There were a few unoccupied tables for leisurely patrons who seemed never to materialize . We sat down at one of them ; my guest took off his hat . A thick crop of snow-white hair was shapelessly mantling his head . He saw me looking at it and with sudden alertness he divined what I was about to remark . " It is thick for a man past sixty , " he said . " Clipping it short  --  that 's what does it . " He ran his fingers through its shallow length . " Only a month old , too . Somehow , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was annoyed at myself ; the last thing I wished to do was to remind the man before me of his past . I wanted him to eat and drink and be as merry as his condition would permit . I had elected myself to the role of patron , and I hoped to overpower him with my beneficence . It is hard to deny oneselfa swagger in the face of misfortune . A waiter came bustlingup . I handed the old man a menu . He set it aside with a show of decision . The competence of this gesture had somethingwell-bred about it . He might have been a man sure enough of his resources to order what pleased him . " I should like a bowl of milk , " he said , " and some crisp French bread . And if it is possible to get some sweet butter  --  " Frankly I was disappointed . I had expected to be quite dazzled by his demands . " You 'd better make that bowl of milk half cream , " I said to the waiter , determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small opulence . My guest raised his hand in protest . " I 'm afraid that would be too rich . After forty years one ca n't quite  --  " I checked him with a nod that was half understanding , half on . " The very first night I came to town I spent every bit of my five dollars at dinner . I was frightfully ill . Even the seat I sat in was too comfortable . It 's extraordinary how one can lose his capacity for luxuries . " His voice , at first rather far away , seemed to come nearer with every word he uttered . " You had five dollars , then . " " Yes . The state gives every man a suit of clothes and five dollars when he leaves prison . The suits are cast-offs from the men who enter . Mine was of very fine quality . I sold it only last week . Traded it for these rags and a dollar or so to boot . " He looked down at his costume with a smile of amusement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was a silly thing to do . Did n't you know  --  " His glance stopped me . " I knew nothing except that I had been in prison for forty years . Freedom is like wine  --  it goes to the head . It frightens you , too , at first . Besides , I 'd always been like that  --  improvident . " " And you never got over it ? . . . I thought experience  --  " I stopped again in confusion . His faded glance had extraordinary qualities of dignity and reproach in them . " You do n't get over things like that . They 're in your blood . When I was a child , I always ate up my share of candy first . I had a brother who hoarded his . " He said this as if he had caught his brother in a fault . " How have you lived all these weeks ? " " For two weeks I had a job . . . . Then they discovered I was a jail bird . Naturally they let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Another ex-convict told them . " " Another ex-convict ! " I cried incredulously . " Why , I should think a fellow ira the same mess would be the last person on earth to betray you . Was he your enemy ? "  | " No . " " Disliked you , maybe ? " " I think not . " " But there must have been a reason . " " I reminded him of a past he wanted to forget . " " What nonsense ! " " No , that is n't nonsense . There was something more to it , too . He had n't any sense of sportsmanship . You see , he never had had any background . He was n't what you would call a gentleman . " I am ashamed to say that for the moment I was amused . My companion saw it . But he was far from annoyed . He merely said , calmly : " That 's another thing you do n't get over . " At that moment the waiter returned with our orders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread into a shallow bowl of milk . During the silence that followed I began to turn over in my mind the best approach to the question I was burning to ask . For what had this man before me been sent up ? Murder , of course . There is very little else for which they give a life sentence in California . But he was such a very mild old gentleman . I repeat I thought over every possible avenue of approach and , then , I asked a totally different thing . I said : " After forty years you must see great changes . " " I saw greater changes in prison , " was his answer . " Life does n't stand still , anywhere . " I flushed . He had a quality of candor and simplicity that was continually putting me in my place , and , in my irritation , I blurted out quite brutally : " How did it come they did n't hang you ? " Once I had said it I was appalled . Fancy putting such a question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my surprise he did n't even wince . He replied : " There wasp274a doubt or two in the minds of the jurors . So they salved their consciences with a life term instead of the noose . " He said this without rancor but with just the slightest touch of irony . A curious desire to curry favor with him came over me . " That 's all wrong ! " I blurted out . " A man is either guilty or innocent . " He looked at me with tepid amusement . " Are you quite sure of that ? " " Are n't you ? " I countered . He shook his head . " No one is ever entirely innocent of anything . A man who puts himself in the poisition of being even falsely accused has contributed something to the crime of which he is charged . Never forget that . I did not actually murder the woman they found me with , but I was part of the procession that led up to that murder . " " A woman ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said the name wistfully . " Was there a romance ? " " Of a sort . " " Do you mind  --  I mean would you like to tell me about it ? " " If it would amuse you . " " Amuse ! " " Come now , is n't that what it amounts to ? Youth is always so full of heroic evasions ! " " Very well , " I said with a touch of exasperation , " it would amuse me frightfully . " " That 's better , " he commented , and he flashed a smile at me , a mere ghost of a smile that I fancied in its heyday must have charmed Rose Fanchon past much that was prudent . Or , to use his own words , had made him part of the processionthat had led to her undoing . He gave me his background , first . Boston in the seventies . Not exactly dull , but crowded rather with a certain respect/ability . A gentleman might get tipsy , for instance , so long as he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might be suspected of having a mistressso long as his conduct in such matters never permitted suspicion to merge into confirmation . He might even go so far as to deny God if he did so with gentility . In short , a background in which the ten commandments became symbolsof good form rather than definite rules of conduct . A suavely respectable life that the man before me had been educated to grace by the combined efforts of a tutor , an exclusive " prep " school , and Harvard . But sometimes the crust of respectability spreads out too thin ; crumbles like pastry that has too much shortening . The tutor , the exclusive " prep " school , Harvard , may have fitted our hero for discretion in his school contacts , including his social lapses , but it had not trained him for the monotonous rigors of a career in his father 's counting house . He was a conspicuous failure , and on that day when he was called into his father 's study to receive the parental reproof , he felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ground too sharp . " I had hoped that you would be a credit to the family name , sir ! " had been his father 's choleric remark . The shaft struck home . At that moment the young man decided to yield up the name that he had graced so indifferently . He would go out and seek his fortune alone under another escutcheon . He would not be a drag , a disappointment , a constant thorn in the side of his people ! His father smiled . It was the prerogative of youth to take chastisement with an heroic gesture . But , in this case , the father did not know the heroic gesture was made earnestly , so earnestly that that was the last time he was ever to look upon his son 's face again . The next morning a youth named Jim Rod began an overlandjourney to California. **29;2951;TOOLONG Winship made it for your Uncle Nicholas when he was fourteen and first went off to sea . No Crockett ever boarded a ship with a trunk , and we 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and put them away in here , for you 're leaving in a week with your mother to join the Four Winds in Boston for Australia . " " Come , Nicholas , " said his grandmother then , for Nicholas , standing there , was staring , first at his father , then at the sea-chest , then through the wide windows at the sea itself beyond the marshes and the meadows , " come , eat your porridge . There are days coming when you 'll wish for porridge like that . And you ca n't go to school without it . " So he ate his porridge though he thought he never could . And every day for a week thereafter while he sat at school , he stared at the map of the world above the blackboard , noting how much more water there was than land upon it , neglecting the sums on his slate and the words in his speller . They went , Nicholas and his mother , leaving his grandmother cheerful in the great house , journeying to Boston by coach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her new paint and in her canvas ready to be set and braced to the wind once she was towed into clear water . They went . Far out into the mid-Atlantic they sailed on the beginning of making their easting , through sullen gray or green water under gray skies , working ever south into the genial northeast trades where sky and water became blue and sunny , and long days succeeded long days with everything shipshape onP151board , with time for the sailors to loiter and smoke and spin their endless yarns , and with hardly a change in the sail they carried . On south through the variables where for days on end as they neared the equator the sun bounded up from the horizon to blaze upon the surface of a glassy sea , where the sailors worked with might and main to make use of the slightest puff of wind , wrinkling the still water in the distance like a school of silver fish , where the heat melted the pitch from the deck seams , and where drizzling hot showers or sudden downpours of warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the quarterdeck . Once over the line the southeasttrades took the Four Winds , took her with all her sails set through more days and even weeks of bright weather , sailing ever southward with Brazil somewhere beyond the far western horizon and Africa somewhere beyond the eastern . Then the blue faded from the water , the sky became overcast , great winds began to blow , the roaring westerlies , his father said , winds that would carry them booming and smashing around Good Hope and well over to Australia itself . Nicholas had never known such winds could blow . They kept him and his mother in the cabin playing his games at the table when they would stay on the table , keeping his father forever on deck , howling and tearing at the few sails , driving tremendous seas to pound and thunder against the groaning timber  --  mountainous seas hoisting the stern and driving the ship 's nose down with thudding blows into the desolate waters before her . They brought with them squalls of sleet and icy snow before which the Four Winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning two months and more after they had left home , his father led him on deck to see in the distance some rocky islands rising from the waste of black tossing waters . " The Kerguelens , Nicholas , " said his father . " Two weeks more and the voyage is over . " Nicholas never wanted the voyage over . Even the worst days held their excitement for him , quite apart from the roar of the wind and the thunder of the water . He had never in his life had such delightful friends or so many of them . The officers were all his friends , tellinghim fabulous stories at the table , explaining the chart to him at night . The carpenter allowed him to follow him about on fair days and on bad ones to sit in his stuffy shop with the spray drenching the tiny windows . The bos'n took him for walks in the second dog-watch , for -- ward where in good weather the sailors lounged and sang . The sailors were the best friends of all . They all had names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of which his mother disliked when , in a thoughtless moment , he told her of them . His mother disapproved of sailors in general and did not in the least like his stealingaway to the fo'c'sle when he had grown to know them better and sitting about while the off watch ate their supper . The fo'c'sle was distinctly a man 's world . Nicholas loved to sit there in the smell of drying clothes and stale tobacco , in the dim light of the swaying lantern which cast their great , ungainly shadows on the walls and floor . Outside the wind roared , making them all seem more snug and comfortable within . He loved to watch themp153sitting about the mess-tub with their spoons and tin basins , ladling out the thick pea soup with dumplings and bits of pork , swilling down their cups of steaming coffee , gnawing great fistfuls of hardtack . The oldest of them all was called Rats . There was no place in the world where he had not been and no kind of ship that he had not sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from shoulder to wrist with ladies ' faces , all different . When Nicholas asked him who the ladies were , he said they were his daughters who all lived in different places . The others roared at this answer , some saying that he should have a hundred arms to picture all his daughters . Rats had so much hair on his chest that he could braid it and tie a red ribbon on the braid . He swore before God and the Devil , too , that the hair had all sprouted in one dreadful instant of a dreadful night off the Malacca Straits when from the lookout in his watch he had spied close by a ship manned completely by skeletons , skeletons on the decks , skeletons scuttling up and down the rigging with their loose bones snapping and cracking in their bare sockets , skeletons hanging to the yards as they bent ghostly sails . The biggest skeleton of all sat astride the jib-boom , glaring up at Rats with fire in his eye-sockets , and screamed through his empty mouth and clacking teeth that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach Rats how to escape the Devil . It was then that the hair sprouted ! But just as the skeleton was about to tell him , Rats clean lost his senses up there in the lookout and never came to until he was relieved at eight bells . And the worst part of it all was , Rats solemnly told Nicholas , that he had never been able to escape the Devil , try as he had tried all his life . There was another sailor named Joe who played a mouth organ , lying in his bunk once he had finished his supper . He had a bosom companion called Mike who sang to his tunes . They had one song which kept ringing in Nicholas ' head both because of its catchy music and because of the wide and odd experiences which it suggestedfrom all over the world . And when sometimes they all joined in , slapping their knees and stamping their feet in time to the tune , he was fairly dizzy with joy . This incomparable song ran : I 've a plum in Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than my Zulu , Or my sweet in Singapore , Or my wife in Valparaisy , Or my wife in County CorkBut she 's nothing to my Daisy Saving kisses in New York . There was one named Bloody Ben , who could go aloft faster than any man on the Four Winds in spite of the fact that his feet were flat with no anklets at all and that he always threw off his shoes before he took to the ratlines , coiling his stockingless toes around them like a monkey . He was an ugly-looking man enough with half his nose gone and the other half wedged into his face ; but he was kind to Nicholas and taught him to tie any number of difficult knots and to splice a rope so that the splicingp155hardly showed at all . Once , at the mess-tub , when things were more hilarious than usual , Nicholas felt such an excitement buzzing within him that he forgot his mannersand asked Ben about his nose . " Where did you lose your nose , Ben ? " he yelled , putting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool , though the Four Winds was even then pitching through the first of the westerlies . " My nose ? " yelled Bloody Ben in return . " You ask about my nose , young feller ? I lost it in a bull-fight in Pernambuco . I killed that bull and sat on his head with all Brazil a-cheerin ' of me and the ladies throwin ' roses . But when I was n't lookin ' , the bull raised one horn in the last move he made on this earth , my sonny , and took my nose off ! " " He 's lying to you , kid ! " bawled Mike . " A hussy bit it off his mug for 'm in San Diego ! " Nicholas did not ask then and there what a hussy was , but , his curiosity conquering discretion , he inquired at bedtime of his mother . She said she did not know ; it must , she thought , be a word peculiar to sailors . He regretted his question , wishing many times thereafter that he had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it kept him from further visits to the fo'c'sle until they reached Australia . Nevertheless , there were still the walks forward with the bos'n or the carpenter ; there were long talks with the sailmaker as he sat punching the stout canvas with his heavy thimble bound across his palm ; there were hours at the wheel in fair weather when he helped the helmsmanspin the brass-topped spokes , down and up , up andp156down to keep her on her course . On sunny days when a fair wind was with them and they flew along with every inch of canvas on her , there was an exhilaration in the very sense of taut rigging and filled sails , in the water racing past . There were ships to speak and sometimes to overhaul  --  a packet ship with the passengers waving their hats and handkerchiefs , a big-bottomed whaler , an odd steamer or two spouting black smoke into the wide , clean sky , British tea-clippers racing home , the Falcon and the Fiery Cross , smart ships with shining rails and bulwarks and polished brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and birds that circled about far from land . And in the dog-watch when supper was over and he was sleepy , there was the secure sense of the three of them together , smiling at one another across the table or walking arm in arm up and down the deck . " Land ho ! on the port bow ! " cried the lookout early one bright morning , and there ahead was the blue outline of Cape Otway , the southernmost point on the Australian mainland . Not many days now before they would slide through the straits between Tasmania and Australia and head northeast for Sydney . Nicholas watched the surf ringing the white beaches and crashing upon the headlands , jumping nimbly out of the way while the crew holystoned and scrubbed , painted and varnished , so that the Four Winds might enter Sydney Harbour with no apologies for her appearance . Nicholas never forgot the month they lay in the beautifulharbour of Sydney with ships from all the world as their neighbours . Before he had been there a week he knew their names and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish quickly those from home by their house flags , the crimson field and yellow beehive of Sutton and Company ; the red and yellow horizontal bars of A. A. Low ; the red cross upon the white field of David Ogden . It was a gay month . His father and mother dressed up for dinner almost every evening and went to drink good wine and eat rare foods on some ship or other that lay at anchor , swinging idly to the tide , her lights twinkling in the darkness beneath the flaming southern stars . Ships had hostesses in plenty in 186o , for many captains now brought their wives to sea and some their children . On rare occasions Nicholas , too , went to dinner , wearing his long new trousers of blue and green plaid and his short black velvetjacket over his starched white underwaist with lace collar and cuffs . Sometimes he stayed with the gentlemenat the table after the ladies had withdrawn ; and he listened with all his ears to the talk that went on and on . There were many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sudden disappearance of the McKay clippers , the Romance of the Seas and the Bald Eagle , sailing from Hongkong and never reaching their ports ; the recent voyage of the new steamship Great Eastern , whether she threatened sail or whether she was singled out for mishaps because of her clumsiness proved at her unfortunate launching ; the action of the Southern States to cripple the American merchant marine ; Britain'ssudden spurt in building and the superiority for shipping of Free Trade over a protective tariff . These things at times widened his eyes with excitement ; at other times they sent him homeward to the Four Winds with worry conquering sleep . For these men knew things , thought Nicholas . They were the finest men in all the world . And when one of them rose in the dining-cabin of his stately ship , raised his glass and cried , " Gentlemen , I drink to the passing of a glorious era ! " Nicholas knew uneasily that , whatever an era was , it was surely passing away . " Fate is against us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when ten of the best commanders known to the sea sat around a sumptuous table with candlelight shining softly on wineglasses and silver , on snowy linen and black clothes and white satin waistcoats . " Fate is against us , and every sailor bows to Fate . The screw steamship is against us , and the perfidious South , and the iron and coal of Old England . The Romance of the Seas and the Bald Eagle are now no more , a dark sign of our passing . But we drink , gentlemen , to the glory of the American clipper and pledge together our fealty to blue water ! " Nicholas , sitting next his father , rose with the others and raised his cup of milk , drinking it as they drank their wine . But he was sad and heavy within him until the same gentleman , spying his anxious face , cried again , " A further toast , gentlemen , to the young lad in our midst . He comes of a glorious race . May he sail his father 's ship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " So he felt better as he went homeward , snuggled close to his father in the stern of the boat while the third officer pulled the oars and they wound in and out among thep159ships toward the high , dark side of the Four Winds . He would fight time and chance , he thought . When he was older , he would , of course , know better what they were and what was the best way to conquer them both . The year after he came back from Sydney , the year he was eleven , Nicholas fell in love , doing it even at that age with the completeness characteristic of the Crocketts and keeping it staunchly to himself . He fell in love with Deborah Parsons at her soap-bubble party . Deborah was ten and had come to live in Saturday Cove because her father had recently been elected preceptor of the academy , a stately red-brick building with white columns , just below the church on the hill . The academy had been built by Thomas Winship in 1810 and administered strict doses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few odds and ends not felt even in the eighteen-sixties to be of much importance . Deborah like Nicholas had been born somewhat late in the life of her parents , her father being well past fifty when she was ten , and neither of them knew exactly how to cope with her superabundant spirits or to steer her firmly into the paths of modesty and comeliness , which in the eighteen-sixtieswere held to be the chief of womanly attributes . Deborah had not made the slightest dent upon the consciousness of Nicholas until the day of the party . She had just been another girl in the village school , her sexp160substantially counteracting her newness ; and although she could draw amazing pictures of Miss Serena on her slate when she should have been studying her tables , such talent was , in Nicholas ' mind , little enough compensationfor the multitude of things closed to her and to all the others like her . But the bubble-party depicted Deborah in a new , disarming , and wholly delightful way . The party was held one Saturday afternoon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white house . It was an early spring , and the apple-blossoms were a cloud of pink and white above Deborah and her guests , who had at last been allowed to shed their winter flannels and serges and alpacas for cotton frocks and suits . Deborah 's mother being absent , the stout and capable maidservant had arranged the big table under the trees with its white washbowls of soapy water , its basin of soft soap for more suds , its row of new clay pipes each gaily tied with ribbon . Deborah had sketched in pencil on the bowl of each pipe a clever drawing of the guest who was to claim it ; and there was much hilarity at the beginning while all found themselves . The stout maidservant , whose name was Susan , was not in the most equable of tempers . First of all , she disapprovedof parties in a time of war . Sugar was dear and so was flour , and so were all the other ingredients of the cakes which she had refused to make for Deborah . Cookies were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and cold molasses water . Susan had two brothers in General Sherman 's army , and she knew well how they were being starved to death though they didp161not dare to say so in their rare letters . Secondly , she saw little sense in parties at any time and especially in the absence of her mistress , who , although she could not alwaysmanage Deborah , was at least responsible for her and might have been able , although Susan had her doubts , to keep Deborah 's new blue muslin securely locked in the closet until the night of the church concert a week later when Deborah was to speak a piece if she could be kept still long enough for her to learn it . But Deborah had wheedled both the party and the dress from her father , who was at this moment reading some outlandish tongue upstairs and paying no heed to the rowdyism messing up his premises , which were , as a matter of plain fact , not his premises at all , though some folks were born with no idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it as Susan saw , being a woman of commonsense , but to weather through the party as well as she could and keep some outward show at least of law and decency and order . The pipes having been sorted and claimed with great glee , and ease for that matter as Deborah 's drawings were unmistakable , the blowing began . It was a lovely party as anybody but Susan , standing stiffly under a tree with her arms tightly folded across her black and white calico , might have seen . The pipes were dipped in the warm , thick suds , cheeks were distended , and the round , clear bubbles began to float singly and in tiny , diaphanous chains from the clean white pipe-bowls . They sailed through the soft , still May air , up and up among the apple-blossoms , the biggest reflecting the rosy petals in their transparency . The children danced about under thep162trees , jumping to catch their bubbles , marvelling at the biggest and brightest , dashing to the table to refill their pipes and to spill soapsuds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no end of a fool to cover the table . It was like Deborah , thought Susan , to be the most thoughtless hostess possible . There she was , prancing about like something fair possessed , blowing more bubblesthan any one else , crowding her guests out at the table . Manners had simply gone gallivanting since Susan 's day . There were n't no manners any longer , and what this world was coining to , Susan , unaided , could not tell nor the Lord either ! Matters reached a climax at last , at least in Susan 's mind , when Deborah , who had already ladled enough soapsuds on her new blue muslin to ensure the necessity of a washing of it and an ironing of half a hundred ruffles before the church concert , broke her pipe fairly into smithereens by pertly striking it on Nicholas Crockett 's head . Susan 's exhausted patience at that moment ran quite out of the orchard and left her not knowing in the rage that took its place that she had missed it . She bore down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay from Nicholas ' stubborn hair , and administeredsome smart slaps and some shakes that untied Deborah 's blue sash and sent it whirling on the orchard grass under the strong arms of Susan . " Shame on you to treat one of your visitors so ! " screamed Susan , now holding Deborah at arm 's length and glaring first at her and then at all the others who stood aghast and staring . " You 're a naughty , ungrateful girl who ought to be properly spanked and put to bed ifp163your folks had any sense . Now , you little sauce-box , you 'll stand and watch your party with never another bubble for you ! No one 's to lend you a pipe either , so mind that , all of you ! " Deborah was not one whit behind Susan in her own fury . She did her best to kick Susan 's legs , safe within the ample folds of her calico , but the arm that held her was inescapable . Her cheeks grew redder and redder , and the black pupils of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But though her arms and legs were useless , she still had her voice . " You mean , hateful old thing ! " she shrieked at Susan . " Who are you to spoil my party ? You 're a nasty , horrid old skinflint , that 's what you are , and all my friends think so , too ! " Deborah 's friends thought nothing at that moment . All stood in their places , the youngest too frightened , the eldest too embarrassed to move . Nicholas thought he ought to speak up and to say that he liked pipes broken over his head , which , indeed , was true at that moment as he looked at Deborah , somehow triumphant even in her ignominious plight ; but the necessary words to convey this information would not come . At last when the littlest girl began to whimper and start across the orchard grass toward the security of her own home and her own mother , Susan thought retirement on her part the wisest move and retreated to her kitchen , her broad back swayingfrom side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute for Deborah to comfort and lead back her departing guest , another for her to tie her sash and push back into place her disordered curls . Thenp164she made an appropriate face at the back door , which had just been slammed with gusto , and turned upon her friends the most charming and subtle of smiles , reserving the long conclusion of the smile for Nicholas himself . " Now the party will go on , " she said . " I 'm sure you would all lend me your pipes , but I do n't need them , thank you . I can blow better bubbles than anyone withoutthe sign of a pipe . Watch me , all of you ! " Upon which , while they all stood about recovering themselves , she marched to the table , dipped one hand into the basin of strong soft soap , the other into one of the great bowls of suds , and began to cover her mouth and nose with the heavy white lather . Well up into her nostrils she forced it ( how it must sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she stood in their midst beneath the blossoming trees with the sun shining on her fair hair and dripping soap-covered face . " Watch me ! " she cried again . There was no need of the command . They were all watching her , small and half-sized girls in ginghams and muslins , small and half-sized boys in white ducks . They drew silently together to make a half-circle before her , their fear giving place to wonder as they watched . For Deborah , wrinkling up her crimson face , began to blow gently from both mouth and nose , and fast upon her gentle blowing there came wreathes of bubbles to float away with the spirited tossing of her head . How long can she hold out ? thought Nicholas , lost in delightedadmiration . Deborah held out far longer than anyone thought she could . Her concluding triumph was a mammoth bubble which she held poised on the end ofp165her nose before it , too , sailed away for one overwhelming instant and broke amid a chorus of admiration and applause . Deborah had magnificently transcended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insubordination , brought the young world of Saturday Cove to her feet . As they trailed homeward at supper-time , there was not one among her guests who did not long to emulate her behaviour and yet not one who did not regretfullyadmit that such deportment would not work acceptably under their allotted roofs . As for Nicholas , he had for the first time in his life seen girls in a new light . Deborah , he said to himself in bed that night , after his grandmother had extricated divers bits of white clay from his thick hair with questions that were not answered , might conceivably be equal to any occasion . She might evert , like Mrs. Joshua Patten , command a clipper around Cape Horn and take her safely into the Golden Gate , as Mrs. Patten had done for fifty-two days when her husband was ill and the first officer under arrest for neglect of duty . By the year he was thirteen Nicholas had learned something about time and chance , although because of them both he never learned that they were unconquerableby any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching out toward That which had made it in the beginning . He learned about time through watching his grandmother , less steady on her feet than she had been , more willing to sit down and let his mother do things , more transparent in her hands and face , less interested in him and his doings . He understood vaguely that the war , bursting at Fort Sumter upon them soon after they had returned from Sydney , was hard on his grandmother . She watched it as one from afar off , and yet he knew that she suffered while she watched . As she neared ninety she became given to repeating herself , and there was hardly a day that he did not hear her say to his mother : " I never thought I 'd live to see another war , and God knows I 'm not hankering to watch this one to a close . There 's something wrong in the way things are . Old men should fight and not the young , for things do n't matter so much to the old . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Winds with hundreds of other good ships was hauled up in Boston . His father was away a great deal of the time , sitting on commissions in Boston or New York , engaged in endless deliberations which came to little or nothing , he said when he came home , tired and half ill from his own and larger anxieties . When he was at home , he sat on other commissions , too , among men who met in the village hall to interview younger men and boys , to decide whether they should go or stay , and to send those who were to go , to larger towns where they would get their blue uniforms and rifles and knapsacks . He fretted and chafed about the house , deploring his age , insisting he was better than half the men on ships or battlefields or in the camps . Like Nicholas ' grandfather Winship he wished that Nicholas had been born when he should havep167been , for then he would show them . His mother , Nicholasknew , was glad that he had been born when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days when his father was there . Miss Serena at sixty-two had reluctantlygiven place to Sergeant Peasley , who had lost his right arm at Bull Run and been sent home without it and with a hole in his side as well . Sergeant Peasley was perhaps not much of a teacher , but he was admirable , the school overseers thought , for the time at hand . Deborah drew amazing pictures of him on her slate . She was decent about the pictures , always tactfully drawing him with the arm he had lost and allowing her genius full scope only on his face , which was funny enough in all conscience . Lessons did not matter much . They droned through whatever was necessary , indefinitely lengtheningthe morning exercises so that they might hang old Jefferson Davis to a sour apple tree and go marching on with John Brown 's soul though his body was mouldering in the grave . After school and on Saturday mornings the boys were drilled in the school yard by Lieutenant Simpson , who had done nothing but jig mackerel on George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished himself for two years in the Navy until a cannon ball had taken his leg clean across the deck and over the side of his ship . He managed wonderfully on his wooden peg , and Nicholas and the others drilled for hours on end with wooden guns while Deborah and her friends watched respectfully from well on one side of the yard . Chance first showed its arrogant and imperturbable face to Nicholas in 1864 , when Jonas Norton got a stray bullet in his heart . Rejoicing that he was at last eighteen and could join General Grant 's army , Jonas had gone merrily through the May campaign , crossing the Rapidan , fighting the Battle of the Wilderness without a scratch , weathering in early June the crushing defeat at Cold Harbour . And now in June , after the Petersburg siege was quite over and the war was surely wearing itself out , he was killed in no battle at all , simply struck by a stray bullet shot by an unseen and unknown sniper . He had been sitting under a tree when the siege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother about the blue Virginia hills , when the bullet got him . It was like Jonas to sit all by himself under a tree , thought Nicholas , when the news reached Saturday Cove . He had always liked to spend long days fishing by himself or reading flat on his stomach under the elm trees at the foot of his father 's field . Apparently , thought Nicholas , trying to figure it out in his muddled head as he trailed slowly homeward that evening along the shore road , apparently one could not know beforehand with any degree of certainty what was going to happen to one , or prepare against it , or even be ready for it . He wished the town-crier might have cried Jonas ' death , given to it something of the importance it held for Nicholas and for Jonas ' family . But the towncrierwas now no more in Saturday Cove , having been voted down in the last March town-meeting as a worn-out and expensive institution , useless now that newspapers were an everyday affair for everybody and national mattersrightly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town-crier 's gone , " his grandmother had saidp169when she heard about the town-meeting , " and the telegraphhas come . Common as common telegrams are now . And I 've lived to see the passing of one and the coming of the other . Well , well ! " Her words had made Nicholas think suddenly of time , of the gentleman 's words at the dinner in Sydney harbour , how it took away one thing and brought another . Now with Jonas gone in such an odd , unexpected way he was beginning to think about chance , over which he must somehow be victorious even though no one in the world could beat time . That chance bullet , which , singing through the warm southern air , found a lodging in Jonas ' heart , did not stop there . It had its repercussions . Jonas had a dog , a setter named Captain , who had been Jonas ' faithful slave ever since he was ten and Captain was a puppy . It seemed as though the dog knew all about Jonas . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and howled long , dismal howls . Whenever he could , he lay on Jonas ' bed , sniffing at the covers or wandered all about the room , sniffing at his books and at his old shoes on the closet floor , looking beseechingly at anyone who tried to drive him out of doors . When July came and school was out , he began howling at Jonas ' fishing-tackle in the woodshed . Mrs. Norton told Solace Crockett that she could n't stand it another hour . She gave Captain to Nicholas together with the books and the fishing-tackle , which soon began to take on Nicholas ' smell so that Captain ceased his howling and felt at home once more . Nicholas loved Captain both for Jonas ' sake and for his own . He had never had a dog before , in spite of his father 's perennial threats to buy him one . Dogs were hard on rugs and furniture , Abigail Crockett had always said , and they smelled no matter how you scrubbed them . She would do anything else in the world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dog about the house , shedding hairs over everything . Now , however , that dogs together with many other things were slipping to the bottom of her mind , she had made no objection to his coming , especially since he had belonged to Jonas . The dog made up , at least a little , for Jonas . Not that Nicholas had known Jonas closely , but he had adored him from afar . Jonas had been decent to the small fry in the village school , seeing that they got their rights and sometimes joined in the games of the older boys . Even when he went to the academy and studied Latin and Greek , he did not forget Nicholas . Sometimes he had even come to the house for an evening to play anagrams or to help Nicholas with his boat-building on the kitchen table . Nicholas had dreamed long dreams about Jonas , how some day when the war was over and shipping had picked up , they would sail together , for Jonas ' father was a captain , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonas , dreamed Nicholas , would command the ship , and he , after he had worked his way up , would be Jonas ' first officer , call Jonas " Sir , " and execute his orders more quickly than any other officer could ever do . Some morning when they were clipping along on the starboard tack with the starboard leeches of all square sails well forward , Jonas would take a quick look around from his deck and shout :  | " Get all ready for about ship , Mr. Crockett ! " " Aye , aye , sir ! " Nicholas would cry , and then to the men on watch , " Furl the crojik ! " " Haul up the clews of the mainsail ! " " Stand by the main and mizzen braces ! " The men would cry , " Aye , aye , Sir , " to him in turn , and with Jonas and him both seeing to things , and not losing a moment , the great ship would come about and drive forward on her new tack . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped no end . They ranged the woods together , scaringup rabbits and partridges . In chilly late August eveningsthey lay together before the fire with Captain 's nose snuggled between Nicholas ' shoulder and elbowwhile he read Two Years Before the Mast or Mr. MidshipmanEasy . Within a month the dog seemed to haveforgotten Jonas completely in his new faithfulness to Nicholas . Then one September afternoon when his father had just come home for three short days and even Captain in comparison lost interest for him , he , remembering Jonas ' generosity to him as a smaller boy , lent Captain as a playmateto some youngsters who had long begged for him . There was , as a matter of fact , another and more powerfulelement that stimulated his generosity . Deborah was with the younger boys , and he could refuse Deborah nothing that she wanted . They took him to the woods where he ran afoul a porcupine , and at nightfall they tearfully brought him home , not knowing what to do with the quills which protruded in dozens and scorespI72from the tender skin about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pain and fright . Nicholas did not know what to do either , but his father did . They stretched Captain on an old rug in the shed and went to work to extract the quills . It was hard , slow work . The quills were nasty things to handle , and the suffering dog was nastier . Nicholas lay upon him , holding his head as his father directed , while Silas did his utmost to get out most of the quills . Deborah stood in the doorway of the shed while they worked . She had summarily sent the small boys home , but she remained , contrite and sorrowful , with tears running down her cheeks . There were blood and howls of pain from Captainand well-directed snaps at Silas ' patient fingers and hands ; there were tears from Nicholas , too , and blood all over the rug , some from Captain , some from Silas . They kept supper waiting while Nicholas ' mother stood anxiouslyabout , more concerned for Silas than for Captain . Silas laughed at her fears as she bandaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog 's mouth with hot water and some healing ointment . But the next day he did not feel over well , and on the third he sent a telegram to Boston that he could not come back to the men who were awaiting him . Nicholas , lying beside Captain on the sitting-room floor , could not believe that his father was really ill , and yet he knew it from his mother 's face . He had developed a high and stubborn fever , the doctor said , which did not look too good . He called another doctor from the nearestcity who said it did not look too good to him either . Nicholas was frightened on the fifth evening when thep173new doctor had gone and the other stayed on in his father 's room . The sitting-room was still , but from upstairshe heard the creaking of his father 's bed as he tossed about , and now and again the sound of his voice , not in protest against his mother 's hands but against the war and steam and the loss of money and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worried his father most were now being made more plain than he had ever made them even in his most discouraged hours . In her chair in the sitting-room his grandmother sat as though waiting for something which was coming whether or not anyone desired it . He wondered as he lay there before the fire , unable to read , whether all old people waited for things , whether he , too , would wait for things when he was old . His grandmother said at ten o'clock . " It 's long past your bedtime , Nicholas . " She did not seem to realize , he thought , that it was long past her own . He crept upstairs with Captain at his heels . He looked into the room where his father was and where his mother and the doctor sat by the bed . His father was more quiet now , his mother whispered , beckoning to him . He and the dog stood by his father 's bed , but his father did not know either of them . He lay staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look at Nicholas when he bent to say good-night . The next morning while he lay drowsily awake , looking at the blue water filling the harbour and at the bright autumn trees that had begun to fire the headlands among their dark pines , his mother came in to tell him quietly that his father was dead . He did not believe it at first , pI74 but he came to it at last after his mother had talked to him . The house was more still than he had ever known it , more still even than his grandfather 's house when he had lain dead on the haircloth sofa . It held a silence that again murmured in his ears . Even the day outside was still , the September sky , the still water . Captain at the foot of his bed awoke and sensed the strange stillness , greeting it with a whine of distress . Nicholas thought he could never be kind to Captain again . But there he was , not in the least to blame , his mother said , having merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . That night , hours after he had gone to bed it seemed , he awoke , hearing voices in the sitting-room , the voice of his mother crying now although she had not cried before him , that of his grandmother steadier than usual . He got out of bed and went quietly past the closed door of the room where his father lay . He sat down on the topmoststair , wrapping his long night-gown about his bare feet . He heard his mother say : " It 's harder for you than for any of us . It 's not right that you should see everybody through like this . First , Nicholas and then Reuben and then Silas ' father and my own mother and father . I 'd hoped it would be different for you . " Captain joined Nicholas then , sitting on his haunches and staring , his eyes big and brown in the light of the candles in the sconces on the wall . He was whining a bit as though in puzzled wonder , and he would have howled there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn his erect head down across his knees.  | " You 're wrong , " he heard his grandmother say , her voice strong and steady as it used to be . " You 're all wrong , Solace . It 's just as it should be , for once . The hard thing about bearing children is not the bearing of them or the bringing them up . It 's the knowledge that ten chances to one you ca n't live to see them through their lives , that you 've got to die while you 're still anxious about them . That 's been spared me . I 've lived to see them all through and safe , and now I can go any time , knowing that my work 's done , finished with no loose ends to it . Somehow or other , I 've always hated loose ends . " They did not say any more , and Nicholas crept back to bed past the closed door . His room was flooded with light from the harvest moon , clear and bright in a cloudlesssky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within it the dark lines of the fishing schooners that lay at anchor , their hulls and masts and rigging . Something in his grandmother 's words had taken away his fearful awe over the stillness in the house . The confusion and the sadness of the day , the bitter questioningof why such things had to be , were for the momentlost . Young though he was and quite unconscious of the nature of his experience , he was as he lay there understanding something of what those who looked on ancient tragedy had understood , something which , freed from the perplexity and disorder of the actual world and transcended by a poet 's vision , gave to them a sense of rightness and of peace . His grandmother was old , he thought . If she said things had happened as they should happen , then there must be at least a chance that she was right . Perhaps his mother , now that his grandmother had told her , would wish to see him through as his grandmother had seen his father . For just an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been born so late , it could never be . Nicholas went to the academy at fourteen and weatheredfour years of it with an ill grace that troubled his mother . He could not see that any of it counted for much toward the things he was burning to do once he was old enough to do them . He neglected his lessons to follow the great contest of 1866 when nine British tea-clippers raced from Foochow around Good Hope to London , three ships doing the passage in ninety-nine days and slipping up to London docks on the selfsame tide . He deplored the fact that there were no more races by Americanships around Cape Horn to the Golden Gate , but even British tea-clippers were better than Greek and Latin . Had he been born earlier , he thought , in place of his brother , who had died before he had really lived , he would not have had to render poor translations of Cxsar and Ovid and Sallust , or to dig away at his geometry , which , however , he undertook with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had once found that it helped him with his boat-building . Had he been born then , in 18 3 1 instead of twenty years later , he would have packed his sea-chest and shipped before the mast , not having to bother with higher learning , which at best fitted one only for the law or medicine or the min/istry . None of these professions held any lure for him . Not many boys on the New England coast in the forties and fifties , if they came from seafaring families , had bothered with the narrow world of school when a wider one was beckoning . But time had wrought its changes and that other dark enemy , chance , which thus far he had not been able to withstand . Fate was clearly against Nicholas , he said in sullen , self-conscious moods to Deborah when he was sixteen and had begun to take her home from Sunday night prayermeetingsand church suppers on Thursday evenings . Deborah at fifteen was far too young to be seen home , her parents said , but Nicholas saw her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared before her white gate on summer evenings and on winter in the dark hall of her father 's house . The nearness of Deborah made him tingle from his head to his toes and sent him home to dream dreams about her which frightened him and made his books duller than ever on succeeding days at school . Deborah had not the slightest intention , she told Nicholas , of remaining in Saturday Cove once her days at the academy were over . She intended to go away and learn more about drawing and painting and sketching . Some day , she said , even though Fate was against her , too , in making her a woman when she longed to be a man , she would astonish Saturday Cove and the larger world with her art . Deborah at school was always drawing something or other ; but since she learned her lessons by merely looking at them , no valid objection could be made to her drawing . Sometimes , when an examination was pending , Deb/orah brought her Latin books to Nicholas ' house and helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from home , and both Solace Crockett and old Abigail , sitting now in her chair and waiting to slip away any hour without any fuss , she hoped , were won by them . Nicholas approached such evenings with dread and delight alternately tearing him in shreds . He was stupid compared with Deborah , and he always seemed more stupid when he sat beside her at the table . " You make such work of it , Nicholas , " she said . " It 's really easy . All in the world he says is , If you are well , it is well , and I am well . ' " Or , " That 's wrong , do n't you see ? It 's a command . What yEneas says is , " Cease to stir up my soul and thine with thy complaints . It is not through my own wishes that I steer forth for Italy . ' " She had a way of commenting on what they read . " She was an idiot to take on so through all these lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who treated me like that ! " This was said with a spirited toss of her head which sent Nicholas ' blood racing in his veins . When they were respectively eighteen and seventeen and both in their last year at the academy , Deborah increasedNicholas ' worry about his future by recklessly steering their evening conversations at her gate into more personal veins . " I 'm going to Mt . Holyoke Seminary just to please father , but I sha n't stay there long . I 'm sure it 's a dull place full of queer , bluestocking girls . There 's a newNicholas Crockett 179p179art school in Boston that lets women come as well as men . That 's where I 'll likely go in a year or two . At any rate I 'm not coming back to Saturday Cove to marry any fisherman that asks me . There 's nothing more in this village any way but fish ! " When she talked like this to Nicholas , he kept his hands close at his sides or gripped securely about the gate railings to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize her and hold her close against him , to kiss her and tell her that if only she would believe in him , he would prove to her that there was something even now in Saturday Cove besides fish , or at least someonewith ambition enough to leave it . But he never did what he wanted to do , partly because he was afraid of Deborah 's power to hurt him , partly because he knew there was sombre truth in what she said . As he went homeward along the dark shore road with the water suckingat the pebbles and few if any ships at anchor , he could take comfort only in the thought that she bestowed her favours upon no other youth in the academy and that there was yet time for him to prove himself worthy of the Crocketts . There was truth in what Deborah said about Saturday Cove . In 1870 there was little left of the old , far-seeing life which had embraced the world and brought it homeward . The yards and most of the docks had gone , buildingsand piers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his grandfather and his father little more than ten years before had been shortened by neglect and disuse . The sea was nearer the land than it had been . Already burdocks and rank grass were grow/ing on the very spots where the yards had stood , spots marked by rusted and forlorn pieces of what machinery had been left as useless . Foreign ships came no longer to Saturday Cove . Nicholas could hardly remember when he had last felt a leap within him at the sight of square , sun-washed sails bursting upon the horizon . Square sails themselves were passing away to give larger place to the stout , schooner-rigged vessels that plied between coast ports north and south . Now at Saturday Cove the craft that beat their way in among the islands and slid into their places at the dismantled wharves were schooners from Nova Scotia or sometimes from so far away as Norfolk , Savannah , and New Orleans . The war and its tariffs , the building of railroads , the opening of the Great West , the perfection of the steamship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at last dealt to shipping under sail its death-blow . The master-builders of Maine and Massachusetts and Nova Scotia , " reluctant to raise barnyard fowls once they had reared eagles , " were dropping off one by one ; merchants who could make high percents by exploiting the new West were , wisely enough , turning their attentionaway from slow sailings in old ships . Maine , it is true , was to keep the American flag floating at the spanker gaff longer than any other state ; and yet the Maine men who still embraced the old life , taking the long eastern passages where sail with lower freights yet had its chance , were for the most part men of middle or later age who had put their all into their ships and to whom little else was left to do . These would continue to sail until age had taken them from the seas . Silas Crockett would havep18Ibeen among them had chance not intervened ; and had everything been different , Nicholas ' early dreams might yet have come true in a measure . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their flowering . Decent berths to Canton and Calcutta were not easy to obtain even by the most ambitious of youths ; wages were low and uncertain ; and the men who now made up the crew of a sailingshipwere not of the stuff that had prevailed in the forties and the fifties when sailing was a gentleman 's calling and when the best families in New England sent their sons before the mast . There was still the fishing as Deborah had said . Nicholas scorned fishing , but there it was . For a decade both before and after the war the deep waters off the New England and Nova Scotian coasts swarmed , even surged with an abundance of cod and haddock , mackerel , halibut , and herring . Now that shipbuilding was virtuallyno more and the trade by sail with foreign ports had practically ceased , the fisheries of Saturday Cove , indeed of all Eastern Maine , were bearing the palm and carryingoff the victory . Ships from Cadiz and Rio might no longer loom upon the clear horizon ; but the fishing boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Banks . Within a day 's journey eastward of Saturday Cove factories were packing herring by train loads and turning over yearly millions of dollars . And boys who had once dreamed of pacing their quarterdecks while their ships swung majestically into the muddy harboursof China , and who could not get the necessity for the sea out of their bones and blood were becoming glad to pack hip-boots and oilskins and set forth for New- foundland or the St. Lawrence Gulf . That at least was a better calling than throwing coils of frayed and dirty rope from the gangway of some miserable coastwise steam-tub to draw her nudging , sooty side close to villagewharves , better than trundling freight-barrows up and down the slippery planks of small landing-stages to supply village grocers with their wares and the earliest of the summer visitors with their trunks and baby carriages . Nicholas graduated from the academy in June of 1870 and gave in the village church a spirited oration on DonoldMcKay , Master Builder . He had refused to write a farewell essay on Time and Tide Wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vogue in 1870 than eulogies to men who had built sailing-ships and who like their ships were , if not dead , already half forgotten . His mother sat in the corner of the old Crockett pew in the church where forty years ago she had been married and looked upon him as he gave his speech . He was handsome , she thought , tall and spare like his father , his blue eyes eager and yet anxious below his stubborn dark hair , which would never lie straight and smooth no matter how he brushed it . She knew as his voice rang out in the crowded church the things that were tearing his heart and making him an uneasy companion in the great house . And she at sixty was powerless to help him . For matters at home lent their anxiety to Nicholas . Some were the result of his having been born too late.  |p183His  mother was no longer young , and he was all she had . There was not much money left of the thousands that China teas and porcelains , India shawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the Crocketts . It had gone with lost ships and the decline in the yards , with the results of panic and war and of his father 's too hopeful nature . True there were two great houses , his grandfather Winship 's and their own , stately memorials of better and more gracious times ; but houses took money for care and upkeep . Nicholas , in point of solid fact , must soon bear a man 's portion in a world which at present favoured ill for his talents and desires . He was adamant against college and any subsequent professionwhich might yield him an irksome livelihood ; and Solace , knowing full well the determination characteristicof the Crocketts , always men of single minds , gave up one by one the arguments with which she had attempted to banish his moody discouragement . " I 'd rather jig mackerel all my life , " he said to her when graduation was over and only the long summer stretched ahead with chores about the garden and barn , with haymaking in the meadows and odd jobs that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather do that than hump around back roads with a doctor 's kit and not know what to do for people . I 'd rather freeze to death off the Banks than sit all my life at a lawyer 's desk . And schoolmastering'sno good , at least for me . I 'm not much at books , you know that . But I know ships and a bit about navigation , and I 'm going to try those examinations they 're giving in Portland in August . It might be even that I 'd show I was better than an able seaman . "  | Nicholas took the examinations and proved he was far better than an able seaman . The hours that he had neglectedhis Latin for Maury 's Wind and Current Charts , his Sailing Directions , and Physical Geography of theSea began to prove that his time had not been unwisely spent . His neat , accurate drawings and his quick , intelligenthandling of the problems set before him had their just reward . In September he was offered a lesser officer'sberth in a ship bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no glorious name like the clippers , being called only the Mildred May , which he thought foolish enough ; she had lost her splendour aloft , and her square sails were supplemented by fore and aft rigging . The port to which she sailed , as his grandfather had prophesied , was neither Canton nor Sydney . But she was the best that was offered , and Nicholas was fast learning that one must adjust oneself to the exigencies and changes of time . At all events , she was rounding the Horn , and since he could not race through the roaring forties as he might have done in 1851 had things been different , her course was at least far ahead of that of a fishing schooner for the Banks . Best of all , Deborah , on the eve of leaving for the seminary at Mt . Holyoke smiled upon the Mildred May and Nicholas ' officership thereon . He pictured his ship in glowing words to her . She might have been the Flying Cloud or the Bald Eagle from the way his voice rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . The trees were already bright and the birds were gathering to go  --  thrushes scurryingp185silently among the undergrowth , towhees and phoebes and whitethroats . A soft haze lay over everything and there was no wind . Deborah was kind on that last afternoon . All her suddencomplexities , all her incomprehensible ways , all her arts of making him uncomfortable and bewildered , were mercifully absent from her . Even her vaulting ambitionsseemed for the time asleep . Nicholas put his arm tightly about her waist , and she played with his long , strong fingers . If she did not tell him in so many words that she loved him , her behaviour suggested that fact and overwhelmed him with adoring gratitude . Nor did she laugh once at his own ambitions and high purposes . She even said as they rested against a boulder with her wide blue skirt spread out upon it and her feet and ankles peepingout from beneath its ruffled hem : " There 's something about you , Nicholas , that keeps you in my mind for hours after we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , do you know , I wish I 'd never seen you ? " Nicholas told her then about the bubble-party , how from that day to this she had never once been out of his mind , not only for hours but for days and weeks on end . I is had never believed he would dare say all the things he was saying in a torrent of confidence to Deborah , there in the quiet of the September woods and in the warm glow of her unfamiliar graciousness . He told her that he would carry her picture every moment high in his waistcoatpocket and that it would keep him from all the temptations which beset men in port and of which she , he was glad to say , knew nothing . Perhaps Deborah did notp186know , but she knew how to give him back his kisses , surprisingand intoxicating him so that he went homeward happier and more secure in his mind than he had ever been in all his life . The voyage to San Francisco was long and hard , nearly five months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clippers had traversed in four and less . Nicholas slaved early and late , helping to kick and beat into shape a motley and sullen crew of ne'er-do-wells and to exact from them a minimum of labour . The pumps were busy for at least half the time , for the Mildred May proved herself leaky and unstable long before they had rounded the Horn . The winter rains and fogs made of San Francisco a far more dismal place than he had ever pictured it ; necessary repairs in port lost them two cargoes ; and Deborah was unsatisfactory in the one letterwhich he received from her . Only the memory of that September afternoon in the Saturday Cove woods kept Nicholas storming about the decks , a whirlwind of good-natured and reliable activity , and won for him a second officer 's job on the long way back . It was late July when they at last reached Boston and mid-August before he was free to travel homeward , a freedom hastened by a sudden message from his mother which said that his grandmother was fast slipping away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday Cove . They were waiting only his return before they placed her in the churchyard with Reuben andp187Nicholas , Silas and James , Amos and Amos ' wife Mary , who had been born when King George 's War was making the backwoods more unsafe than ever and who had died without knowing that the Revolution had ended and that shipping was free once more . Nicholas stood , tall and brown and rugged , unquestionablyyears older , Solace thought , by his mother and looked upon his grandmother lying in the front parlour , between the two great windows looking seaward , her coffin placed against the wall from which the gardens and fountains of Versailles looked down upon her . Amos Crockett had bought that paper in 1793 in Paris while the Terror was raging . There was little demand for things which had to do with Versailles in 1793 , and Amos had bought the paper for little . He had always regretted that Mary could not have lived to see it , once it was spread upon the walls that he had built . Now Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had owned for generations and which marked their proud voyaging to the far ports of the world : the portraits of Judah , James , and Amos and of Amos ' brother Benjamin , selfassured , contented , eager men in gilded frames ; the painting of Amos ' ship Mary , full-rigged with colours flying leaving Marseilles , and that of Judah , his father , named for Judah 's wife , Sarah , who had lived so long ago that not even a vestige of her remained in anyone 's memory , although she had been a prime housekeeper and a woman of many other parts as well ; the carved , highbackedchairs of English oak which Amos had brought from London ; the highboy and chests and cabinets with their multiplicity of knick-knacks ; the Heppelwhite table and the fire-screen with Chinese dragons , which Eliza Ann Shaw had found time to work in imported silks between bearing her ten children . Abigail Crockett lay among all these things which she had dusted twice a week and closed the door upon except on the rare days when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests or given a neighbourhood party and , as a widow , had come in quite by herself to look about her . She seemed to have shrunken pitiably in death , Nicholas thought , lying so deeply within the stiff , unreal folds of satin that he , towering above her , felt somehow as though he were already looking into her grave . He could not discern any familiar line or expression in her still face , not even carelessness of death which he , knowing her , had half expected to find . She had so completely gone that he , gazing upon her with his arm about his mother , found himself summoning frantically back all her countlessmannerisms , tricks of voice and hands and speech , all her sudden spurts of life , all her words and thoughts that had betokened her wisdom and humour and made her so incontestably what she had been . When they had once come back to him , clear and shining , her punishments , her frosting-bowl , Moses and Nebuchadnezzar , her Saturday night scrubs , it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat her loneliness and give life to her nothingness . " She went without any fuss just as she always wanted , " Solace said , " in her sleep ; I do n't even know when . I found her gone when I went up in the morning to take her a cup of tea . I 'm sorry she could n't have seen you . She grew brighter somehow for two weeks or so beforep189and talked about you and how she knew you 'd command a ship like all the others before many years . She even took up her knitting again and began some socks for you . I think she knew she was going . The last few days she talked a lot about the things in here , how she wanted you should have them all and how some day they might fetch money if you were ever in need . She was what I call a big woman , Nicholas . This world wo n't make a finer one no matter how it goes on and on making people . I 've thought since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about or have sensible thoughts upon . " Her mother 's words about his grandmother kept coming back to Nicholas , now comforting , now reproachful , during his next voyage around the Horn and back as secondofficer of the Mildred May . Like the former it was a hard voyage in a ship ill-fitted for the sturdy demands of her course ; and it was made harder for Nicholas because of Deborah , at home for the summer and far less gracious than the year before . Deborah had her own problems , she had told Nicholas , quite as insistent as his . She might even go away from Saturday Cove for good and all . The new trustees of the academy , who had recentlytaken the place of older , more conservative men , held that the academy needed a younger head , one more urgent as to discipline and more alive to the needs of the young who were beginning to feel the lack of relationshipbetween their antiquated studies at school and the demands made upon them by a new world . Deborah did not blame the trustees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it was a new world , she said , a world of land rather than of the water he per- sisted in sailing upon . Look at the New West , she said , with rich land for the asking and with cities springing up over night , some even now with art schools like Chicago . She had come to think , she told Nicholas with a hard glint in her eyes which hurt him worse than her frequent refusalsto let him kiss her , that really all the up-and-corningyoung men were going West  --  young men who dared to strike out for themselves instead of stubbornly pursuinga lost calling just because their fathers had pursued it . But she did not know that it concerned her one way or another how Nicholas felt about one 's work in the world or for that matter whether her father stayed on in Saturday Cove with his musty old Latin and Greek . She might even go West herself , she said ominously to him when he had come to say goodbye . It was a rainy afternoon when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downpour that he had worn his oilskins over his blue clothes and looked more like a sailor than ever when he entered the Parsons ' sittingroom . He had walked through the village and to the fishing-wharves before he had mustered up courage to turn back and mount the hill to the prceptor 's white house . He sensed foreboding in the dark , windy day , the fog that lay over the harbour , the wet filth about the piers where the laden boats were discharging their messy freight . Young men whom he had known in school were standing in the holds of the fishing-boats knee-deep in herring , shovelling these by great slippery shovelfuls into baskets on pulleys , which bore them either to the larger schooners waiting to carry them away or to the new canning factory recently built in Saturday Cove . Thep191men and boys who stood in the thousands upon thousands of fish were bronzed and tired . Fish scales clung to their hair and to the stubble on their faces . They lived a hard life and were working only to get home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to their outgoing boats . The rain was beating against the panes of the sittingroomwhen he at last sat opposite Deborah , who was sortingout some sketches before the fire . She wore a gray dress with a broad white collar about her neck and had never looked more beautiful , Nicholas thought . When he said so , she did not seem to notice overmuch , being busy with the papers and cardboard on her lap . It was a difficult afternoon . The memory of it rankled in Nicholas ' mind throughout every hour of his long voyage , lying there to torment him with the uneasy knowledge that something was wrong and then suddenly raising its head to confront him with what the something was . There was a young man in Boston , Deborah said  --  it seemed only right that she should tell Nicholas , seeing how he felt  --  who had asked her to share his life and fortune . He was a lawyer , already settled in business , although he was sensibly thinking of pulling up stakes and going where there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure in her own mind exactly how she felt about him , but there he was . She thought it only fair that Nicholas should know , nor did she think it fair to encourage him in any behaviour with which in ill-judged moments she might have encouraged him in the past . Better for them both , thought Deborah , to forget the past and let time take its own course.  | " It 's no use making plans , Nicholas , " said Deborah 's icy voice , " when I do n't even know yet how I feel . I thought I did last year , but now I 'm sure I do n't . No , there 's nothing wrong with you . You 're just what you 've always been , and always will be . You 're not the changing kind . I 'll always like and admire you , but that 's all I 'm ready to say . You do n't need to feel so bad about it . There are plenty of girls in the world , and men , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , indifferent voice and of her fingers forever sorting and resorting her sketches never once left Nicholas as they sailed down the slopes of tossing water toward the Horn and up again toward San Francisco . It burned within him , making him hot and breathless within his heavy sea clothes in icy squalls of sleet and snow , now firing anger and resentment , now hurting him with an ache beside which wearinessand the manifold irritations of an old , poorly manned ship were as nothing . The voyage seemed neverending , monotonous in the very evenness of its consistent ill luck . When they at last reached San Francisco after five months of infinite desolation , there was no word from Deborah even although , now that the Union and the Central Pacific had united their lines to make transcontinentaltravel and mails an easy certainty , there had been time for half a hundred letters . Nicholas lost his head then , doing this also with the completeness of the Crocketts , Silas and James , old Judah and Amos , who under like circumstances would have behaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were not lost ) precisely as the last of theirp193line . He met a woman in San Francisco , or rather she met him , overtaking him quite by chance on the last night of their stay in port when the hope for letters had gone for good and when everything else had left Nicholas except bitter resentment and fury . The woman , who was old enough to have borne Nicholas , banished these emotionsby supplying for the moment a tumult of others more bearable , which in turn left him with nothing but disgust and self-loathing and the restless memory of insane promises when he boarded his ship at dawn . It was then and during succeeding days that he thought of his grandmother , now that he had proved himself unworthyof even a memory of Deborah . He might , he told himself as he paced the pitching decks and fought his way forward and aft through engulfing seas , have told AbigailCrockett had she been anywhere to tell . He had a feeling that she might have returned even his anxious confidence with a sympathy in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing compared to her quick understanding of what had made him do as he had done . Now that he could look back upon her , review his boyhood with her , she fulfilled in his mind the truth of his mother 's words that there was nothing she did not know about and think sensibly upon . But since her understanding was closed to him , since the brightness had now quite gone from his world , he experienced a bitter relief as they stumbled homeward through gray seas ( Nicholas for once careless of delays and ill luck ) that he was free at least from the necessity of telling Deborah what she , in common with most decent young women in the 1870 's , could never have understood for the fraction of a second . The necessity of telling Deborah did not dissolve itself so easily . For when he reached home once more , there was Deborah , more winning and needful of him than she had ever been . She was sorry about not writing since he had evidently been anxious , but she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him as free as she herself had wanted to be . Now Saturday Cove , she said , seemed to be her portion whether she would or no . The trustees of the academy had been spared an embarrassing interview with her father , for he had died suddenly while Nicholas was in torment somewhere off Brazil . She and her mother were already preparing the preceptor 's house for a younger and more up-to-date man ; and they themselves were moving in a few weeks into the old Winshiphome , which Solace Crockett was glad to have occupiedagainst the dampness and mould sure to attack unuseddwellings . Her mother with a tenacity amazing to Deborah had refused to leave Saturday Cove . Her friends of eleven years were there , she said , and at over sixty one could not pull up stakes and transplant oneself . Nor had Deborah 's father on a salary of five hundred dollars a year left them too well off . They would best leave well enough alone , said Deborah 's mother , and thank the Lord daily for their many blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore on and Deborah constantly warmed towardp195him . He was even grateful that the Mildred May was undergoing extensive repairs in Boston before taking to sea again . She would not be ready before January , her commander wrote . He only hoped that Nicholas could wait for her and him . Nicholas waited . Now when he saw Deborah as he did almost every evening , he said good-night to her in his grandfather 's old sitting-room . It was good to see her there . She kept red apples on the table and oxalis in the window-brackets . The wide hall was no longer cold and still , and the doors of the rooms upstairs stood open . The subtle , persistent change creeping over Saturday Cove was evidenced even in the fact that Nicholas did his courting of Deborah in the Winship sitting-room whereas Silas had sat with Solace Winship in the front parlour . The doors of the front parlour were closed now upon its former light and grandeur as were the doors of the front parlours everywhere in Saturday Cove now that great ships came no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of the past when talk had flowed on about half the world . Back parlours did very well now ; for not only did front ones take extra wood to heat them , but housekeepers of a second generation were wont to guard priceless possessions against daily wear and tear . Indeed , after those sweeping changes in shipping in the sixties and seventies , changes social as well as economic , there was a gradual shifting from front to back parlours along the entire coast of Maine . The knowledge that he must one day tell Deborah about the woman in San Francisco still weighed upon Nicholas , but he pushed it ahead into the future as far asp196it would go . When one was living in Paradise , it was monstrous to descend into Hell . He shrank from the suffering of Deborah once regained and then perhaps irretrievablylost . If he could but make himself necessary enough to her , she might forgive him when the wretched hour came that he must tell ; and although his honesty reproved him for what he felt to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was powerless to resist . The woman in San Francisco was mercifully silent . No word came from her to Nicholas . She had , in fact , forgottenall about him ; his young promises had meant nothing to her no matter how they nagged at his honest nature . She recalled his visit only to laugh at his inexperience when men wiser in the ways of the world sought her avours . Her careless , mirthful confidences to them would have made Nicholas ' cheeks burn with humiliation could he have heard them . But as things were , he was grateful for her silence which in a measure healed his fears if it did not effectively quiet his conscience . Deborah that cold winter in Saturday Cove was irresistible . She set at nought his worries over the long-deferredsailing of his ship and consequent loss of hardearnedmoney . When the ice closed the harbour and the fishing-boats were hauled up and the village fell half asleep , she made it for him a place of warmth and light . Nicholas dutifully played cribbage with Deborah 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches , sewed by the table till the old clock sounded nine . Then he had Deborah to himself for an hour and a half before he took the dark shore road for home.  |p197On  Sundays Deborah and her mother dined at the Crockett home , coming together from church where the Reverend Ethan Fisher , for twenty years in the churchyard , had been superseded by a younger man , who , ardentthough he was in the yearly seasons of revival and in the cause of temperance now sweeping New England , did not feel called upon to concern himself quite so vitally with the private affairs of his parish and the strict keeping of the Sabbath day . Nicholas and Deborah spent an unconscionablylong time in Abigail Crockett 's kitchen doing the dinner dishes on Sunday . A great cook stove there had long since taken the place of the brick oven which Abigail had used for years . Only a wall of red brick showed where the fireplace with its pots and cranes once had been . Tin kettles now took the place of iron ones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths of birch and spruce than the logs which had in the thirties and forties still fired the old oven . 1 ) eborah was fussy about dish washing . New and ingenioussoap-shakers gave her plenty of hot suds , and the kettles must be kept filled for her careful rinsing of glasswareand silver . Nicholas was in heaven while he dried the dishes for Deborah . He wore a great apron of his mother 's over his Sunday suit and followed Deborah 's directions to the last minute of hanging the scrubbed dish-towels on the clothes line in the back yard . In April the Mildred May was ready to sail again , loading her cargo this time not for San Francisco , as both her owners and her commander had at last come to admittingthat with all her overhauling she was unfit for the stormy passage around the Horn . She was now routedp198for Norfolk and Savannah to carry fish and manufactured goods and to bring back coal to Boston , or perhaps to go to New Orleans in season for cotton , although new railroadlines and steamships were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas ' threatened departure brought matters to a head between him and Deborah . One late April evening when the moist spring air came through the windows of the Winship sitting-room and some branches of wild plum which Deborah had gathered before their time of flowering were showing buds of white on the mantelpiece , Nicholas , sitting beside her on the old sofa , told her about the woman in San Francisco . He had asked Deborah to marry him when the spring came around again to mark his twenty-third birthday , and he would not claim her promise until she knew . Deborah on the whole was decentabout the story , which Nicholas stumbled through with his long brown hands covering his face and fumbling in the heavy hair above his forehead . She was even disposed to kindliness and a partial understanding when she saw his pathetic wretchedness and remembered how she herself had felt beneath the stress of his kisses . He went home late that night with the weight of a long year mercifully gone from his mind and body . He left the next morning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed more miraculouslythan new paint and cordage could ever have effected . Even Savannah , Norfolk , and New Orleans took on the outlines of Calcutta and Canton . Their low , dishevelled wharves , their hot suns and filthy blacks , rolling their eyes under cotton bales and canvas bucketsp199of filthier coal , had no power to depress him . Life and the world had given Nicholas more than he had dared hope ; and time and chance no longer loomed ominously before his re-opened eyes . Nicholas and Deborah were married the following spring after Nicholas in a year of coast sailing had risen to the first officer 's berth on the Mildred May and at least partially replenished his flat pockets . They were married on the forty-fourth anniversary of Solace 's wedding day and in the Saturday Cove church where she had swept up the aisle on Silas ' arm , strong within its folds of best blue  --  roadcloth , her shaking hand held close against the cream  --  tin of his fine waistcoat . Neither Deborah nor Nicholas ad wanted so simple a wedding as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it to please Solace . Nicholasore a new blue suit with the buttons and braid whichoved his recent promotion , and Deborah was quiteautiful enough in a gown of pale green silk with a iquant hat to match sitting high upon her fair head. he church was quite as well filled as on Solace 's wedding day although the guests were more sombre in appearance and although social distinctions were far less closelyarked . Miss Serena Osgood was there , shrunken andfeeble , still faithful in her fading memory to an old romance , which only a scant handful in Saturday Cove somuch as dimly remembered . The Winship home was again open for a wedding re- ception , its front and back parlours again made into one great room . Lilacs once more banked the fireplaces , and the sunlight fell upon the polished furniture below Thomas Winship 's carved ships above his white doorways . Deborah and Nicholas with their mothers received their friends in the front parlour ; and although there was no wedding-bell above the heads of the bridal couple and far less ceremony in the presentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordiality and good humour . There was plenty to eat and an abundance of coffee and good fruit punch to drink . The temperance agitation of the seventies banned the more vivifying beveragesof 1830 just as their social seriousness in general discouraged any dancing upon the unkempt orchard grass . Nor did the talk now include the world in its scope ; nor were the ladies ' costumes so costly and picturesque ; nor were there men about in satin and broadcloth , goldheadedcanes and buff top hats  --  prosperous , self-assured men home for a season with the magic of China and India about them and their ships perchance riding at anchor in the very harbour . But it was a beautiful day all the same and a fully satisfyingoccasion ; and if the velvet on the chairs was a bit faded and the muslin curtains a bit less fine and the house in general less spruce than it had been , there were few there who could remember acutely enough to note the difference . Miss Serena , it is true , kept repeating from the chair in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since the fact was obvious and everyone had grown used to it , more pity was accorded to Miss Serena than to time . Nicholas and Deborah did not drive away in a coach.  |p20IThe  green and yellow one had been scrapped as useless twenty years before . They did not drive away at all , but after everything was over and their guests had gone and they themselves had helped to put the house in order , they walked in the early evening to the Crockett home and under the syringas in the garden ate the supper which Deborah had prepared . Deborah , it had been decided , was to make her home ( and Nicholas ' ) with Solace Crockett . It seemed the best plan all around . Deborah knew that she would get along better with her mother-in-law than with her mother , and from long experience her mother knew it , too . Mrs. Parsons was quite able , she said , to make out by herself . No house was large enough to hold two families , she wisely concluded ; and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some country girl who wanted to attend the academy and who for her board would help with household chores . Deborah did get on better with Solace Crockett than with her mother . Indeed , she got on very well . She had Solace 's idea of her to keep untarnished , and a thorough respect for her mother-in-law stimulated and strengthenedher resolve . She might have her ups and downs with Nicholas ; his very adoration of her and his annoyingpatience made them inevitable ; but they were not to reach his mother 's eyes and ears . And when Nicholas Was away , as he must be most of the time , Deborah would like the dignity of awaiting his return in a house which bespoke a larger world than that of Saturday Cove even though that world had now withdrawn itself homeward across the seas . There were no ups and downs during their firstp202weeks together in their new life . Solace Crockett stayed on with Mrs. Parsons in the house where she had been born and left Deborah and Nicholas to themselves . They lived those weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Saturday Cove had no part . They did the things which they had done as children , picked wild strawberries from the thick meadow grass , fished for flounders in Nicholas ' old dory , pulled their lobster-pots and dug their clams , picnickedon the boulder in the woods where Deborah had once told Nicholas that she could not get him out of her head for some hours after she had seen him . The ups and downs came when Nicholas had gone to the Mildred May and Deborah was left with Saturday Cove as background and foreground , past and present and future . And because Solace must be kept inviolable from Deborah 's moods , they were all the more heaped upon Nicholas once he was at home again . Before a year was up , Nicholas approached his homecomings with a stealthy dread creeping insidiously into his expectations and desires . Fear made inroads upon his longing to see Deborah , the fear that in their hours together there would be upbraidings of his stubborn determination to stay under sail when there were steamships in plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with half the spunk of Nicholas , if he would only think of her and not entirely of himself . Steamships made quicker passages and more money ; and , after all , they were ships and they moved in the sea , which was clearly more to Nicholas than was Deborah herself . An officer 's berth on a steamship might mean a home or at least roomsp203in Boston or New York during the winter months where Deborah might conceivably take up her art again and not decay in Saturday Cove as she most certainly was doing with no one to teach her anything that she did not know already . Nicholas was always slow in replying to Deborah 's impatience . First of all , he was perplexed by the fact that Deborah never could be made to understand how he felt about a sailing-ship and his family 's connection therewith , a connection so long that to Nicholas it was indissoluble . And while he was honestly endeavouring to understand why she could not understand , Deborah 's impatience was sure to progress into reproach and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one thing to feel anger against Deborah when she had kept him upon tenter-hooks before she had made up her mind to marry him ; but now that she was his , anger was as impossibleas was the abrupt changing of his life to complywith her pleading . Nicholas ' wounded stubbornness acted but as a spur to Deborah 's ready imagination . She could think of a hundred things to say to Nicholas to which he had no answer . When all else failed to move him , there was always the woman in San Francisco to fall back upon in order to make him aware of his unworthiness . To this last and final goad , which always plunged Nicholas into black humiliation and remorse , there was clearly no countercharge . Fate seemingly dealt winning cards to Deborah in the fall of 1875 . The Mildred May , bound adventurously and unwisely to Bermuda , capsized in a gale off Hatteras . Things looked bad enough from the start , but almost cer- tain peril swiftly became disaster when she caught fire and within three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas was the only one to reach shore and safety after three days of frightful privation and suffering . Nicholas lost two men from burns too terrible to weather the thirst and exposure demanded of them and returned home himself so haggard and ill that Deborah , even while she bided her time , was swept by tendernessand pity . Nicholas was cited in the papers for his hardihood and sense , and companies and captains began once more to know of Saturday Cove and what it could produce in men . While he rested at home in the short November days , offers came to him . New steamship companies were proving eager for officers trained thus under sail . The successor to the great Charles Morgan , who in his long life given to steamship building and navigation had built and managed one hundred and seventeen craft of every conceivable description , came forward with the captaincy of a new steamer of seventeen hundred tons built to traversethe dangerous waters of the Gulf of Mexico . The newly organized Savannah Line , itself boastful that its steamboats were designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , nay urged upon Nicholasthe command of one of its best . When letters and telegrams of this nature reached SaturdayCove , Solace , dictated by her pride in Nicholas as well as by her anxiety for his future , joined her forces with those of Deborah . Nicholas might as well face facts , she said . It was no use beating one 's head against a stone wall . She was all for sail herself as her life witnessed ,  |p205but  if there was no sail , what was one to do ? A stubborn determination like that of Nicholas could not raise up sailing-ships . Nicholas sat in his father 's chair by the fire until Christmas and listened to his mother and Deborah , holdingoff meanwhile the southern steamship lines although he knew well what he would say to them . He was standing with his back to the wall , fighting desperately against being overwhelmed . Time had beaten him and so had chance , which had wrecked the Mildred May and brought him to the unwelcome notice of companies and courses which he despised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloriously lost . On the last day of December when he felt his powers of resistance waning like the spent year  --  a year that had left him poorer in pocket and more distressed in mind than he had been since his marriage  --  two things , leaping suddenly above his horizon , confronted him with the promise of a new world . The brief day was dark with flurries of icy snow when he went outside in the afternoon to look upon the still open and forsaken harbour . The brown , snowless fields and ridges were gaunt and lifeless . Indecision nagged within him , an emotion rather than a state of mind , making him worn and half ill in spite of his mother 's attempts to build him up again with food and sleep . Deborah had gone earlier to the village , declining his company , and he wandered about awaiting her return , miserable without her , more miserable in her presence . The sun was lying low and pale above the western spruces when she at last came home . She told her news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on a low stool with her long hands stretched out before the fire . Solace had made her some hot tea , and she held the cup far from her as she told them . The doctor had confirmed her alternate hopes and fears , she said . Th ere was a baby coming in the early summer . When she had told them with her eyes on Nicholas ' face , Nicholas rose and walked about the room , not saying a word to Deborah . He was tingling all over his body , feeling as he had felt when they had studied their Latin lessons in this very room . He was half glad , half sorry that Deborah had not waited to tell him when they were alone . The baby 's coming , he knew , could not now be an isolated fact , complete and triumphant in itself . It was swathed and circumscribed by the necessity for quick decisions , by offers for steady and higher wages , and by Deborah 's loneliness and fear . One could not make a simple statement of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural , long-desired happening so complexand bewildering . At last he came and stood by Deborah after his mother had gathered up the tea things and gone to the kitchen . Deborah leaned her head against him while the early darkness settled outside the window and the sharp snow flakes began to click against the panes . She said : " There 's some one else to think of now , Nicholas , besidesjust you and what you want . You 'd best telegraph Savannah , do n't you think ? They 're holding it open for you until to-morrow . " He bent and kissed Deborah then and got his coat and cap from the hallway . He went along the shore road ,  |p207stumbling  over the ruts of frozen ground now fast filling with snow . He felt as though years had passed over him since Deborah had come home . When he reached the village postoffice , the stage had just arrived with the evening mail . He went in to wait for its leisurely distribution , glad to defer his visit to the store which also held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail , the Bangor and Portlandpapers , the Farmers ' Almanac for 1876 , the few letters , the overdue Christmas packages . The small outer enclosure of the office was filled with men and boys , women and girls muffled against the cold . Nicholas stood in one corner , returning vaguely the greetings of his neighbours , wondering if any among them beneath their hoods and wraps were faced with problems like his own or were burning within themselves from a secret akin to his . Once the slot was opened , he crowded forward with the others for the contents of his box . There was a letter from the Savannah Line , repeating its offer , urging upon him a quick and favourable decision ; there was the Boston paper ; and there within the folds of the paper and hidden from his first inspection of what the mail might offer , was yet another letter addressed to him in a cramped , decisive , unknown hand . He retreated to his corner to open and read the letter while those behind him in the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a hundred boxes which he had recently filled . Nicholas forgot everyone there and elsewhere as he read  --  Jonas Norton 's father , who had retired and was growing old , Lieutenant Simp- son , who now used his wooden leg in skippering one of the best schooners on the Banks , a small boy to whom he had promised one of his earlier ship-models and who was gazing at him with admiring eyes , even Deborah and Solace waiting for him by the fire with supper ready . He saw only the long seas stretching southward from the equator to Good Hope , the still glassy water of the doldrumssplattered by driving slants of hot rain , the fair , rolling clouds of the southeast trades , the tearing gusts and squalls of the westerlies . " I have a first officer 's berth to Hongkong to offer you , " he was reading , " on my own ship , one of the best as you may know , knowing ships . We are just now in and sail again from New York on the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took my first orders as a mere boy from your grandfather . I hope you may see your way to joining us . I have a good crew , mostly of home men and boys , rare in these days , and the second and third officers are first-rate stuff . There are those that think that to follow sail in these days is to waste a good man 's time ; but knowing your family and reading the record of your recent disaster off Hatteras , I am constrained to believe that you are of different mind . " Nicholas ' telegram went not to Savannah but to Searsport , to a name known throughout New England as that of a master mariner and commander . A half-hour later he burst into the dining-room upon Deborah and Solace waiting at the supper table , the tired lines erased from his face , his eyes again lighted by the old glow as he told them . His mother watching him thought of Silas twentyfiveyears before at the launching of the Surprise , and allp209her misgivings faded into nothingness as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main offensiveuntil she and Nicholas should be alone , still harbouredher own . " You do n't mean , Nicholas , that you 're turning down a captaincy to keep only what you 've had for two years . " " Yes , " said Nicholas . " I suppose it looks like that to people who do n't understand . But there 's not much in commanding a thing you 've no respect for . Everyone knows the ship I 'm taking . She 's the best of those that are left . I 'd rather sail on her as cook than to pilot a Morgan steamer through a Galveston swamp or to carry fancy passengers from New York to Savannah . " " What about your future ? " went on Deborah 's still voice , so still that Nicholas , knowing what smouldered beneath its stillness , fidgeted uneasily in his chair . " You 've got to think of that more than ever now . " " I know . That 's just what 's made me do as I have done . I 'll be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a ship , and he 'll be proud , too . " " Is the voyage long ? " asked Deborah after an uneasy silence . " If you sail the first of March way off there , when will you be back ? " Nicholas 's eyes fell before the steady gleam of her own . " It 'll be seven months at least , " he said , " with all things going right . Most likely far longer . I 'm sorry , Deborah . " " You do n't mean ! " cried Deborah , and then stopped , remembering her reserves kept tightly in check for Nicholas ' ears alone . Nicholas appealed silently to his mother.  |p2I0  " I 'm afraid you do n't quite understand , Deborah , " said Solace . " Women whose husbands go to sea expect these things  --  or worse . And you 'll be glad he 's away . Men are no good at such times . I 've never ceased to be glad that Nicholas ' father was n't here with me . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely took everyone 's appetite , " I suppose that that 's all in the way different women look at it . Times have changed and women , too , since Nicholas was born . " Deborah 's main offensive lasted well through the night . There were tears and upbraidings , sobs and threats , cleverly drawn pictures of her sacrifices and of Nicholas ' stubborn unworthiness . By dawn even the southeast trades had lost their lure , and Nicholas was wondering as he lay beside Deborah , at last asleep , how two months were to be weathered before the Searsport ship sailed on the first of March . At half-past six he stumbled down the stairs to light the fires for his mother . Snow was falling , and the fields and meadows stretching to the slate-coloured harbour were white and still in the pale light of the winter dawn . He stood by the sink in the kitchen watching the sky slowly brighten , glad of the stillness in the house , fearful of breakfast . He heard the muffled , distant tones of the clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died away and the day became inevitable , he saw a well-bundledman limping through the unbroken snow to the back door . It was Lieutenant Simpson , who had once taught him to drill with a wooden gun on the school playground ,  |p211now  Captain Simpson , successful skipper of the schooner Lydia , a " high-liner " in the fresh halibut fishing on the ( ; rand Banks . Captain Simpson did not apologize for his untimely call as he entered the kitchen upon Nicholas ' surprised invitation . For a man who habitually breakfastedat four A.M. , seven doubtless seemed well on into the day . He stood upon Abigail Crockett 's yellow floor with his legs , real and unreal , well apart , shook the snow from his heavy cap , tugged at his muffler , looked appraisingly , perhaps admiringly , at Nicholas . He himself came from no family like the Crockett 's , and yet he had used his time and talents well . A pension in payment for his kg had been wisely spent and substantially increased in the one thing he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout new schooner of one hunredand twenty tons and , unlike most Maine fishermen , ad had the foresight to desert cod and mackerel for theore lucrative , if more perilous , pursuit of halibut . I le was not disposed to preambles or to unnecessary xplanations . Standing there in the kitchen with the sticks f spruce crackling in the black stove and the snow falling to ; idily without , he said to Nicholas : " I 'm not callatin ' on how you 'll blow , Nicholas , but ' ' I I come to the point straight on . I 've lost my best man or this month 's trip : he 's been took sick ; and we sailith this afternoon 's tide . I 've six dories and I need welve men . When I saw you last night in the postoffice , had an idea that seemed even better once I 'd slept on it . is no summer picnic , my job ai n't , but there 's money in t . We aim to make the trip in twenty days at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some ninety thousandp2I2pounds of fresh stuff , and each man 'll stand to make his two hundred dollars or more . We do n't have no fancy ranks aboard as you know . Each fellow does his share . But I 've known you and what you come from , and if you 're favourable to go along , I 'll give you a half of my own turnover , which ought to mean nigh four hundred dollars to you . I 've some good strong fellows , but I need another man with a head on his shoulders for bad weather and with wits that jump in a fix . And I thought if you was layin ' off waitin ' till spring for somethin ' more in your own line , you might consider my offer till that somethin ' shows up  --  in the interim , as they say , so to speak . " Nicholas looked at Captain Simpson . Although he knew nothing of all that was passing through Nicholas ' mind , he seemed at that moment to have come in the guise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air in his lungs , wide free skies above and about him . He felt money in his hands against new necessity . Upstairs he heard his mother and Deborah moving about in preparation for another day , the first of many days until March should come , days which would beat steadily against him with their weight of opposition and reproach . He stood leaning against the old chest where he had heard his grandmother 's songs and eaten her gingerbread-men . He heard Captain Simpson say : " Like as not I 've kind of taken you off your feet , so to speak , but the fact is I ai n't much time left . I ca n't wait much beyond ten o'clock to know . " " You do n't need to wait , " said Nicholas then . " Not an hour . I 'll be ready . And  --  thanks . "  |p213Life  returned to Nicholas once they were anchored in the bitter gray waters of the Banks . He had felt it coming back during the five days that they worked northeastward , using head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks to keep from freezing , and on off hours clustering about the fire in the stuffy cabin . Order was slowly taking the place of confusion in his mind ; assurance was banishing the blackness of indecision ; the rightness of his allegiance was again establishing itself . Perhaps even now , he thought in the cold hour of his watch , he might begin , late as it seemed , his victory over time and chance . The fishing itself at once stabilized and increased his renewed faith and confidence by the very rigour of its demands . It left no hours for misgivings , no moments for questioning as to one 's course of action . From the first hint of dawn until the last shadowy gleam of daylightit gave , in return for monstrous labour , at least the negative peace of a mind unable from utter weariness of body to be anxious . By five o'clock in the darkness and cold of the January mornings they were rolling from their bunks , numb from the heaviness of their sleep , stiff from cold and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They drew on their great boots over the heavy socks in which they had slept , buttoned on their extra shirts , their pea-jackets , their oilskins , spread mutton tallow from the common can over and within the worst of the cuts and bruises on their hands . Before or after , between or among these operations , they breakfasted , the starboard gang of six in one lot , the port in another , crowding the galley , drinking down cups of scalding coffee in which hardtack might be soaked , devouring great bowls of corn-meal mush sweetened with molasses or brown sugar and slabs of platebeef wedged between slices of soggy , unbuttered bread . Then the dories must be inspected and made ready , the gaffs and gobsticks tested by smart whacks upon the stout gunwales in the dim light of the lanterns , the allowance of water stored . When the first rays of light began to penetrate the obscurity of gray , lowering skies and the more mighty obscurity of winter fogs , the dories were made ready for lowering without delay , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost . Nicholas ' labour on the Mildred May was as nothing to this . So exacting was it , so stealthy in its every moment of danger , that he felt as though his life heretofore had been spent in sleep in comparison with the omnipresent vigilance demanded of eyes and ears , hands and back and legs . When the dories slipped away from the vessel and started through the cold , tossing seas for the trawling grounds where the great lines with their baited ground hooks had been set the afternoon before , there was not the fraction of a second in which a man could be safely off his guard . There was fog to watch ; there was the wind , the slightest shifting of which must be noted and reckoned with lest the position of the Lydia might be lost in fog or darkness and the dories lost in their turn once they had mistaken the home and shelter to which they would hasten as soon as the trawls had been hauled.  |p215There  was danger from heavy , breaking seas ready to slide over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish were gaffed ; there was danger from the fish themselves unless they were stunned by the gobstick before they were thrown into the bottom of the labouring dory ; and there was danger from ice which sometimes appeared suddenly as though rising from the sea , ghosts haunting a ghostly waste of water , jagged cakes , any one of which might smash them into bits , indiscernible in fog , often unnoticed in the blank whiteness of the winter atmosphereeven when fog was mercifully absent . And always there was the more stealthy danger from exposure and from the cold that surrounded them as though , Nicholasthought , they were but pulsating , living cells , the only life of a vast , lifeless world which was encircling them and gradually extending to them also its overwhelmingcold . Nicholas felt his muscles , unused to such strain , tearingbeneath his chafed flesh as he hauled in the trawls , heavy with fish each weighing from forty to two hundred . ounds . And then there was the long task of rowing homeward through stormy seas , sleet and hail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and laborious sk of landing their fish once they had reached the side . f the Lydia , hauling them in with their long-handledffs , one man in the tossing dory , the other on the rock-g schooner . There was dinner then , a quick meal ofore platebeef and coffee and hardtack , eaten , if they had  --  en lucky , long before noon ; and after it was over ande longed to stretch , drenched as one was , if only for alf an hour in a sodden bunk , there were thousands of pounds of fish to split and clean and throw into the icelinedhold . In passable weather the trawls were rebaited as they were pulled , and sunk again ; but in bad the baitingwas done after the fish were cleaned and stowed away . The tired men squatted by the trawl and bait tubs on the deck , cutting into hunks the by-products of their catch , cod and haddock and menhaden , which would serve for halibut food , and securing the hunks to six hundred hooks for the trawl-lines , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters between the anchoring buoys . Then in what daylight was left the dories slipped away again to lay the baited trawls , helped back home where there was fog or when darkness overtook them by a conch-shell blown by the cook or skipper or by the firing of the Lydia 's warning gun . When the darkness fell over the face of the desolate sea , and the dories were piled on deck ready for the dawn , and supper had been eaten , there was at last time for a pipe or two in the cabin before sleep settled upon them where they sat or lay , sleep so numbing that few had time or inclination to take off more than boots and outer coats , sleep so dreamless that no one recognized it as sleep until one must be wakened for his watch or to begin again the terrible and yet healing monotony of another day 's labour . All night through from early darkness at five until late daylight at seven watch must be kept turn and turn about , an hour to each man , cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen , icy shrouds to the lookout , but one did it , mechanically as though some hiddenmachinery within was hoisting heavy legs and feet , enabling cold fingers to clutch upon colder security.  | 17Drowsiness must be shaken off , the dark sea scanned and watched , mast lights scrutinized seemingly at every moment , for other schooners were passing on the way to and from Gloucester and Marblehead , Nantucket , or ports nearer home . Ice was an ever-present menace ; and now that steam had won its tough foothold , ocean ships might come looming from the darkness across their very anchorage . But at most the labour , terrific as it was in its strain on mind and body , was of short duration . In that , the halibut fishing was more lenient than the cod , in spite of the fact that skippers thus engaged could not wait to ride out gales or to lay off their fishing while they awaited decent weather . The Lydia , in common with other vessels charteredby the fishing companies , lost her profits unless she could deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty thousand pounds of fine white halibut , which would fetch seven and one-half cents , meant a wallet full of money to every man , provided he lost no time and balked at no hardship . Captain Simpson had chosen his men well . After six days of labour that brooked no delay and made allowance for no peril his hold was stocked with close to a hundred thousand pounds of the best fish he had ever taken on the Grand Banks . They had reached the grounds on Januaryvcnth , and late on the night of the fourteenth after a  --  ay that exceeded any they had yet spent because of its teadily increasing cold they were ready to hoist anchord start southward . Nicholas was aware of an almost peculiar sense of rewhenhe felt the Lydia respond to the icy wind in herp218sails and bound forward through following seas  --  peculiarin that he had experienced , at least consciously , no sense of dread while he had laboured at the fishing . Now , however , as they drove through the darkness he was grateful for their escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing rigour of their days . He lay in his bunk , half asleep , awaiting his watch at ten o'clock , and listened in a weary stupour to the talk of the tired men who lay about the narrow quarters . The air , cold though it was , was heavy with the smells of wet and dirty woollens , the fumes of cheap tobacco , the strong not unpleasant odour of the liniment with which some were rubbing the swollen muscles of their legs and arms , now freed for a season and in consequence more tortuous from pain . They were talking of less successful trips than this one when the smaller work had yielded smaller profits , spending their money more cautiously since it had been earned at dearer cost . One of them was saying : " I 've got a new kid at home . Likely enough he 'll get a baby carriage now . " Another was good-naturedly receiving banter upon his approaching marriage to a girl in Machiasport . He was stripped to his waist in spite of the cold and was rubbingsalve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was black with filthy grease . " If she seed you now , Bill , she 'd sure give you the go-bye . " " Not her ! " cried Bill . " She do n't turn a man down for cuts and sores when he 's worked like Hell for ' em . No , nor for bow legs neither . " Others were asleep in their bunks , their heavy , ster/torous breathing adding its weight to the closeness of the air . Nicholas was more weary than he had ever known a man could be . His back ached , the pain running down his thighs to his knees and ankles with sharp stabs of anguish . He shivered from the cold , wondering why the sweat stood out upon his face even as he pulled his dirty blankets more closely about him . At ten he dragged himself to his feet , put on his heavy shirts and fleece-lined jacket , his cap with ear-laps and his mittens , and made his way up the icy stairs to the deck . The cold was steadily falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot and pierced with stars and with the long streamers of the northern lights . Five below it had been at noon when they brought back their laden dories after the last great haul ; ten below at their four o'clock supper ; fifteen at " mugging up " time . There was no reason for looking at the deck thermometer , he thought , as he pulled himself up slowly and cautiously into the lookout ; there was small sense of adventure in this cold . Once at his post , well-propped against the stout wood of the mast which shielded him somewhat from the wind , he began his watch . He was glad to be away from the cabin and alone , weary and ill as he was . The thoughts which had been dulled by labour or waylaid by the necesaityfor constant vigilance came back to him there , high above the black sea , in the immensity of space . In seven days if the wind held good he would be at home , bathed and in a clean bed ; in five weeks he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life at last begin- ning after its long span of incompleteness . Even the hardest and least propitious of voyages in comparison with his experience of the past days would seem a yachtingcruise . And after a rest at home with the money he was bringing smoothing the way for everybody , he would be at the height of his powers , able to impress the finest of commanders with the knowledge that sail could never entirely pass from the seas since there were young men left who , like their fathers , were worthy of it . At brief intervals he swung his arms violently across and against his chest , although the pain of his action was almost less easily borne than the fear that prompted it . He began to do this once he had fully realized the cold , of which the man he had relieved had warned him . He continued to do it , soon not so much in fear of the cold itself as of the drowsiness which crept over him , dulling his mind and silencing the pain of his body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future closed down before him , black and opaque as was the dark wall of the night beyond his shortenedvision . He could not pierce it , try as he would . In its place the past came back , not thronging upon him , gay and bright with memories , but gleaming fitfully through long stretches of darkness as fireflies gleam over Maine meadows and through tangled roadside thickets on warm July evenings . Once he mistook the Lydia for the Duncan Dunbar rushing on through black waters for Sydney Heads . He even roused himself with painful suddenness at that instant by hearing his voice cry to the cold stars above him , " Hell or Sydney in sixty days ! " The cold became transferred to the cold of his grand/father 's house on the day when he had died , and the tappingof the frozen reef-points against the taut sails the tapping of the bare April lilacs against the leaded panes in the sidelights of the old front doorway . And last of all , deep down in the bottom of his slipping mind , there came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights that streamed above him , the warm May sunshine , and Deborah in a blue dress , cookie-men with currants for buttons , and the words of an old song : " King Nebuchadnezzar , that wily old foxGod sent to the fields to eat grass with an ox . Said the ox to the king , You 're an odd king to me , But I 'll lend you my grass and the shade of my tree . ' " It took four men to get Nicholas down from the lookoutand all the rest to work over him with panic in their stiff fingers . But it was all to no avail . The Lydia tore on southwestward through the cold ; and in the morning the sun was bright and the long seas stretched ahead , their blue fully as deep as that of those that rolled south before the trades.  |p225ONE  warm July afternoon in the year 1886 , when the haymakers were busy in the Crockett meadows , a little boy was watching them through the high open doors of the loft in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just finishing the raking of long swathes of well-dried hay into mounds which , he knew , they would soon pitch into the waiting rack . He could see the rack under the big elm trees in the lower corner of the field with the oxen standing beside it out of the rays of the hot afternoon sun . He wanted to join the men who had been working hard all day to beat some angry clouds threatening rain and thunder from the western sky ; but he felt shy because of his tell-tale cheeks and eyes . They always good-naturedly allowed him to help tread down the load , he stumbling back and forth over the hay which they pitched up in great , fragrant forkfuls until the rack was filled , crowned and streaming , and ready to be drawn by the labouring oxen over the shorn , uneven meadowland and into the back driveway until it stood just beneath the loft doors where he now waited . He did not think he could give up making the hay , for it was one of his chief summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's letter with its crushing disappointment should have come that very afternoon , brought from the postoffice by Susan , who had got herselfcleaned up after the dinner dishes were washed and gone to the village in her black and white calico beneath her black umbrella . Susan had spared him his cleaningup , deferring it until just before supper on account of his working in the meadows . He could hear her now in the distant kitchen rattling some tin pails and cups , wieldingthe green pump handle in the sink with many quick strokes to be sure she was getting the very coldest water from the bottom of the well . Susan always filled pails for the haymakers with molasses and ginger drink , which would refresh them before they began their gathering in . Reuben was accustomed to carrying it to them himself , a pail in each hand and the cups tied to the handlewith stout twine . Once he was in the meadows , restingwith them under the trees , one of them was sure to propose that he remain to tread the loads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his full length on the very top above the straining oxen . He was not crying any more , he was glad to think , and he knew he would never have the courage to resist Susan'sshout which he expected any moment now . It was rather a long walk to the meadows , and the breeze from the full harbour water might conceivably work wonders with his face before he reached the haymakers . He did not mind Susan 's seeing the traces of his tears , as more might burst out at supper or afterward when he told his grandmother , although he meant to try as hard as ever he could to keep them back . His grandmother , once he had learned to read , had never asked to see his mother 's let/ters , waiting only for what he chose to tell her ; and she was quite unaware of this one in the pocket of his blouse . He did not read it again as he awaited Susan 's call before descending the ladder from the loft to the barn floor . He knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am very sorry , indeed , to have to disappoint you a second time about your visit to Boston . Mr. Sawyer and I should have been glad to show you the things you want to see , and I am anxious to see how much you have grown in two whole years . You must be a big , tall boy by now , and I feel sure you are a credit to your father and me , as your grandmother tells me you are . But your stepfather has been called away to Charleston in South Carolina to make some paintings of some old houses there , and he wishes me to accompany him . I hope that you will be patient and bear your disappointment manfully . You will surely come next summer , or perhaps even at Christmas when you are free from school , although I do not like to have you leave your grandmother alone , especially in the winter when it is harder for her to go about . " Mr. Sawyer has bought you a fine new box of paints which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to-morrow . " With love to your grandmother and best wishes to Susan , I am , my dear Reuben , " Ever your loving " MOTHER . " Now , as he said it over again , no more tears were forthcoming . Perhaps , he thought , there were no more left to come . Perhaps , indeed , his grief had been pushed aside by another feeling which he did not quite know how to name . It was not exactly anger against his mother , who after all could not be blamed for wanting to go with his stepfather to South Carolina  --  a far-away place , which held the lure of all far-away places to Reuben and which he knew well from his geography book as a pale green southern state on the Atlantic Ocean . It was rather a half-formed feeling of resentment that she did not seem to mind much about not seeing him . He remembered his shyness when he had last seen her , beautiful and dainty though he had thought her in her city clothes . She had made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she helped him undress at night and when she had fussed about the way his stockings had of crumplinguntidily below his thick little knees . He did not grow tall fast enough to suit her , he knew , and , since he had not made much progress between eight and ten , perhaps it was just as well that he stayed in Saturday Cove with his grandmother who never embarrassed him . He did not at all mind not seeing his stepfather , who never knew what to say to him and who was always painting something or other all over the disorderly Boston flat . But to give up seeing Bunker Hill Monument and the Minute Man , the site of the rude bridge that arched the flood and even the possibility of Plymouth Rock , and above all else the docks where two of his grandfather 's great ships had been built was a disappointment cruel enough , especially in view of the fact that he had told all his friends at school , including the teacher herself , that he was actually to see these things with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the realization that he must soon admit he was to see none of them at all made him quiver with embarrassment up there in the loft and helped top229increase the resentment he felt . But since even in his short life he had learned that plans must often be set aside and that people must try for the sake of others to conceal what they really felt , he leaned farther from the loft doorway and hoped that the breeze from the incoming tide was helping his eyes at least a little . Susan 's call came just as the haymakers had joined the oxen beneath the elm trees where they would rest for a quarter of an hour before the gathering-in should begin . " Master Reuben , " called Susan . " Where are you anyway ? The swipes is ready . " Susan had odd ways , he thought , as he answered her call and began to descend the ladder . She always called him Master Reuben out of respect for his father whom she had known as a little boy and for his grandfather whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she often told Reuben , and even though she ate at the table with him and his grandmother and sometimes even carved the meat for his grandmother , who was poor at such things , she never forgot that she was their servant and was proud of it . " Wherever have you been ? " she asked a bit irritably when he had come through the shed to the back door and stooped to take the pails from her hands . " In the loft , I 'll be bound , all this nice afternoon with hay and chaff all through your clothes and the Lord alone knows what else . You 'll get a scrubbin ' to-night and do n't you forget it . Now do n't slop the swipes whatever you do , for the men ca n't spare so much as a pint on a day like this . "  |p230Reuben  felt immeasurably relieved as he started for the meadows , bending well forward so that he could carry the heavy pails without spilling them . If Susan had not noticed his eyes , then his chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well as she . The path that he followed was a well-trodden one leading straight to the shore . He would leave it once he had reached the stone wall that separated the meadows from the field directly behind the house . The field years before had been part of the lawn and garden ; but now that he and his grandmother were alone and big lawns and gardens cost money ( which they did not have ) to be kept in proper shape , it had been allowed to merge into the orchard and like the orchard to be mown only twice duringthe summer . The elderberries on the stone wall were flaming red now that July was half over , and the wild clematis a mass of fragile bloom . He was careful about the wall , lifting the pails in turn well over it and setting them securely upon the newly shorn ground of the meadow before he himself climbed over and resumed his journey toward the elm trees where the men were resting with their pipes . They were glad to see him . They roused themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took with thanks the cups which he offered them . Then they sat with their backs against the hay and their knees drawn up , holding their cups low between their legs until they drank off their cold drink with long and satisfied swigs . Reuben went about among the four of them , refillingtheir cups from the long-handled dipper which Susan had placed in one of the pails . They had pushedp231their wide-brimmed straw hats to the back of their heads ; they were wet and hot , and there was dust and dirt in the seams and wrinkles of their necks and arms ; they smelled of sweat and labour there under the trees . The light , intermittent breeze from the sea only made more apparentthe odour of their bodies which mingled with the dry fragrance of the hay and with the warm , rich breath of the patient oxen , switching their tails against the tenaciousflies upon their flanks and sides . When they had drunk their first fill and had returned to their pipes , Reuben set the pails each within reach of two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own cup near at hand . Now that the sweat was running down his flushed face from his exertionsin their behalf , he was no longer anxious over their detection of his tears ; and even if he had been , he could not bear either to rest upon the next haycock , where they might conceivably forget all about him , or to intrude himself upon a vacant spot of the one where they rested , lest they should think him too familiar . So he lay before them on his stomach , his compact , thickly set little body looking uncomfortable enough in his close knee pants of corduroy , his blue denim blouse , his ribbed stockings and heavy shoes , which Susan would never let him shed , even on the hottest days , except on Saturday when his weekly bath was imminent . He silently chewed a long piece of hay , watched the thunderheads rolling up in the southwest , threatening rain and yet never quite obscuring the sun , and wondered how soon one of them would mention his treading of the loads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded him between short puffs on their corncobpipes and long drinks from their tin cups . When they had first seen him coming slowly toward the meadows under the weight of his pails , they had been put in a good humour toward him by one of their number , who did Solace Crockett 's milking for her and saw to the place in general . He was called Seth Tucker , and he had been in school with Reuben 's father . " That little fellow 's a good one , " he had said to the others , " and no mistake . His grandmother , she tells me how he 's her right-hand man round that big place there , and time and again he works along o ' me , capable as capable , and never beggin ' you to do something for ' im like some young ones . Seems like it 's kinder hard for ' im to live along just with them two women , good as they be . Seems like he 'll grow old before his time . Look at him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as careful . He ai n't much like what his father was , and that 's a fact . My mother says he do n't favour the Crockett side at all . Far back as she can go , they was all tall , fine set-up men . Nor his mother 's side neither . She says he 's like a brother of his grandfather  --  that Reuben who has a stone in the churchyard sayin ' he was lost at sea . " " An ' your mother 's right , " said the oldest of the four , a man of more than seventy , who had sharpened so many scythes in his life that on July nights he dreamed uneasilyof whetstones against steel . " I mind him myself , that Reuben Crockett , an ' how my father come into the kitchen where we was havin ' supper an ' said what a stew Cap'n James Crockett was in because the boy 's ship had n't been heard from . That was way back somewherep233long before any of you young fellows was so much as thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father worked in the Crockett yards in them days , an ' we was taught to look up to the Crocketts . I was just a shaver then  --  knee high to nothin ' atall  --  but I remember it all the same , an ' how I went to bed thinkin ' of drowndin ' alone ' way off to sea somewhere . Yes , I mind that young Reuben . He was short an ' squat like , not favourin ' the first Nicholas or Silas or their father or uncles . I mind them all , an ' what a prime lot o ' men they was in the good old days when this village counted for somethin ' . An ' I mind James ' wife Abigail  --  she 's not been dead so long , take it by an ' large , to an old fellow like me . There was a woman for you ! I 've sat in this meadow many a year as a young chap an ' as a man o ' middle age an ' seen her come sweepin ' through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslin skirts all billowin ' out around her an ' a basket on her arm full o ' stuff for us , doughnuts an ' pressed veal an ' bottles of ale that nobody sees nowadays , but that used to be as common as they was right for a thirsty man . " He had looked appraisingly at Reuben as he drew near , stumbling a bit on the uneven surface of the freshly cut ground . " Yes , " he concluded , " he 's a sight like that first Reuhenwho never even got to the churchyard , cheap end for a man 's costly life as ' t is . An ' when I see him comin ' along here from that old house that 's seen fine days , an ' remember how his grandmother rode off in a coach on her weddin ' day an ' how his great-grandfather gave a glass o ' grog an ' a new dollar bill to every man in hisp234yard , my own father included , without so much as a thought as to the price , I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul an ' Jonathan , his son , How are the mighty fallen ! ' " The old man 's words had had their effect upon the others as well as upon himself , and all the four who had received Reuben gratefully now looked upon him with friendliness . " I hear tell , young Reuben , " said one , breaking the warm , close silence in which they lounged for the last possible minutes , " I hear tell from my boy at home that you 're to take a journey before many days are over . Goin ' to Boston , is it ? You 'll doubtless come back so full of knowledge about the world that you wo n't want to tread no more hay for us . " Reuben lay closer against the ground to still the jump within him . So intent had he been upon concealment of his disappointment that he had not reckoned on such a crisis as this . It was lucky that the last doubt had vanishedabout treading the hay else he did not know how he could have answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Seth half suspected all that had been passing through his mind and hurting his body , since Susan had brought the letter . " I 'm not going just yet , I 'm afraid . My mother has to go away when she was n't expecting to . So I 'm likely to wait awhile , maybe till next summer . And I 'll always want to tread the hay , thank you . " To Reuben 's relief as well as to his joy they began then their preliminaries to making the great loads . They all rose with one accord and stretched themselves , raisingp235their brown , hairy arms above their heads , settling their torn old hats , and giving an extra hitch to their galluses , which , when they were suddenly loosened before being tightened once more , revealed wet and dirty lines upon their cotton shirts . Once their baggy overalls and trouserswere hauled up tightly , their empty pipes and tobaccocans stowed in their hip pockets , they began to gather together their long wooden rakes from against the haycock where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of the rack . The metallicclatter of the forks as they were drawn over the rough boards of the empty rack was music in the ears of Reuben as he stood about , waiting and watching for some chance to be of service himself . He found it in holding up the heavy pole of the rack while the oxen were backed about , one on either side , and fastening it firmly with iron pins within the cross-piece of their rattling wooden yoke , polished to the lustre of satin by years of wear against their necks and shoulders . Once they were yoked to the great blue rack , and the man who was to drive them ready with his goad-stick across their necks , and the other three with pitchforks in the hands of two and a rake for cleaning up in the hand of one , Reuben slid along the warm red side of one of the oxen , jumped upon the pole , and pulled himself between two of the round rack uprightsto the knotted , chaff-strewn floor . Standing there above the oxen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar that held firm the rungs inserted into it , he was gloriously ready for his part in the best of the haymaking . The oxen started ; the empty rack lumbered and clat- tered , bumped and swayed to the farther side of the meadow where the hay had been longest cut and piled ; the men followed behind , using their forks and rakes now and again as giant walking-sticks . Reuben wondered why they did not ride when they could have done so as well as not , but they seemed to know their own minds . The hot sun continued , in spite of the thunderheads , to beat down upon the newly cut ground and the rounded yellow haycocks ; the harbour just beyond , so near that one could hear the shouts of some rusticators on a pleasure sloop , was filled with blue , sparkling water ; the marsh stretches , where toward the east the meadows fell back before the sea , were cut by still , full lanes of the rising tide . The gulls were quiet , settled drowsily upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloop which had the empty harbour to itself . All the emotions which had hurt Reuben in the loft became as nothing in the warm , bright completeness of that afternoon in the hayfields . When they reached the last haycock , just before the meadow began to lose its dryness in marsh water , the oxen stopped , the man drivingthem substituted his goad-stick for the pitchfork which had been clattering about in the rack with Reuben , and the real work began . Now great mounds of hay came tumbling over the high railings , sometimes two at once , often smothering Reuben for the instant before he could extricate himself and go on stumbling back and forth , forth and back , treading down the forkfuls , stampingin the corners , kicking the hay about so that the surfaceshould be as compact and as even as he could make it . They went from haycock to haycock , the suddenp237starts of the rack hurtling him backward or forward on the soft hay where he lay panting until they reached the next , the man behind raking up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few trailing bits that fell from the load and throwing these in upon Reuben just as they stopped again . When the load was half-made , one of the men joined Reuben to help with his added heaviness and with the use of his fork to distribute the hay that still came as quickly as before though only two were pitching . And so fast did everyone work that within half an hour the rack was laden far above its railings , and Reuben lay hot and happy in the very center , ready to ride to the barn , to wait there until the hay should be stowed away in the loft , and then to return to the meadow for yet another load until the grass was clean and free and ready for the rain . The sensation of being on top of the load was always unparalleled by any that Reuben had experienced in his ten years . From there he could see nothing that belonged on the ground , not the oxen , or the men walking behind or beside the rack , or the grass itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight into the seemingly trunkless orchard trees , straight above the harbour to the green spruces on the islands , straight into the beams and rafters of the great barn , floorless now to him ; and when he lay on his back , there was nothing between him and the sky but the waving green veil of the highest elms . When they had once creaked and lumbered up the driveway to the barn and come to a standstill directly below the open doors of the loft , they freed the oxen , who stood in the barn floor , their sides heaving from their labour . Then Reuben pumped deep water from the well , and the men stood about the curb , drinking it from the dipper , which always rested on the square , flat top of the pump . And after the hay was stowed away , two men pitching it high in great streaming forkfuls and the two others drawing it from the doorway and stowing it tightly beneath the cross-beams and over and among the brown rafters , they had another drink all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper-time before they had quite done and the men had started homeward , now sitting in the back of the empty rack with their legs hanging downward . Reubensaw them go with regret . He stood at the barn door and watched them out of sight down the hill that led to the shore road , hearing , even after they had passed from his view , the clatter and the creaking through the summerdust . It was a treat to him to have men about , doing the work of men , saying the things that men say to one another in men 's voices . He did not know what a treat it was until he saw them go away before the gathering storm . Seth Tucker stayed for the milking , and Reubenwas loth to leave him and go indoors when Susan called him peremptorily to come and have his scrubbing up before he was fit for the supper table . That evening while Susan did the dishes and heated still more water on the stove for yet another scrub , the storm broke in jagged streaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . His grandmother was clearly nervous . She did not like storms and looked upon this one as especially sinister since it had broken all expectation and custom and come up on anp239ebb tide . She did not remember , she told Susan , whom she had sent throughout the house to close all windows , more than three storms in her life which had ever come once the tide had turned ; and each had been a caution . So agitated was she that Reuben did not add to her anxiety his own disappointment . Instead , while she and Susan moved from room to room , keeping  --  wary eyes on the barn , the great trees , and the church spire just visible from the side windows , he got the ink bottle from its place on the shelf in the dining-room cupboard and wrote his mother a letter . His hands and arms were stiff from the haymaking so that it was hard for him to keep his lines straight and his words clear . He had to copy his letter three times before he decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote , " It is a terrible storm . I am glad we got our hay in . I tredded five loads this afternoon . " I think it is very nice for you to go to South Carolina with my stepfather . I will come to Boston some other time when it is better for you to have me . " Thank Mr. Sawyer for the paints . " I am not so tall as you want me to be . " Your obediant son , " REUBEN CROCKETT. " 2Solace Crockett had named her grandson . She had chosen his name directly she had seen him in the earlyp240morning of a July day which had finally come after six dreadful months of waiting . She did not even consult his mother . Deborah had longed for a daughter , saying even that only the slender chance of a little girl had kept her alive to endure her grief and suffering . A little girl , she said to Solace , could be depended upon to stay at home and comfort them for all they had gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though she bore the Crockett name , could hardly give promise of sorrow in the future because of any family loyalties which she might inherit . Deborah had said these things in her most bitter hours . For the most part , she had been a companion to Solace rather than a drain upon her spirit . She was honest and intelligent enough to face squarely the truth , both that Nicholas ' death had brought more suffering to his mother than to her and that she herself was in a measure answerable for it . She was honest enough also both to realize and to acknowledge that Solace Crockett was a finer woman than she herself , and that , ironically enough , it was Solace who was paying a heavy toll not for the willfulness of her son but rather for the selfishnessof her daughter-in-law . Deborah acknowledged these things and suffered genuine and bitter remorse over the part she had played in the tragedy of Nicholas ' death . But just as she was unable , because of a limitation within herself , to realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to build upon her suffering and remorse any structure of mind and spirit in which she might continue to live in some degree of dignity and order . She gave to Solace without stint consideration andp241affection , gratitude and admiration ; and except for momentsand hours of bitterness when she railed aloud against the injustice of life and in secret deplored the impossibilityof escape from a future she could neither endurenor transmute , she had borne the anxiety of waiting for her child with a fair measure of fortitude . Solace , remembering the strength and serenity which Abigail Crockett had lent to her , had done her utmost for Deborah , losing sight of her own grief in concern for Deborah 's present and in the troubled thought of her future . She herself had lived her life and , on the whole , had small complaint to make against whatever had determinedit . But Deborah was young . It was hard to see her at twenty-five throttled and thwarted by circumstances , tied hand and foot , and unable , by the very imperiousnessof her nature , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Solace joined her hopes and prayers to those of Deborah that the baby might be a girl . When a boy came and his grandmother held him before the kitchen fire precisely as Abigail had held his father , she named him Reuben Shaw Crockett on the spot . There was a great deal in the name which Solace could not explain to Deborah . First of all , there was the desireto recompense Abigail for a grievous loss , even althoughAbigail was either far beyond the need of recompenseor else had received it already , pressed down and running over . Abigail , in common with other women of seafaring families , had felt the loss of her second son more complete and summary than as if he had gone to earth in the churchyard . A sea change differed from an earth change in that it was less natural , more comfortless . Who could know these things better than Solace herself ? In this child which lay on her lap the elder Reuben , she had thought , might live and move again by the very power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandson , she saw little about him that was Crockett . Given always the possibility of growth and change , she yet could not see how the length and suppleness of the Crockett men could supplant or overcome his short , compact , almost square little body , his round head set close to his shoulders , his wide , thick knees . He must , ignoringDeborah and Nicholas , Silas and herself , have gone farther back for his lineaments and features . He might , of course , be a Winship like his great-grandfather , but as she studied him , she was more inclined to think that he was a Shaw , and if so , he deserved the name of those who had thus endowed him . Abigail had told her that the Shaws for the most part were stocky , thick-set people ; and Solace herself as a little girl remembered Reuben , standing in the old church on a hassock for the hymns so that he might not look so short in contrast with his father and his brothers Nicholas and Silas . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she could look upon the world , not as a performer or participator within it so much as a spectator of it , the pathos rather than the tragedy of change came home to her , the steady resistless passing away of the sons of earth before the ever-rolling stream of time . And the sadness deepened when one realized that those who lived at any given present loved and hated , laughed and wept , failed or triumphed as the invisible chains which bound themp243to the past allowed them to do . Thus there was added pathos in the unconscious retaliation of the dead upon the living , revenge quite without rancour in the mere persistence of their natures . For those who had lived and were now dead controlled in large measure those who had forgotten or had never known them , Judah and Amos in Silas and Nicholas , old Reuben Shaw , who had defied the ships of King George III , in this baby , removed from him by five generations . And since the wide-kneed Shaws , who had stumped about the Derby wharf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent back a memorial to themselves in the shape and features of her grandson , it seemed but just to Solace that his name at least should be an outward and visible sign of their insensible remonstrance against complete impotence and cessation . Now that Fate had chosen to deal her its last cruel blow in denying her a daughter , Deborah had not cared a whit what name had been given to her son so long as no suggestion had been made that he should inherit his father 's . That she could never have borne to call him or to hear sounding about the house . From the beginning of his life , except for her daily care of him , which she fulfilled to Solace 's complete satisfaction , she left the decisions as to his early rearing almost entirely to his grandmother . She lived , as Solace was quite well aware , in the half-formed and never fully expressed hope that the future still held something for her far removed from Saturday Cove . And when , in Reuben 's third year , after her own mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she met a young artist who was summering in Saturday Cove , Solace saw as clearly as Deborah that a better way had opened for them all . Deborah and the artist , whose name was Edward Sawyer , were decent about Reuben , never once suggestingthat he should be left with his grandmother while they embraced a life they both wanted . The suggestion came verbally from Solace herself and silently from Reuben 's complete dependence upon her . Solace , nearingseventy , felt the compensations rather than the in -- roads of age . She wanted to keep Reuben with her in the house of his ancestors where he belonged . He was clearly not Deborah 's child in any but a physical sense , and Deborah was the first to recognize the fact . There was , indeed , almost gratitude in her recognition of it . Had he shown any of the traits that made her what she was or even a sufficient number of those belonging to Nicholas , she would not so willingly have left him in Saturday Cove . But from the start he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her lack of understanding of him . He was a slow , sober child , quiet and orderly in his ways , not quick like Nicholas and Deborah either at comprehension or action . He would play for hours at some solitary game and pick up his toys when he had finished without having to be told . He was abnormally sensitive to reproof or punishment and seemed , to Deborahat least , quite without any vital spark which made most children disobedient or rebellious . Solace , watching him , could not herself discern those gifts within him which , Abigail had always maintained , came donep245up with the Crocketts and ready for instant distribution upon a waiting and subservient world . Perhaps for that very reason she loved him more , seeing in him an absence of those things which might have made life easier for him but harder for those who must live it beside him . And since , both because of what he seemed to be and because of the more settled character of the years in which he would live his life , time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwarted and wounded his father , her fears for him became less positiveeven in his babyhood than her sense of quiet protectionover him . Deborah married when Reuben was four and went away from Saturday Cove , not to return to it save at long intervals and for brief visits . There followed her , quite at Solace 's insistence , some of the furniture from the front parlour and more of the china from the diningroomcupboard  --  things which Abigail had left for Nicholasand which , Solace said , belonged also to Deborah as well . These , aside from their value in dollars and cents , which Deborah might some day need , would make her housekeeping in Boston easier . And when the things were crated and gone to the steamboat wharf and Deborah 's last clothes had gone from her closets and the knick-knacks from her room , Solace , sitting in Abigail'schair and watching Reuben piling his blocks slowly and carefully on the worn rug , felt without the least feeling either of regret or of reproof , that the Crocketts and the Winships and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as they ought to be.  |p246Reuben  's childhood in Saturday Cove in the eighteeneightieswas far different from that of his father in the eighteen-fifties . In the first place , there were differences in the great house itself . Built and furnished by Amos Crockett as a wedding gift for his son in the last years of the seventeen hundreds from the profits and products of foreign voyages and kept proudly in its original sturdinessand beauty by James and Abigail , who in their turn had wanted for nothing , it was now suffering the inroads of time and the reverses of fortune . It did not stand so squarely or so solidly upon its stone foundations as it had once stood . Its door-sills needed attention , and when a November wind took the last of the old leaves from the woodbine that all summer concealed the cracks and rotting wood above its white doorway facing the sea , it looked like an old house . The bricks in the terrace , which had formerly reached the first of its welltendedgarden plots , were broken and missing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , once a lawn ; the orchard , so carefully pruned and cared for by Amos and James and Silas , was now perforce allowed to look after itself . The slope of its wide roofs now sagged in places , and the roofs themselvescould have done with fresh shingles had Solace Crockett been able to see her way to anything but necessarypatching as occasion demanded . The green shuttersrattled now within and without their framework ; their paint was spotted with white from the salt ofp247many fogs ; and from the outworn fastener of each there hung a stout cord to ensure its security in a high wind . The barn had done well enough for years without the repairs it sorely needed . Within matters were much the same . The great hall with its double curving staircase reaching from front to back wanted fresh paint and paper as did the rooms opening from it . The cracks in the floors had widened , and the floors themselves sagged a bit here and there with the sagging of their foundations . The doors were the doors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and latches , swinging lightly to one 's touch instead of substantially and securely as doors swing when their jambs and sills are kept in proper repair . The wood of the window frames also showed dry and dusty beneath the paint , which had a way of peeling off as paint will peel when wood is soft and crumbling from age . There were cracks here and there in the plaster of the ceilings which were not surprising since James had been the last Crockett to replaster them . The rooms themselves , gracious as they were when the sun lay full within them or when a fire burned below their white mantels , lacked the freshness of other days . Judah and Amos , James and Benjamin still looked down upon Reuben staring up at them in the front parlour on Sunday afternoons . Their ships , except for the one which Deborah had chosen as her just portion , still hung upon the walls ; Amos ' paper of Versailles still showed its gardens and fountains ; and the furniture , depleted though it was of some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed it with oil on the palm of her broad hand . The dragons on Eliza Ann Shaw 's firescreenwere frayed and faded enough , but they still served as a curiosity for Reuben to point out shyly to his teacher when she came for supper twice a year on Saturdayevening , and when Solace had warned him to remember his manners and not to be afraid to address their guest now and then . " My great-great-grandmother made it , " Reuben said slowly , conscious of his best clothes and of his new shoes that creaked . " She made it in Salem more than one hundredyears ago . " And since Reuben had never known the house as it had been in his grandfather 's boyhood and even in his father 's , it seemed to him the most satisfying of houses . He conceived , in fact , a premature affection for it , seeing in it far more than the place of warmth and protection accepted by most children when they think of home . He never approached it through the field from the shore where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow , which banked it almost to its window sills , without feeling a surge of pride throughout his body , not only because it was his home but because it was stately and beautiful . And when he and his grandmothercame home together on Sundays from church and followed the path , where the grass now grew up through the gravel and clam-shells , to the side door beneath the lilacs , he always said to her no matter what the season : " I think , grandmother , that we have the best house in Saturday Cove  --  no , I mean in the whole world . " Perhaps it was her recognition of this feeling in him that prompted Solace to open the front parlour on Sun/days . She and Abigail had rarely opened it during Nicholas ' boyhood , using the sunnier back parlour for their sitting-room . But Nicholas , at least during his father 's life , reasoned Solace , had had small need of the better room with all the things it held , things which by their association and their worth might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heritage . Nicholas had known a wider world than his son could know , and he had had about him those who , by connectinghim daily with the Crockett past , could pave the way for his Crockett future . Solace was glad as Reuben left his little boyhood and reached the age of ten that his future did not seem to burn so restlessly and yet so certainlywithin him ; but she felt strongly that the past should be made clear to him before she had to leave him . The front parlour served to this end . On Sunday mornings while his grandmother dressed for church Reuben studied his Sunday-school lesson at the polished table beneath the picture of Amos Crockett 's ship Mary leaving Marseilles . He sat in a high-backed chair with his feet firmly placed on the floor so that they might not damage the chair rungs . He wore his Sunday suit of sombre dark gray , the tight trousers stopping awkwardly just below his knees and the jacket much cut away in front over the high buttoned vest . His low collar had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black silk , and his heavy black shoes had gleaming copper toes upon them to keep them from wearing out too soon . He kept his Bible open on the newspapers , which Susan had spread to protect the table , and said the portions to be memorized over and over to himself in loud whispers until he thought he knew them unless his teacher should ask him too suddenly . And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? orEnter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat : Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it. or , and most difficult to make any sense of even with the help of his puzzled teacher : In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God . In addition to these prescribed verses or others like them there was always a temperance text , a backwash in the eighties from the tidal wave of the seventies : Look not thou upon the wine when it is red , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright . At the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder . Finally there was always a lesson from his Sunday-school manual , which in the spring and summer was called AlmostPersuaded and in the autumn and winter The Lord God of Israel . He did not much mind learning the verses or the lessons with their exhortations and threats , taking them as a matter of course and only feeling a shade ofp251regret for himself when he learned that his father had not gone to Sunday-school , there being none in the Saturday Cove church when he was a boy . " Did n't my father have to learn the Bible , then ? " " Yes , his grandmother taught it to him on Sundays and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am at teaching . She made verses and songs about the Bible stories and sang them to your father . " In spite , however , of Solace 's descriptions of Abigail she remained a shadowy portrait to Reuben . There was no picture of his great-grandmother in the front parlour , and the album likeness which his grandmother showed him on Sunday afternoons did not impress her upon his imagination . His grandmother did better with his grandfather , although there was no portrait of him either . Indeed , from the very beginning of Reuben 's memory Silas Crockett lived therein as did no one else , even his own father . An old woman now , Solace lived most clearly in the past where even Nicholas was not . Nicholas was her present , too close and painful , especially when the past was ready and waiting to heal it . Sitting in the front parlour , she told Reuben endless things about his grandfather . " Was he tall , grandmother , like my father ? " " Yes , he was tall and very handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went everyone looked at him . He was strong , too . He could lift me and carry me ever so far . " " Do I look at all like him ? " " No , only you have his eyes and some of his ways . "  | " What ways ? " " Well , you are kind and thoughtful of me as he always was . And you love to think of going to far-away places . Your grandfather was forever planning where he 'd go next , where he 'd take me to . " " Did you like going to sea , grandmother ? " " Not at first . I was very frightened . But after a long time I learned not to be frightened . " " How did you learn ? " " By loving your grandfather , I suppose . He was not happy unless he was at sea , like all these others here and your father , too . " Reuben scanned the walls , looking at Judah and Amos , then turning slowly on his hassock to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea , too , do n't you , grand-mother ? " She felt herself then tempering the thought which she and Silas and all the others in the room had given him . " Perhaps so , " she said , " but perhaps not . There are many other things to do besides going to sea , Reuben . " " There probably wo n't be sailing-ships when I 'm old enough to go . But I might command a steamship and sail across the Atlantic ocean and other oceans as well . Then I 'd see the places I study about . I 'd like to see all the places , grandmother , that you and my grandfather saw . " On Friday nights from school he always brought home his geography book , standing it carefully against the firescreenso that it would be ready for Sunday . They alwaysclosed their hour after dinner in the front parlourp253with the geography book . They rested it upon the table and went through its maps together , one by one , beginning with the map of the whole watery earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which they could trace his grandfather 's voyages from one hemisphere to the other . Then , once the courses of the Southern Seas or the Solace Winship or the Four Winds had been fully established in Reuben 's mind , they turned to the other maps , which marked places neglected by the map of the whole earth , and gave his grandfather 's several ports the attention they deserved . Sometimes they played a game with his grandfather 's cities and islands , straits and bays . They would both close their eyes tightly and count ten excitedly aloud , which had no point at all except that it added zest to things . Then Reuben brought his forefinger down at random upon any place at all and cried , " Ready ! " Whereupon his grandmother must open her eyes and with no deliberation at all tell something about the spot upon which Reuben 's forefinger rested . " The Balearic Isles , " said his grandmother . " They are in the Mediterranean , Reuben , as you see . The water is bluer there than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island the people have built walls that go up and down the hillsides , even up and down the mountains  --  oldwalls built centuries ago . The walls hold up the olive trees , which shine like silver , and the people ride their donkeys there and gather olives in the sun . " " I should like to see an olive tree , " said Reuben . His grandmother opened her eyes a second time.  | " The mid-Atlantic , " she said . " So many things have happened there to your grandfather and me that I could n't rightly choose between them . But if you move your finger two inches to the right , there 's Marseilles . I 've been there often . It 's a fine harbour with mountains of rock all about it and all kinds of foreign people . Ships have sailed there for many hundreds of years , even the ships of King Solomon , so your grandfather once told me . They sell flowers , violets and roses , and queer shellfishon the quays in the spring . You hear all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls of hard bread and drink wine at little tables out-of-doors in the sun . " " Did you ever drink wine , grandmother ? I thought it was wrong . " She felt after nearly sixty years the crust of the French bread within her hand , saw the gleam of the sunlightin the red wine . " Not in Marseilles , years ago , " she said . " Only here , now . " When the short hour was over and his grandmother had gone for her nap , Reuben went to the tidy kitchen where Susan sat by the table , a white apron over her black dress . Susan always read on Sunday afternoons . She kept her Bible open before her , but she rarely read from it . She went to the Ladies ' Social Library on Saturdayevenings and procured upon the payment of five cents a book to last her until Wednesday when the library was again open . She had a few favourites which she read over and over , never seeming to tire of them . One was called Tempest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love with His Wife . Sometimes she was so absorbed in her reading that she did not hear Reuben coming through the long hall . In later years he always remembered how she had sat bolt upright at the table , holding her book in both her hands , and how sometimes he had surprised tears in the hollows between her lower eyelids and her high , broad cheek bones . At fifty Susan had grown to more massive proportions than when she had shaken Reuben 's mother at her bubble party . Her hair was gray , and she drew it straight back into a knot of the exact shape of a lobster buoy at the exact crown of her head , drew it so tightly that not a hair could ever relax ; and she looked withal so scrubbed , so neat , so capable that Reuben always thought the tears must be a trial to her lying there untended while she read . He learned that it was Thelma which always brought the tears and had a secret urge to read it himself ; but since it was kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Susan was always in the kitchen , his wish was never gratified . When she had once recognized his presence in the doorway , she always put her book away ( Reuben never guessed at what sacrifice ) with her glasses in it to keep her place and began to make molasses candy . He always remembered the smell of the boiling molasses and butter in the warm kitchen and how a wad of it tasted when Susanto try it had dropped a bit from a spoon into a cup of cold water . When the candy was done , they pulled it together while his grandmother finished her nap . They twisted it first into dark brown twists , soft and warm and likely to stick to one 's hands if they were not well greased with butter . Then they pulled it between their outstretched arms , bending it in halves , sometimes again in quarters , watching it turn from brown to gold and finally to yellow . At the last , when it began to harden in their grasp , they pulled together , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until they could pull it no longer , until it was ready to be coiled in a great circle on the table and cut in pieces with a sharp knife . He ate it then , piece by piece , over his own book until Susan told him to stop lest he should spoil his supper . And when the day was over and the twilight was darkeningthe meadows and the sea , he ate his bowl of pilot bread , stripped fish , and milk at the kitchen table and thought how fortunate he was to live in an old house where his great-grandfather and grandfather and father had lived and from where he could hear the sound of the tide as he fell asleep . There was small sign of the shipyards left when the nineties were just around the corner and Reuben was thirteen . Grass and rank growth had covered them all ; and when strangers who did not know Saturday Cove sailed into its harbour and saw the high banks above the shore and the vetches , wild lavender , and goldenrod that clothed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest the sea there were remnants of wharves and docks and building platforms . So far asp257that went , only the older people in Saturday Cove itself remembered the docks well , the ships that had been built there and launched with the church bells ringing and everybody in holiday dress . And now even the fishing-wharves were disappearing in their turn . The factory where packing had been carried on for a decade up to 188o had gone , beaten out by larger plants eastward . Now what was left of it had been moved to the saw-mill yard where it served very well for the storage and drying of the planks , which were still sawn when the waters of the brook tumbled over the darn in the spring rains and joined the tide . The offshorefishing fleet had quite disappeared . What fishermenwere left now sailed away to Eastport or Lubec , making these larger towns their base and coming home only when the best of the season was over . Fishing , in fact , as well as shipbuilding had suffered from change . The great railroads now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gloucestercatch westward in their new refrigerator cars , could quite as easily , after the development of the Pacific and Great Lakes fisheries , bring the over-abundant supply of Columbia River salmon and the fish of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan eastward to New York and Boston . The free importation of Canadian herring during the seventies and early eighties likewise crippled the activities of the smaller offshore fleets and turned the attention of many Maine village fishermen to other means of livelihood just now knocking at their doors . For by the time the nineties had reached Saturday Cove , it together with scores of other seacoast towns and villages was ready and eager to utilize a new industry  --  that of supplyingthe easier demands of a fast-growing summer population . Master fishermen , who had weathered fogs and gales off Newfoundland , now cleaned and painted their schooners to take out parties for days of deep-sea fishing in the outer waters of Frenchman 's Bay , or Passamaquoddy , or Blue Hill , or Penobscot . It was an easy and a pleasant occupation and brought hitherto undreamedofprofits without danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventies and eighties worked in the crews of such schooners , sharing profits dependent upon the runs of fish and their own luck and skill at catching and cleaning , were quick to discover a far simplerand more profitable means of living in the inshore fisheries near at hand . These strangers with good clothes and well-filled pockets , who were buying land at prices unheard-of and erecting cottages with native labour , needed fresh fish for their tables as well as lobstersand clams . Good grounds for trawling or handlinefishing for cod and haddock were not far distant ; there were few seasons when tinker mackerel did not run , turning the outer harbour to blue and silver ; and any man whose back had well-nigh broken in hours on the Banks , rowing a dory or pulling a heavy trawl or coiling tubs of line in zero weather , counted it child 's play to dig a barrel of clams at any low water , shock them clean , and sell them at ten cents the quart . Reuben Crockett never saw a ship built or launched from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his long inheritance , was denied him.  |p259Nor  in his day did a " trader " ever tie up at the wharf with marbles and tops and sling-shots on her dishevelled decks . Nor did he ever watch the boats of the offshore fleet bearing away for the Banks with their women folk crowding the pier in the April mist to bid them godspeedand a safe return . Even foreign faces in Saturday Cove in the eighties and nineties were almost unknown . Reuben , unlike his father , never saw dark , bearded men with rings in their ears , lounging about the piers , gabberingand gesticulating , while monkeys sat rakishly on their shoulders . In fact , an incident which occurred in his thirteenth year made such an impression upon him that he thought about it for weeks afterward and boasted for days at school that it had happened to him . He and his grandmotherand Susan one autumn evening were sitting in the back parlour quietly enough when a noise without of someone rapping against the window-pane caused him to raise startled eyes . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their lamp was the shadowy black face of a stranger . He wore a red handkerchief knotted about his neck and was apparently in distress of some kind as they could make out from his frenzied gestures . Susan in her alarm was about to throw any object in the room at him ; but when Reuben , trembling , had gone to the door at his grandmother 's command , he proved to be harmless enough , wishing only to see the doctor to whom he had been misdirected . He came from Barbados , he said in his fragmentary , uncertain English , on a ship after lumber ; and once they knew he was quite harmless and suffering from a broken wrist , Susan pre/o pared him a good supper on the kitchen table . Reuben never forgot how he stood in a corner of the kitchen and stared at the stranger as he ate his food with his left hand , extending the painful wrist of the right before him . He was Reuben 's one actual entrance in the flesh into the great world far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been numberless , this seeing with his eyes and hearing with his ears outweighed all his more impalpable experiences . The changes that Reuben saw daily in Saturday Cove did not , in fact , impress him at all , at least as changes . Their significance , destined to be so far-reaching in the next century , was quite lost upon a boy who had his chores to do and his lessons to get before he was free to range the now well-nigh deserted shores . He felt sorry that times were different , simply because his father 's life as his grandmother , or more often as Susan , depicted it seemed more exciting than his own . He shared his grandmother 's regret when the heads of seafaring families died one by one ; he was sorry that they had taken with them the stories which they had sometimes told on the old wharves on Saturday mornings while the water slapped at the piers ; but he little knew what was passing through her mind when she said : " Captain Rufus Candage has gone , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once so close . I never thought I 'd live to see the day when I was glad that your grandfather died a young man . He never could abide change . " Nor did Reuben for a moment realize that an era in coast history had closed when certain of the great whitep261houses , which voyages to the Far East had built , passed one by one through the lawyer 's hands to men from Philadelphia and Boston and New York . He was merely glad that their own need not be thus sacrificed , not because in his mind the dispensing with it would mean anything in the light of a long past , but rather because he would be desolate without it . And when the Boston and Bangor Steamship Company put on a daily boat to bring to Saturday Cove and points west and east those who were henceforth to determine the social and economic history of the coast , he in common with other village boys welcomed the innovation . It was fun to stand on the pier , now called the steamboat wharf , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gangway with her eager , well-dressed strangers crowding about the deck-rails , to see them drive away in buckboards and surreys to their new cottages among the spruces on the headlands or to the old houses in the village which they had bought . They brought business , Reuben heard the tradesmen say , kept money in circulation , gave employmentto folks that needed it , and all in all were the best thing that had happened to the coast of Maine in many a long day . When Solace Crockett saw her seventies running swiftly toward their close and recognized with the calm acuteness of women of her sort that her days were numbered , she sold her father 's house to two maiden ladiesp262from Boston . She did not want to sell it . But what , she asked herself and Susan , could Reuben do with two houses when there was not enough money to keep one even in passable repair ? Moreover , if she died as she doubtless would while Reuben was still under the guardianship of some one or other , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthily . She had had all sorts of dreams about the house even though she knew they were chimerical in view of her circumstances . She had wanted to give it to Saturday Cove as a library and museum . She would have liked to think in her last years of the downstairs rooms being used for books , which people might even linger over to read on rainy afternoons instead of selecting one and carrying it straight homeward . The upstairs rooms , she had imagined , might be the repository of manuscripts , log-books , records , old drawings , pictures and the like , which should preserve the history of a bit of the coast from carelessness , neglect , and ignorance . She would place there her father 's plans of his fourteen meeting-houses , the specificationsand figures of his lesser work , so that he might not in succeeding years pass entirely into oblivion . She would like to have had him remembered by the succeedinggenerations of Saturday Cove if only as a name . She would place , too , perhaps in her own room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had commanded them . There were other families either in town or closely enough removed from it to be still interested who would be glad to contribute to such a collection . And later perhaps , even when the new century had half gone and not a square-rigged ship ran before the trades or the wester/lies of either hemisphere , people would mount her father 's winding staircase to her old room and look with respect and reverence upon the dignity and worth and grandeur which it held in trust within its walls . There would be other rooms for pieces of beautiful furniture , for bits of old china and damask , which people would be glad to spare from their family legacies , for shawls and other weaving and embroidery , made either on foreign or home looms by strange or familiar hands . All these things , carefully placed and guarded within the old house , itself a memorial of the days when men like her father laboured with faith and devotion for the very sake of labour , would perhaps halt time now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them understand , if only for a moment , the sacredness of tradition , the long dependence of the present upon the past . She had abandoned the dream long before it had been fully born ; it died daily even while it was coming to life ; for it was preposterous , even in its vaguest outlines . In the first place , there must be found in Saturday Cove a sufficient number of those in authority who , because they had been well nurtured by the past , recognized the value of its preservation . That task in itself was problematical . The old seafaring families who had in large measure made that past were fast dying out ; for now that shipping was over , building and voyaging alike , there was little to keep later generations in Saturday Cove , if there was money enough to leave it . The very enterprise which had sent their fathers and grandfathers across the seas sent them , after school and perhaps college were over , top264the offices , universities , and hospitals of larger centers where the leaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lost . And if , perchance , there could be found among those whom age , necessity , or sentiment had kept at home a sufficient number who might be depended upon to receive and administer her gift of the old Winship house , she must not for a moment forget that the gift was quite without endowment of any sort . Librariesand museums must not only be housed but run , she told herself , smiling at the secret foolishness which had given her such pleasure . The Misses Peabody were school-mistresses of an old and excellent family . They knew and appreciated the beauty of the old Winship home , and they appreciated Solace Crockett as well . She was glad it was they who were to open and close the picket gate and clear the grass roots from the peonies in the front yard instead of a man from St. Paul , who had offered her a larger price . Since it must go , she told Susan , she wanted to sell it to New England people who would have a feeling for it and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mistress . She was not one , she said , to want a lot of new folks messing up a place to which they had no right . But since what was to be was to be , and these outsiders had come to stay , it was just as well to do business with the best of them , rather than with some scalawag from the West which , every one knew , was full of folks not quite up to the mark of them that stayed to home . Furthermore , Susan said to the pump and the wood-box and to Seth Tucker under an oath of secrecy , if her eyes did n't deceive her ,  |p265and  they had n't for fifty years and more now , it was just as well to get things settled up as they should be settled for Master Reuben and as soon as might be . She knew better than most , she said , when this world and the next met in a body 's eyes , and although she was biding her time and keeping her counsel , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once arrangements had been made between Solace and the elder Miss Peabody , who shivered through Easter of 1890 in Saturday Cove , as to what was to be taken from the house and what left , once the lawyer had been seen and the deed drawn and the check signed , Susanput on an extra suit of winter underwear and spent two days cleaning out the Winship attic . The things which obviously might be of value  --  letters and books , odd pieces of old furniture , some great sheets of paperwith drawings on them  --  she brought to the kitchen ; and on the first warm day in April she built a fire in the stove there and fetched her mistress to make the necessary decisions for preservation or destruction . Solace sat by the sunny window and looked over one by one the things which Susan spread before her . She could not bear to hurry over her task even though Susan'sbroad back , as she stood by the opposite window and looked out upon the brown orchard , registered impatience and vexation at the time she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , papers preserved by her father and recording sundry affairs of village importance in which he had been concerned , was like seeing for the second time some old play whose characters , cos- tumes , and action , forgotten through the years , became once more familiar . Among many others , all of which halted time for her , were two records of meetings held in 182I of the Select Committee of the Saturday Cove Social Library . Her father , as scribe of the committee , had written the reportsin his careful , precise hand . He had been fortyfouryears old then , she thought , a young man . The first , dated in March 1821 , revealed " a dissension led by certain women of the town " who demanded a vote in the selection of books , hitherto ruled only by men : This dissension having reached a point at which continued refusals seem ill-advised , the Select Committee has resolved to name this day of the aforesaid women one , viz. , Mrs. Abigail Crockett , wife of Captain James Crockett , who shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast one vote for or against the proposals of the said committee . She may have a proper voice in deliberation and discussion , but it is clearly recognized by all concerned that right of proposal of any course of action shall be withheld from her . Solace could see Abigail at forty-six speaking a prematureand unwelcome word for the rights of women . She knew as surely as though the dissenters had been named on the yellowing paper that Abigail was their selfappointedleader , saw her going about her kitchen and planning her revolt as she kneaded her bread dough or poured her candle moulds , the thought of the first Nicholasstill new and painful within her . The second record lent action to the play , increased a hundredfold the drama :  |p267At  a meeting of the Select Committee of the Saturday Cove Social Library held on the second of November , Anno Domini , 1821 , it was voted to exchange certain books now in circulation for other books deemed and considered more useful and of betterinfluence to and upon their readers. viz. , Humphrey Clinker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3 vols. for Dr. Wood 's Letters to Unitarians . Sterne 's Sentimental Journey for The Infant 's Progressfrom the Valley o f Destruction to Everlasting Glory . The Fool of Quality , 3 vols. for Pure Religion Recommendedas the Only Way to Happiness. *This resolution was adopted by the five members of the committeewith but one dissenting vote , that having been cast by the newly allowed female member , Mrs. Abigail Crockett . Solace , sitting by the table in the old house seventy years afterward , could see Abigail casting her vote with superb indifference as to its effect , and the consternation it must have wrought among the men of Saturday Cove responsible for the selection of its reading . She could hear Abigail 's crisp , straightforward voice extolling the virtues and the values of novels before the scandalized committee , already regretting its forced decision to admita female member . She knew how Abigail had laughed at home while she recounted to James her initialadventure into the affairs of men . Now no men could be found in the village save the preceptor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was read to serve on a committee ; and the name had long since been changed to that of the Ladies ' Social Library. * The record of this exchange , with books accurately named and date exact , is taken from certain Maine village papers of the year 1821.  | Solace had lived long , she thought , and had seen many changes . Reuben would see more . As she sat by the table , going through the books and papers before her , discarding some , giving others to Susan to pile in a clothes basket to be taken to the Crockett attic for safe keeping , she thought of the greater , more tenacious hold which a father 's house held upon its descendants than that of a mother , always in reality her father 's house . This house , which had in large measure given birth and nurture to the love responsible for Nicholas and Reuben , was now passing into other hands while the house of the male line remained . She herself had not for a moment considered selling the Crockett home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had receivedfor it . That must be handed down intact to Reuben for him to do with as he liked . Houses handed down by men to their sons , even to their daughters , assumedin some mysterious way a sturdier inheritance . One could say , " This was my father 's house , " " My grandfather was born here , " " This is the old Crockett homestead " with a deeper and more continuous pride than one could refer to a mother 's home , which at best , so far as a daughter was concerned , endured but for a generation and was never held seriously in the minds of men with anything but a passing sentiment . When a woman married , thought Solace , her hands cold and shaky in spite of Susan 's fire in the kitchen stove , she transferred her allegiance to the house of her husband where her children were born . It was right , she supposed , and natural , but it was not always easy . " Do you suppose , " asked Susan , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Master Reuben'sgoin ' to have any use for all this cultch or for that matter any understandin ' of it ? Ai n't it just goin ' from one attic to another for another set of rats to gnaw on ? " " I suppose so , " said Solace , laying the plans of Thomas Winship 's meeting-houses on the top of the basket . She was thinking at that moment of how she had wanted to keep them spread out in cases in the upstairs room . " I suppose so , Susan . But I ca n't destroy them , foolish as it seems . They  --  they hold the thoughts of people . Reuben can do what he likes with them when he 's grown . " " There are an awful lot of thoughts in this world , " observed Susan , staring at the basket . " To my mind it 's lucky they have n't all been wrote down . An ' closin ' up old places ai n't good for nobody , their minds nor their bodies . It 's an unhealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I 've got the front rooms all cleared out ready for them fussbudgets from Boston . I 've saved every knick-knack and whim-wham accordin ' to the papers that was drawn up . You ai n't goin ' to catch your death mosyin ' about in there if I 've got any say so . I 'm goin ' to take you home where it 's warm and cheery an ' there ai n't no pneumonia in the very floorboards same as there is down here . Master Reuben an ' I 'll come back for this mess o ' stuff when we get around to it . " Solace was grateful for Susan as they drove homeward through the April mud . Susan sat , solid and comfortable , slapping the reins over the back of the old horse . She was not to all appearances troubled by any sentiments at all ; she was impervious to the way people had felt inp270certain chairs below certain mantels , to the ecstasy , the security , and the sleep which had stirred and comforted them in certain great beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied , the knowledge both that age in some persons accentuates rather than dulls emotion and that in the recollection of experience lies more reality than in the immediate experience itself . Susan would have an easier time of it in her old age . For one thing , her father 's house had rightly descended to her brother , and her mother 's house , which , of course , had never really been her mother 's , had long since gone the way of all mothers ' houses . There was one major compensation in the disposal of the Winship home , major to Reuben and pleasing to Solace , who wanted to leave things shipshape for him . From the generous check , which had been received from the Misses Peabody , Solace set aside a fair portion for repairs on the Crockett house , which would be Reuben 's , was already , as a matter of fact , in his name . Reuben alwaysremembered that summer of 1890 when the carpentersand masons were at work inside and out ; when the painters mixed and stirred their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid into smaller pails and mounting with them to the scaffolding where they scraped and painted with long , slapping sweeps of their brushes ; when the paper-hangers bothered Susan for hot water for their paste and spread their lengths ofp271paper on long trestle-tables throughout most of the rooms in turn . It was a summer during which he needed and asked for no other occupation than to stand for hours at a time watching the men at work , the only difficulty being that he did not know upon whom to concentrate . He read that year in the daily paper from Bangor that a great World 's Fair was to be held soon in Chicago , but that to him was as nothing compared to the delighted agitationthat was his for a week when the carpenters allowedhim to sit with them on the scaffolding of the roof and pound short , bright nails into the tops of fresh shingles , that smelled of new wood and must be placed carefully side by side in a straight line before the nails secured them with two heavy blows of the hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking and reached into its stiff pocket for the nails as he needed them , overlappinghis shingles carefully and beginning on his next row with caution . When he was not helping , he went about , inside the house and out , taking delight in the mere presence of men who worked and talked with him , neglecting his playmates who seemed dull enough in contrast , fearful of his grandmother 's and Susan 's errandswhich might take him even for an hour from the scene of industry and labour . And every night when he went to bed , he considered seriously , for he was in the academy now and thinking uneasily of his future , whether it might not he better all around if he should embrace a trade rather than go to college as his grandmotherwanted him to do , or even than to follow on in seafaring which seemed nowadays to offer little enough , even to boys with a long tradition within it.  |p272Most  wonderful of all during that fresh summer when every unspent day seemed awake and alive was the gradualtransformation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects as , through them , in that inner characterwhich made it what it was . Now it no longer slumped upon its foundations or sank beneath its saggingroofs . Instead it raised itself proudly like a person who , imbued with new courage , holds his head high and his shoulders up , or like one whom new clothes suddenly reveal in a manner transcending even the clothes themselves . It was as though , thought Solace , it had been reanimated less by carpentry and brickwork and plasteringthan by the resurrection through them of the spirit which had lived a century within it . When she and Reubenafter supper walked slowly through the field to the shore in order to turn back and look upon it standing there , they both felt , although they did not speak of it to each other , the intangible yet actual nature of its transformation . Within it was the same . Judah and Amos , Benjamin and James , Abigail and Silas came back again with their old vigour once the rooms were spruce and new . Solace could hear Silas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts and Abigail as a bride rattling her pots and pans as she hung them on her new kitchen walls in 1797 . There was only one thing that she left as it was . That was the Versailles paper in the front parlour . One of the workmen , who knew more than the others and had a feeling for old things , said it would be a pity to strip that from the walls . They did not make such paper nowadays , he said , good for a hundred years and more.  |p273He  could clean it with some new-fangled stuff so that much of its original freshness would come back . When he had finished with it , it did , indeed , look different beneathnewly plastered ceilings and encased in freshly painted wainscotings . Solace was glad to keep it . Reubenwould be proud to show it to people , she told him , ten or twenty years hence , to tell them that it came from France when Robespierre was making Paris a terrifying place and when noble heads were dropping one by one beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be glad to lie below it when her time came . It came in September after the house was exactly as she had wanted to leave it for Reuben , after the scaffold- ing was down and the vines replaced and the furniture i within all set to rights . The hay was cut , too , with Reubennow to bear a man 's share in the labour , stowed away in the freshly painted and newly shingled barn ; and the meadows were green again beneath the August showers and the fogs of the dog-days . August had been hard on Solace with its muggy , humid weather . Sometimes at supper Susan and Reuben had noted with alarm how her breath came quickly through her parted lips and how the beating of her heart became visible in her neck and beneath the folds of her dress . She lay quietly in bed during the last few days , sleepingmost of the time , now and again asking to have her pillows raised so that she might look out upon the harbourwater . Reuben sat for hours beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when she opened her eyes . She seldom opened them as the days went on ,  | but Reuben rarely left her , since there was always the chance that she would . He sat in the chair with his hands folded between his knees and watched his grandmother . At fourteen he was still short and stocky with compact , serious features , a nose shorter than those of the Crocketts , a mouth at once fuller and less decisive . He had the blue eyes and dark brows of Nicholas and Silas beneath his straight , dark hair , and only they gave proof that his thoughts were of any length or depth . He was an engaging boy , perhaps more through what he did not say or do than through what he did ; but whatever he had within him was not obvious to anyone at all . Susan wondered often what was passing through his mind as he sat doggedly on beside his grandmother for hours on end , most of the day and half of the night ; but she was not one for prying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucker when he brought in the milk , and probably no one would ever know . When his grandmother quietly let her last breath go at sunset one September evening , Reuben as quietly left the room , crossed the field , and walked back and forth alone along the shore , now and then pausing to skip flat stones with practised wrist out across the still water . Sometimes he got as many as six skips from a stone , Susannoted , as she and Seth Tucker waited outside for people to come to do what had to be done . He was the beatingestyoung one , she said , that she had ever seen , and she for one had never been able to make him out , much as she liked him.  |p275Deborah  came for Solace 's funeral , and Reuben almost warily laid out his clothes and got himself ready for his mother . He had seen her but twice since he was ten , once in Boston on a long-deferred visit that had held more of embarrassment than pleasure , once for a few days in Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning she came . He had dreaded the meeting for hours , and it proved no easier than he had feared . I le stood in his black suit at the top of the gangway as she came from the boat , his black cap held awkwardly in his hand . Susan had dyed his best clothes from navy blue to black . It was only proper , she said . The suit had shrunk in the process and made him look even more ungainly than he was . His mother said , " Well , Reuben , " and kissed him on his cheek , which was wet from perspiration though the autumn day was cold . He could not seem to keep his face and hands dry , much as he mopped them with his black-bordered handkerchief . He minded the stares of the people standing about far less than he minded the drive home with his mother . He could not think of one word to say to her as he drove her up the village street and along the shore road . She wore black , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she looked dainty and clean in spite of her journey . He replied as best he could to her questions , but his monosyllabic words and fragmentary sentences cracked with his changing voice and made him acutelyp276miserable . Once at home it was no better , perhaps even worse . They sat together , seemingly for hours on end , in the sitting-room before the closed doors of the front parlour . It was hard for his mother , too . Reuben recognizedthat fact in spite of his own suffering and would have helped her if he could . Deborah at nearly forty was lovely to look at , and Reuben in an odd , impersonal way was proud of his mother . He had even felt a momentary sense of pleasurableimportance mingling with his fear when he had glimpsed certain of his school friends whose curiosity had drawn them to the wharf . She looked more like a summer visitor than like a native . Her hands were soft and white with polished nails , and she moved about the old rooms with such an air of complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingtorment . It was not easy for Deborah to be back in Saturday Cove . In that Reuben was right . Only a decent sense of propriety , gratitude , and duty had brought her in response to Susan 's telegram . The rooms in which she sat or walked about , the dead face of Solace in the front parlour , the field stretching to the shore , the bed in which she slept , the presence of her son  --  all these urged upon her an emotional response which she was unable to give them . The past was worse than dead to Deborah in that it held not even the sense of finality and acceptance which the death of things and experiences sometimes brings , a finality without remorse , an acceptance free from regret . It was not dead so much as blotted out , gone from her consciousness , dissolved and vanished ,  |p277|passed  out of sight . The memory of her love for Nicholas became baseless and insubstantial even before she vainly tried to bring it before her . Reuben as its outward and visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entailing possible responsibilities from which she shrank as well for himself as for her . It was , would be insufferable , she thought , to have the past come hurtlinginto the present like some strange , almost abortive birth , unconnected by any affections or impressions , unrecognizableeven by pain . Deborah tried to break Reuben 's embarrassed silence 11 as they sat together , not because she had any real desire to know him as her son , but rather because the very tensionof their aloofness became at moments unbearable . " The old house looks very nice , Reuben . " " Yes , it does . " " It 's a beautiful old place , I think . " " I think so , too . " " Your father was very proud of it . " " Yes . " " I hope you 'll be able to keep it when you get older . " " I hope so , too . " " Have you thought of what you 'll do when you finish the academy , made any plans for yourself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandmother ever talk with you about what she wanted you to do ? " " Sometimes she did . " There was always a point beyond which Deborah could not get with Reuben . When that point was soon reached , they sat again in silence.  | Susan did not help matters during those trying two days . Susan was not one to forget past grievances , and she had neither cared for Deborah as a little girl nor expected much of her as a woman . Moreover , Susan was jealous both for the rights of Master Reuben and for those of her dead mistress in the front parlour . Knowing Deborah as she did , or at least assumed she did , she had what she considered her well-grounded fears . If Reuben'smother made up her mind to take Master Reuben back with her to Boston , Susan had already make up her stout mind to relieve it of certain opinions she held on the matter , opinions well substantiated by certain confidences given her by Solace Crockett herself . Susan was biding her time , she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speak she would and to some purpose . She knew Master Reuben , his clothes , his appetite , and his odd ways ; and before he was taken to Boston to live with ne'er-do-well artists , who cared not so much as a crumb for him , who would take what little he had ( and the Lord knew it was n't much ) and who would fill the old house in the summer with Heaven knew what sort of idle daubers , she intended to have her say out . She intended also , she said , to keep both her eyes and her ears well open while Mrs. Edward Sawyer was in a house where she had never for one moment belonged ; and she loyally fulfilled her resolve . In all justice ( or injustice ) to Deborah , Susan might have been spared her agitation . Deborah had no desire to transport to Boston her unfamiliar son , who sat oppositeher in the back parlour , not more ill at ease , she thought , than she herself . In point of sober fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . There he was , belonging to her , the fruit of a love which had once conquered her better judgment and of which now not a vestige remained , save now and again at rare intervals the uneasy sense that she had once made a mess of things . When at last the two days were at an end and things were mercifully over , so far at least as their outward aspects were concerned , she spoke to Reuben as they sat together in the sitting-room . At the sound of her voice breaking the restless silence , Susan in the chair which she had moved to the open door leading from the kitchen to the hall raised her head like some great dog who hears strange footsteps drawing near his master 's house . " I 've been thinking , Reuben , about what is best for you. , , " You need n't . I 'm all right . " " I do n't like to leave you here alone . " " I 'm not alone . Susan will stay with me . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open door Deborah lowered her voice , but Susan caught the words . " Are you happy with Susan ? " " Of course . I 'm  --  I 'm used to her . " " And you 're not used to me . Is that it ? " " I suppose so . " Deborah gathered herself together as one gathers himself for a first daring plunge into deep water . " You must know that I want to do all that I can for you , Reuben . I 'm your mother after all . You 're always welcome to come to Boston to stay with me . Your step/o father told me to tell you . The schools are better there , and it might be best for you . " Emboldened by his mother 's temerity , Reuben found his own voice . Susan , listening , understood the cost of his words . She could hear him drawing himself slowly up on the cane seat and against the back of his grandmother'schair where he sat . " Thank you , mother , and my stepfather , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house where I belong . " Deborah , forcing herself to look at Reuben and see the matter through , saw with a start the eyes of Nicholas at the supper-table fifteen years before . She sought hurriedlyfor another question which should deaden a sudden , unexpected stab of pain . " Are you sure you wo n't be lonely here ? " " Perhaps I 'll be lonely sometimes , but not so lonely as in Boston . " There was silence again in the sitting-room , a silence which , Susan knew , neither Deborah nor Reuben dared to break . As for her , she found all at once that there were tears in the hollows above her cheek bones , more tears than even Marie Corelli could bring forth . Feeling them there , she rose at once and bestirred herself , not without relief , to set her bread for rising during the night . Reuben Crockett was never popular in the usual sense of the word either among his schoolmates or his teachers in the Saturday Cove Academy , but in an odd way hep281was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , but unlike Nicholas he bent for hours over his studies simply because it seemed to him at the time the only thing to do . He kept from the beginning , when he had put his toys away without being told , a slow , meticulous sense of doing whatever was requiredof him whenever it was required and as well as he could do it . He made painstaking , correct translationsof his Latin , which , although they would never fire any teacher by their spirit or originality , would yet satisfyby the fact that they were always forthcoming , exact and dependable . He did the same with all his other lessons , at school sitting quietly until he was called upon and then as quietly telling what he knew . Nor did he distinguish himself in school sports and games or at parties . Nevertheless , when games were to be played , he played them , and when there were parties , he was there . His schoolmates liked , even admired him without exactly knowing why . Perhaps they liked him because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he always seemed to know what he thought about things . When any matter for deliberation came up and preliminary discussions were held about the school grounds at recess , Reuben was never one for talk ; but when a decision was about to be made , he was always ready with everything neatly placed in his mind and his opinion quite made up . Nor was he easily swerved from what he thought . In church it was the same . It never once occurred to Reuben not to go to church , since he had always gone . I le went every Sunday morning at half-past ten in his best clothes with a clean handkerchief in his pocket . He always led Susan in , down the main aisle to the old Crockett pew , the third from the front ; and once she was seated and had arranged the folds of her black alpaca or foulard silk , he saw that she had a footstool for her ample , rheumatic feet . Then he sat at the head of the pew where James and Silas and Nicholas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , found the hymns for Susan and sang them unobtrusively , and always kept his eyes full on the minister 's face during the forty-five minute sermon , which sometimes ran into an hour or more without the slightest sign on Reuben 's part that it was too long or dull . He stayed for Sunday-school , too , held now during the hour succeeding church . He had learned his lesson at home just as he learned his daily lessons at school and was comforting to his teacher , who had been forced to realize that the learningof Sunday-school lessons was now considered needlessand supererogatory on the part of most of his class . On Sunday evenings , leaving Susan in the kitchen with her old-time favourites , supplemented now by Anna Katharine Green , the latest Amelia Edith Barr , and the new success , The Prisoner of Zenda , he went to prayer meeting , sitting attentively in the vestry and singingWork for the Night Is Coming , Shall We Gather at the River ? and Blest Be the Tie that Binds . Unlike theother boys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any girl to her doorway , there to stand in half-embarrassed talk or to go into the sitting-room to finish with her family the Sunday afternoon supply ofp283popcorn or molasses taffy . Instead he skirted the churchyardand walked home alone along the shore road . Always in his walks home at night he stopped now and again to look off across the harbour to where the islands lay , dark , obscure humps when there was no moon , in moonlight pointed and sparred from their spruces and firs which were reflected in the shining water . Farther , on clear nights stretched the horizon , a pale line of light beneath the moon and stars . He liked to stand there at night and look seaward , with the crickets in August and September filling the air and in April and May the peepers from the marshes . He liked to stop even in winter before the ice closed in the inner harbour , note how the snow-covered fields fell downward until at the water 's edge they became rhythmic , curving mounds of white above the high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out , dark , mysterious , and cold . I le liked to imagine how others of his family had walked the same road homeward , had stopped as he stopped to look out upon a different harbour and a different sea , gleaming here and there with the lights of great ships at anchor and mirroring their dark yards and spars . Now except for the clear or obscured outlines of a schooner or two or of the smart , white hulls of pleasure yachts and sloops in summer , there was small evidence of ships when he had passed the inner harbour with the water slapping at the skiffs and dories of the local fishermen . The night was close about him ; the air was fresh and free ; and he was alone with his own thoughts , which from his childhoodhad never failed him . Reuben 's religious life was a matter of cogitation , not to say of controversy among the church authorities of Saturday Cove when , in 1894 , at the age of eighteen he asked to be admitted to membership . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even private professions of a change in mind and heart , which in that day by most brands of rural New England Congregationalism were held to be necessary preliminaries to the taking of such a serious and revolutionary step . He had , in fact , been conspicuous during the yearly seasons of revival by his apparent lack of emotional and spiritual fervour . He had never come forward to the seat of the penitents , had never risen when the call for Christians to stand had been sounded , had never given so much as a verse of Scripture to testify either to his faith or to the astoundingtransformation wrought by the grace of God within him . Yet here he was , without excuse or explanation , suing quietly for membership within the Communion of Saints . The minister and the deacons comprising the church committee deliberated long and carefully over Reuben 's request . There was no gainsaying that there were many things in his favour . He had the name of a moral and upright young man with no bad habits ; he was a constant attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . The minister , although theologically not an exponent of initial grace , was half inclined to believe when he looked at Reuben during the Sunday morning service that by some special act of Providence it had been implanted in him , even although Reuben himself was not given to testimony and apparently was not in any way aware of the influx of the Spirit . It mightp285be that with his baptism his tongue would occasionally become loosened , thought the Reverend Mr. Bentley , mulling the matter over in his troubled mind , and that he would no longer hesitate to declare in public the unsearchableriches of God . Reuben , sitting uncomfortably before the minister in the old parsonage , quite unaware that in this very room his grandmother and grandfather , over sixty years before , had received holy instructions upon their approachingmarriage , gave no sign either of his own consciousness of initial grace or of any loosening of his tongue . He made , in fact , but one thoroughly complete statement which , though it was not displeasing to his questioner , hardly contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puzzled Mr. Bentley , " to learn what steps have led you to this momentous decision ; in short , what has made you eager to ally yourself with the church of God ? " Reuben , embarrassed and perplexed , looked for a steady moment at the minister and then at the full afternoontide , which before a strong southwest wind was rocking the dories about at their anchorage . " I 'm afraid there have n't been any steps , sir , at least that I can remember . I just think it 's  --  it 's the right thing for a young man to do . " But there was something about him sitting there , even with the nervous twirling of his cap in his hands and the inadequate answers which he gave to the succeeding questions , only half understood , that convinced the minister , who in turn set aside the uneasy objections of the church committee.  |p286Reuben  joined the church as unostentatiously as he had always attended it , and Susan , who had been saved early and had long since forgotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face as she watched him go forward for his baptism and reception . She looked for no change in him although she knew that a change was expected after such a grave and significant step . She told her friends , whom she frequently met about the village or who sometimes came to sit with her for an hour in her bright kitchen , that Master Reuben did n't need any change in him , no matter what the church said . He might have his ways same as she had hers , but he was as good a boy as ever breathed the breath of life , and that she would maintain to her dying day . Reuben did have his ways , accentuated within him by the very fact that he was not called upon to adapt himself to anyone but Susan . Above all else he liked things done as they had always been done , the same hours for bed-time and getting up , the same fish-balls for Sunday dinner , lamps in the same places shining through the windows in the selfsame , familiar shafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same dish upon the table . " What 's become of the old dish ? " he said to Susan when she made a change . " Did it get broken or some-thing ? " He studied his Sunday-school lesson in the front parlourfrom nine to ten on Sunday mornings , and he alwaysspent an hour there after dinner , sitting alone with his book . He had a way of walking through the house , looking at things , handling them sometimes . Whenever , urged by Susan , he asked his friends in on Saturdayp287evening to play games , authors or anagrams , Boston or Jenkins Up , or to pull taffy , he liked to have the chairs in their accustomed places before he went to bed . It was characteristic of him that he did not talk about his future with anyone at all . Not that there were many to talk with had he cared to do so . There was the lawyer , who had charge of his small affairs pending his twentyfirstbirthday and who each month dealt out to Susan whatever she needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum allowed him for pocketmoney . The lawyer had gone to school with Reuben 's father and had come home , after reading in a Calais office for the bar examinations , to draw up deeds for the transfer of land and to take small fees from farmers who wanted insecure boundaries established . He understood Reuben as little as Reuben liked him . There was the preceptor of the academy , now called the principal , a kind , well-meaning man , who could not honestly say that any indications in Reuben 's present glowed with a bright light for his future . There was his mother , who each Year dutifully offered him a home and possible work in Boston and who each year received from Reuben a polite refusal . And there was Susan , who knew him too well to offer suggestions had she had any to offer and who was inclined to think that anything which Master Reuben decided to do would be done better than as though any one else attempted it . The natural result was that Reuben at nineteen , having graduated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own mind as to his place in the years that stretched before him . He made it up during the long walks which he was forever taking by himself through the woods and along the shore paths . From money that he had saved from the amount allowed him he bought a small sailboat in the spring of the year that a decision must be made and spent hours sailing it in all weathers far beyond the harbour . Sitting in the stern with the sheet in his hands and watching with careful eyes the vagaries of the wind , he kept his mind busy on this possibility and that . There were few enough for him , and he knew it , knowing full well what manner of young man he was and how certain things were well-rooted within him for better or for worse . He thought seriously of college , which his grandmother had desired for him . There were many things against college , pondered Reuben , and few for it as far as he could see . To go to collegemeant the using of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old house . It meant his bewilderedentrance into a new and strange life among new and strange people , studies which had little appeal to him and , worst of all , the necessity for excellence if he were to succeed in any of the professions to which collegeinevitably led . Reuben had no illusions about himself . At nineteen he knew far more about his own nature and worth than most men know at forty . He understood that he would never be a man to whom persons are unmistakably drawn , a man who succeeds in whatever he undertakes by the mere force of personality and an abundance of social gifts . He knew , for instance , that he could never sell things , either leaning across the counter of some city or even country store or going about from town to town with samples of cotton goods , clothing , boots and shoes in huge cases , which he sometimes saw in the small mercantilehouses of Saturday Cove . The drummer business was booming in the nineties among the country towns , and many young men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presupposed either confidence in one 's wares or cleverness in hoodwinking customers , and above all else it required a kind of social urbanity , affability and neighbourliness which one had or one had not . Not a few young men in the nineties in Maine coast villages were giving up the idea of further education and a possible profession and instead taking up trades . Educationmeant money , which was scarce enough in most families , even the best , now that the old life had gone , whereas here at one 's very doors was the ever-growing demand for carpenters and masons and paper-hangers to build and put in order the summer homes which were rising year by year . To learn a trade now meant good wages after the shortest of apprenticeships ; and yet a certain stubborn pride within Reuben set summarily aside the notion , so alluring when at fourteen he had driven nails into the fresh shingles on his old roofs . He could not , he thought , without apology come up his driveway to his white doors with a tool-kit on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint and oil and varnish , before Amos and Judah in his front parlour . I le came of better stuff , he said to himself with a proud lift of his head as he trimmed his sail skilfully to get the best of the wind . And steadily as the summer days went on and the autumn loomed ominously before him , thep290knowledge became clearer to him that his work like that of his forbears must be with the sea and with some sort of ship that moved thereon . Had he been differently situated , less alone in the world , even of a more venturesome nature , he might conceivably , though at that late day , have experienced under sail the life upon which his father had been about to enter . For there were still in the nineties sailing-ships here and there making the long passage eastward to Australian and Chinese ports , rounding Good Hope and Java Head , clearing the Sunda Straits , still competing through lower freight rates with the now triumphant conquestof steam . But Reuben in Saturday Cove in the mid-nineties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him in contact with their masters and owners . Nor did the Crockett name mean what it had meant in the seventies and fifties . Time and chance had smothered its magic . His immediate future at least must be nearer home among the smaller , steam-driven craft which were being built or renovated to take care of the steady stream of people , coming eastward from New York and Boston and points west with their goods and chattels to spend the summer months along the coast of Maine from Casco to Passamaquoddy . Once his mind was made up , he went one warm day in late July to see the local steamship agent , who put him in touch with the Bangor office and who , a native himself of Saturday Cove and not unaware of the stuff that had produced Reuben , wrote a letter to anticipate Reuben 's application . By the middle of August he was placed as ship 's clerk on a coastwise steamer runningp291daily except on Sunday between Rockland and points east to Mount Desert . The steamer was a small one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockland wharf awaiting the arrival of the larger boat from Boston , which docked at five A.M. and transferred her sleepy passengersfor their day 's journey down the coast . Besides these and their baggage she carried every conceivable sort of freight , canned goods , farm machinery , wagons and sometimes horses , furniture , fish , and kerosene , fruit and grain , sugar and molasses , boots and shoes and Bostonpapers , everything in short that towns and villages off the railroad depended upon for their daily maintenance . She was not a prepossessing craft , being a small wooden propeller with a length of only one hundred and twenty feet ; but she was officered by decent and able men , some of whom like Reuben bore names once well and honourablyknown in deep-water traffic half around the world . Now that he had settled the beginning of his future Reuben brought to his work the same trustworthiness and reliability that had characterized him from the start . The officers took notice of the way he did things and now and then gave him charges of responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his ambitions and his dreams . When he walked through the noisy , fog-swept Rockland wharf-houses where dirty men were forever trundling freight-barrows , and the smell of multifariouscargoes mingled with the smells of grease and soot and harbour water , he thought how one day he might be transferred to the spacious , cleaner , newer steamers plying to Boston or New York or extending their runs farther eastward : the City of Bangor , for instance , or the Frank Jones , or the new steel propeller Perna quid . He took pleasure in the very fact that he was helping to carry passengers who represented a larger life than he knew , men and women who had seen more of the world than he , boys who sometimes in city accents asked him questions as to this light and that island along their desultory course . He grew acquainted with the coast both in terms of navigation and of interest in its very loveliness . He never tired of the great curve of shore line sweeping up to Owl 's Head , or of the perfect symmetryof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills of Camden with Negro Island Light in their dark shadow , the blue sweep of Eggemoggin , the high green promontory of Eagle and the squat cosiness of Pumpkin , the spruces that back the great granite cliffs of Heron Neck , and the white lighthouse towers of Frenchman 's Bay  --  Egg Rock , Bear Island , and Baker , warning mariners of the treacherous shoals and bars of the Cranberries . And on alternate nights when the Matinicus lay over in her Mount Desert port , he smoked his pipe , which Susan did not like but which seemed a necessity to a sailor 's life , and wondered if Java Head and the peaks beyond Rio and even the harbour of Sydney , which his father had seen , were actually more beautifulthan the tumbling Mount Desert hills rising darkly into the evening sky or growing blue as the dawn broke behind them . Reuben Crockett 2 93p293He did not after all trouble Susan unduly with his pipe , since it was not often that he could spend a Sunday at home . When an occasional holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few extra hours , he came by stage from the neighbouring railway station , now ten miles away . Saturday Cove itself was not on the route of his steamer . Susan always made it a point to be about the house on Saturday afternoons and evenings just on the chance of his arrival . She always watched him as he came up the driveway in his neat blue clothes and cap . She thought as the months and years went by that Master Reuben walked with a more decisive step as though he were growing quicker and more sure of himself now that he was in the twenties and had been promoted to an officership . Susan asked no better thing than to keep the house ready and in order for his infrequent returns . It had becomeher home through the years , and she had no other . She had told Master Reuben when he once began to strike out for himself that her board and keep were quite enough for her . She had worked for forty years , she said , and had laid by a respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reuben continued to pay her , nevertheless , his postal orders coming every month with the regularity of the sun ; and Susan cashed each at the inside postoffice window and then put by the money between  --  the pages of the Family Bible that marked the Book of Joshua . She laid it away in that safe and secret place against the time when Master Reuben might be ill or in need . She had quite enough to occupy her days . There was the cleaning of the house every week , the daily tidying up , the necessary cooking and washing . When her work was done , she knitted in the kitchen where the clock ticked on in almost perfect time with the tall one in the hall . She knitted Reuben 's socks and wristers and winter gloves ; and when a great plentitude of those was complete , she knitted sundry articles for a Calais firm , which supplied her with wool and paid her a small price for her labour . She could knit and read at the same time , and she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the outside world whenever he came home . He told her in the spring of 1898 of the latest developments in Cuba , and what he privately thought of Admiral Dewey , and how glad he was that a war for which he had small respect and sympathy was not calling for any numberof young and able men . Susan was glad , too . She was sorry that the Cubans were starving ; she would feed them if she could ; but secretly she had no use for mixingup with a lot of outlandish folks who had nothing in common with good New England stock . Each day she studied the wind and weather from her kitchen window , keeping an eye on the eastern horizon , and sometimes she walked about the house and into the meadows where she could better scan the heavens and the sea . In the fall of 1898 when the great storm of the 26th of November broke and ravaged the coast waters from Fundy to Cape Cod , she did not sleep at all . That Saturdaymorning had been exceptionally bright for No/vember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands and making the headlands on the farther shore of the harbour gaunt and distinct in their stern outlines of late autumn with winter just around the corner . There had not been the slightest hint of snow either in the morning air or in the sky . The rare and brief November sun had never shed a warmer light on the brown fields and meadows . She remembered afterward how at three o'clock the wind had suddenly shifted to blow from the northeast just as she had gone out to empty her soapy bath water over the brown , decaying leaves of the pieplantby the side of the barn . Soapy water was good for pie-plant , Susan always thought , and every Saturday she emptied a wash-tub full of it even after the ground had begun to harden a bit . The wind increased that afternoon to gale force and by early darkness was shaking the shutters , slatting the bare branches of the lilacs against the house , and growing stronger every hour . At seven o'clock it was blowing a hurricane of snow . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Master Reuben 's boat , wondering if it had reached its Mount Desert port by five o'clock , knowinghow , if it were late , it must battle against that northeaststorm blowing dead against it . She learned two days later of what that November storm had cost ; and when Reuben came the following Sunday to eat a deferred Thanksgiving dinner with her , he talked for hours of it , his tongue so loosened that he paced her kitchen floor , talking , talking , while she did her dishes . Reuben 's boat had come through all right  --  he was first officer of her now  --  though she had had a time of it at the last with the snow beginning at the approach of darkness and the wind beating her offshore . Just where the Portland had gone down , said Reuben , would always be a matter of sad conjecture . Some said off Boon Island Light , others Kennebunkport , still others around Race Point and High Head near Provincetown . Reuben 's own theory was that she went down on Stellwagen Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , some bodies of the hundred and sixty-eight souls lost on her had drifted ashore on the Cape Cod sands as early as Sunday evening . " And may the Lord have mercy on them all ! " cried Susan , for once not minding the tobacco smoke curling about her kitchen from the bowl of Reuben 's pipe . No one on the Maine coast talked of much else that winter . Even the coal schooner King Philip and the Maine-named Pentagoet , which disappeared in the same terrible night with all on board , were frail rivals of the Portland disaster as subjects of conversation . To Susan and perhaps even to Reuben himself it cast a new light upon his calling , proved that dangers had not passed with the passing of the sailing-ship , placed an added premiumupon the hardihood and responsibility of those that officered and commanded boats through inshore as well as through deep waters . " Come to that , " said Reuben to Susan more than once on his succeeding visits , " there 's a heap to learn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going well the way some people think . It 's knowing every reef and shoal and sounding of the most tricky coast in all the world . It must have been a fine thing to sail inp297open water hundreds of miles on every side of you and get the most you could out of your ship . But maybe it 's not such a poor job to know how to get through the islands of Eggemoggin Reach and Frenchman 's Bay in a fog that 's sitting thick on your very pilot-house . " Susan was proud of Master Reuben when he talked this way with his eyes glowing and the new braid on his blue coat shining in the light of her kitchen lamp . Reuben was learning not only steamboat navigation in the late nineties but the history of it as well . He listened to the talk of the older men in the service , and , as his interest grew , he spent his off hours during the winter months in running down whatever records he could find in the various historical societies and libraries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bangor . It seemed to Susan that he knew the ins and outs of each of the many short-lived companies founded on the coast for seventy-five years back and all the craft that they had floated . He had picked up odd drawings of the first steam-driven boats of the 182o 's and even arlier , their wood-fired engines supplemented then byil , and he liked to spread them out before her on the Sundays he was at home and explain their curiosities to her . He liked to tell her stories of some of them . For instance , he quite endowed with magic the very day of Susan 's commonplace and undistinguished advent into this world by identifying it with the burning of the Royal Tar , an early Maine coast steamboat , named after King William IV and bound from St. John to Portland . The 26th day of October of the year 1836 thus took on an unwonted glamour for Susan when she learned that even while her mother laboured in pain to bring her into the sin and suffering of this planet , where most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragedy had been enacted on the sea only thirty miles away . The Royal Tar , Reuben told Susan , had carried besides her seventy passengers the singular cargo of a menagerie , having stowed away in her hold an elephant , two camels , two lions , and a royal Bengal tiger . The fire , which broke out shortly after she had left Eastport in the supply of wood stacked too near her boiler , was fed by a strong northwest wind ; and the steamer with most of her passengersand all her menagerie suffered a merciless and cruel fate . Reuben 's story had the odd effect of increasingSusan 's respect for her own birth . That an elephant , two camels , a pair of lions , and a Bengal tiger , none of which animals Susan had ever seen , should have been swimming about in panic through the waters of PassamaquoddyBay at the very moment when Susan was greetingthis world with a cry made an immeasurable dent upon her imagination and enlivened not only her conversations with her friends but many a solitary hour over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as to hope for Master Reuben 's return . In the earliest years of his seafaring , when the closing in of the ice laid the Matinicus up for three months at least , Reuben had spent part of the winter at home . But as time went on and he rose slowly in his importance to the company , he began to find office employment in Bangoror Boston . This , Susan thought , was all to the good . Idleness , she maintained , was safe for no one at all , at anyp299place , at any time ; and she would far rather never see Master Reuben than to have him hanging about the stores and wharves of Saturday Cove like a lot of young men with no gumption whatsoever . " I do n't know what this village is comin ' to , " she said to Reuben , " upon my soul I do n't . It 's gettin ' so that young an ' old work only in the summer an ' hang round air-tights all winter figurin ' how they can cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get enough out of ' cm to live on the remainin ' nine . It ai n't healthy for all concerned . An ' these new cigarettes the young fry 's smokin ' eat the linin ' off their lungs and stomachs an ' take away what little starch they 've got left in ' em . Tobacco'sa curse , if you ask me , Master Reuben , which you ai n't . You stick to your job no matter where it takes you . I 'll hold the old fort here if it takes my last breath , as one general said to another in the Civil War which you ca n't remember , but I can , with my poor brothers so nearly starved that they 've never been the same since . " In 190I when the Eastern Steamship Company , a consolidation of all lines running east from Boston , was formed , Reuben left the Matinicus to become commanderof the Searsport , the youngest man in command of any ship run by the new company . The Searsport , connecting with the Boston boat at Rockland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays she left Saturday Cove for Rockland ; on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays she left Rockland for Saturday Cove . A sister ship , the Searsmont , took care of the alternate days so that each morning a boat left for Rockland and each afternoon a boat arrived in Saturday Cove . Reuben had done well , and the new company recognizedthat fact . He might , indeed , have taken , instead of his captaincy , a first officership with the promise of quick promotion on the new and spacious City of Rockland , plying the main route between Boston and Bangor . But even although he had once dreamed of t:le larger boats with their nearer approximation to deep water , he decided to stick to the smaller , partly because he could not bear to give up the now familiar coast , partly because his command of the Searsport would mean Sundays and alternate nights at home . When the decision was once made , he broke down all reserve and caution and sent Susan a telegram from the Boston office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company . Susan let it lie on the kitchen table for a full quarter of an hour while she sat staring at it in the still room , now reaching out her hand toward it , now drawing her hand back , unable for fear to tear it open . Once she had done so , she started for the village in the usual heat of a September day to publish abroad the news that Master Reuben , like his forbears , was now commander of his own ship . When she had once come back at supper-time , hurrying along the shore road and up the driveway in an excitement that would not let her walk as a woman of her years ought to walk , she felt as odd and shaky that she had to lie down for an hour once she was in the house.  |p301One  Saturday afternoon in early October of the same year Reuben at Susan 's back door met a woman , who remainedconstantly in his thoughts and behaviour for two years before he at last decided to tell her about it . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall from Machias to teach the grammar school at Saturday Cove . She was five years older than Reuben . On the afternoon that she began to invade his consciousnessReuben had come home from the steamboat wharf for supper , secure in the thought of a good run from Rockland , a safely discharged cargo , and a reliable officer and purser remaining on board the Searsport . He had come up the driveway , surveying the old house criticallyas he walked . Some shingles on the western roof of the ell needed replacing , he noted , after the work in 1890 in which he at fourteen had had such pleasure . He was taking stock at that moment of his bank account and felt proud that now with no effort at all he could keep things in decent shape . The old place looked beautiful in the October light with the low sun streaming upon it . The woodbine above the front doorway was flaming red against the white clapboards . The whole house could do with a coat of paint , he thought , and when spring came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressing in her room above the kitchen when he opened the back door and went inside . She had been lying down for two hours as the doctor had ordered her to do , not because , as she had stoutly informed Reu/O2 ben , she believed one word he said or had any patience with his tonics and nostrums , but because , once having been fool enough to go to see him , she insisted on getting her money 's worth . She would be down directly , she called . There was a fresh squash pie in the pantry , and the coffee was on the back of the stove if he wanted a lunch before supper . Huldah 's knock came at the back door while Reuben , regardless of lunch , was walking about the familiar rooms . He opened it to see her standing there . He never forgot the moment , although she was neither prepossessingor in the least unusual in a worn brown jacket with leg-of-mutton sleeves , a shirtwaist with a high , boned collar that made red marks beneath her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , and a wide and long brown skirt , to the stout brush-braid of which some fallen leaves were clinging . She asked for Susan . " Is Miss Gray in ? " she said . For a moment Reuben was puzzled . He did not remember ever having heard Susan 's other name , had , indeed , forgotten that she owned one . " You must be Captain Crockett , " continued this unknowncaller . " I 'm sorry to bother you when you 're just home . I saw you coming ahead of me along the road . " She had a nice voice , thought Reuben , low and clearwith a rise and fall in it that somehow made it musical . By this time he had recovered himself and asked her in . " I 'm afraid I do n't know who you are , " he said , leadingher through the kitchen to the sitting-room . " Ip303thought I knew everyone in Saturday Cove at least by sight . Maybe I 'm growing old . " She laughed . She had a pleasant laugh like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice . They were gray eyes , Reuben noted , just off the blue , and they were frank and friendly . She put her gloves on the table  --  they looked worn and old  --  and sat down by the fireplace . " There 's no reason why you should know me , " she said , looking straight at Reuben standing by the center table in his blue clothes . " My name is Huldah Barrett , and I 've just come from Machias to teach the grammar school . My mother and I live in the second house belowthe church  --  the old Stevens ' place , they call it . We 've taken the lower rooms there and are keeping house . And right now I 'm soliciting for the church suppernext Thursday . I 'm on the committee . Mother said she knew I 'd be put on something directly , but I do n't mind ; in fact , I like it . We thought Miss Gray would be willing to make a marble cake . It seems she 's famous for marble cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised Reuben , looking uneasilytoward the staircase . " She 'll be down right away . " He tried to think of something else to say , but hecould not seem to do so . Women were out of his line , especially strange ones who appeared unexpectedly . Buthe managed to sit down in the chair opposite her own , placing his cap , which he was still holding , on the table . The cap had a star upon it above its gold braid andserved to suggest her next observation which she hastenedto make , sensing his own embarrassment and feel- ing sorry that she had forced herself upon him only for a marble cake . " The whole village is pleased at your promotion . We heard about it at once from  --  from Susan . I think I 'll have to call her Susan since every one else does . I know some of the old people here and there who knew your father and grandfather . They 're all proud of what you 've done . " To this it was even more difficult to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , relieved to hear Susan 's stout tread . " It 's very kind of you to tell me . " Reuben meant to go when Susan came in , but he kept on sitting there , as much because he found it oddly comfortableto have some one else in the house besides himselfand Susan as because he did not quite know how to leave . He listened to ten minutes ' talk on cakes , sponge and angel and marble , sunshine , moonshine , and lightning , Lord Baltimore and silver , nut , chocolate , and apple sauce , jelly-roll , cream pie , and the lowly one-egg . These were listed on Huldah 's paper , and opposite them were the names of the artists , who of their exceeding charity were to mix , beat , and bake them for the Thursdaynight supper . When Huldah rose to go , he rose , too , and led the way to the front door . It seemed more fitting that she should leave from that entrance . Susan , surprised , followedafter them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first of the steps to say goodbye , " I declare if it ai n't the beatingest thing the way the church folks have took you right in . But there  --  when a body 'll work with a will ,  |p305they  'll always get the chance . Next thing you know they 'll have you collectin ' the minister 's salary . I believemyself , " she concluded with an appreciative look at her caller as she stood smiling under the old woodbine , " that it 's because folks ca n't refuse you what you ask for . There 's some that come here that I would n't stir up so much as a soda biscuit for , and that 's a fact . " Susan talked about Huldah Barrett at the supper table that evening . She 'd entered right into things , she told Reuben , and folks liked it . She sang in the church choir , played the organ for the opening exercises in the Sunday-school , and when the hymns were sung , did n't she come down from the organ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to handle for a year ? The scholars in the school liked her , too . Although she did n't put up with no nonsense , she made them feel to home with her somehow , went on picnics with them to the shore or the woods and called on their mothers and fathers . She was thirty years old , Susan said , and did n't make a secret of her age like some silly women . Susan had gathered that her mother was somewhat of a burden , one of the spleeny sort that had indigestion when she did n't have rheumaticks , was given to fussing about these new things called nerves , and was forever running to the drug-store for something or other . At church the next morning Reuben heard Huldah 's voice in the choir . He spotted it just as soon as the service began with the Doxology . It was a good voice , clear and true , and she sang as though she meant the words . He stayed to Sunday-school for the first time in the seven years since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister 's Bible Class to which he was assigned , he now and then glanced from the back of the church to the wing pews in front where Huldah was teaching her boys . They looked interested , he thought , and every once in a while they laughed at something she had said . Reuben could not recall ever having laughed in Sundayschoolwhen he was young like that , and he liked it . At seven o'clock he found himself in the vestry for the Sundaynight prayer-meeting . Here again Huldah was at the organ , pushing down the rasping pedals , arranging the white stops as she wanted them once she had glanced at the hymn to be sung . He might be mistaken in his memory , Reuben thought , as he walked homeward underthe hunter 's moon , but it did not seem to him that he had ever heard before such spirit in the singing . When he had boarded the Searsport next morning and stood in the pilot-house edging her out from the wharf , making a close , safe circle of the harbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow a new interestflooding his life . He was almost unreasonably happy there in the autumn sunlight , watching the blue water part before his sharp prow , seeing the reds and yellows of maples and beeches and birches fire the high shores of the islands and headlands , feeling against his face the cold freshness of the October air . By noon , although the sun would still be shining , a haze would soften the now distinct outlines of rock-strewn points and white lighthouses , buoys , islands , and passing vessels . He loved the way that purple haze of autumn afternoons deepened and dimmed the shores and the sea , making thep307atmosphere drowsy , even slumbrous , urging upon a man time and desire to think and to take pleasure in his thought . Reuben 's courtship of Huldah Barrett was for a long time only in his mind . Except for the stout certainty of Susan and the active memory of his grandmother , women had heretofore played no part at all in his life . But now that Huldah had come into his thoughts , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a shadowy and quite satisfying wood , he had come suddenly and without warning into the full sunlightof a summer field . He was glad that he had chosen to stay by the coast instead of steaming from Rockland to Boston and back again . He even saw at times in his decisionthe workings of some benevolent Chance . For now he was at home every Sunday , as well as alternate nights during the week , at least until the winter ice took his boat off her course . It was months before he saw anything at all of Huldah beyond her presence at church , and she would have been startled enough had she known the part she was already playing in his life . It was not , in fact , until June after their meeting in October that he became so bold as to call upon her . Searching about for some reason or excuse which might explain his coming to the old Stevens ' house , he discovered in a shop in Rockland a set of excellent photographs of some of the Maine lighthouses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great shaft of Petit-Manan shadowy in thick weather , the lonely outpost of Saddleback Ledge , Matinicus Rock deep in January snow , the windblown spruces of Heron Neck , black behind its white tower . He selected eight of these and had them mounted on sheets of white cardboard . They would look well on the walls of her schoolroom . It was not at all a bad idea , he hoped she would think , to familiarize Maine children with their own coast . When he came home one clear June evening and smelled the lilacs long before he had reached the house , he felt such an unwonted excitement within him that , quite contrary to his expectation , he showed Susan straight away the contents of the great package under his arm . He unpacked the pictures in the sitting-room and had them arranged on the white mantel above the fireplacebefore he called her in to see . " For land sakes ! " cried Susan , standing in her ginghamapron with her stout red hands on her broad hips . " Are you goin ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Reuben , surprised that he felt no more ill at ease than he did before Susan 's stares , " I thought I 'd give them to Miss Barrett for her schoolroom , that is , if you think she 'd like to have them . " He felt Susan 's keen glance upon him and felt also at that moment the quick blood flooding his face and neck . " Well , I never ! " cried Susan again . " I snum , I never did ! " He knew Susan . He knew at once that she was pleased by his gift to Huldah . So was Huldah herself . Reuben sat on in the Barrett sitting-room for an hour with Hul/dah after he had presented his pictures with explanations of how he thought they might interest her children at school . " I think it 's a wonderful thing to know the world , " he said , as he stood again before the pictures now on Huldah'smantel , " and I 've often wished I could . But if you ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing to know the state you live in and a coast like this . " Huldah was direct and frank with Reuben in her delightover his gift . She should choose her favourite she said  --  she thought it was Petit-Manan , but she would have to sleep on it  --  and keep it on her desk in her own room there at home . It would help no end when she was correcting examples in cube root , which she thought the worst and most senseless exercise in all Greenleaf 's arithmetic . Now that he had opened the way and had not been repulsed , Reuben spent every Saturday evening with Huldah and saw her home from prayer-meeting on Sundaynights as well . The village began early to accept their keeping company and to talk about it with generous approbation , overlooking even the discrepancy in age . Reuben Crockett had never looked at any one else in all his life , and now that he had , it was a good thing , might loosen him up a bit and make him more like other folks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Saturday Cove for years , with ideas and standards that were fast slipping in a changing age . She was one in a thousand , and any man who could get her might count himself fortunate . Reuben 's entrance into her life was not without diffi- culties although the difficulties were a hundredfold outweighedby the compensations . Huldah 's mother was not by nature a buoyant woman . She harboured , indeed nourished many ills both of the flesh and of the spirit , and she found occasion to speak of them during the hours that Reuben and Huldah spent playing with her the new game of flinch . Moreover , she looked warily upon Reuben'sinvasion of her life with her daughter , a life which she had until now assumed was to be entirely her own . She had a way of making them both uncomfortable in her presence , which resulted , once she was absent , in an extremesense of comfort one in the other . Long before Reuben had told Huldah that he loved and wanted her , he had told her everything else he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Week by week he poured this flood upon her , unable to resist her interest , sympathy , and understanding in the eager questions and rejoinders by which she led him to talk about himself . Going home at night , walking rapidly in a peculiar sense of both physical and mental freedom , he would sometimes stop suddenly , find himself looking at himself as at another person , and wonder almost with panic in his throat at the things he had told to Huldah , intimatethings about his thoughts and beliefs , his loves and aversions , confidences of his pride in his family and of the things he had longed to do and could not because of the changed and changing times , certain deprivations of his childhood which he was only now beginning to realize , old sufferings , new joys . Huldah was one of the relatively few persons in this world who find life by giving it away , wholly and une/quivocally . Upon her and others like her is the gospel paradox built and fulfilled . Whatever she received came flowing back , begotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not have to wait many days for her bread cast upon the waters . She was an example , people said , to the young and undecided at the seasons of revival still held at the turn of the century , of the power of God and His grace in a human heart . This was undoubtedlytrue , although it was also true that God could not always find such a receptacle for His grace as was I uldah . Nor must Huldah struggle with misgivings for that grace , nor seize upon it like Jacob wrestling with the angel , as is the fate of some upon the long search for God . She had apparently in some mysterious way possessedit from the beginning , pressed down and running over . She loved God , at least partly because superabundantlove was natural to her ; and thus far in her somewhatcircumscribed life love for Him had not been renderedunnecessary , neglected because of other loves . When Reuben came in Huldah 's thirty-first year , the necessity for God was well-established within her . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and hours and minutes , she found much of her love for him in her love for God , and her love of God in him . But she did not recognize the new and mutual dependence of these loves , one upon the other , and would have been genuinely puzzled at any such suggestion , which in her time and place and by the peoplewhom she knew was never even surmised . Reuben felt sure that Huldah could not have been surprised when , after he had told her everything else inp312his world , he got around to telling her of his love . Nor was she . Nor was either of them unduly distressed over the apparent necessity of waiting for each other . They could wait more easily upon the certainty of a few untrammelledhours each week together than they could face the certainty of more trammelled hours with Susan and Huldah 's mother to reckon with . Susan alone presented no problem ; it was Huldah 's mother who was the stumblingblock . Susan was not drawn toward Mrs. Barrett . She had small patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessiveattitude toward her daughter . Susan would have " put up " with Mrs. Barrett ; she told Master Reuben so every Sunday after 1903 ; but Reuben knew that Susan 's " putting up " would be no flexible process if the four of them ever lost their common sense sufficiently to enter upon life together under one roof . And Reuben himself was frightened of innovations . He wanted his home as Susan had kept it and as Huldah and Susan could keep it together , not as Huldah 's mother could and unquestionablywould turn it topsy-turvey . When all the trying realities of the whole matter had been once faced for good and all , as was Reuben 's way , he and Huldah entered upon one of those long courtships of which most rural villages in New England and elsewherebear record . By the time four years had gone by , Saturday Cove ceased talking about it  --  the pity that two persons , one of whom was already in advanced years for marriage , could not spend their lives together , the once-persistent query as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so against him to seekp313elsewhere , the almost certain conjectures that unless time intervened and that hastily , the Crockett name was doomed to cessation with the death of Reuben . Perhaps , indeed , Saturday Cove had been more anxiousover their long-deferred marriage than were either Reuben or Huldah . As for Reuben , the very creation of love in his life was so overwhelming a thing that he could wait more patiently than most for its consummation . He could never become entirely accustomed to the way it heightened perceptions and experiences , forever bringing to shining points what before had been flat surfaces  --  thebirds in spring when he left the house early to rejoin his boat , sure that Huldah would be at her door to say goodbye , the rugged outlines of the coast , his new understanding of the lives of the men with whom he worked , even the blessing of rainy days which seemed to him to halt time and give him a chance to live over his new life in his mind . Now the most concrete and repeatedhappenings put an edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , things such as selecting with Huldah the evening hymns for church and , after church was over , staying behind with her to close the wheezy organ , pile the hymn books neatly , turn out the hanging lamps , and see that the old stove was safe . At Huldah 's suggestion Reuben became the new superintendentof the Sunday-school in 1904 . He still retainedenough of his old life to be surprised at the way he stood before the school , gave out the hymns for Huldahto play , and even made a few remarks of his own about the lesson to be taught in the various classes . These things now in his new freedom seemed natural and easy ; and when in church he heard the minister read the morninglesson from the Psalms , Bring my soul out of prison that I may praise Thy name , he knew precisely what the words meant and understood that he now had no need to make the prayer . Time as always kept its own counsel ; but it was far kinder than anyone had ventured to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the most sanguine had been lotting on when Mrs. Barrett 's daily prophecy at length was fulfilled and she died suddenly at only sixty-seven from what she had always considered the least of a score of ailments . Reuben and Huldah waited six months to marry , though no one in Saturday Cove would have had a word to say had they not waited a week . In view of six years , however , six months seemed as nothing . They were married in the church , largely because they both had a rooted feeling therein , partly because Reuben had a tenacious desire to follow , in so far as it could be managed , the way of those preceding him . The wedding was held late one Saturday afternoon in October after the boys of Huldah 's Sunday-school class had swept the woods all the morning for autumn leaves , and at the close of a long day during which Reuben had been declared incapable with many guffaws by the officers and crew ofp315his boat and allowed only to walk about the deck and watch the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of Captain Crockett 's boat came to his wedding , from the first officer to the meanest freight-trundler , marching solidly up the aisle , bronzed and shaved and scrubbed in their blue clothes . Huldah said she would always remember them , standing in the left-hand front pews at respectful attention . She had always known in her heart that Reuben 's men had a feeling for him , akin to part of her own , and she needed no other proof . They gave Huldah and Reuben a silver soup tureen and a twenty-dollar gold piece and arranged besidesfor a week 's wedding trip for Captain and Mrs. Crockett , fully paid for . Susan stood by herself in the front pew on the right , her black alpaca freshened up by a gift of white gloves from Master Reuben . Behind her the church was thronged by the village at large . And although Huldah 's dark blue mohair had been fashioned by her own fingers and her hat selected from drummers ' samples at the local milliner 's , although there was not the sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch at the close of the service , it is safe to say that no Crockett and his bride , even in the old days , had ever received such manifold good wishes , genuine , superabundant , overflowing.  |p319DURING  the short year that she lived with Huldah Crockett in the old house Susan was far more a friend than a servant . She loved Huldah as she had loved no one in her seventy-three years save Solace and Master Reuben . Huldah had a way of relying upon Susan which carried with it a kind indisposition to change any of Susan 's long-established ways . When she and Reuben had returned from their week in Boston and settled in for their life together , Huldah took instant and carefulnote of the kitchen and pantry , the manner in which Susan stretched her dishcloth across the bottom of the agate pan , spread her drying-towels in the sun , and stood her scalded milk-pans against the well-curb . Within a day she had ascertained what stood on what shelves and in what order . She learned at what time Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of an hour from her steady course ; and she had the sense to see that any suggestion of innovation in time or in method would not only disturb the even tenor of Susan 's way , but would strike cruelly at the very roots of Susan 's life itself . Susan did not know how any man could have done better for himself than Master Reuben had done . On nights when she could not sleep because she felt heavy and uncomfortable in her insides , she lay in her bed and thought how well he had done , waiting there in the darkness for the morning , which was sure to hold a new excitement for her . Huldah might want Susan to dictate some new recipes while she wrote them down on some cards , which she was collecting in a wooden box almost precisely like the new-fangled catalogue recently acquiredby the Ladies ' Social Library . Since Susan knew so well the places of the books she liked that she could put her hands on them in the dark , she could not at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchaseof which she had reluctantly given a quarter of a dollar ; but once Huldah had begun to collect recipes in a similar receptacle , arranging her cards under neat letters , C for cakes , P for pies , and M for muffins , Susan found herself , when she went for her books on Saturday , congratulating the librarian on being up-to-date . Huldah might want her skeins of wool held for winding or even offer to hold Susan 's for her ; she might have dropped a stitch in her knitting and want Susan to pick it up for her ; she might want Susan to help her spread a pattern on the dining-room table , pinning it carefully to the cloth and figuring out the most economical way of cutting . Or she might at ten o'clock , when Susan invariably sat down by the window in the kitchen for a free hour before eleven o'clock should start the dinner , come to ask Susan 's advice about soliciting for a church supper or to find out exactly what she thought as to the wisdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once dinner was over and the afternoon wasp321ahead , she might even suggest that Susan bring her sewingto the sitting-room . Susan took Huldah one morning to the Crockett attic where sea-chests filled with log-books , trunks filled with clothes , and an old table piled with the plans of Thomas Winship 's meeting-houses stood in order among numberlessodds and ends of everything under the sun beneath the brown , unfinished beams and rafters . They went through them together so that Huldah might know precisely what was there and , in so far as Susan knew , what the things meant and to whom they had belonged . There were many things that Susan knew nothing at all about , things which Solace Crockett had never shown her . There was in one trunk what had quite apparentlybeen a wedding outfit of white muslin and satin , merino and leghorn , gown and hat , cape and shoes . " Muslin keeps like nothin ' at all , " Susan had said , showing Huldah the ravelled slits in the creases of the shirred and puffed sleeves . There were shawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers twenty years back . They were beautiful shawls , obviously of some foreign make with tails of dragons and strange birds forming their coloured fringe , one shawl in dull blue , two in black . Solace Crockett had once imagined them placed on exhibitionin the old Winship house . " These must have been taken out not so long ago an ' done up fresh , " said Susan . " The papers say only 1889 , but for the life o ' me I ca n't call to mind when ' t was . I 'm sure I never saw them before . But there , old Mis ' Crockett was forever putterin ' round up here , spite o '  |p322me  . They 're likely enough hers , or maybe they go fartherback . Wool 's not like muslin , an ' these seem sound except for thinnin ' a bit in the folds . Yes , it 's likely they belonged to Solace Crockett in the days when her husband sailed the seas an ' her herself for that matter . " " Solace is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl . Susan agreed with her . " It 's better than some they have nowadays , an ' that 's a fact , " she said . " Gladys an ' Sylvia , an ' such like . An ' in this case the name fitted . Mis ' Solace Crockett could n't ha ' been a better woman . I used to often tell Master Reuben that whatever he lacked in a mother , or in a father for that matter , was made up to him in her . " " What was Reuben 's great-grandmother 's name on the Crockett side ? I do n't think I 've ever heard him say . He talks about the men of the family , but except for his grandmother he does n't say much about the women . " " Men do n't , " said Susan . " Now what was her name ? I snum I 've forgotten , though Lord knows I knew , same as gospel . She was old when I come to this village . She outlived Master Reuben 's grandfather who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , now I mind . ' T was Abigail . That 's what ' t was , but it 's about as far back as I can remember , bein ' more or less a stranger here till I was past twenty-five myself . " " That 's a good name , too . Abigail . " " Well , it 's not so fluttery as some , an ' it comes fromp323the Bible somewhere , do n't it ? At the minute I ca n't say where . " " Abigail ? " said Huldah reflectively . " Why , yes , Susan . She was the one that got a lunch for King David when her husband Nabal had refused him . " Susan was refolding the shawls in fresh papers . " That do n't surprise me a mite , " she observed . " Women are always feedin ' men folks , in those old days as now . " It was a good , warm feeling , Susan thought , to find oneself thus necessary to another and younger woman , quite different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Susan , trying to straighten it out in her own mind , expected women to do things for them , took them and their work for granted without so much as even realizing the extent of their labour and sacrifice . They could not help it ; it was the way they were made , God help them ! It was a new and thrilling experience for Susan to feel herself of value to Huldah , to know that she was understood and appreciated . She and Iluldah within even a few months grew to have little secrets between them , women 's secrets from which even Reuben was shut out . Sometimes the secrets had to do with Reuben himself . For instance , Susan and Huldah decided in solemn conferencethat Reuben was eating far too much pastry for his own good . Susan had been just on the point of proposinga change in desserts herself , she said , when Huldahconsulted her about the matter ; cup custards , Spanishcream , and baked Indian pudding were far more wholesome as occasional variants from the apple pie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally for men ; and they laid their plans straightway for the food which should be set before the unsuspecting Reuben on Sundays and on his nights at home . Susan took untold comfort , not only in Huldah 's prime housekeeping but in the knowledge that she thought and felt as Susan did about most things . Young as Huldah was , and she seemed young to Susan , she had her feet firmly planted and moving in the right way . She was not misled or bamboozled , said Susan , into thinking that all the new rinktums now coming into this world would make folks happier or better . When Reuben in a recklessmoment proposed having a telephone installed from the wires on the main road and Susan was wondering how she could ever endure the sudden , unexpected ringingof a bell through the house , it was Huldah who , with a quick glance at Susan 's face , said it was not only unnecessarybut useless . Huldah felt precisely as Susan did about the automobiles which were beginning to penetrate the coast , coming even to Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no pleasure in driving any more along the country roads when you were in constant terror lest the brow of a quiet hill should suddenly beetle with a great black object chugging toward one and emitting a vile smell . It had gotten so that you could not depend upon even an afternoon'sdrive without the probability of meeting one at least ; in fact , you must drive with your left hand , keepingyour right unimpaired and ready to wave it violently as a signal for the driver of the automobile to jam hisp325unwieldy brakes and stop his treacherous vehicle before your horse should bound in frenzy into the wayside ditch . Huldah agreed with Susan , too , about the enormityof charging fifteen cents for a church supper of beans and brown bread which had heretofore always been free as salvation . " It 's an outrage ! " cried Susan , chopping the vegetablehash with fury in her wooden chopping tray . " That 's what it is , an ' mark my words , no good will come of it . An ' with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks to stir up cakes an ' finger pastry out o ' their own pockets an ' then expect ' em to hand over fifteencents for what they 're puttin ' in their own insides . Used to be that church suppers was one big family with folks gatherin ' in the vestry , all feelin ' friendly an ' to home . Now it 's so everybody can come , Methodists an ' heathen alike , an ' there ai n't the feelin ' there used to be . Money 's the root of all evil , as the Bible well says , an ' the search for it 'll be the ruination of the church , if you ask me . " Susan went to the village now only on alternate Saturdayafternoons . She looked forward to these excursionslargely because she knew that Huldah would lend a listening and sympathetic ear upon her return . The village , she said , was not what it once was . In summer it was messed up with people who did n't belong to it , who sat languidly in surreys driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks out of their way at the post-office window and in the village ; in the winter it was filled with those that had nothing to do but speculate about their neighbours and listen to talk/ing-machines which the whole world was going mad over . Susan 's moral character in the winter of 1909 through no fault of her own suffered deterioration , not to say debasement from one of these devices for the promulgationof unworthy thoughts . She had entered the dry goods store , she told Huldah , for the innocent purchase of hooks and eyes and a spool of white thread , number 50 , when , having to await her turn , her ears had been assailed by a song , the like of which she had never heard before and prayed God fervently she might never hear again . The phonograph was sounding its blatant voice in a room at the rear and was obviously delighting some young listeners if one could judge from the squeals of laughter sounding even through the closed door . Susan had stood as though frozen to the spot , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the worst . The words , she told Huldah upon her return home , had lodged themselves in her mind for good and all , repugnant as they were to her , and the unwelcome tune kept running in her head . She had even found herself singing the cheap and horrid song as she ascended the hill : Will someone kindly tell me ? Will someone answer why ? To me it is a riddle , And it will be till I die . A million peaches round me , And I should like to knowWhy I picked a lemon in the garden of love Where they say only peaches grow ?  |p327If  such things could lodge themselves thus securely in her old mind , asked Susan of Huldah , what effect must they have upon the young ? Not that for one moment she was suggesting that love songs did not have their place , but why wallow in such unrefined music and thought and language when there were still to be sung , " When You and I Were Young , Maggie , " or " Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about the young in other ways , also ; at least she took pleasure in dislodging her anxiety concerningthem . She heard from all sides , she said , that the academy had fallen a prey to new ways and ideas . Not that the people who told her seemed overly concerned , but as for Susan herself she believed that the old had a responsibility toward the young . She understood , she told Huldah , that the scholars in the academy were rebelling against the studies they had always taken as a matter of course in Master Reuben 's day and in his father 's . Many of them did not want Greek and Latin any more or debating or reciting orations and poems on Friday afternoons , practices which , Susan had always assumed , were the mark of young ladies and gentlemen bent on making something of themselves in a world that sorely needed them . They were even tiring of spelling-bees . Instead they were wasting their time on publishing a school magazine , and even the girls were tearing about in indecent clothes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and playing games at one another 's homes until ten o'clock on Saturdayevenings as had been the order in Master Reuben'stime . In place of these they danced until mid- night in the village hall at least once every month with few to raise so much as an eyebrow at such goings-on . As a result , which anyone with any sense might see , human nature being what it was , there were things happeningeven to nice young girls which had never happened in her day , say what anyone would . Susan guessed she knew her own time and how decent young folks had always acted . She hinted these things darkly to Huldah as they sat over their sewing on Reuben 's nights away ; and Huldah at her side of the center-table beneath the lamp , even while she herself hoped that Reuben was remembering his winter underwear and taking care of his cold , knew that Susan was deeply enjoying her forebodingsand the reception of them in a friendly ear . There was something both satisfying and touching to Huldah as well as to Reuben in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew , in her condemnationsand prophecies , finding ease in her uneasiness , tranquillity in her agitation . Times might be changing and , perhaps , for the worse , but Susan 's days were fulfilling themselves and her care and labour receivingits just reward . And when in the late spring of 1910 she learned that a child was coming to Huldah and Reuben and that her hands were needed to make ready for it , her ways became more than ever the ways of pleasantness and her paths those of peace . Nor did she worry overmuch about Huldah as she might well have done . To Susan the very contentment of Reuben and Huldah was proof against misfortune and disaster . They lived in such mutual dependence , received each day with such quiet pleasure in its begin/ning and middle and end , so clearly were asking for nothing of life except life itself , that Susan found herself also taking small thought for their morrow . She never saw the baby . She died quietly one August afternoon when she had been out in the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in her chair by the kitchen table , leaning over heavily upon it , her face and even her body strangely twisted out of shape . She ran to look for someone to send for the doctor and met Reuben coming up the driveway from the steamboat wharf . Susan was almost gone when they reached the kitchen . She could hardly speak , but they gathered that she would have told them something had she been able about someone named Joshua and about the baby . " I 'm trying to figure out about this Joshua , " said Reuben in his slow way when Huldah came to sit beside him that evening on the porch . " I do n't remember of her ever mentioning him before , and I 'm sure her brothers were n't named that . I hate to think that there 's anything she wanted done that we ca n't do . She 's done so much for me all my life . " The August evening was cool and still with an early reminder of autumn in its shortened twilight and its clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crickets and katydids , not as sometimes in a shrill , uninterrupted resonance but rather in high , monotonous tones that doubled back upon themselves , not separated and yet separable like the steady and yet intermittent pulsation of small , sharp saws pushed to and fro in wood.  | " They say , " observed Reuben , drawing his chair closer to Huldah 's and taking her hand in his , " they say that when the crickets sing that way , not steady like , it means an early and a cold winter . " She returned the pressure of his hand . " I do n't care , " she said , " early and cold , late and warm , it does n't matter . Weather never matters now , dear , except for you , and I do n't believe you mind either . Nothing matters except us together and all we have . I ca n't even be sorry about Susan . I 'm glad . It 's just as it ought to be . I like to think of her lying in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it . She said just this morning when she 'd finished the parlour , Well , it 's done now for another week , ready for a wedding or a funeral or whatever else the good Lord sees fit to send us . ' I ca n't help thinking He sent exactly what He wanted , and if that 's so , then we ca n't do anything else but take it and be glad . " It was Huldah who an hour afterward thought of the Family Bible . She told Reuben later that she rememberedSusan 's peering into it from time to time and looking ill at ease when she was discovered . When they had taken it from the shelf beneath the table in the front parlour , they found Susan 's money in a sealed white envelope which had obviously been changed from month to month . There were five hundred dollars in large bills within the envelope . Now that they had found it , lying against the words of the Lord to the son of Nun , words encouraging him to be strong and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they understood to whom Susan inp331her last months upon this earth had wished it to be given . Whether or not the crickets and katydids kept some infinitesimal finger on the pulse-beats of the cosmos and knew what they knew , the winter that year came early . After sharp October rains the leaves lost their unattained glory and fell in premature millions before high bitter winds . Huldah grew accustomed to sullen November skies long before November had come and Reuben to reaches of sullen , indifferent water . Early frosts denied the marigolds their last tenacious blooming , bright against their fading green in the bare garden . True to her assertion , Huldah was careless of the weather . She always felt surprised when upon walking to the village she heard people complaining about it , and more surprised when it was borne in upon her that most of their irritation over it was because of her . They kept thinking of her , they told her , alone so much of the time in that great house way off there and in a conditionwhere she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them said there was not a night when Reuben was lying over in Rockland that they did not look for her light , glowing out there beyond the fields , before they went to bed . When they said these things , even before she could thank them for their concern , she felt the almost pathetic unreality of their solicitude , a reality , of course , to them , to her in the new completeness of her life , unsubstantial , without foundation or form . Their worry , to which she could give no harbourage or even welcome , went fluttering through some void , dissolvingat last into air . The thoughts which they sent to her at night , when they turned down their lamp wicks and stared through their darkened panes toward the old Crockett house , were like tiny pebbles thrown against her window , repulsed , powerless to arouse her from the deep , all-embracing security in which she lived . She rejoiced in the short days . Callers were not so likely to come when lamps must be lighted early , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of supper though it was nearly two hours off . In the evenings when Reuben was not at home she thought of him , inexhaustible hours of thinking above her sewing or knitting in the front parlour where she had taken to sitting on the nights when she was alone . She liked it there . She felt as though she were slowly becoming acquainted with the Crockett men , knowing Reuben through them and them through Reuben . Sometimes she had the odd sensation there in the parlourof their patronizing her a bit in that she came from more simple beginnings and had seen relatively nothing of the world which they had known so intimately . She felt half-relieved that there were no portraits on the wall of their wives . These she studied from daguerreotypeson the what-not and from pictures in the albumwhere from their very position on her lap they made her feel less humble . She tried in vain to dis/cover Reuben 's features in the portraits looking so steadily at her . He did not look like his ancestors ; except for his eyes she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spark and the humour of those of Amos and Benjamin and James . They were handsomer men than Reuben , that she must unwillingly admit , loving him all the more because he did not have their obvious masterfulness , urbanity , and charm . Nevertheless , she doubted if they had had many of the things that satisfied her most in him . Reuben rarely spoke of his mother , whom she had never seen , and she doubted also if he favoured her and her family . All in all , she concluded , Reuben had been specially made with his own special ways and virtues ; and he did not need either voyages to China and Australia to bring them out or a portrait painter in London or New York to record them . She could not get enough of thinking about Reuben . Sometimes she reproved herself for not reading more , keeping up with things , she thought , in the papers and magazines which she could easily get from the library . But now that the baby was but two months away , thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she read infrequently about profoundmatters like Canadian Reciprocity and the protectivetariff , about strange ideas termed the initiative and referendum and recall , about the unrest in Russia where the common people seemed to think they were not getting their rights , such information was always eluding her or she eluding it . Before Reuben had come into her life , she would have grown pale with horrifiedp334indignation over the undignified and unprecedented goings-on of certain women who were actually trumpingup absurd reasons why they and the others of their sex should have a vote like men . Neither such disgustingbehaviour nor such cataclysmic demands now sat heavily upon her . Indeed , she could not seem to hold any of these things before her mind , try as she sometimes did . It was far easier and more satisfying to think of Reuben or perhaps not so much to think about him as to know the certainty of his love , to sit within the enfolding security of his presence . On the days when he was due at home there was always the long making ready for his coming : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him in the morning baking ; the fresh laying of the table for supper with the exciting question as to which china to choose from the wealth in the old cupboard ; the scrutinyof her work-basket so that it might not occasion hunting for this and that when he was once in his chair and wanted her in hers ; the concentrated watching for his boat when three o'clock drew near . First , the brown smoke staining the distant horizon , then the indistinct mound of grayish-white as though the sky itself had suddenly protruded just above the sea , the change from solidity and thickness to length and width , the slow taking shape of prow and pilot-house and smokestack , and at last the clear outlines of the boat , cutting the gray water below the brooding sky and the circling gulls . Their evenings wanted for nothing . Even their desultorytalk of unimportant things , the wind kicking upp335Fox Island thoroughfare , the new ways Huldah had found of disguising the taste of the milk which she hated , added to their sense of bounteous life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day had been long and cold with a high wind blowing up his nostrils , he told Huldah , and beating out his very breath , Reubentook pleasure in falling asleep in his chair at eight o'clock .
