Believe or Not <P> Sirs : <P> Believe it or not , Robert L. Ripley , creator of the " Believe It or Not ' ' Series has just reached Sydney on the luxury liner Mariposa . <P> Ripley was delighted with Sydney Harbour . He was amazed to know that the Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of the biggest of its kind in the World . He was astonished when he saw the Laughing Jackass and found not a beast , but a bird that laughed at its own jokes . <P> He talked with Ornithologist A. H. Chisholm who told him about the Bower Bird , the bird which paints the inside of its nest . He was delighted with a luncheon which I hurriedly arranged , where he met Ministers of the State-men who were former speakers in the State House Assembly and the Federal Senate . <P> It took some persuasion to make him believe that some of the sheep out here wear shoes to protect their feet from the burrs . <P> All these things interested Ripley , but the thing that grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , were two copies of TIME that I gave him-the first he had seen in Sydney . <P> <P> GEORGE FITZPATRICK <P> Superintendent <P> New South Wales Community Hospital Sydney , Australia <P> " Ditched , Dammed &; Drained " <P> Sirs : <P> I read newspapers and periodicals every day of my life and I must say that I get information out of TIME which I find in no other publication . For instance the causes which led to Governor Roosevelt 's being a cripple ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . <P> I read in TIME where you said that Governor Murray of Oklahoma in a speech at Charlotte made use of an expression wherein Hoover was a great engineer for he had ditched , dammed and drained the whole country in the short time he has been president ( TIME , Feb. 29 ) . <P> The point is that Governor Murray used the expression as being original with him when it was to the contrary-and his audience did n't know any better . Since I read what Governor Murray had to say about Hoover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respects to the President in exactly the same words which Governor Murray used in his Charlotte speech . I do n't know that the speakers tried to convey the impression that they were the authors of this bit of sarcasm thrown at Mr. Hoover , but I can say that every time the expression was used it brought down the house . <P> On more than one occasion , TIME has furnished me with information which I was unable to procure from any other source and so I am asking you to print the name of the author of this most excellent piece of Democratic thunder and the occasion on which it was used . <P> <P> W. G. Cox <P> Burlington , N. C. <P> <P> Up rose in the Senate on Dec. 10 , 1930 Mississippi 's Democratic Pat Harrison , arch-baiter of the G. 0 . P. , to remark : ' ' For the last 18 months Herbert Hoover has shown that he has not only ditched the United States but he has drained the whole world . " The alliteration was later expanded but Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency . He took it from a constituent 's letter . The letter has been lost ; the constituent remains nameless. - ED . <P> Shanghai <P> Sirs :
