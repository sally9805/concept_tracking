txt Bethlehem Steel Corp . for 1931 is likely to report total income from.kiperating activities sufficient to cover interest charges , the usual liberal deduction for depreciation , depletion , etc .. and have a small balance left available for the 1,000,000 shares of 7% cumulative preferred stock . This will mean total income of between $21,500,000 and $22,000,000 for the year , allowing for the normal deductions mentioned . Such a showing will be in sharp contrast with those to be made by many other steel concerns which were unable to cover the normal deductions from results of operations last year . The general business depression , accompanied by a sharp falling off in demand for steel products , and lack of stability in the price structure , made 1931 a trying period for the entire steel industry . Bethlehem was able to weather the industrial storm in an impressive manner , without deviating from the conservative course which has been followed right along of making very liberal charges for depreciation and depletion . For the nine months ended September 30 , last , Bethlehem showed total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ** equal to 31.89 a share on the preferred stock . To obtain the results of the foregoing estimate , the total income for the final quarter must have been approximately $3,600 ; 000 , compared with $3,954 ; 960 in the three months end &; September 30 , last . Preferred Dividend Safe 70i/tile there is reason to doubt continuance of the quarterly dividend of 50 cents on the common stock , which was the rate ordered paid three and six months ago , there is no question in responsible quarters regarding the regular distribution of $1.75 on the preferred for the quarter when the directors meet for action Thursday . Rumors regarding the danger to the preferred dividend were circulated from time to time a month ago , but these were prompted by the decline which occurred in the stock when necessitous liquidation was in progress during the late months of 1931 . In April last year Bethlehem directors reduced the annual dividend rate on the common stock to $4 from $6 previously prevailing , by declaration of a , distribution of $1 for tbd quarter . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to 50 cents for the quarter , and this action was repeated in October , although at that time many were confident the dividend would be omitted . Due to the fact that there was further curtailment of production in the final three months last year , that price unsettlement continued , and that there has been only moderate improvement in steel activities since the beginning of 1932 , it is not unnatural that continuation of the 50-cent common dividend at this time is doubted . Financial Position Strong Bethlehem has been able to maintain a strong financial position despite the unsatisfactory conditions which existed last year , although there has been a substantial amount spent for capital investment to complete improvements and construction projects . There is not likely to be any drastic change in the cash holdings from the previous year , when the balance sheet figures are made public in about two months . Cash as of December 31 , 1930 , was $22,935,689 . It always has been the policy of the Bethlehem officials to write down whatever items are affected by existing conditions . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some loss in value of securities held will be suffered because of the declines which occurred late last year . This is the conservative policy to follow in accounting , and 1931 is not likely to prove an exception in this connection so far as Bethlehem is concerned . Plants in Good Condition Although Bethlehem , like other steel companies , was confronted with many problems during the past year , the plants and properties were kept in good physical shape , and the organization is in a position to take advantage of any moderate change for the better which may occur with some improvement in steel buying and consumption during the spring months and thereafter . Costs have been materially reduced as a result of the greatly increased efficiency , and the various economies which were put into effect by the management during the past year . While these could not be reflected accurately , during the period of low operations and reduced quotations , they will be influential factors in the recovery of earnings once the situation improves . For a number of years Bethlehem carried on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included rebuilding of plants , revamping mills , installing new and more efficient machinery , etc . But for this foresight by officials in the past , the year 1931 would have been a much more trying one for the corpora-1 tion . As it is Bethlehem now ranks with the leaders in manufacturing facilities , diversification of products and low costs .
