Voluptuous , invitational Mae West , public passion of 50 million movie-going males , had to do last week the one thing every middle-aged woman hates most to do : admit having reached her middle forties . And she had to admit the other one thing that Mae West least wished to admit : that she is married . <P> Her marriage was not entirely news to Mae West 's fans . Two years ago a female WPA researcher flipped a marriage card out of Milwaukee 's registry which attested the wedding of one Mae West to one Frank Wallace , April 11 , 1911 ( TIME , May 6 , 1935 ) . The Mae West then married was 18 , would today be 44 . Promptly Vaudeville Hoofer Frank Wallace popped up in Manhattan to boast that he was the man . But she would have none of him . " I 've gotten a lot of bunnies on Easter , " she retorted in her throatiest , breast-heaving contralto , " but this is the first time I 've ever received a husband . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinster and I 'm not 42 . I was practically a child in 1911 and I never was in Milwaukee until four years ago . They 'll have me married to triplets next ! Let this alleged Mr. Mae West c 'm ' up and see my lawyer sometime and prove it ! " <P> Last week in Superior Court in Los Angeles it was as obvious as Mae West 's best curves that Mr. Mae West had taken her advice . Even her most devoted fans chortled when they read that her now-admitted hoofer husband 's real name is not Wallace but Willities or Szatkus and that the Szatkus family always knew her as Mamie . " Mrs. Mamie Szatkus " was scarcely box-office for glamorous Mae West . <P> Lawyers pondered the possible legal harvest of Mr. Mae West 's suit . Under California law , property , except gifts , acquired by either husband or wife after marriage becomes community property , owned half &; half by either spouse . Mae West 's 1935 income was $480,000 . Her current worth , mostly acquired since the 1911 wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be tall , dark nor handsome but the inside of his head was apparently not as bald as the outside . He had said he wished to vindicate his honor , money was of secondary moment . Snorted Mrs. Szatkus last week , " We were married but we never lived together as man and wife . " Snorted Mr. Szatkus ' lawyer , " They offered us $30,000 to settle the case . . . . Mae West can have half of Wallace 's Szatkus ' possessions . . . . Next week we expect to apply for an injunction that will tie up all of Miss West 's property in California . " That his client 's share-Mae-West's-wealth movement might be halted by California 's community property law proviso that a separated wife 's earnings are her own was poohed by Mr. Szatkus ' Los Angeles lawyer who said the clause was discriminatory sex legislation and might be found unconstitutional .
