One morning last week the New Dealing Philadelphia Record front-paged two copyrighted stories which took up five of eight top-column positions . The story which the Record had first in Philadelphia ran under a three-column headline : PAINT MAKER GIVES 76 EMPLOYES $100,000 SO THEY CAN START YEAR FREE FROM DEBT , CALLS IT HIS CONTRIBUTION TO NEW DEAL . <P> The other story , which was no scoop , had a two-column head : WIDENERS ' $100,000 PARTY RIVALS GLITTER OF GILDED AGE ; MUSIC ALONE COSTS $10,000 . <P> Thus did Publisher Julius David Stern give texts for a sermon about " a $100,000 blowout for the cream of U. S. society . . . with all the gloss and gaiety of the careless , incredible , forgotten days before the Crash , " and James Harvey Gravell 's " way of showing his faith in the New Deal . " <P> Just as no expense was stinted to make the Peter Arrell Brown Widener II 's " Bubble Ball " Philadelphia 's party of the year , neither did the Record stint space to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectives and a fresh-painted picket fence , all details such as pink satin walls , pink lilies and pink soapsuds fountain in the swank Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. * Invidiously balanced against a paragraph pointing out that Peter Arrell Brown Widener II 's fortune was established by his grandfather , the Record reported that James Harvey Gravell started to make a rustproof paint preparation in 1914 with nothing but " a bucket , a broomstick and a good idea , " built up a $1,250,000 business with branches in Detroit and Walkerville , Ont . <P> Balanced against an assertion that 75% of the 1,100 Widener guests were not acquainted with their hosts , the Record related how Mr. Gravell talked to each &; every one of his employes at the main plant when he gave them checks to square their debts . All no American Chemical Paint Co. workers ( 76 at Ambler , 34 in other branch plants ) - whether they had debts or not-shared in the bonus handout . <P> First to be called into Mr. Gravell 's office last week was a truck driver . Ill at ease when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $6,500 mortgage were hard to meet . " Well , John , " Mr. Gravell said , " do n't worry about it . Here 's the $6,500 . Go pay off the mortgage . " Astonished , John mumbled his thanks , promised not to give away what the boss was doing . One after another Mr. Gravell watched his employes squirm , then gave them checks for doctor bills , past-due installments on radios , mortgages , or , if they were free from debt , a check for perhaps $200 or $300 . One worker , after receiving nearly $5,000 , turned on Mr. Gravell and shouted : " You 're a hell of a boss . I thought I was n't doing so well and was worried about losing my job , and now you do this . " Then he started crying . Paintmaker Gravell 's goodness was not his first . Employes said last week he had always given generous Christmas presents , had loaned them money to build homes or meet pressing bills . His nine women office workers swear by him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , also to and from lunch .
