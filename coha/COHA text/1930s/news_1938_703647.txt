txt Suffolk County has elected John F. Dowd its Sheriff  --  probably for the next 20 years  --  one of the most secure and comfortable public positions in Massachusetts . If Mr. Dowd continues the status quo at Charles Street Jail and the Court House , he has a job that provides him with $400,000 to expend each year at his discretion and for which he is answerable to no single superior ; he has 230 or more workers whom he can hire and fire at will ; he commands a powerful political machine by which sheriffs in the past have maintained themselves in office ; he will be superintendent of the new $5,000,000 Court House which is already nicknamed " Dowd 's Castle " ; and while he carries on as the County 's principal official , he will reside in a substantial house on Embankment Road which the County provides . This is the job of Sheriff as handed down to Mr. Dowd by longstanding custom . Whether the new Sheriff will adhere to this tradition is uncertain . However , on Mr. Dowd 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To tell of Sheriff Dowd 's plans requires first a description of his duties . Few private citizens have more than a vague idea what are these duties ; few lawyers arc willing to define with certainty the extent of his legal powers ; few officials at City Hall hazard a ruling as to the limit of a sheriff 's authority in arbitrary expenditure a County funds . Almost no one knOWs these things because the office of sheriff , one of he oldest in English history , has lost its place of prominence in the growth of complex government. , while yet retaining its broad and discretionary powers . The Sheriff has two main jobs : He has care and custody of County prisoners as keeper of the Charles Street Jail : and he is custodian of the Court House . ' As keeper of the jail , Mr. Dowd will have closer touch with the underworld of Boston , Revere and Chelsea , than any other public official - except the District Attorney . With the exception of criminal cases , the Sheriff of Suffolk County begins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omit He serves-writs and processes thereby bringing the defendant before the bar of justice : and when judgment has been declared he is entrusted , if the defendant is found guilty , with custody of the same . Seven deputies To assist him the sheriff has seven deputy sheriffs whom he arbitrarily appoints In the activities of these deputies lies much of sheriff 's political power . The group forms a clique that-is irs a position to do many favors supplementary to duty for influential friends . In the past it has been- composed of men with astute grasp of local affairs , men well acquainted with the public and private lives of leaders of many groups in the County . No one knows what a deputy sheriff is paid in Suffolk County except the treasurer-deputy , a bookkeeper and perhaps the Sheriff himself . Because there financial facts have always been veiled , it has been rumored on the street for years that the Sheriff takes a cut in these fees in addition to his regular salary The deputies receive no stipend ' or salary from ' the County but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided his home aid keep The seven have an office in the Court House and the bookkeeper sends out bills for legal services once a month . Only he and the treasurer-deputy know the total income of the group . A former deputy told this newsfiaper that in the year he served in this position he never knew what amount of money was collected and never knew what the treasurer might have'done with undistributed funds , if there were any . Told of this situation , Mr. Dowd was asked what he would do if he discovers the policy prevails today . Yearly Salary " I believe it would be more practical to the County , " Mr , Dowd answered , " If legislation could be en- ? acted whereby Deputy Sheriffs were placed on a yearly salary and the money collected from fees turned Into the . County treasury . " Asked whether he would merely approve such a stop , 01 ' would take the initiative to make this change , Mr. Dowd repli &l:; " There is a possibility that I may take the initiative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prised to tilimoAier that the actual amount of money taken in by the deputy sheriffs today is barely sufficient to provide them with a reasonable salary . Another change that Mr. Dowd may encourage as sheriff is the introduction of Civil Service to County employees . At present the County employs 303 workers , none of whom are under Civil Service and 231 of whom can be fired by the Sheriff at his ? will , These workers have no recourse to any other official . The remdinder , ' 12 court ofilgers , can not be dismissed arbitrarily by the Sheriff without approval of a majority of the County judges . This . County personnel , dependent . upon the whim of , one man for a - job ; ' creates the nucleus of an excellent political machine by which sheriffs in the past have remained hi ' office for two , three or even four tegns . Bearing in mind that a term is six yearn It is apparent why the position of sheriff is regarded as a life job . Well Service Sheriff Dowd states that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salary range between 1,000 and $2,000 which would embrace about 250 persons  --  should be protected by Civil Service . " Would yOU take the initiative in Seeking legislathin to provide Civil Service for your ' employees , " Mr ; Dowd Was then asked . ' Tho Sheriff replied that he would not . " Put if the matter Is placed before me , " he added , " I shall hav'e no objection . " There is irony in Mr. Dowd 's election as Sheriff for *at least two former familiar public figure4 --  Edward L : Dolan and ' J. Walter Quinn who served respectively as City Treasurer and chauffeur for James M , Curley in his last administration as Mayor . As a City Councilor , Mr. Dowd was the first to attack Dolan and Quinn when he broke the Mohawk Packing Company scandal in a speech in the Council , Mr. Dowd 'S charges were followed up by the Finance Commission in a sensational investigation . Messrs , Dolan and Quinn are now serving sentences in Charles Street Jail for contempt of court , an aftermath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Dolan and Quinn were likewise principal figuies Thus the man who first called the public 's attention to the activities of Dolan and Quinn and for which they ultimately went to the County Jail is today their jailer  --  Steriff John F. Dowd . Fight Against Curley Mr. Dowd 's fight against the Cur-fey regime gods back over a decade . ' As a young man John F. Dowd was a florist , serving a well-known Boston firm as errand boy . In 15 years he rose to become Shipper , salesman , decorator and buyer . Then he resigned to enter politics , accepting a secretaryship under Mayor Curley 's second administration . In 1925 he broke with Mayor Curley to run ' against the Curley candidate for the City Council in Ward 8 , Mr. Curley 's famous home ward . He was victorious and has won six re-elections , almost every time being bitterly opposed by Mr. Curley's1 henchmen . Political reporters attribute Mr Dowd 's success to constant hard work for his constituents . " My door has always been open , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , Boston boys and girls " is a winner . Today Sheriff Dowd pledges himself to continuing his " square deal . " He will not exercise dictatorial power over his employees so long as they give the County service . He promises that there shall be no More favorites at the Court House who In the past have worked but an hour a day . He vows that the dusty old building will be cleaned tip and kept clean so long as he is Sheriff . Three Men Dismissed Mr. Dowd disclosed today that three men under his jurisdiction have been discharged from the public payroll because they were not earning their pay . Declaring that he expects every man working for $10 per weh or less to give full service , Mr. powd revealed that of the three dis -- charged , two had been working one and one-half hours per night , and the other worked one day In three weeks . Sheriff Dowd also announced that the new Courthouse will be turned over to the Suffolk Cbunty Commissioners ? Dee . 1 , and that it will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
