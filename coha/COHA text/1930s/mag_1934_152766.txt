( for Charles ) Forbes , breezy little Scots business pundit , wrote : <P> " WANTED-a Napoleon of the Building Industry . <P> " America has had its Automobile King , Henry Ford ; its Oil King , John D. Rockefeller ... its Chewing Gum King , William Wrigley , Jr . ... its Coke King , Henry Clay Frick . <P> " America needs today another colossus , a superman , capable of giving every city and town and community in America attractive modern homes at lower prices than hitherto possible . <P> " If America could give birth to a man able to do for homebuilding what Henry Ford proved able to do for automobile building , he would find scope for eclipsing Ford in both fame and fortune .
