txt CHAPTER IV THE FOUNDATIONS OF PEACE STATESMANSHIP generally , in its approach to the question of international peace , has dealt with it almost exclusively as a problem of preventing war . This is to take too narrow and too shallow a view . The League of Nations is the instrument of Labour 's foreign policy : the Covenant and the Briand-Kellogg Pact are its basis . Putting an end to the arms race is its immediate objective . Progress towards disarmament is bound up with the League 's success in organizing the regime of equality and mutual aid within which lies security against war . But the peace of the world is not securely founded upon purely political measures of this character , The foundations of peace are moral , social , and economic , and Labour 's peace policy consequently looks to measures more fundamental than the devising of purely political safeguards against war . That is why there is an intimate connexion between Labour 's home and foreign policy . World planning and world control of international economic life both postulate and follow // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inevitable corollary to a national policy which aims at the creation of a Socialist community is an international policy which is directed towards the establishment of a Co-operative World Commonwealth . Such a policy is the only effective alternative to the arms race and the only basis for disarmament . British Labour would put this country 's influence , in its dealings with all other countries , behind a truly international policy , which will develop the League of Nations in the direction of world government . The problems of a world organized as a system of sovereign States are not primarily problems of political relationships , but those arising from the conflict of private economic interests , the industrial and commercial competition between countries arising out of the desire for monopoly markets or sources of raw materials and aggravated by different social standards and different conceptions of social justice . A foreign policy which concerns itself exclusively with the political relationships of sovereign States and takes no account of the causes of economic conflict can not be called an effective policy , nor can it build a collective peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of organizing the world for peace , it is too often forgotten that the Peace Conference linked with the League of Nations the International Labour Organization , and that the constitution of the latter body // explicitly declares that peace , which the League of Nations will seek to establish , must be based on social justice , and that there are in the world conditions of labour which involve such injustice , hardship and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are imperilled . ' British Labour agrees with this analysis . But we contend ? and the post-war history of the world has emphasized and reinforced our contention ? that the only way of establishing social justice is to replace the system of production for profit by a system of production for the use of the community . We hold it to be proved that the conditions resulting from the profit-making system of production not only give rise to social injustices and social inequalities that imperil peace , but also breed vested interests whose scramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of war . As long as economic enterprise is dominated by the profit-seeking motive the peace of nations will remain in jeopardy . Under the stimulus of this motive almost every country 's economic policy is assuming a nationalist and militarist character . International co-operation in the economic sphere has practically ceased : foreign trade is regulated , by means of tariffs , quotas , and licences , with the object of making the country independent , as far as this is possible , of other countries , and to strengthen its economic position // at their expense . Economic nationalism , as it is called , is quite plainly a policy of national defence . The measures this policy dictates are precisely those which would be adopted by countries that expect to be involved in war . And they are measures which , like armaments , enormously increase the risks they are intended to avert . Hence the imperative need for a drastic change in the economic system if peace is to be made secure . The international policy of Labour is in sharp contrast to these tendencies towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-defence . We challenge both the domestic and the foreign application of the doctrine of economic nationalism . In home policy it has led to highly questionable developments of the principles of national planning in regard to market control , regulation of imports , and largescale subsidization of industries and services , with no accompanying developments in the direction of public ownership or democratic organization of the industries and services which are receiving direct and indirect financial assistance from the State . In its application to other countries it has indisputably increased the tension of international relationships and has intensified the economic antagonisms and the financial and commercial difficulties which tempt governments to seek a solution in war . British Labour offers as an alternative the // solution embodied in its policy for both domestic and world affairs , as it is profoundly convinced that this is the only effective way , not merely of preventing war , but of laying the foundations of universal and enduring peace . That is , a peace that is more than an armed truce or a precarious and uneasy equipoise of militarized States ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of international co-operation will afford . The economic and social programme which constitutes Labour 's home policy is an essential instrument of our peace policy . On the one hand , the measures of economic and social reconstruction we propose lay the axe at the roots of war ; on the other hand , they can not be fully carried out nor finally consolidated except by world action . We are committed to far-reaching measures of international cooperation to render practicable and secure our economic and social policy at home , and in order to lay the social and economic foundations of peace . What does international co-operation mean ? As we conceive it , it means utilizing to the fullest extent the entire machinery and resources of the League ? its economic , financial , transit and health organizations , and the International Labour Organization . Just as at home we shall endeavour to bring under control the whole economic life of the country , so in international policy we shall strive for world planning , world action , and world control in economic and // financial matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications , hours of labour and conditions of employment , public health and every other matter of common international concern . By a series of bold practical measures we must move towards the goal of a Co-operative World Commonwealth . They will strengthen the foundations of Socialism . But these are also the foundations of peace . In the degree in which we can succeed in socializing the economic activities of mankind we shall diminish the risks of war . In doing this we shall be acting upon the principles and following the indications of the Covenant of the League , and employing for its declared purpose the machinery of the League and the International Labour Organization . If we show at the same time that the triumph of Socialism is the only way to ensure world peace , we do no more than prove what the common sense of mankind already recognizes : even to wage war in the modern world , as experience has shown , nations must resort to the organization of their material resources on socialistic lines , suspending for the duration ' the principles and practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to invoke Socialist principles if we would organize the world for peace , or even if we would emerge from the economic depression and put a stop to the arms race . In some fields such as public health , the suppression of social evils , transport and // communications and kindred questions , the lines of great future developments are already clear . In particular , broadcasting and civil aviation will play an important part in bettering international relations by bringing the peoples of widely separated nations into closer contact and by promoting better understanding and more unity of purpose among the nations as a whole . Labour will therefore endeavour to free these great new public services from the shackles which nationalism and militarism would lay upon them . It will likewise seek to promote every useful form of economic and financial co-operation . The frenzied and mutually contradictory measures which economic nationalism has dictated to governments that are striving to protect their peoples from the effects of the world crisis have only served to make the crisis worse . It is the declared purpose of ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , and thus to enable us to stabilize by international agreement both the value of money and ( consequently ) the rates of foreign exchange ; to supervise and control , with the aid of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations and a reformed Bank of International Settlements , the export of capital and the raising of international loans ; and to restart the flow of international trade now clogged and misdirected by tariffs and other governmental restrictions and regulations . Labour will not seek to re-establish the old laisser-faire system // which capitalism , in its expanding phase , found convenient , but will work for the all-round lowering of tariff barriers and the substitution for these of a system of planned international exchange of goods and services which will mutually benefit workers and consumers in all countries . Such a policy would enable every country to enjoy its full share of the material abundance the world 's productive system can now provide . It is in this direction that we must move to increase the volume of international trade , and by bold Socialist measures at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , we can stimulate and expand consumption and help to solve the problem of unemployment all the world over , particularly in our own exporting and shipping industries and in the primary industries , especially agriculture , abroad . As a necessary step towards a planned international economy , Labour will propose to give the economic and financial organization of the League the requisite resources and facilities to conduct a full long-term scientific inquiry into the fundamental problems of the world 's economic life . This inquiry , attacked in the true spirit of scientific statesmanship , need not be unduly prolonged ; some of the conclusions reached will become a matter of immediate international action ; and the ultimate purpose will be to frame a coherent and fully articulated plan , for national and international application , by which the // thousands of millions of wealth now left unproduced every year , wasted , or deliberately destroyed when produced , will be brought to the service of the peoples of all countries . International planning will , it may be confidently expected , reveal possibilities of economic expansion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , that should help to distract attention from sterile frontier squabbles , and to lay the foundations for a new order of things in Europe and the world . In the work of economic planning , now a plain and imperative necessity , Labour will associate the International Labour Organization . Its co-operation is vitally important . The rapid development of machinery and power production , and the attendant processes of rationalization ' in industry , are creating new problems affecting the life and labour or the producing classes . At the very time when mechanical invention , power equipment , and scientific methods have transformed industry , and have enormously enlarged productive capacity , the industrial and social standards which the Trade Unions have established , and are striving to maintain , are being challenged by capitalist employers , who allege that the maintenance of these standards is too costly for industry to bear . Not merely is there a stubborn resistance to proposals for reducing hours of work as a method of more equitably distributing opportunities of employment , but an attempt is being made in some countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class ; in other countries to weaken that organization ; in all countries to frustrate its purpose and defeat its efforts . So that now , more than ever , it is necessary to assist the Trade Unions to safeguard the industrial standards that have been established and to strengthen these standards by developing to the utmost the policy of regulating by international legislation the conditions under which goods entering into international commerce are produced . Labour will seek , therefore , to use the machinery of the International Labour Organization for the purpose it was designed to serve ? namely , to frame a code of international labour laws which will bring industrial and social standards in all countries up to the level of the highest . It will also prevent them being undermined by unfair competition in the world market from countries which seek to gain advantage by debasing standards of wages and conditions of employment for their own people . In our view the International Labour Organization has not yet been used to the full extent that it should be and can be , to assist in bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and industrial system . In this way , and in no other way , is it possible , in Labour 's view , to lay the common economic and social foundations for a Peace-World , in which alone civilization can survive . But these are also the foundations of Socialism . We are Socialists because we can see no other way of // organizing the world for peace , because a comprehensive policy of socialization at home and of active international co-operation for the development of common interests overriding every nationalist and imperialist interest can alone remove the causes of war . CHAPTER V DISARMAMENT AND NATIONAL DEFENCE THE race in armaments is once more in full swing . It is the most dangerous symptom of the steady deterioration of the international situation that has set in since September , 1931 . Every one knows that the race in armaments is a vicious circle , and every one knows that its ultimate end is ? war . But those who advocate bigger armaments do so in the name of their necessity for national defence . Their argument in this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dangerous degree ; the others have failed to follow our example ; they have begun rearming ; therefore , we have no alternative but to follow suit . In any case the whole world knows that we do not want war , nor do we dream of attacking any one . Our armaments are purely for defence and can not possibly be interpreted by other nations as a threat ; whereas we are doubtful about the purpose for which other countries are arming and can not risk giving them the benefit of the doubt . ' It is necessary to face the hard fact that these arguments are actually being used and are sincerely believed in by the // peoples concerned , in every State taking part in the new arms race , just as they were used with equal sincerity on both sides of the arms race that culminated in August , 1914 . The new arms race is already overshadowing , and if suffered to continue will break down , the collective peace system and revive the conditions of international anarchy and the Balance of Power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . The alternative to the arms race and Armageddon is to make a reality of the collective peace system to which we are bound by solemn treaty obligations , and for which the world paid the price of four years of the most terrible war in human history . An integral part of the peace-keeping system is the obligation to reduce and limit arms . Fifteen years ' struggle by the League with this problem , including three heart-breaking years of the Disarmament Conference , have made it plain beyond any possibility of doubt that the arms race can be stopped and the towering armaments that threaten civilization can be abolished only if there be ( a ) a complete system for settling disputes by pacific means ; ( b ) stringent obligations to take joint action against an aggressor so thoroughly worked out as to be as nearly fool- and knaveproof as is possible in any human institution , and inspiring general confidence that they will , when it comes to the point , be applied . If . a nation believes itself exposed to the danger of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not refrain from making the most // complete preparations , which its resources permit , against the danger of attack . The principal political condition for disarmament is that States should not have to rely on their unaided strength for defence , but should be able to rely on the organized collective action of the League so long as they behave as loyal members of the League . To work out , and pledge ourselves to such collective obligations is not an easy or light task . But we must choose to-day between two alternatives , either of which is disagreeable and risky : we can either go back to the old idea first proclaimed by a Roman general and a favourite maxim ever since of men of war : If you want peace , prepare for war . ' That method in the last analysis rests on contradictory arguments , on an attempt to perform the impossible feat of each State being stronger than its neighbour . It entails the reversion to international anarchy , the Balance of Power and the arms race . It can hardly be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It always has ended in war and always will . Its advocates indeed proclaim that war is inevitable , and if their paradoxical method of pursuing peace be adopted they will undoubtedly prove themselves true prophets . The alternative is to go all out in making a reality of the collective defence system . That is a colossal task . It requires daring , imagination , a steadfast purpose ? every bit of the brains and pluck and political genius of the British people . But as John Stuart Mill once put it : Against // great ills small remedies do not produce small effects ? they produce no effect at all . ' The arms race is a great ill . It is an ill so terrible and big with such black disaster that we can make no impression on it by half measures . It is no good standing with one foot in the Balance of Power and the other in the League of Nations , paying lip service to the League , but refusing to accept any more peace commitments . The only result of such ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of more war commitments in the shape of bigger and bigger armaments and an accelerating arms race . That kind of policy makes the worst of both worlds . There is something to be said , although it happens to be wrong , for leaving the League and reverting to isolation . There is a great deal to be said and , Labour believes , rightly said , for going all out to make a success of the League . But there is nothing to be said for remaining in the League in such a faint-hearted and lukewarm manner that we let it fail and are dragged down in its failure . Those who find insuperable difficulties in any vigorous policy shut their eyes to the awful risk , nay , the certainty of ultimate disaster involved in having no policy , or what amounts to no policy . Events are moving with portentous swiftness and he who attempts to stand still is really going backwards . The drift towards war has already acquired such momentum that the only way to stop it is by a tremendous drive for peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires heroic remedies . // These are the central truths on which Labour bases its policy for disarmament and defence . That is why Labour would take immediate steps to put an end to the race in armaments and the growing danger of war . Labour would submit to all nations at Geneva a bold and far-reaching plan both for all-round disarmament and for the international organization of security . The plan will provide for : ( a ) the abolition of all the arms ( warships over 10,000 tons , submarines and aircraft carriers , military and naval aviation , tanks and guns over 4-inch calibre , with strict limitation of smaller arms ) forbidden to the Central Powers by the 1919 Treaties , with a system of regular supervision and diplomatic , economic and financial guarantees of execution ; ( b ) the limitation of armaments ' budgets ; ( c ) the abolition of national air forces , the internationalizing of civil aviation , and the creation of an international air police force ; ( d ) the nationalization and drastic international control of the manufacture of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-aggression , clarified by a definition of aggression and linked with the sanctions system of the League ; the revision of the Covenant to incorporate in it the complete renunciation of war contained in the Briand-Kellogg Pact ; the bringing into force of the Treaty of Financial Assistance // and the Treaty for Strengthening the Means to Prevent War ; ( f ) machinery and obligations for settling all disputes by pacific means . The ultimate object of Labour 's disarmament and security policy is to abolish all national armed forces and to entrust the defence of world law and order to an international police force , under the League of Nations . There is abundant evidence that a programme on these lines has the support of a large majority of British opinion . The experience of the Disarmament Conference further shows that it would have the support of a big majority of the nations represented there . It is impossible , of course , to predict precisely what the international situation will be when the next Labour Government assumes office , but the main lines of development are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have a great deal of support , for the simple reason that it is the only way out of the tragic dilemma of the arms race . Labour 's policy on disarmament and defence , it must be remembered , is only part of a wider policy which will be applied simultaneously all along the line . At the same time as we shall be pressing on with disarmament and collective defence , we shall be laying the economic foundations of peace and facing such issues as the problem of peaceful change in Europe ; the menace to peace in the Far East ; the revival of militant nationalism and the cult of war in the // world . Labour 's way of treating these issues is discussed in subsequent chapters . To sum up : the question of national defence is once more a burning problem for our country and for all other countries . Some voices are raised in favour of unilateral disarmament and non-resistance ? i.e. , of abandoning self-defence altogether . But such views are not likely to be held by a sufficient number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart from the repugnance felt by most people to the whole conception of surrender and abdication , an attitude of this sort would not solve the problem of peace in a world where there are such great and tragic examples of the use and the glorification of force and fraud , and where nations are so interdependent that pacifists who reject economic sanctions ' ' thereby become , willy-nilly , accessories after the fact to the crime of war , for they are in favour of selling war materials to an aggressor . For good or ill , therefore , we must face the problem of national defence . There are only two ways of solving that problem . One is to revert to the traditional conception of each nation being sole judge of its rights and , therefore , solely responsible for their defence . In pursuance of that conception our frontiers would run wherever the multitudinous rights of the world-wide British Empire were liable to serious challenge from States who in their turn would // be arming in response to our armaments . Those would be impossibly large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more onerous in an atmosphere of deepening suspicion and fear till the strain of the arms race was broken by another great war . On these lines , the more we and other nations spend on defence , the more insecure we shall all become , and the more we should between us be preparing the world not for peace but for war . The other way is to make a reality of the method of pooled defence by putting the whole power of the British Empire behind the League in exchange for other countries doing the same . This new method means that we have only one frontier ? the Covenant , which guarantees us , on the basis of reciprocity , that if our territory be invaded , or if third party judgement on our rights be flouted , we shall have the world on our side against the aggressor . That is a limited and manageable commitment . On this basis it will become possible drastically to reduce , limit , control and ultimately internationalize armaments . On these lines the more the nations organize their collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more remote will be the danger of war . The new method involves the risk of trusting at least some other nations ( so does an alliance ) and of third party judgement on our rights . But it affords a reasonable chance of getting rid of war altogether . It is the method to which we are pledged by treaty obligations that it cost ten million dead and twenty million wounded to bring // into existence . We owe it to the dead , as well as to the living , to put our frontier in the Covenant and our national defence behind our frontier . In his maiden speech to the Assembly ( on September 18 , 1934 ) M. Litvinov , chief delegate of the Soviet Union , said : The sound and the meaning of the words " organization of peace " ought now to be different from their sound and meaning twelve or fifteen years ago . Then , to many members of the League of Nations , war seemed to be a remote theoretical danger , and there seemed to be no hurry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all as the threatening danger of to-morrow . Now the organization of peace , for which so far very little has been done , must be set against the extremely active organization of war . Then , many believed that the spirit of war might be exorcised by adjurations , resolutions and declarations . Now , everybody knows that the exponents of the idea of war , the open promulgators of the refashioning of the map of Europe and Asia by the sword , are not to be intimidated by paper obstacles . Members of the League of Nations know this by experience . We are now confronted with the task of averting war by more effective means . ' Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond , in a book published in October , 1934,1 points out with regard to the machinery of peace : // The " Pax Britannica " or of any other kind results from the fixed determination that peace shall be preserved , not from a platonic affection and desire for peace . It is the result of a will , not a pious wish . ' Labour agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by words alone , but only by the collective organization of effective means . Those means will be provided by putting national armaments at the service of peace . What is wanted , in order to achieve this , is a real will to peace , a fixed determination that peace shall be preserved , coupled with a clear realization of the fact that the only true safety is the safety of all , because unless national provisions for defence are directed to and work towards this specific end , they will become a source of antagonism and , therefore , of increasing peril . The world-wide British Commonwealth is scattered over the seven seas and the five continents in an interdependent world where war anywhere may become war everywhere ; the " Pax Britannica " is inextricably bound up with the peace of the world . CHAPTER VI CHANGING THE STATUS QUO FROM the outset of the enterprise of organizing peace , voices have been raised in warning against the danger of stereotyping the status quo . It is pointed out that war , terrible as it is , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of international legislation , and so the forces of change ? growth in populations , economic developments leading to conflicts over access to markets or raw materials , etc. ? bank up until they accumulate enough explosive force to break out in war . So the argument runs . It is generally followed up by objections to any system of sanctions ( collective defence ) unless it is accompanied by some procedure for effecting changes in treaty rights . At this point the argument gets a little confused , for it identifies sanctions with stereotyping the status quo , ' although sanctions come into operation only against a State that has resorted to war . In other words , those who object to sanctions on the ground that they stereotype the status quo ' arc really demanding that war be retained as an instrument of national policy , though so little are most of them aware of this fact that they ask that the Kellogg-Briand // Pact ( which renounces resort to war as an instrument of national policy ) instead of the Covenant should be the basis for organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly face the fact that they are asking that war be retained as the final arbiter . They justify this attitude by arguing that fear induced by threats of war may be the best way of compelling States to revise their frontiers or other treaty rights , and that the present peace settlement is so bad that they are not prepared to maintain it against change , even if that change be effected by war . And so they protest , not only against sanctions , but against closing the gap ' in the Covenant and against all-in arbitration . Few of those who advance by retaining the power to threaten war . As a rule they simply assume that the injustices of the Peace Treaties are so glaring and so undisputed that no one of goodwill can have any trouble in saying what these injustices are and how they should be put right . In particular they assume that the re-drawing of the map of Europe will cause no trouble to any one whose genuine purpose is the establishment of lasting peace . Many good people of liberal views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the balance of power in the House of Commons , condemned the Geneva Protocol by the very argument here under discussion , that it would stereotype the status quo . ' In so doing they // were instinctively reacting against what they held to be the plain indisputable wrongs which the Treaties of Peace had perpetrated against the defeated nations . But were their assumptions justified ? Could they have re-drawn the map as easily as they believed ? Could they have found new frontiers which would have been approved by the universal conscience as self-evidently just ? Nothing could be more improbable . The truth is that the populations of Europe are not divided into homogeneous groups of identical racial origin and complete community of interest . On the contrary , Central and Southern Europe is a mosaic of mixed populations , differing in race , religion and language . If the principle of race , or President Wilson 's principle of self-determination be adopted , there are in many places no frontiers that are right , no mere changing of existing territorial arrangements that will remove existing injustices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than frontiers is what requires revising . Still less can those who advance the argument now under consideration justify their second assumption that the changes required in the status quo can be brought about by war or threat of war . For this assumption challenges the whole of history . The verdict of war goes to the strong , not necessarily to him whose cause is just . War throughout the ages has brought the injustice from which new wars are bred . If good results have also sometimes followed , it has always been // plain that they could have been obtained far better , far more cheaply and far more enduringly without war than with it . Certainly at the present time the Socialist will not accept this argument about stereotyping the status quo . He will hold fast to the fundamental reality of the modern world , which is that civilization must stamp out war or war will destroy civilization ; war can not be retained as an instrument of change , for war can not be localized or its destructive effects limited , nor can peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war . Therefore , whatever the merits of any dispute , war must be forbidden and ruled out absolutely as a method of settlement . Nor will the Socialist accept the argument of another school who desire to organize sanctions , but who wish at the same time to set up some sort of Court of Equity ' with compulsory jurisdiction . By this is apparently meant that a body of men should be appointed with the power to decree such changes in the territorial and other established rights of States as seemed good to them . The decisions of these men would be able to override international law and treaty obligations . Sanctions and compulsory equity ' would be imposed on a world of sovereign States . To this school the Socialist will reply that the method they propose for securing change in the existing status quo is wholly impracticable . For they propose to leave untouched the sovereignty ' and independence ' of each State over the territory subjected to its rule ; yet they also propose // that sovereign States should surrender their territory at the bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and free to override all existing rights which governments by treaty or custom have acquired . What hope is there that the governments of sovereign States will , in fact , agree to anything of the kind ? It has been possible to induce them to submit the interpretation of their rights to the test of third party judgement operating on the basis of law . But this proposal for a Court of Equity ' goes far beyond that . It would mean that governments must accept legislation , ' the changing of existing legal rights , by a body in which they have no representation . Such legislation without representation ' would strike at the vital principle of sovereignty and , therefore , it may be confidently predicted that the governments of sovereign States , in the world as it is to-day , will not accept it . Nor will the Socialist much regret that this is so . For to him it appears that both these schools of thought fall into confusion and contradiction because they do not go to the root of the problem of securing justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing peace without touching on the sovereignty or the economic and social foundations of States . That is an enterprise akin to squaring the circle . It is not so much frontiers that matter as the political and economic regimes within the frontiers , and the way in which these regimes link on with each other across frontiers . The whole Socialist approach to this question // of peaceful change of the status quo is , indeed , quite different . To begin with , we hold that the primary cause of war in the modern world is economic . There is weighty support for this view in the analysis of world conditions made in the first section of this book . But a direct opinion on this subject is worth quoting , for it emanates from the eminent Belgian Prime Minister , who is also an industrialist and financier , M. Theunis , who presided over the World Economic Conference of 1927 at Geneva . In his presidential address M. Theunis said : Economic conflicts and divergence of economic interests are perhaps the most serious and the most permanent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . No machinery for the settlement of international disputes can be relied upon to maintain peace if the economic policies of the world so develop as to create not only deep divergencies of economic interest between different masses of the world 's population , but a sense of intolerable injury and injustice . No task is more urgent or more vital than that of securing agreement on certain principles of policy which are necessary in the interests of future peace . And there is perhaps no question which , in comparison with its intrinsic importance , has had so little careful and collective deliberation . ' Sir Arthur Salter , who quotes this opinion with approval , adds : In a word , if we want peace In a lecture printed in Problems of Peace , ' Third Series , being the proceedings of the Geneva Institute of International Relations , 1928. // wo must not merely rely upon a machinery for the settlement of disputes when they arise ; we must so lay the foundations of peace that the disputes which do arise will be relatively unenvenonmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long-standing sense of divergent interest and injustice .... If we , comfortably believing that there is a machinery for stopping war , are content to allow the economic forces of the world to move along lines which ! cad and guide to war , even the machinery of the League will not , at the last moment , save us from the consequences . ' those words were spoken in 1928 . Since then the economic depression has released tremendous economic and social forces , the character and political repercussions of which were indicated in the first two chapters of this book . How Labour proposes to grapple with these forces is described in Chapter IV ? The Foundations of Peace . ' In laying the foundations of peace , it must be observed , Labour is at the same time laying the foundations of a new type of society , a worldwide and dynamic society that will be changing and growing rapidly , for it will be based on the active and fruitful principles of co-operation and social justice . But the social and economic forces released by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism and aggressive policies , and these in turn have started a new race in armaments . So far from there being any reason for anxiety about the status quo ? either political , social , // economic , financial , or international ? being stereotyped , there is grave reason to fear that the forces of change may become so violent as to shatter civilization . The world is moving with a blind and distracted motion , but moving rapidly ; it does not know where it is going , but it is certainly not standing still . So far from treaties proving too rigid , they are losing all sanctity . It seems misplaced , or at least mistimed , anxiety to worry about stereotyping the status quo when the world is in the melting pot , and all things are in flux . That is why Labour wishes to bend its energies first to stop civilization being swept away in the cataclysm of war . Unless this can be done , there is little hope of securing the kind of changes by which present injustices can be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people do , as if the treaties could be scrapped and replaced overnight by others embodying territorial frontiers more to the liking of the defeated powers , is to play with words , and with dangerous words at that . For such Treaty Revision , ' if it were attempted in the present conditions and in the present atmosphere in Europe , would end in war . Such Revision ' is not , as many people too confidingly believe , a way to get rid ' of the running sores in the international body politic ; on the contrary , it is the surest way to provoke a conflict which , by wise handling , may yet be avoided . But if this direct onslaught on the Revision problem be ruled out , how can we hope to secure // the peaceful changes in the existing status quo which assuredly will be required if present grievances are ever to be removed ? The first thing to do is to stop the arms race . That can be done only by the adoption of a plan for collective defence , disarmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as that outlined in the previous chapter . The adoption of a plan on these lines would transform the political atmosphere in Europe , by restoring faith in the rule of law and banishing the fear that violence would be used to effect changes in national territories . In that atmosphere much can be done by agreement and negotiation and by utilizing the means of moral pressure and discussion provided by the machinery of the League of Nations . There are three possible ways in which change might be effected through the machinery of the League . The first is by the use of Article 19 of the Covenant , which is designed to promote the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might " endanger the peace of the world . " ' Many people believe that this Article has been tried and failed , and that it is as good as dead . Nothing could be further from the truth . The Article has never been invoked by any European power . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning on a number // of occasions . In general the tendency has been towards a restrictive interpretation of its provisions . But none of the powers which it provides has been in any way compromised , and if it were properly used it might prove to be an instrument of considerable power . Under its terms any member of the League can bring up any existing international arrangement in which it would desire a change , and could insist upon a full public discussion . The Assembly , by majority vote , could appoint a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the issues involved ; this commission , when appointed , could make a report and recommendations by a majority of its members ; when it received this report the Assembly ( again by majority vote , since this is only a question of advice ' and not decision ) could make any proposals to the parties which it might find wise . It can hardly be doubted that this procedure would bring the pressure of world public opinion to bear very effectively against the maintenance of arrangements condemned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change might be through the use of Article 15 of the Covenant . In connexion with the proposals to amend the Covenant so as to rule out resort to war altogether , the idea received a great deal of support that members of the League should agree to accept a report of the Council under Article 15 , paragraph 6 , or of the Assembly under Article 15 , paragraph 10 . These reports dispense with the votes of the parties ( and , in the case of // the Assembly , only the votes of the States represented on the Council and of a bare majority of the other members of the Assembly are required ) , and as they may recommend changes in the legal rights of the parties , an amendment on these lines would constitute the beginnings of international legislation . The third method by which peaceful change might be obtained is through reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague . The Permanent Court , like any other court , is competent to hear cases arising from the claim that circumstances have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations necessary ( this competence derives from the wellknown principle of international law : rebus sic stantibus ' ) . The Court itself , if freely used under the Optional Clause , may build up a series of judgements and opinions which would constitute a form of judicial legislation by putting new constructions on treaties and on principles of international law . It may be added that an increasing number of League treaties provide for their own reconsideration and if necessary revision at stated periods and on specified conditions , and the League is constantly holding conferences which conclude new treaties . Thus , it is fair to claim that the forces of growth and change , if the channel of war is successfully blocked , may be trusted to find for // themselves new channels and avenues of development . The League , as an association of States , is subject to the same tendencies as any other confederation or federal system , namely , the tendency to provide for means of legislation even at the cost of surrender of sovereign powers by the units in the association in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of everyday life . But it may be predicted that in proportion as the community of nations begins to devise methods approaching international legislation to promote its common interests , it will be found that such legislation will be concerned not so much with shifting frontiers as with the real interests of the community , that is , the lives and fortunes of the men and women on both sides of whatever frontier may run through the area affected by the proposed legislation . It may further be predicted that legislation in the international as in the national domain will be based on the representation of the community concerned and not camouflaged as a Court of Equity ' imposing its decisions from outside . The analogy at the back of the Socialist 's mind when he considers the problem of peaceful change is always the analogy with confederations and federal systems . Labour is thinking in terms of the dawn of world government . That is why it would be , in the Labour view , a mistake to suppose that peaceful change can ever consist principally in frontier revisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must change . The greatest peaceful change must be the progressive disappearance of inflamed nationalism and the growth of international arrangements across frontiers on tariffs , currency , economic co-operation , transport , and , in the political field , on the fair treatment of minorities . There was much in the history of the first ten years of the League to encourage us to believe that such change can be hoped for , and to show us how fast and far it may go once the fear of war has been eliminated from international life . Once that fear is gone , and those kinds of changes have begun , some frontier revision may also become possible and wise . The policy of Labour will favour any just and reasonable frontier adjustments and treaty revisions . But Labour 's main effort in the domain of changing the status quo will be concentrated on banishing the fear of war , laying the economic foundations of peace , social justice , and cooperation , and abolishing frontiers by drawing the nations together into a World Commonwealth . In so far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall begin with whatever States will share our ideal and join with us in advancing step by step towards the common goal . CHAPTER VII THE FAR EAST LABOUR follows with deepening anxiety the LABOUR course of events in the Far East , and has never failed to appreciate the extreme gravity of the situation . It regards the problem of Asia as pivotal to the peace of the world . It recognizes that there exists to-day a condition of stalemate which is full of danger . The aggression on the part of Japan , and the general disregard of solemn treaty obligations have had dire consequences in international relations . In this connexion it is interesting to note that The Times , in its leading article of October 4 , 1934 , observes : There can not . . . be any real doubt that the primary causes of the upward tendency of armaments have been Japanese policy in the Far East and the deliberate rearmament of Germany under the Hitler regime . ' Though events in Germany have partly reflected the inability of the Geneva conference to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of security , there is a strong feeling in Labour circles that the primary cause of the failure of the Disarmament Conference to reach 1 // success has been the loss of confidence in collective security occasioned by the Far Eastern situation . Labour has officially declared that its first objective would be to do everything within its power to remove the menace of a great war in that part of the world . It would take its stand squarely on the Covenant of the League of Nations , the Nine-Power Treaty ' . and the Pact of Paris , as interpreted in the unanimous report of the League Assembly concerning the Manchurian dispute . It would keep in closest touch with the United States and the Soviet Union with regard to a concerted attitude against aggression and the violation of treaties in the Far East . It would make clear that any fresh resort to war would be met by world-wide action on the basis of the treaties forbidding war . Moreover , Labour would use all its influence to frustrate any effort to make China the victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's territorial integrity and political independence . It would also endeavour to secure by common action those conditions under which alone a reasonable standard of life is attainable by the peoples of the East . The Assembly Report by which Great Britain is bound makes it clear that ( 1 ) Manchuria is an integral part of China , under Chinese sovereignty , and the Nine-Power Treaty applies to Manchuria as it does to every other part of China . ( 2 ) The present military occupation of Manchuria is the result of Japanese military operations that can not // be called defensive and for which China has no responsibility ; the existence of this occupation is a standing violation of Article 101 of the Covenant and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty . ( 3 ) The present regime in Manchuria was created and is controlled by the Japanese General Staff ; its maintenance and recognition are contrary to the interests of China and to the wishes of the population , which is ninety-five per cent Chinese ; its existence is a violation of the Covenant , NinePower Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace in the Far East . ( 4 ) The maintenance of peace in the Far East is a matter of international concern . The report recommended that Manchuria be demilitarized and restored to Chinese rule on a semi-autonomous basis and with extensive safeguards for all legitimate Japanese rights and interests ; due account was also to be taken of the position of the U.S.S.R. in North Manchuria and of the principle of the open door . ' There should be international co-operation through the League in assisting the Chinese Government 's national reconstruction plan . Finally the report bound all the members of the League not to recognize Manchukuo ' de jure or de facto , to abstain from any act that might facilitate the maintenance of this treaty-breaking regime , and to concert their policy on the basis of the report . An Assembly Advisory Committee was set up , on which the United States , which accepted the report , is represented , and of which 1 See Appendix VII . 1 // the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain are ex officio members , in virtue of their membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rejected by Japan . The whole issue remains open , nothing is settled , and the League 's responsibility for the preservation of peace and securing respect for treaty obligations continues . Labour 's policy is to take this situation as it finds it , to apply the non-recognition policy loyally , to make effective the plan of technical co-operation with China for purposes of national reconstruction , and to keep the peace . Labour believes that if only peace can be kept , the intolerable burden of military expenditure in Japan , the ceaseless guerrilla warfare in Manchuria , the drain of making good the constant deficits in the trade balance and finances of Manchukuo , ' the growing strength of China and the U.S.S.R. , and the deepening hostility of the whole world , will in the end induce the Japanese people to recognize that the solution recommended in the Assembly Report is fair and honourable to Japan as well as to China , and is the only possible alternative to disaster for their own country . But Labour recognizes that the present situation is neither just nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept unless it is known beforehand by all concerned that any fresh resort to war would certainly be visited by sanctions , applied by the whole League in association with the United States . Hence the statement that the Labour Government would keep in closest touch // with the United States and the Soviet Union with regard to a concerted attitude against aggression and the violation of treaties in the Far East . It would make clear that any fresh resort to war would be met by world-wide action on the basis of the treaties forbidding war . ' This policy , it will be seen , is merely the loyal and effective application of our treaty obligations , as interpreted in the report by which our country , as well as the other members of the League and the United States , is bound , as a result of the decision of the governments concerned . The Lytton Report , on which the Assembly Report is based , was everywhere hailed as a remarkable document . It was the result of the labours , not of theorists , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and diplomats , all nationals of the great powers with interests in China ; this Commission had a large staff of experts , travelled extensively , and had every conceivable source of information thrown open to it and every variety of argument pressed upon it ; it visited Japan first , and throughout its investigation it had a Japanese assessor , as well as a plethora of Japanese documents and elaborate Japanese surveillance during the whole of its visit in Manchuria ; the report was unanimous . The Assembly Report was elaborated over a period of months after the publication of the Lytton Report , by the delegates of nineteen Governments , including our own , with the assistance of the Far Eastern experts of their foreign offices , and with a full sense // of the political responsibilities involved ; it accepted the findings of the Lytton Commission completely . The Assembly Report therefore represents an accumulated weight of knowledge and authority not lightly to be disregarded . The British Government accepted that report and it is still binding on this country . Nevertheless , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Conservative Party and Press and in certain quarters in the City , which wishes to disregard the Assembly Report and our treaty obligations , and to come to an understanding with Japan on the basis of condoning the occupation of Manchuria . There is hardly a debate on foreign affairs in the House in which some Conservative M.P.s and papers do not raise their voices in favour of a renewal in some form of the Anglo-Japanese alliance . In certain parts of the Conservative Press this view is advocated with remarkable persistence . There was a spate of articles , editorials and special supplements in this sense at the time of the dispatch of the F.B.I . economic mission to Manchukuo ' almost immediately after Parliament rose in the summer of 1934 . From the point of view of politicians who think in pre-war terms there is much to be said for a deal ' with Japan : We are now , ' their argument runs , in much the same position towards Japan as Great Britain was towards France before the " deal " over Morocco and Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partitioning of Persia . To-day the alternative is an arms race leading to // a war , or a deal with Japan at the expense of China coupled with a political , commercial and naval understanding . ' The trouble with this policy is that it ignores the Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty ; it overlooks the fact that nationalism is now so strong in China that that country can no longer be submitted to the indignity of spheres of influence , ' let alone protectorates and partition ; finally it would commit us to hostility to the Soviet Union and the United States , and be interpreted in certain powerful circles in Japan as opening the door to further military adventures . Such a policy would make for war and not for peace . So repugnant is it , indeed , to morals and common sense that no British Government could embark on such a course . But the advocates of this policy may exert sufficient influence to prevent the vigorous pursuit of any alternative policy . That is why it is necessary to insist that here , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Covenant , to adopt an attitude that encourages potential aggressors to speculate on our defaulting on our obligations when it comes to the point . That policy also makes for war and not peace . It makes the worst of both the pre-war and the post-war worlds . Under the guise of avoiding immediate risk it incurs the certainty of ultimate disaster . The only policy capable of keeping the peace is openly to stand by our treaty obligations in deed as well as word . That is the only policy in consonance with the moral , juridical and // material facts of the post-war world . It involves making it clear that any fresh resort to war would be met by world-wide action on the basis of the treaties forbidding war . ' To understand exactly what that means it should be realized that any war fought to maintain , let alone to extend , the present Covenantbreaking military occupation of China 's northeastern provinces ( Manchuria and Jehol ) must necessarily be regarded as aggressive by all States that have accepted the Assembly Report of February 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to repudiate the Nine-Power Treaty , the Covenant , and the Paris Pact , as interpreted in the Assembly Report by which this country , the U.S.A. , and all the members of the League are bound . If Great Britain took her stand , not in any violent or challenging fashion , but firmly and unequivocally , on that position , there is no reasonable doubt that the U.S.S.R. , France and Italy would follow suit , and that the U.S.A. would give its cordial approval and diplomatic support . And there is equally no reasonable doubt that the whole League would fall into line , and that as a result of this calm but clear-cut and steadfast policy peace and order would gradually be restored to the Far East . The Assembly Report declares that it is in the interests of world peace that the League should continue to afford China the technical assistance in modernizing her institutions which her Government might request with a view to enabling the // Chinese people to reorganize and consolidate the Chinese State . ' In lending this assistance through the machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote the political and economic stability of the Chinese Republic , not in the interests of financial groups , but in the interests of the Chinese people and of the world at large . The Labour Party will reverse the imperialist policy of domination and economic exploitation which in the past has been so grave a menace to the peaceful development of the world . In this policy the hearty co-operation of the Soviet Union and the United States may be counted upon , for the policy is at all points in conformity with the interests of these two countries and with the record and spirit of their relations with China . It should not be forgotten that when the Great War supervened the Allied Powers appealed to China to side with them in the struggle . She responded to the call , and received in return a promise that on the termination of the war she would be accorded in international relations the position and the consideration due to a great country . The promise was given unhesitatingly , whether or no its full import was appreciated by those Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as China was concerned , the intention was clear . She joined the Allied cause , consistently with her policy as a whole , with the purpose of furthering her national aspirations at the first convenient moment . A few years later , in 1922 , the States signing the // Nine-Power Treaty agreed to provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable Government . ' On May 22 , 1926 , Sir Austen Chamberlain , in a memorandum to China , laid down the principle that all the Powers should abandon the idea that the economic and political development of China can only be secured under foreign tutelage ' and that it should be the policy of the Powers to endeavour to maintain harmonious relations with China without waiting for or insisting on the prior establishment of a strong Central Government . ' In May , 1931 , the Labour Government gave its cordial approval to the inauguration , at the request of the Chinese Government , of the League plan of technical co-operation with the National Economic Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan and execute its programme of reconstruction . The Labour Government also took up the question of the rendition of British concessions and the abolition of exterritoriality , as had been promised at the Washington Conference and since . In 1933 , the Assembly endorsed the report of the Lytton Commission , which described how political and economic reconstruction was progressing , and how the tide of national sentiment was rising . In 1934 the League technical agent in China , Dr. Rajchman , in a remarkable report surveyed the whole field of reconstruction and the multitudinous activities of the Government and its National Economic Council . The report brought out the // fact that the entire political , financial and administrative trative responsibility for all this work necessarily rests on the Chinese Government , that any outside help is technical and advisory in character and subsidiary in extent , and that the time when China could be in any relationship of tutelage or patronage to any foreign power or group of foreign powers or interests , has irrevocably passed . The West must adjust itself finally to the conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and 4,000 years of tradition , in a country as big as all Europe , are not easy to modernize and consolidate into a strong State . But much has been done , still more is being prepared , and the spread of the sentiment of national unity is ultimately as inevitable in China as elsewhere . The Chinese , and they alone , can build up their vast country , although their task will be facilitated by the machinery for technical co-operation ready to their hand in the League . It is the intention of British Labour to give every assistance in the power of a fellow-member of the League , because we are convinced that to do so is in the interests of the whole of mankind . We look forward eagerly to the day when the great Chinese people shall take its rightful place among the leading nations of the world . Labour 's policy for restoring law and order in the Far East is simple , and rests on feelings of equal friendship and respect for the peoples of both China and Japan . It consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
