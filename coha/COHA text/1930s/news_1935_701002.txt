txt While Attorney General David T. Wilentz spent the day at his home in Perth Amboy preparing for the resumption of his cross-examination on Monday morning , Bruno Richard Hauptmann had the first of his two days of respite today before he goes back on the stand for another ordeal . Despite the admissions Mr. Wilentz forced from him in his half hour 's cross-examination late yesterday afternoon , Ilauptrnann was reported to have recovered his composure . Information from the county jail back of Hunterdon County court house was that the prisoner slept well last night , ate well today and did not appear nervous . Hauptmann will need all the rest and composure he can gain before Monday , which will be the nineteenth court day of his trial for the murder of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. , at Hopewell , on March 1 , 1932 . Mr. Wilentz is expected to resume the hammer-and-tongs attack which he began yesterday against Hauptmann 's denials of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby , building the ladder , writing the ransom notes , and collecting the ransom . More Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had four more of Hauptmann 's account books and diaries found in his Bronx home after his arrest last September , like the little red note-book with the word " boat " spelled " b-o-a-d , " which Mr. Wilentz shook in Hauptmann 's face yesterday afternoon . This was the same spelling which appeared in the fourteenth and last of the ransom notes . Although Hauptmann refused to admit that he had written that par-1 ticular word In the book , he faltered out the admission that it looked like his handwriting , and that the note-book contained his handwriting in other entries . He gave two answers  --  one that he could not remember having written the word that way in the note-book , and the other that , if he had done so , it must have been eight years ago , before he could write English as well as now . The prosecution revealed after court that the notebook contained a record of Hauptmann 's personal expenditures for 1931 , the year before the kidnapping , and that the word " boad , " so spelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure for a boat trip . Other Samples of Writing . Other notebooks include a large account book , and in addition the State has samples of Hauptmann 's writing when in the German Army and in prison in Germany , with which to attack him either on cross examination or in rebuttal . According to the prosecution , all these documents show that the peculiar misspellings , usages and handwriting characteristics , including the because the local system was overtaxed by the drain on it caused by the extra burden of power for the telegraph facilities for the trial . ? Studies His Deals Again . On returning to his cell late yesterday afternoon , it was learned today , Hauptmann quickly plunged into a study of photostatic copies of his stock-trading accounts and of memoranda on these records which he made in his cell last weekend . These concern the large bank de- ' posits and purchases of stock which Hauptmann made after the kidnapping , and which the State contends link him , when added to the $14,600 of the ransom money found in his garage , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindbergh. although it has , not proved that the money which went into the bank and brokerage accounts was Lindbergh ransom money . Showing more interest in this than than in any other phase of the case , Hauptmann under direct examination by his chief counsel , Edward J. Reilly of Brooklyn , laid his records out on the judge 's bench alongside the witness chair , studied them deliberately , and gave a detailed explanafion of each separate item . He denied that any of these large deposits and purchases were made with Lindbergh ransom money . His explanation was that he had obtained the money to speculate on a scale which amounted to total trading , including both purchases and sales , of $350,000 , with transactions of $50,000 or more in several separate months , in several entirely legitimate ways . These included a start in 1929 on several thousand dollars saved by himself and his wife out of their wages , cross-entries and withdrawals from one account to another at various times , and , from 1932 to the end of 1933 , of profits from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as much as $4,500 in a single item to the stock trading account . As soon as he was turned over to Attorney General Wilentz for crossexamination yesterday afternoon , Hauptmann without waiting for the lawyers ' first question , volunteered the explanation that he had no bookkeeping records to support his story of his financial dealings with Fisch , and that his testimony was the best recollection he had . There might be a difference here and there , but it would not be a big one , he added . Later , under questioning by Mr. Wilentz , Hauptmann admitted that Fisch , who is now dead , was the only man except himself who had known of the financial arrangement whereby , without any records being exchanged , Hauptmann had a 50 per cent interest in Fisch 's fur business and Fisch a similar interest in Hauptmann 's stock trading account . Hauptmann also admitted that he and not Fisch was the one who delivered the money to the brokers and that the stock account was in his name or his wife 's and not in Fisch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hauptmann to a searching cross-examination on his explanation of these deposits and purchases , probably taking up each item one by one as he explained it . and trying to force him to admit that he was not telling the truth . The prosecution said that it would show to the witness the account books which he kept methodically over a period of years , and ask him to explain why , after making a record of every small expenditure and receipt for years before the kidnapping , including money spent for gasoline on an automobile trip to California , he should suddenly step out of character in failing to keep records of money deals with Fisch involving thousands of dollars . Hauptmann will be asked to explain why a man who had been as thrifty and economical in a small way all his life , as he has testified he has been , should suddenly be ' come so careless in large affairs during 1932 and 1933 with a man whom , by his own testimony , he did not meet until March or April , 1932 , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to him by a friend . William E. Frank , an expert accountant of the Internal Revenue Bureau , who testified for the State after making a long investigation of Hauptmann 's financial records , sat at the prosecution table all the time Hauptmann was testifying yesterday , and made detailed notes on his explanation of his financial transactions . Besides advising Mr. ' Wilentz on his cross-examination , Mr. Frank is expected to testify as a rebuttal witness for the State if necessary . It was also learned that the State has in reserve evidence regarding alleged expenditures Ilauptmann made in entertaining other women when Mrs. Hauptmann made her trip to Europe in the Summer of 1932 , and may use this evidence in rebuttal if it feels it necessary to convince the jury that Hauptmann came into possession of suspicious " sudden wealth " immediately after the Lindbergh ransom was paid on April 2 , 1932 . The State also disclosed that Mrs. Hauptmann , who is to be the second witness for the defense , Will be vigorously cross-examined about her knowledge of the source of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain why she gave up her job as a waitress in a Bronx bakery - restaurant within a few months of the kidnapping , and never worked thereafter , and why she made the 1932 trip to Germany . Hauptmann in his testimony said that the only reason she went was to visit her mother on the latter 's seventieth birthday , and that she did not work after the birth of her baby . Ready for Rebuttal . The prosecution is planning to line up rebuttal witnesses at its headquarters in Trenton this week to meet whatever testimony the defense puts in . Members of the family of Isidor Fisch , whom a New York detective brought here from Germany , have been in Trenton for several days , being held in reserve for rebuttal against the defense efforts to involve Fisch , especially if it is attempted to prove that he wrote the ransom notes or collected the ransom money . Dr. John F. Condon , who paid the ransom as Colonel Lindbergh 's agent ; Colonel Henry Breckinridge , Colonel Lindbergh 's lawyer , who stayed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney Samuel J. Foley of the Bronx , who took a statement from Hauptmann after his arrest admitting that he had written Dr. Condon 's telephone number and address inside a closet in his home , may be called as rebuttal witnesses . It has been hinted that Dr. Condon would tell on rebuttal of the talks he has had with Hauptmann in jail in efforts to persuade him to confess . From present indications , the case is expected to go to the jury in ten days or two weeks . Hauptmann and Mrs. Hauptmann will be followed by four handwriting experts , several alibi witnesses and , others who the defense hopes will destroy the testimony of witnesses who - have identified Hauptmann as having been at or near Hopewell before the night of the crime and who have linked him with Dr. Condon during the ransom negotiations . The defense is expected to call thirty to forty witnesses , as against the eighty-seven whom the State called to the stand in sixteen and one-half court days . After the defense rests , the State will call its rebuttal witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury by Mr. Wilentz and Mr. Reilly , next the judge 's charge , and finally the verdict . use of the hyphenated form " New York " and a " unique " formation of the letter " x " have always been individual characteristics of Hauptmann 's writing . The account books also will be used to attack Hauptmann 's explanation of what the State calls the " sudden wealth " he acquired after the kidnapping . Mr. Wilentz will confer with his assistants at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the prosecution 's head-'I quarters at the Hotel Hilderbrecht , in Trenton . Before Hauptmann took the stand here , the prosecution said it had found seventy-six distinct contradictions in the statements he made in New York after his arrest . Today Mr. Wilentz was said to be picking out additional contradictions with which to confront Hauptmann on the witness stand . Ridicules Confession Talk . C. Lloyd Fisher , his local defense counsel , visited Hauptmann in his cell last night and again this morning , holding a private conversation with him by whispering through the bars of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to exercise outside his cell . Mr. Fisher said after leaving the jail this morning that Hauptmann had ridiculed reports that he was likely to confess when he returned to the witness chair at 10 o'clock on Monday morning . " What have I got to confess ? " the accused man commented , according to Mr. Fisher . " Bruno was in excellent condition when I saw him , " the lawyer continued . " He was as steady as a rock ; more composed than at any time since he has been in Flemington . He has a very fine mental attitude toward the situation . " Sheriff John H. Curtiss corroborated Mr. Fisher 's statement that the prisoner appeared to be in good condition , both physically and mentally . " He is in good shape , is not ill , and says he feels very well , " said the Sheriff . " He has made no complaints and is apparently in good mental condition . " Warden Harold McCrea said that Hauptmann slept well last night , ate a good breakfast this morning and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ate a good dinner . Mrs. Anna Hauptmann. the prisoner 's wife , who returned to New York last night to visit relatives in the Bronx and see her infant son , Mannfried , had a talk with her husband in the jail just before leaving . According to the custom imposed upon them by the authorities , there was a metal screen between them as they talked . Light Out in His Cell . The prisoner underwent an odd experience thit , morning when the electric light which has been kept shining on his cell and exercise pen day and night since he was lodged in jail here more than three months ago went out and stayed mat for forty minutes , leaving the space in a dim light from outside barred windows . Alarmed by the incident , which they did not understand at first , the three armed guards who stand watch over him all the time , redoubled their vigilance . Later it was learned that an airplane had struck a power line in a crash outside of town , and temporarily crippled a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 19 has the light in Hauptmann 's cell been out . On that occasion Hauptmann was not in the cell , but in the court room during a session of the trial , when the lights went out
