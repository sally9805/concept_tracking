txt Four Evanston youths who sought excitement by running o : . cakes of ice in Lake Michigan yesterday saw the danger of their pastime demonstrated by a policeman who had been sent to warn them . William Rees , 2767 Garrison street ; John Elsom , 815 Clinton place ; Wil ? Liam Bushnell , 2744 Ridge avenue , and Harrison Southworth , 814 Clinton place , were skipping from block to block about 60 yards off shore at the northern end of the Northwestern campus when the report reached the police station . Patrolmen Howard Borgeson and George Gunnerson hastened to the scene . The boys did not hear the shouts of the policemen , so Borgeson decided to go after them . But the floating ice would n't support his 230 pounds and he was plunged into the cold water to his waist . When the boys came ashore to help they were hustled to the police station for a lecture by the Juvenile officer on the dangers of attempting to walk on Ice .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
