Two years ago Mme Chiang Kaishek , wife of the Generalissimo , took command of the Chinese Air Force , became the first woman to command any air force . Acting as her own purchasing agent , Mme Chiang spent an estimated $20,000,000 for war planes , reputedly saved China at least an equal sum in " customary graft . " One reason why the hotter-headed Chinese leaders finally persuaded cautious Generalissimo Chiang to engage in war with Japan was that they thought Mme Chiang 's war planes were going to bomb Japanese cities . <P> Last week twelve war planes from China ( said by the Japanese to be Soviet planes ) finally flew across the 120-mile-wide Formosa Strait , escorted by pursuit planes , and rained bombs on Japanese-owned Formosa . They flew so high that accurate bombing was impossible . From the ground the attacking craft could be seen with the naked eye only as minute specks . Eight were killed , 29 wounded . Property damage was small . <P> Formosa is some 750 miles from Tokyo , but the fact remained that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh month of the war . Chinese did not , however , give the credit to Mme Chiang Kaishek .

The strain of war-time duties is generally known to have taxed her health and this probably will be given as the reason for her resignation in the near future . " Actually during the past month Mme Chiang has been diving quietly in the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong , leaving the active command of what she always called " my airforce " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China 's " invigorated " airforce . Some of the Japanese forces which had reached the north bank of the Yellow River in their advance toward the so-called " Chinese Hindenburg Line " were reported " broken up " by bombs . A captive balloon from which Japanese observers were directing artillery fire was attacked from the air and shot down in flames . This week Japanese operations against the Hindenburg Line continued with slow , progressive success , but Generalissimo Chiang 's troops had begun offering improved resistance , due observers thought to " invigorated " bombing .
