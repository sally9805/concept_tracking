After a three-month study of Britain 's year-old proposal for slicing the Holy Land into British-mandated , Arabic and Jewish States , members of His Majesty 's Government 's technical commission last week sailed from Haifa for London . Their pilgrimage to the Holy Land had been marked by an intense wave of Arab-Jewish terrorism . As the members departed , Britain 's Colonial Secretary , youthful Malcolm MacDonald , arrived by air , spent two days secretly inspecting the security measures Britain has been forced to take . <P> No observer was ready last week to predict that the commission would place its approval on the original partition scheme . In fact , the New York Times 's Near Eastern correspondent , Joseph M. Levy , went on record with the statement that the turbulent conditions in Palestine had convinced the British that two far-reaching changes must be made in the partition plan : 1 ) The proposed Jewish State must be reduced from 2,500 square miles to some 400 , confined to the Sharon Valley , whose population is about 95% Jewish . 2 ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities here believe that the Arabs are not yet fit for self-government and that therefore all Palestine outside the proposed Jewish <P> State should be administered by the British under a revised mandate . " Meanwhile , zealous Jews and Arabs continued for the sixth successive week their murder-bent activities . In cities , although British troops stood guard at virtually every street corner , bombs were hurled and snipers picked off their victims in broad daylight . The total toll of the terrorism during previous weeks : Arabs , 155 killed , 278 injured ; Jews , 72 killed , 217 injured . <P> In the interior , British armored cars rolled over rocky brown hills searching for Oozlebarts* ( armed bands of Arabs ) . <P> According to reports , the Oozlebarts are now virtually masters in certain sections . <P> " During the day it is His Britannic Majesty 's Government , while from nightfall to daybreak it is the rebels ' government , " cracked Arab villagers . The Oozlebarts , operating under an " unknown generalissimo " with headquarters at Damascus , have set up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their squabbles to Oozlebart civil courts , which apply Islamic law and charge nothing ( Palestine court fees are notoriously high ) . Oozlebart military courts dispense quick justice , sometimes death , to Arabs caught selling land to Jews . <P> Back in the U. S. last week after a successful 15-day drive to raise $500,000 in England for the transfer of refugee children from Central Europe to Palestine , crusading Comedian Izzy Iskovitch , better known as Eddie Cantor , proudly let it be known that young Palestine settlers have named the town of Kvutzat Aryeh in his honor . The children translated his first name as " Aryeh . " Its meaning : " The Lion . " Informed that Motor Magnate Henry Ford had accepted the Grand Cross of the German Eagle from the anti-Semitic German Government on the occasion of his 75th birthday fortnight ago , The Lion roared : " Mr. Henry Ford , in my opinion , is a damned fool for permitting the world 's greatest gangster to give him this citation .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
