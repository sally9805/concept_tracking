 | Speak Up for Courtesy Condensed from Review of Reviews Henry Morton Robinson While we Americans are not internationally celebrated for our elegant manners , we have developed a fairly serviceable social technique to help us through our daily lives . Courtesy of a hearty , post-pioneer kind is a rather common thing with us - so common , in fact , that we are apt to be jolted when it is n't forthcoming . Indeed , usually we are so taken aback that we neglect our positive duty to do something about it . If enough of us habitually spoke up whenever we encountered public bad manners , there would soon be a great change for the better . Pondering several recent experiences with insolent public and semi-public servants , I 'm convinced that I was remiss to have let them pass unchallenged ; I might have performed a public service by protesting . Robert Millikan , the scientist , once remarked that the men who operate the filling stations have done more to teach the American people courtesy and good manners than all the professors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : gas station employes realize that their business is a highly competitive one , and that the slightest discourtesy to patrons will be reflected in waning revenue . Which accounts for the gallantry one usually meets with at a filling station . Employes in larger organizations - stores , railroads , public utilities - despite the best efforts of executives , all too often fail to recognize that the public has a right to demand considerate treatment . One of the most disagreeable fellows I 've run into recently was a ticket agent in a large railway station . Did the fact that I had to travel on his line give him a license to treat me with brusque indifference ? At the time , I took his bad manners in silence , but I ought to have pulled him up short with a protest . Nothing smart-alecky or controversial . Just a straightforward assertion of my title to the courtesy that the officials of the road want me to have . Perhaps something like this : " The officers of this company are trying to build up a satisfied passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't exactly compliment you for the help you 're giving them . " With millions of men out of work , there is no reason why a poorly-qualified person should  | hold a job . And discourtesy is a poor qualification for any work . I quietly mentioned this fact to a supercilious hotel clerk last week , and was gratified to see an improvement in his attitude when I next asked for service . After all , these chaps are supposed to be specialists in tact and courtesy , and it pays to remind them of it occasionally . Traffic cops have much to contend with , and doubtless the fine edge of their patience gets frazzled after an eight-hour trick at a busy corner . But this is scant excuse for some of the verbal lacings they give to motorists . A friend of mine , profanely assailed by a traffic cop for a minor violation , decided to stand his ground as a taxpayer and a responsible citizen . " Officer , " he said , " before you hand me that ticket , please step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Sergeant . I 'm surehe 'd like to hear you repeat , in the same tone of voice , the language you 've just used on me . " Of course my friend did not get the ticket . Every policeman knows that his uniform gives him no right to vent his verbal spleen on the citizenry . He can arrest you , or hand you a summons , but abusive oratory on his part is distinctly extra-legal , and your firm announcement that you do n't propose to take his personal guff will usually impress him . The very Ace of Discourtesy is often the personage behind the grilled window in the theater boxoffice . He is by nature a superior fellow with a chilly disdain for everyone who tries to buy theater tickets . His stubborn disregard for my purse and seating tastes , his evident haste to be rid of me , amount to positive discourtesy , very difficult to combat . But I have decided that henceforth I am going to combat it on every occasion . How ? By " calling " him in language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer of this play , the actors , and everyone connected with it , have gone to great trouble to provide me with an evening 's pleasure . You , by your unmannerliness , have just done your best to mar that pleasure . If it happens again , the management will be notified . " A few courageous souls , registering their complaints in dignified accents , could do much to check the blight of discourtesy among us . The shorter the speech , the better ; the important thing is to remind the offending doorman or plumber or headwaiter that his discourtesy is keenly resented and will no longer be passively borne . As a result , you and everyone else are likely to receive more painstaking attention and a finer brand of courtesy in the future . There is another side to the story : for every brush with discourtesy we probably experience a dozen instances of cheerful ex-  | tra service , unsolicited , and - in most cases - unrewarded . A few weeks ago I bought a suit and received such excellent counsel and treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was a gentleman ; it was impossible to show my appreciation by tipping him , so I did something that we should all do much oftener . I wrote a brief note to the president of the store , mentioning my courteous salesman by name , and expressing pleasure at his splendid treatment of me . I am sure that everyone , including myself , profited by that simple note , and that the salesman in particular was heartened by the thought that his courtesy was not unvalued by his fellow man . Courtesy is not the king of virtues , but it is certainly one of his noblest aides . I suppose its true function is to lubricate the surface of those countless casual human contacts in which our deeper emotions are not called into play . It is so valuable a human commodity that we are justified in extending ourselves mightily to promote it ; if it comes freely we are fortunate , but when it is stingily offered we must not be afraid to demand a more generous share . I do not mean to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overworked servitors ; there are dozens of occasions daily in which restraint and patient silence are the only courses open to the considerate man or woman . But if discourtesy is to be checked , heroic methods must be invoked . We must boldly speak up for good manners and let our voices be heard in every boorish corner of our world .
