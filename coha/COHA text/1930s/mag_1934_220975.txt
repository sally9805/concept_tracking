At 60 m. p. h. the Euston-to-Blackpool express rocketed north through the night of the British midlands just west of Manchester , past the signal box at tiny Winwick Junction and smack into a puttering local . When the tumult had died and the ten dead had been laid out in the morgue , British Justice last week went ponderously to work on the facts . To an inquest at Warrington was summoned William Bloor . <P> William Bloor has been the signalman at Winwick Junction for 21 years . A tall , middleaged , careful-minded , precise-spoken Briton who had never before had an accident on his section , he spoke with genuine puzzlement : ' ' So far as the down line is concerned , my mind is a blank . " <P> At the time of the accident there were seven trains approaching , leaving or passing Signalman Bloor 's junction . He had just passed through a Manchester express , a westbound freight , the doomed local . He held up a cattle train behind the local to let a fish train pass south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the movements in my mind . " Up from the south roared the fast express . Mr. Bloor got the fish train out of the way . " I was quite relieved in my mind . " <P> " But , " concluded Mr. Bloor , " I had forgotten all about the local train to Wigan . " <P> Into the awe-struck silence of the courtroom spoke Coroner Sir Samuel Brighouse last week : " Bloor has openly , and I think very openly , admitted that it was through an error on his part that the unfortunate occurrence took place . I think that Bloor was carrying out his duties as faithfully and honestly and as well as he could . If you believe that you will return a verdict of Misadventure . " <P> Thorough believers in British faith and honesty , the Coroner 's jury promptly brought in a verdict that the ten victims had died from a Misadventure.
