THIS is the story of how the great advertising agency , Lord and Thomas , caused the people of the state of California to repeal a chain-store tax . It is an object lesson to all political-minded people , and ought to be read carefully , with pencil and paper for notes , by naive radicals . Right now there is a pest of little bills running through the legislatures of the country taxing the chain stores . Whether the chain store is a good thing or a bad thing , and whether the small retailer has a chance to fight it or not , these bills are mostly foolish and badly drawn . They are just a venture on the part of the small retailer . He is frightened . He does n't realize that the sweep of the chain stores upon him is part of a historical movement , and if he did realize it he would n't care . He is fighting for his life . You can hardly expect him to say : " The world is through with me and I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with the chain stores he is by no means alone . On his side he has some of the big distributors and manufacturers , and he usually has the state legislatures because he its a voter . The chains , often owned outside the state , are not voters . Hence the epidemic in various states of special taxes and license fees on retailers , so arranged that they will press more heavily on the chain stores . The state of California passed a bill providing for such a tax . The bill was known as " 22 , " The tax was insignificant for a single store under one ownership , but it rose as high as $500 a store for chain-store systems . Behind this bill were 80,000 independent dealers , highly organized . A thousand anti-chain people marched on Sacramento to encourage the Governor to sign it . He dared hot veto the bill , but he remarked that it could be repealed by referendum if the people of the state wished . It was at this moment that the Lord and Thomas Advertising Agency stepped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and is presidedover by Mr. Albert Lasker , who played a large and patriotic part during the World War as chairman of the Shipping Board . The campaign conducted by Lord and Thomas to repeal the California chain-store tax was an astute piece of work . First , Lord and Thomas raced around and got the signatures of 135,000 California voters calling for a referendum . Then they put this carefully aside while they did a little good ground work . For seven months if you had been in California you would n't have known that anything was happening . As Lord and Thomas explained to their clients , " It is not enough to be right ; it is also necessary to seem right . " During those seven months Lord and Thomas were carefully arranging matters so that their clients should " seem right . " All the information I give you here I got from a report sent out by Lord and Thomas to prospective advertisers . This report was a sort of boast . In it Lord and Thomas pointed out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people : 1 . Their employees . There are 40,000 of these in California . But many of them were opposed to the chain stores because their pay was small , their hours long , and their treatment bad . 2 . The producers and processors ( processors are middlemen ) of goods handled by the chain stores . Many of these were opposed to the chains because they too felt that they had n't been fairly treated . They claimed that they had suffered from many an , abuse which had forced down their profits and sometimes driven them into bankruptcy . 3 . Their customers . These appreciated the low prices but many of them knew and sympathized with the troubles of the employees and the producers . Lord and Thomas went systematically to work on all three groups . Gravely they tell what they did about the employee group . First they said to the chain stores : December 11 , 1937 " You 've got to stop using numbers for your employees . You 've got to call them by name . " The clerks were numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks " doffed their anonymity and put on neat badges giving names and titles . " They were then entered on card catalogues with all kinds of personal data . Here and there a salary was raised , and here and there hours were cut . There was a sudden outburst of parties , picnics , glee clubs , orchestras , athletic games , and dances , " with the blessing and cooperation of the management . " When a worker had a baby or a wedding anniversary , he got a pleasant letter from the boss . For an accident or illness or death in the family there was a letter of regret and sometimes even a little " practical help . " Lord and Thomas say that the workers responded by a new interest in their employers ' problems , including the tax . Among the festive preparations was a movie called " The Spirit of ' 36 . " You can imagine what that was like . Endowed with a name instead of a number , the happy recipient of a form letter of sympathy , and member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boss 's side . He then was trained to tell his friends and relatives the whole story so that they would line up for the referendum , or , as the report says , " the employee had facts and technique for presenting the problem to outsiders . " At the same time Lord and Thomas were working with the second of the natural groups of friends who were so unnatural as not to be friendly . In 1934 the grocery chains bought $229,000,000 worth of goods in California , the agency discovered . Each chain made a list of the sellers of these goods . Many were farmers , and some of these had also sold their products to the same chains outside the state . To these farmers Lord and Thomas sent men to make speeches , but that was a pretty obvious attempt to influence them . Not so obvious were the special chain-store drives , like that on canned peaches . As you probably know , California grows nearly all the peaches canned in the country . These drives were intended to show the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores also had special sales of dried fruits and other farm products . For the first time Lord and Thomas brought together the heads of the chains and the heads of marketing organizations and other groups to which most of the farmers belong . As a result of these conferences the chain stores gave up a number of injurious practices , such as unreasonable quantity discounts , loss leaders on agricultural products , and unearned advertising allowances . For instance , when a chain bought a certain amount of a product , it demanded a special discount which was to be used in advertising . Sometimes it was so used and sometimes it was not . The practice was seriously abused . The same thing occurred with unreasonable quantity discounts . ( The Tydings-Miller bill stopped some of this abuse but not all of it . ) These matters and one or two others were arranged in the conferences . On the whole the farmers were pleased with what they gained in these get-togethers . The chain stores are often charged with indifference in local community-welfare work ; so Lord and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civic affairs and community movements , " and " more frequently than ever , " says the report , chain-store managers went to meetings of chambers of commerce , clubs , and other groups . Managers were allowed to give donations of money and merchandise on their own authority . And , perhaps even more significant , in dealing with landlords , bankers , real-estate and insurance agents , the chains became more polite . A large staff of speakers was busy day and night with the farm groups , business men 's clubs , and women 's clubs . Any gathering could have a speaker for nothing . Sometimes by seven o'clock in the morning a speaker had already addressed three meetings . One of them began with a colored janitors ' meeting at 4 a. m . This ran on for seven months . Then suddenly newspaper advertising and a radio program burst upon the state . Each Monday evening on the radio came the California Hour . Politics was not mentioned ; there was music and in each program a salute to some locality in California ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that locality . In sixty minutes there were only three or four commercial announcements , and those brief . Prizes were given for essays on the chain-store situation . All of this was deftly done ; the benefits of the chains were pointed out but not much was said about the tax . Meanwhile , of course , the pro-tax people were keeping busy . But they were bewildered and at a loss . According to Lord and Thomas , the head of the pro-tax association said : " I wish the chains would come out in the open and fight . I 'm afraid of this velvet touch . " The primaries were held in August . Between the primaries and the elections two months elapsed , and during those two months the chains " took off their gloves . " The newspapers were deluged with material . Important people in chains had personal talks with newspaper publishers . The speakers ' bureau began to talk about the tax itself . Some of the advertising was slick . There 's a chain in California which sells " See 's Home-Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised or something by Grandma See . Is there a Grandma See ? People whom I asked in California laughed at the question . But these anti-tax advertisements showed a picture of a lovely Grandma See , kind-faced , white-haired , and eighty-two years old , looking friendly and saying , " Do you want to put me out of business ? " Through all this advertising ran a magnificent slogan : " 22 is a tax on you . Vote no . " For the chains were not relying purely on pity and sym- , pathy for Grandma See , old and sweet though she might be , but were building on the surer basis of saving money for the customer . The organization as a whole did n't appear in most of these ads . They were signed by the separate chains . Then Lord and Thomas got an accidental break . The supporters of the bill , the little stores , collected some money , and it turned out that the man at the head of the money-raising outfit took 40 per cent of all he collected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the last few weeks everything was speeded up . Extra radio talks came over the air . Double cards appeared in street cars and buses ; outdoor posters , theater slides , lapel buttons , windshield stickers , bumper strips were dealt out . Other organizations turned out to help . Indignant protests against the bill came from the Commonwealth Club of California , the state Chamber of Commerce , the United States Chamber of Commerce , the California Consumers " Conference , and so on . Mass-meetings two hours long were held in auditoriums . These were really shows . Most of the time was taken up with entertainment by professional talent . Handsome prizes , such as radios and waffle-irons , were given away at the door . The show was entirely free . Tickets were given out by the clerks of the local chain store . Fifty of these meetings were held in the Los Angeles area alone before election , and an average of more than 1,500 persons attended each one . Lord and Thomas seem especially proud of the last meeting of the campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Central Avenue section ( colored ) of Los Angeles . It was called " East Side Mardi Gras , " and had an all-colored program ; master of ceremonies , speakers , projection operators , audience  --  all were colored . Some 1,800 persons came . In the same district , on the same night , two rival candidates for the office of district attorney of Los Angeles County spoke . Each attracted about 150 people , although this was a bitter fight . Then came Election Day , but Lord and Thomas did n't sit back and wait . The chain-store employees made lists of their relatives and friends , and set to work on them . Many of the relatives and friends acted as volunteers . There was an intensive registration drive . Big-scale maps full of pins showed where the employees lived . They were organized on a military basis : one worker to each district ( precinct , it is called in the report ) ; one lieutenant for each twenty precincts ; a captain for each ten lieutenants ; a major for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see every voter opposed to the tax and make sure he voted , take him to the polls if necessary . In Los Angeles County over 5,000 employees gave part of their day to this , and 60 per cent of all chain-store employees did some actual work on it . Polls had been taken in the course of the campaign . In August only 39 per cent were opposed to the bill ; in September , 54 per cent . On Election Day the bill was voted down by 64 per cent of the voters . After it was over , Lord and Thomas interviewed the voters and got some interesting notes on why they voted as they did . The most effective argument with those who voted for the repeal of the bill had been that it raised the cost of living . On the other side the best argument had been that the chains were monopolies . More women than men had been moved by the argument about the rise in the cost of living , and more rural voters than urban voters . More men than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than rural voters . That is how Lord and Thomas went to the people of California ; only the people of California did n't know anything about Lord and Thomas , and do n't now .
