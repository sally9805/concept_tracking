Time-Table Collector <P> Sirs : <P> TIME . Aug. 14 , p. 29 , contained an interesting article on the Davidsons in Kenya Colony , with a picture showing them on a rail car near Makindu station . <P> I collect timetables as a hobby . This morning I received from the Superintendent of the Line of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours copies of their various timetables . Along with my letter of thanks , I am sending him a copy of this weeks TIME , with p. 29 marked . It seemed rather a coincidence that the picture of his railway line should appear the very week that the timetables were received . . . . <P> BUELL W. HUDSON <P> Woonsocket , R.I. <P> The States &; Huey Long <P> Sirs : <P> Regarding New Orleans Item-Tribune Publisher Thomson 's letter and your footnote in Aug. 14 issue of TIME . . . . <P> I have no quarrel with Mr. Thomson 's explanation to the world or his own conscience as to the Item-Tribune 's association with Crawfish Huey Long , either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do take exception to your footnote in which you quote an excerpt from the Senator 's statement during the Broussard-Overton senatorial investigation in which he said : ' ' Since the counsel wants to know , we collected for Tin-States when they were with us , and for the Progress Huey Long 's own slandering weekly when they were with us .

I was not contradicted then . I repeat to you what I said then . <P> Huey Long never at any time ordered the deduction of so much as a thin dime from the pay envelope of an officeholder compelled to do Long 's bidding or lose his job , to be turned over to the New Orleans States . <P> If he had offered to do so , the offer would have been summarily rejected . For the States under the Ewing management could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that type of political coercion . The States never sought forced circulation . It wanted no circulation that could be construed as involving a sacrifice of its principles and political independence . . . . <P> JOHN D. EWING President &; Publisher Ewing Newspapers New Orleans , La . <P> U.S. v. NRA <P> Sirs : I note with considerable interest that you reflect in the columns of TIME an unusual knowledge of the NRA program and the purposes behind it . I feel , therefore , that perhaps you can throw some light on a question that is bothering a number of people in this community . As a group we are pretty patriotic down here . Usually we subscribe about 100% to movements such as the NRA . Even now , when the movement is in its infancy it is very difficult to find a business not under the Blue Eagle-with one very notable exception . Surprising as it may seem , our own Uncle Sam is the only one who flatly refuses to put out the Blue Eagle . Since he is sponsor of the movement this seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lower wages , yet he lowers the wages of his own employees 25%. ...
