 | LET me state right here at the start that I did n't expect to find very much to write about in this one-man survey into jest what the church was doing toward helping to solve the distressing problem of unemployment and hunger . As a matter of fact I did n't expect to find anything except possibly some sentimental and wholly inadequate gestures in handing out alms ? and praying from afar . I was certain I would not find the church mingling with life I mean with its feet deep in the muck and cruelty and heart- aches of life . -I did not dream that I would find churches and ministers awakened , militant , conscious of economic wrongs , and preaching a fighting brand of New Christianity yet one that draws its power and its authority from the humble and revolutionary life of the Great Leader of almost 2000 years ago . But I found all that and more . I found a new courage in the profession of ministry . I found that in one Protestant denomination alone more than 2000 preachers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our present system of profit and greed and on the mess we have made of our muddled and unplanned world . I made the thrilling discovery that in the fifteen years since I had been inside a church , something vital and beautiful had happened : Christianity was beginning to turn from the sole problem of salvation to one of meeting , full-faced , all human needs ? jobs and hunger to start with , and then the whole great problem of economic justice and a complete new order of life . To me it 's a brilliant chapter in the story of America of 1933 -- of the America that must learn to dream again . Let me start with Minneapolis . On a blowy day in the middle of January I sat in the office of Dr. George Mecklenburg , pastor of the Wesley Church , which nestles in the sprawling downtown district and butts against the twelve-story business @#  | block called Wesley Temple . Besides being mentor of this million-dollar institution this broad-shouldered , square-jawed , brown-eyed Northwesterner is President of the Organized Unemployed , Inc. ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its rolls . It has its own bank that has issued $200,000 worth of " sauerkraut money " scrip that 's good at the organization 's own great cooperative store and warehouse and wood yards , and is accepted for its full face value by scores of Minneapolis doctors , dentists , lawyers , barbers , watch repairers , and by garages , laundries , and business colleges . The particular day I spent in Minneapolis it had some thousand or more men and women on its pay rolls , each drawing an average of $2 a day in scrip . It had 45 trade guilds , able to do anything from building a house to repairing shoes . Exactly four months old , it was already selfsustaining , self-respecting , and dreaming of the great work that it would do this spring . It was an inspiring example of practical applied Christianity ? of a cooperative brotherhood that has kept hundreds and thousands of unemployed families from the devastating ravages of idleness and forced public charity . It was born in this Welley Church from the imaginative mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own W R H M radio station atop Wesley Temple . And it was all so simple and sound and helpful that I wondered why every church and every community in America had n't been backing just some such self-help work and barter plan . Take the day I was there . Into the office of this fighting pastor came two wholesale cloth merchants . They had $1000 worth of surplus heavy mackinaw cloth that they were n't able to dispose of . Over in the basement of the warehouse of the Organized Unemployed , Inc. were three or four hundred surplus barrels of first-class sauerkraut worth $10 a barrel of anybody 's money . 100 x $10=$1000 . All right , let 's trade the $1000 worth of surplus cloth for Too barrels of surplus sauerkraut ? for $1000 in sauerkraut money . Sauerkraut is ready money up in Minnesota , and these cloth merchants can dicker around and get their cash . " But what are you going to do with all that heavy cloth ? " I asked Dictator Mecklenburg . " Well , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into heavy mackinaw coats , and we know where we can trade them to the company store of a beet-sugar factory just outside the city limits for $r000 worth of sugar . Sugar is rife of the hardest things to get hold of without having real United States currency . You see , ? e do n't want to touch real money . We 've done two or three hundred thousand dollars ' worth of business , and not more than s percent has been for real money . The rest has been in this sauerkraut money of ours ? barter and scrip that we 've printed ourselves . We pay our men and women in scrip and then they trade it out . But put on your coat and I 'll take you over to headquarters . " On the way over I asked him how the whole scheme vas conceived . He hesitated before he answered . " Let 's see , " he began . " In 1931 and in the spring of 1932 our church had been sort of dabbling at relief . We helped 4000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we were n't really getting anywhere . And then while I was driving home from the General Conference of the Methodist  | Episcopal Church held in Atlantic City last May the thought struck me over and over again that here in this land of plenty starvation was rampant , and nobody was really doing anything about it . What was the use of preaching , if real deeds did n't follow ? And then finally it came to me like a blow that I myself should do something about it ; that it was up to me . " Well , I spent a month in the library reading everything I could find on barter and exchange . I went clear back to the Eighth Century , and I discovered that wherever a barter system had been used extensively they 'd always hit on some sort of scrip . I did n't talk over my idea with any one except my wife and an unemployed Pullman conductor named Earl Leuth , now Secretary-Treasurer of our organization . " Czar Mecklenburg chuckled and then went on : " Finally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I got busy . For a week I spoke over our radio about the necessity of really doing something and then I called a meeting of business men and people of affairs . That was the first week of last August , and 1500 gathered in the church auditorium . I explained my idea of a self-help organization of unemployed , using our own scrip instead of real money . They jumped at it . " Within two weeks we had hundreds of volunteers making a complete survey of the unemployed situation for all Minneapolis . We appointed committees for each of the thirteen city wards , and they in turn selected a ward chairman and a captain for each precinct . Then we got busy . " The first job was food . Scouts were sent out into the country to find where they could trade labor for produce ? potatoes , cabbage , vegetables , and wood . They worked on shares ; they repaired motors , fixed-fences , painted houses ? anything and everything that would get the produce . They found worthless old trucks and repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In each ward canning groups were formed ; 20,000 quarts of vegetables were  | canned , and the women paid from 20 to 30 cents an hour for their work in good scrip . Hundreds of men were sent to the woods , and thousands of cords cut and hauled to wood yards in the city where they were sawed up . From the School Board they got permission to use the rambling , old , unused and condemned Vocational High School ? and then got the city Engineers to " uncondemn " it . This they turned into headquarters , and a store , restaurant , shops , and hotel . ' I hat building interested me greatly . On the right as you enter is a regular bank , run by unemployed accountants ? only scrip is used instead of United States currency . Next comes a store where you can buy for scrip pretty much the things you can in an ordinary store : bread ? baked from Red Cross flour and sold for the cost of the baking ? canned goods , staple groceries , new clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry cleaned and rebuilt , new and used shoes ? everything and anything . Only scrip is accepted . Down the hall to the left you enter a great room that looks a good deal like the Old Curiosity Shop come to life . One half the room is filled with rockers , chairs , beds , and house furnishings of every kind and description . On long tables in the opposite end are piled a thousand and one things ? silverware , books , candlesticks , pictures , cooking utensils , automobile tires , coffee grinders ? a pathetic heap of near-junk that has been brought here and bartered for the precious scrip that could be exchanged for food and wearing apparel . Then came the " white collar " restaurant . Here for ro cents in scrip you can get a thoroughly satisfactory meal . I ate my supper there and I hope I may always get as good an evening meal as that : fried liver and onions , a great helping of fried potatoes , two big slices of whole-wheat bread , a cup of coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They serve I200 to 1400 people a day there ? three full meals for 30 cents , three meals for an hour and a half 's work . Down in the great block-long basement you 'll find a dress-making shop with 24 power-driven sewing machines , a shoe shop , bakery , canned fruit storage room , and goodness knows what else . Upstairs is a hundred-bed hotel where for 15 cents in scrip a man gets a clean , comfortable bed and bath . Everywhere were surprises . A whole community was being taken care of here ? a self-helping , selfrespecting community where good , honest , surplus labor could be traded for the necessities of life . A mile or two away was a warehouse with thousands of pounds of potatoes , carrots , and cabbages , and hundreds of barrels of sauerkraut ? good , old , smelly sauerkraut money ? all left out of the original 6o,000 barrels of vegetables brought in last fall . In the yard outside 20 or 30 men were running four power saws , cutting self-help wood into foot lengths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods while others were hauling short lengths to retail customers ? and all done either by barter or by the use of scrip ! That scrip was as good as anybody 's money . I heard of the ramblings of one scrip $5 bill . It was paid an impoverished widow for 25 hours of work . That day her gas was being shut off for non-payment , and she simply had to have some hard cash . A kind-hearted neighborhood grocer agreed to trade her $5 in U. S. currency for her scrip bill . The widow paid her gas bill , and the grocer discovered that his dentist would take the Organized Unemployed scrip for dental work ? so he got his teeth fixed . The dentist in turn found that his job printer would accept scrip , so he bartered for SS worth of printing . The printer gave the scrip to a garage man for fixing his car , and the garage man turned it over to a barber for S5 in shaves and hair cuts and the barber brought it to the self-help store and bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That makes seven complete transactions $35 worth of jobs on that one little piece of printed paper . It 's like the house that Jack built . And speaking of houses , the Organized Unemployed , Inc. could even do that for you ? if you had something you could swap for their labor . Among the 7000 members 45 labor guilds have been formed , each of which runs its own affairs , proportions its own jobs , and pretty well looks after itself . Hundreds of rundown apartment houses are being redecorated in trade for rent ; the men are paid in scrip and then the rent checks are traded for other work . And I must n't forget to tell of the young man I talked to in the restaurant kitchen , who in September paid for his wedding license in scrip and then gave the minister S2 in scrip for marrying him . And now he 's figuring on a " scrip " baby and has told the furniture exchange man to keep his eye out for a good " scrip " baby carriage . Apparently there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading surplus labor for surplus articles . For instance a stove factory was running about 25 percent of capacity . It was arranged with the Organized Unemployed , Inc. to take over a good share of the output and pay in scrip . The factory owner explained to his men that if they would accept half their pay in scrip , he would give them twice as much work . The Organized Unemployed trade these stoves for all sorts of necessary things bacon , sugar , etc . And the great sweep of this barter scheme has only begun . It is a magnificent experiment in cooperation . Its possibilities are endless . Right now negotiations are under way with the American Trade Exchange , a farmers ' cooperative marketing association at Fergus Falls , Minnesota , to exchange clothing made by the Organized Unemployed for cattle and dairy products and grain and flour . This coming spring and summer branches will be established on farms , and there will be a mighty bartering between the country , and the city . ( Incidentally , Dreamer Mecklenburg and his 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Brothers , plans this spring to put rood ex-farmer families back on the soil . The city will pay their grocer 's bills for six months , and each Big Brother will stand sponsor for one family . ) Out of this vast and practical scheme no one makes any money . All profit is eliminated . All middlemen are done away with . Distribution costs are minimum . Because there are no profits and only surplus labor and surplus goods are dealt in , business men and merchants wish it well . If through self-help unemployed men can be kept off city charity it is money saved for the community . But it is vastly more than money saved it is human beings saved . Nothing in the world is more devastating to human character than unemployment and idleness . It brings on a sure and deadly progressive deterioration of family life . The head of the family develops an inferiority complex . He loses his self-confidence and then his self-respect . The wife and mother becomes nervous and critical . The children are undernourished and bewildered . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really believe , " Dr. Mecklenburg said to me , " that if the wives of unemployed could find jobs for themselves , there would be a veritable epidemic of divorce ? so frayed are the nerves . . . People everywhere ? church people , preachers , laymen ? must do something to help . The church offers a natural center and an organization . " I know that I got to the place where I simply had to stop preaching the gospel of the Man who fed the 5000 , or do something myself . I could n't go on preaching and see people hungry . I had to close up shop and run away from it all , or do something to help ? so I decided to do something . " I interrupted , " Do most preachers feel that way about it ? " " They 'll have to get around to it sooner or later , " he snapped . " If the church does n't rise to its new responsibilities , it will be a tragic failure . There is no time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must accept this new job of making Christianity a real social and economic force . " Then this extraordinary leader continued : " Of course , what we are doing here in this Organized Unemployed movement is a great experiment and adventure in self-help , and it may have a profound effect in teaching the benefits of cooperation . No one can tell how far afield it will lead us . But at best it by no means solves the whole problem of our faulty system of production and distribution . " He paused before he went on : " You know Capitalism is beginning to sense that there are only two roads that it can follow : one is along the trail of cooperative brotherhood ; the other is the red road of Bolshevism . There is no middle road . And right here in Minneapolis the group of rich people who we thought were against us ? I mean , against the whole new conception of Christianity 's duty toward common man ? well , they 're more and more on our side . They realize that the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the way out . " I figure it 's up to the church to show the  | way . The church is the place to inspire men to do something for humanity . A preacher 's job is to get people to do deeds . " And the 1933 brand of preachers is doing it , too . Take the case of a slender , 4z-year-old preacher named Edwin A. Brown , over in Cleveland , Ohio . His Broadway Church sits in the midst of 25,000 workers , representing over 30 nationalities , but predominately Bohemian . Two years ago , more than half of them were out of work ? that figure would probably have run as high as 70 to 8o percent today . Something had to be done . At first there was the usual effort to give out food and help to the most desperate . But it failed to touch the spot . To be effective it must be cooperative , this man Brown , who had been through the fire of industrial disputes on the side of the workers ? quickly figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neighborhood . Creed or rank meant nothing ; it was human life they were dealing with . The problem of what to do and how to do it was put squarely up to the men themselves . Food was the first and primary necessity . One man told of a milk concern that was pouring its skimmed milk into the sewer ; another , of a bakery company that was selling its stale bread to farmers to feed to their hogs ; a third , of how grocers punched holes in their dented canned goods and threw them into the dump heaps . Committees were formed ? made up mostly of unskilled day laborers ? to see what could be done toward salvaging these wasted foods . The milk company ? a farmers ' cooperative ? agreed to turn over 10o gallons of skimmed milk free each week . This amount has since been raised to 18o gallons and is distributed free in the basement of the church . The twodays-old bread was bought and resold for 2 cents a loaf ? now discontinued on account of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without cost and redistributed to the most needy . JITH the coming of spring of 1932 Brown and his committees of working men figured out how they might operate a cooperative vegetable farm . From the city they obtained a thirty-acre tract , and an implement company furnished a tractor and plows to plow the land . The rest of the work was done by hand . Exactly 45 men joined this farming venture . They were divided into three groups of 15 men each . A barn was fixed up as a dormitory and cook house , equipment secured one way and another , and the great adventure undertaken . Despite droughts , insects , and inexperience , each man received for his share , after all expenses were paid , 9 bushels of potatoes , 300 pounds of cabbage , 9 bushels of tomatoes , I z bushel of shelled white beans , and enough vegetables to can loo quarts . But the real crop could n't begin to be computed ; it had to do with health and hope and a fresh outlook . " You 've sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Mr. Brown at the end of the first week that her man had been in the country . Each man had 6 full weeks of this healthy outdoor work . And this coming summer the group hope to have 5o to 6o acres and double their number and yield . That 's part of the grown-up picture : Look for a moment at the children 's side of the story . Many of these children have been living in homes where neither parent has had work for three years . They are , without exception , undernourished and spiritually underfed . About a year ago Rev. Brown was called to a poor home to baptize a child of four who had never recovered from an attack of infantile paralysis and only recently had fallen and broken his right thigh bone . His leg was-still in a cast , and the poor little fellow simply was failing to make the grade . The minister postponed the baptism , and that afternoon while he was having his teeth fixed spoke about the @#  | sad case to the remarkable Dr. Weston A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teeth and bone . The kindly genius became interested , called on the boy , prescribed and furnished the means for a proper diet ? and the other day , when I saw this child , he was as normal as any boy . Dr. Price was now interested in these children of the unemployed and , with the help of a volunteer corps of dentists , examined 750 school children and almost without exception found their teeth needed attention , and that they were not getting the proper tooth-building foods . Obviously there was not the means at hand to tackle the problem of caring for all these children . The next best thing was to pick out some 40 of the worst cases and give them free health luncheons . Dr. Price did this and from his own means supplied the cod-liver oil and a special butter rich in Vitamin D. The church group supplied the milk and whole-wheat biscuits and the wholesome simple food . But all that has to do with the material side of the help given . There 's another important side the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too of these unemployed men gather in the basement of the Broadway church to talk things over . There 's usually a set talk by an outside speaker , then the meeting is thrown open to discussion ? and the sky is the limit . The particular evening I was there a young minister just returned from a trip through Soviet Russia spoke on Communism . When he had finished , there was a tidal wave of questions and tense debate ? then I was called on to speak my piece . I said exactly what I thought and then tried to defend my position . I have never heard a freeer or franker discussion of this " dangerous " subject . And this was in a church , with the minister acting as chairman and referee . When it was all over , I congratulated Preacher Brown on his broadminded tolerance . i " What else is there to do but make this a living church ? " he answered . " We must challenge the pagan ethics of our present economic system . The church of Christ simply has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear to see people suffer . We must win people by life and deed ? and not by preaching . We must embark on a great adventure in the realm of human contacts . After all , the supreme concern of Jesus was for human life . And I keep asking myself , Can I be a real Christian when my neighbors are hungry and cold and losing their homes and are discouraged to the point of suicide ? ' " THIS able Rev. Brown is only one of thousands who are asking this same question . Out on the northwest edge of the factory district of Chicago a young , red-headed , fighting parson named N. B. Waltmire is shouting it at the top of his voice . His church is poor and rests in the center of a Scandinavian and Polish neighborhood , with between 8o and 90 percent of the men unemployed . " I 've been trying to apply the system of Jesus to our economic and social life , " he explained to me . " We 're doing our best to adapt the church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of greatest need . " We did n't have any means to do much more than give lunches to the most undernourished children , and to make clothing for the destitute , and to do little things like this . But we could give these discouraged and broken men some means of organized protest against the present iniquities and injustices . A group of us thought it over and finally organized the Chicago Workers ' Committee on Unemployment . We formed the first unit in this church . Here we have some 200 men paying , if and when they can , to cents dues a month . We have our weekly business meetings where we take up the problem of immediate and pressing relief cases , and stand as a buffer in eviction cases . We hear our Committee on propaganda , and then decide on our social and educational features . We have taken our religion down from high pulpits to the level of common men and their human problems . " This red-headed fighter looked me squarely in the eyes . " I look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity , " he went on slowly . " One of two things will happen : either our greedy competitive system will dominate and drive out the spirit of Christ in life and the church ? or the spirit of Christ will change the present system . I preach much of this in my pulpit and in our unemployed group I teach this , because I feel that right now the burning issue is the correct solution of our economic problem . And either we must solve this problem by some sort of cooperative brotherhood , or the world will sink back into new Dark Ages , with farmers turned into peasants and city workers sinking into degradation . " These were burning words . They put squarely up to the organized church the tremendous task of saving a world from chaos and ruin . " If the church fails , " this fighter went on , " the world will fail . No honest preacher or priest or rabbi can dodge the square-cut issue . Something must be e'one right now towards remaking this sorely pressed world . The church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new injection of the real spirit of Jesus , the brave and uncompromising revolutionary leader . " THIS fiery challenge was still ringing in my ears as I drove out to Dr. Ernest Tittle 's great million and a half dollar church plant in the midst of rich Evanston . The youthful redheaded radical preacher had received me in a humble little study that was half bedroom and half library . Dr. Tittle 's office had Oriental rugs on the floor and oil paintings on the wall . But the hearts of these two men of Faith were beating with the same fears and hopes . " Religion is a way of life , " this great and wise minister said to me . " That means that religion must touch every kind of human relationship . Religion believes man is sacred ; therefore religion can not consent to man 's exploitation . We must have great social changes , but they must be brought about by education rather than by force and violence . " And all this , I claim , is news of the highest order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church that wandered far away from life and common human needs now goes back into life . It is opening its windows to the winds of the living world ? the world of 1933 . It is facing facts . It begins to dreamagain ? to dream of people and of helping them solve their real problems . It needs more brave men , churchmen and laymen alike , to hold high the banners calling for a New Deal , a New Christianity , a New Fighting Spirit . The world can not wait . Its problems and its creaky economic machinery must be readjusted , reoiled , and possibly rebuilt . Halfway measures of relief and charity are only temporary stop-gaps ; the big job is yet to be done . It is the organized churches ' great opportunity for leadership . It is their opportun- , ity to regain the lost hold on millions of disillusioned men and women . Already the church that so many of us turned from , because of its aloofness and inadequacy , is giving to a confused and bewildered world a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only started . Instead of the present five or ten percent of preachers and priests thinking and preaching the new gospel of economic justice , there must be ten , twenty times that number . If I were a praying man , I would say : " 0 Lord , give us more leaders with the imagination and courage of the Mecklenburgs and Browns and Waltmires and Tittles ? and fewer politicians and stuffed shirts . Amen . "
