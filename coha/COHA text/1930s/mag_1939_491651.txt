F LATBUSH AVENUE , Brooklyn . A young man took off his hat . " Excuse me , sir , but I 'd Like to ask you a few questions . " The elderly man peered at him . " Shoot , son . " " Well , do you think that Congress or the President should determine the gold content of the dollar ? " The elderly man was indignant . " Why , the President , naturally ! He 's the figurehead of the nation . He should do the figurin ' ! " On a sheet of paper headed THE AMEBIC/U.4 INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC OPINION WANTS YOUR OPINION , the young man put a sober cross in a square marked " President . " Next morning a brisk girl in Princeton , New Jersey , found the sheet on her desk . As she glanced at it , her fingers flickered over the buttons of a tabulator . Keys punched slots in a card . The card tripped keys in another tabulator . A man in shirt sleeves jotted down a figure , a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There Dr. George H. Gallup discussed them with his associates and dictated a short statement . Three days later , sixty-four newspapers informed their 7,000,000 readers that 86 per cent of the nation believed that Congress , not the President , should determine the gold content of the dollar . The woolly-witted old Brooklynite was not lost in this shuffle of cards and papers . When the tabulator threshed out his sheet , it threw away his chain of thought , but kept his conclusions . To be sure , it kept them only as an infinitesimal component of a digit , but this is all that Doctor Gallup wants of anyone . He would want no more of the president of Harvard . And President Conant 's conclusion would carry preeisely the same weight as the Brooklynite 's . Like death and horse racing , the Gallup poll makes all men equal . R Manhattan Dark Horse T WO of the men it made equal , popular opinion to the contrary , were Governor Lehman , of New York , and District Attorney Dewey , in their recent campaign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds on his election went as high as 17 to 5 , and there were even-money bets that he would win by 400.000 votes . Gallup warned that these odds were far out of line ; his poll showed that the two candidates were equal to a hair 's breadth , but the press scoffed at him , almost to a paper . Two weeks before election , Lehman was out in front by of 1 per cent . Then Dewey started to overhaul him ; the Friday before election day , he was perceptibly ahead . When he telephoned , Gallup told him so . " But it does n't mean a thing , " he added . " Wait till the President 's speech is over . " The President spoke that night in behalf of Lehman . Gallup took another poll next morning , asking only three questions : " How are you voting ? Did you listen ? Did it change you ? " One person in every hundred admitted the speech had made him change to Lehman . Gallup knew this proportion , small as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't have the heart to tell Dewey himself ; he asked one of his assistants to break the news . Then he released his final prediction : Lehman would get 50.2 per cent of the major-party vote . Living by the Law of . Rverages T HAT Tuesday New York State cast nearly five million votes , of which 2,391,286 , or 50.68 per cent , were for Lehman . Gallup was wrong by 48-190ths of I per cent  --  a slightly smaller impurity than that in Ivory Soap . It was even smaller than Gallup had counted on . He does n't claim to be able to come nearer than 3 per cent ; this is his normal expectancy of error . It exists because there are factors in voting which the most shrewdly devised system of polling can not cover . Two of them are the condition of the weather and the honesty of the count . In the Lehman-Dewey vote , fair weather upstate in the Republican districts would have meant a better turnout for Dewey , enough to make the election even closer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swing the election the other way . Gallup got the breaks that time , but he is resigned to having them go against him in sonic other close fight . Shaking his head , he says , " You live by the sword and die by the sword in this business . The law of averages shows that the law of averages will prove me wrong , and it 's a law you ca n't repeal . " The photo finish of the New York race was dramatic , and the accuracy of the poll brought Gallup a lot of acclaim , but he was doing a harder job at the same time , and is prouder of his success . Not the job of predicting senatorial and other gubernatorial elections , although he hit fifty-six out or sixty , but the job of predicting elections to the House . It would have been impossibly laborious and expensive to poll each of the 435 congressional districts and yet , at first glance , that seemed the only reliable method . But Gallup took a second glance and it suggested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did so . The poll revealed that the Republican candidates as a group were stronger than they had been in 1936 by a national average of five voters out of a hundred . The next step was to cheek how many Democratic and third-party congressmen had been elected by such small margins in 1036 that this shift might mean their defeat in 1938 . He found that there were seventy-five , and predicted accordingly . The Republicans gained eighty-one seats . As a footnote , Gallup also announced that if the election had been held the preceding November , only forty-six would have lost their seats ; but if it had been held the preceding May , ninety-five would have lost thorn . The popularity of the New Deal is closely parallel to the popularity of its chief , according to Gallup 's polls . He has been checking on Roosevelt every month since February , 1934 . At that time , 69 per cent of the electorate was for him , but by the summer of 1935 , after he had kept Congress in session with his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , its all-time low . It hovered around the middle 50 's until Landon made his first radio speech after being nominated , then shot up immediately and continued to rise until it hit 65 . It fell again in February , 1937 , when the court-packing plan was proposed , and it has been in the middle 50 's ever since . Significantly , Roosevelt can always give his index a small temporary rise by going fishing . Gallup believes that this is because people enjoy a respite from controversy . They like fighting men , but not men who are forever fighting . That 's one of the reasons they do n't like John L. Lewis  --  they consider him a troublemaker  --  aud one of the reasons why Cordell Hull is the most popular member of the Cabinet . For more than three years now , the nation has paid Gallup for reading its political and economic tea leaves . His first such reading can be dated exactly . On October 20 , 1935 , Director George H. Gallup , of the American Institute of Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of the electorate thought that the New Deal was costing too much . This unfriendly utterance might have been ignored , but for the fact that it made the front pages of thirty-five important newspapers . Moreover , the institute arrogantly proclaimed that this was the first scientific measurement of the voters ' minds , and promised to take similar measurements weekly on other national problems . For politicians , its title , " America Speaks ! " had an ominous sound . The New Dealers fumed for a few days , then Charlie Michelson , their press agent , wrote patronizingly , " You will look in vain for the name of Dr. George Gallup in Who 's Who . " He dismissed the institute as a feeble Republican plot to discredit the Administration . All good voters were advised to await the opening of the Literary Digest poll " adequate , honest , unbiased and unmanipulated . " No voter awaited that poll more anxiously than Gallup , who had sold his service to newspapers on a money-back guaranty that it would be more nearly accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bided his time . Landon was nominated on Tune 11 , 1936 . On July twelfth , Gallup warned his subscribers that the Literary Digest 's old-fashioned polling methods would point to the wrong man . Almost as an afterthought he mentioned that its totals would show about 56 per cent for Landon , 44 per cent fur Roosevelt . Inasmuch as the poll was not to begin for six weeks , Wilfred J. Funk , editor of the Digest , was outraged . " Never before has anyone foretold what our poll was going to show before it even started ! " he snapped . " Our fine statistical friend " should be advised that the Digest would carry on " with those old-fashioned methods that have produced correct forecasts exactly one hundred per cent of the time . " Passing a Crisis ALLUP stuffed this blast , too , into his Dirty U1 Editorials file and went on compiling his own figures . From the very beginning they had indicated Roosevelt as a certainty . The shade of the litmus was varying from week to week , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He got paler and paler as November drew nearer . It was n't for want of confidence in his methods or results , but because his whole life hung on them . Besides , the outside pressure was increasing daily . Half the newspapers subscribing to his service were anti-New Deal , and their readers thought they were being betrayed . They wrote Gallup by the thousand : " It ca n't be a national poll . I have n't received a ballot . What 's more , nobody in my neighborhood has ! " Editors wired angrily for instructions on how to use his figures . Gallup 's reply was invariable : " Run them 66 beside the Digest 's . " The Dirty Editorials file became full to bursting . The most abusive editorials , he noticed , were from small-town papers . He was not surprised ; small towns are usually conservative . But he was distressed at the volume of abuse from Iowa , his home state . He began to suffer from insomnia . Lying sleepless , his thoughts wore this groove : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now , my institute is ruined . All the swell young people I 've hired will be thrown out of work . All my previous research will be suspected . It will take me years to live down the mistake , if I can ever live it down . But where could the mistake oecur ? Let'e see now ? " The result was that he had worked himself into such a state by the end of October that Mrs. Gallup shanghaied him to Sarasota for a rest . He did n't get it . Some of his Republican friends who had heard him say that there was " always a reasonable doubt " reported it to Republican headquarters , and headquarters construed this as meaning that he doubted his own figures . Forty-eight hours before the election , they telephoned him at Sarasota , asking authority to make the announcement , in the hope of attracting the bandwagon vote . Gallup , ordinarily mild , was infuriated . " If you do , " he told them , " I 'll release the true odds on Roosevelt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver . Election day , he bought a radio and installed it in his hotel room . After the movies that night he tuned in and waited , dry-smoking nervously . Presently the first return came over , from a small town in Massachusetts . The day 's vote was given , and the vote in the election of 1932 . Gallup checked them against his own estimates ; the swing to Roosevelt was exactly in proportion . He knew he was home . He switched off the radio , split a bottle of champagne with his wife , and went to bed . 58 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 27 , 1950 It was five weeks before he was well enough to resume work . During that time the Digest was going quietly broke . It had not only backed the wrong horse ; its 20 per cent error was within 1 per cent of Gallup 's cocksure prophecy back in July . Gallup 's own figure was 6% per cent off . Still , when Charley Michelson thumbed through the now Who 's Who , he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History of a Prophet This brash young fellow who makes a. profession of climbing out on a limb , teetering there amid cheers and jeers , and then bringing back the apple , is a farm boy , now thirty-seven years old . Just under six feet , just under 200 pounds , he is a roomy man , with the measured tread and hunched shoulders of a plowman . His eyes are slate-blue . Straight on , he looks not unlike Dizzy Dean . Certainly he looks nothing like ? the common conception of a research scientist . He was born in Jefferson , Iowa , on November 18 , 1901 . " George Horace " or not , his childhood friends call him " Ted . " Much of his personal mail is addressed to " Theodore Gallup . " Not even his wife knew until last summer where the nickname came from  --  a feud between his nurse and his father . Prophetically , it was a political feud . More so , it was a feud over a Roosevelt . To Mr. Gallup , Theodore Roosevelt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter than St. Michael . Her revenge for having to hear her hero defamed was to tack his nickname onto the son of his defamer . She tacked it so firmly that it has never been dislodged . The elder Gallup was a speculator in ranch and farm lands who spent the latter part of his life developing a new system of Fogies His sou says , " He was the most intellectual man I ever knew ; someday I 'm going to articulate the trunkful of manuscripts he left and see that his intelligence is recognized . My whole professional career has been devoted to getting ideas across to people and from them . Father wa-s completely unable to do either . " He was , however , able to start what his son refers to as " my good old standard double-A education . " It was also a start in journalism . Young Gallup published his first article when he was in high school  --  a condemnation of the school board which brought the town down on his neck . But it was only a start . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa when his rather went bankrupt in the collapse of the Iowa land boom in 1920 . Gallup managed to hang on through the next two years with the help of a nonathletic scholarship and a **25;1489;TOOLONG job tending towels in the gymnasium . Senior year , he was made editor of The Daily Iowan . Until then , it had been like any other undergraduate paper . From then on it was out , - standing . Gallup fattened it up with a , national wire service and coverage of local news , built a new plant to fit it , and sold enough advertising to pay the tab . Again the town came down on his neck ; Iowa City 's local newspaper did n't like the competition . But the university came down with a reward  --  a school of journalism whose staff included Gallup ( B.A. , ' 23 ) and William S. Maulsby , one of his former professors , and later the first paid employee of the institute . To tempt students to enroll , they invented seventeen different courses " But I taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped organize Quill and Scroll , an international honorary society for high-school journalists which now has around a thousand chapters . On the side , Gallup picked up a master 's degree in psychology and pegged away at his hobby  --  a method for aceuratelygau gin g reader interest in newspapers and magazines . Convinced that editors not only did n't know their renders ' preferences but did n't know how to determine them , he spent six years and discarded fifty trial methods before he found one that satisfied him . This method , now known as " the Gallup Method , " he made the subject of his thesis for a doctor 's degree , written in 1928 . The degree was only a by-product of this remarkable document . The chief products were the picture magazine Look , the first advertisement in the form of a comic strip , and the American Institute of Public Opinion . It was , in short , the springboard from which Gallup jumped from local to national recognition . The method is dazzlingly simple . The way to learn what interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to learn what they read is to hand them a newspaper or magazine and ask them to go over it with you . Says Maulsby , " No one but Gallup would bother to do a thing like that . " Who Reads the Funnies ? Since his research was being financed by the Cowles brothers , publishers of the Des Moines Register &; Tribune , he handed people this paper . The survey established two facts : That . interest in comics and pictures was tremendous , and that most adults , too , read the comics . The Register &; Tribune had planned to economize on these features . It now bought more of them . It also experimented with the rote section , arranging the pictures to tell a story . Circulation soared . Presently the roto section began to run away with the rest of the paper . A national magazine of nothing but pictures was indicated . They named it " Look . " Gallup was so excited by the success of his discovery that he conducted other surveys and published them in trade magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a test , Hearst offered the advertising agencies a page of his syndicated comic section , Young &; Rubicam , of New York , snapped it up for a breakfast food . It was the first full-page commercial comic , and it pulled in enough purchasers to make Raymond Ruisie.ani grab his bat and set out on Gallup 's trail . He found him teaching journalism at Northwestern - University . Gallup asked assurance that his findings would be accepted , favorable or not , and that he would n't be used for sales promotion . He joined the firm in June , 1932 . The Philosophy of Selling He was short on advertising technique , but his surveys made him long on what people who read the ads thought about them . Here are some of his findings : If you 're selling with printed matter , break it into short paragraphs ; lighten it with conversation ; sprinkle it with italics . If you 're selling with pictures , make them pictures of people , not products ; and if they are n't photographs , the drawings should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the radio . Gallup 's interviewers dragged 250,000 radio fans to the telephone last year and asked them what programs they had been listening to , and why . They do similar jobs for some of the magazines too . A story in a woman 's magazine attracted the greatest proportion of readers they ever found-60 per cent . Gallup attributes its pull to its title : Love in the Moonlight  --  The Woman Who Knew What She Wanted and Got It . From none of these fields , however , does Gallup harvest anything but statistics . Nothing else there has the slightest subjective interest for him . He is the world 's ranking authority on comic strips , yet he refuses to read them himself and fusses because his children spend so much time over them . He has redrawn the fiction and art patterns of half a dozen magazines , yet all magazines bore him . So do all radio programs except news broadcasts . So do the movies , although he is about to make a survey of the industry . Re would probably be happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor and try to outthink New York 's best newspapermen , spotting stories they are missing . One of his best " beats " was scored during the recent war scare in Europe , when he sent out an office boy to buy a gas mask . The boy reported , as alert city editors should have proclaimed . that one was n't to be had in the city . Gallup might have turned to journalism if it had n't been for his mother-in-law . Mrs. Ola Babcock Miller . The widow of the publisher of the Washington , Tows ? Democrat , she ran for Iowa 's secretary of state on the Democratic ticket in 1932 . The campaign was curious in that Mrs. Miller did not make one . She did not need to . In a strongly Republican state , she became the first woman to hold the office , and was twice reelected before her death in 1937 . Gallup began to speculate whether his surveys could forecast such odd changes in public opinion , For his own amusement. , he compiled the voting records of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ballots late in 1933 . When he checked the estimates he based on them against the official returns from the congressional elections of 1934 , he found that they matched within I per cent . " I had a system , " he said , " but I did n't know what to do with it . " Fortunately , he happened to mention it to Harold It Anderson , a Chicago broker of newspaper features and the agent for Gallup 's surveys . Anderson knew a good thing when he saw it . He managed to convince Gallup that he had hit on something more than an ingenious parlor game . They put in enough of their capital to establish the institute , summoned Maulsby to New York , and installed him in a one-room office with a desk , a typewriter and a telephone . The day the office opened , Anderson made three calls to California at a cost of $150 . The next day they spent satisfying the telephone company that they were n't a race-track tipster service . Gallup went sheepishly to Rubicam , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pay cut . Rubicam , too , knew a good thing when he saw it . He waived the pay cut in return for a promise of no more side lines , and in 1937 he made Gallup a vice-president of the agency and a stockholder . Meanwhile , Gallup undertook to help sell the service to newspapers . One Midwest publisher heard him through and denounced the whole idea as the dream of " a young upstart . " Gallup kept on talking . The publisher ended by buying the service and comparing him with Edison . Eugene Meyer , of the Washington Post , hired a blimp to cruise over the city on the day of the institute 's first release , trailing a banner with its theme phrase , " America Speaks ! " That first release was the one in which Gallup reported a general protest against the New Deal 's extravagance . When astonished political writers asked for a description of his polling method , he said only , " It varies . " Hour to Analyze America More informatively , it consists in selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a miniature electorate , faithfully representing the views of all voters . In essence , it is like taking a blood test . Gallup himself calls it a cross section . On national questions , one of these groups must be chosen from each state , since the voting population of each state has a different structure , There are six controls , or " breakdowns , " for a cross section : Geographieal  --  urban and rural  --  economic , age , sex , color and political . These are basic for each state , though the percentages differ , of course , from state to state . Put all forty-eight cross sections together and you have the nation 's vote . Gallup declares that anyone could take his system and get his results . Anyone , then , should be able to take his Illinois cross section  --  which fol .. lows  --  aed make an accurate prediction of the state 's vote . The number of voters polled is unimportant  --  Gallup would poll about 3000 ? but they would have to fit the percentages exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : L GEOGRAPHICAL Chicago and suburbs Farmers Small towns Cities 2500 to 10,000 Cities 10,000 to 100,000 ( Includes Peoria ) . . 141 100% ?

To keep the phrasing of a question from influencing the answer , he sometimes puts it in two ways , so that half the ballots act as a check on the others . For instance , half his ballots asked , " Do you approve of Secretary Hull 's policy in seeking a reciprocal trade agreement with Great Britain ? " The other half , " If Great Britain reduces tariffs on American goods , should we reduce tariffs on British goods ? " In this case , the answers matched exactly : 73 per cent voted " yes " on each question . He also provides for voters with vigorous opinions by letting them check a large-size YES or No in preference to normal ones . Thereby he learns which side will put up a stiffer fight . The innovation has been particularly popular with anti-New Dealers , he has found , Objectors to the court-packing plan ran heavily to the emphatic Noes ; its supporters were content with mild Yeses .

Opinion Research maintains a field staff of more than 700 canvassers , scattered strategically over the country .

If he Lives in Chicago , he will interview about 40 per cent of his quota on the streets in good weather . So presently you find him with his foot on the running board of a truck idling at the curb .

" A former sand hog in New York said , " I 'm all off Roosevelt because I 'm developing heart trouble on this WPA job . I 'm used to good hard sand-hog work under pressure , and this WPA work is too easy . " To the question , " Do you think that insane persons and habitual criminals should be sterilized ? " a woman in Seattle answered , " Yes , I 'm in favor of everybody 's using soap . " A canvasser with a strong Maine accent was surveying part of South Carolina about automobiles .

What Americans Think Once a canvasser reported being nearly mobbed . Gallup was making a survey to find out what the country people thought about a campaign for stamping out syphilis . They knew so little about the disease that they would n't let the canvasser go until he had told them as much as he was able . " They 'd never been given adequate information about it , " Gallup says . " The voters are far ahead of the politicians on social questions . If they had been given a chance to speak , syphilis would have been wiped out a. generation ago . " About 15,000 voters are given a chance to speak in Gallup 's national polls . He can complete an ordinary one in from eight to ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed through in forty-eight hours , by having the vote wired in . The canvassers  --  mostly college graduates , lawyers , schoolteachers , and so on  --  are paid sixty-five cents an hour , which puts the field cost of each ballot at just under thirty cents and raises the overhead of the institute to around 8300,000 a year . This includes Gallup 's salary of about $10,000 . The bill is paid by newspapers subscribing to the service , some of them buying it at $500 a week . Few newspaper services are as expensive , but Gallup wonders if he is charging enough . From his more than 1000 surveys , Gallup has collected an interesting dossier of presumed American thought . EVENING POST Seventy-five per cent of the voters believe in life after death  --  one old fellow said that he did n't know , but he 'd soon find out . Forty per cent dislike swing music , but 10 per cent do n't know what it is . Seventy per cent want the distribution of birth-control literature made legal . Sixty per cent would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanently . The same number would n't make a round trip to Europe by plane , even if it was a free ride . Eighty-nine per cent favor Government old-age pensions for the needy . Fifty per cent believe Toni Mooney guilty , but nearly everybody wants him pardoned . Sixty-six per cent would n't vote for a woman for President . The same number want sit-down strikes made illegal . Seventy-seven per cent blame Germany for starting the World War and are opposed to giving back her colonies . Nearly everybody thinks America should stay out of the next European war . Thirty-two per cent ca n't swim . And hardly five per cent agree on the same cause of the Depression . A National Scorekeeper By establishing what people thought about a subject yesterday and think about it today , Gallup is convinced that he can predict what they will think about it tomorrow . He insists that public opinion changes slowly , unless given sudden impetus by an event like Hitler 's invasion of Austria , and that continual recording of opinions on important issues will end such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mandate to prolong prohibition . He considers himself a political scorekeeper . When the public knows the score , it is more interested in the game . As he sees it .. the more interested , the more vigilant ; the more vigilant the public is , the less chance a professional politician has of pulling a piece of roguery . Gallup argues that the old political machines are running down and wearing out . The swing to the Democrats in the 1930 election was no greater in states where they were well organized than in states where they were n't organized at all . If this scorekeeper idea is carried through , the presidential nominations and campaigns of 1940 will be as much of an empty formality as the Electoral College is now . Gallup will run trial heats to determine the best vote getters in every party , and then match them up in a final poll . The day of choosing a candidate in a smoke-filled room will be over . The shrill slogan , the sweating delegation , the torchlight procession , all will be flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its offices soberly and responsibly . It is Gallup 's favorite dream . Meanwhile , he is constantly trying to reduce his margin of error , not by changing his basic procedure , but by correcting his formulas . He has learned that special circumstances require special adjustments . In the New York gubernatorial election last year , he tentatively added race and religion to his other controls . The wisdom of the experiment was proved when a canvasser instructed to question no one but Jews found that they were 100 per cent for Lehman . If a Catholic were Jonoary 21 . F9.112 again nominated for the presidency , these new controls would be vital . He is also learning more about election turnouts . He explains his underestimate of Roosevelt 's plurality in 1936 by the fact that . he allowed for a 10 per cent increase of the have-not vote over 1932 and got an increase of 16 per cent . The Digest made its fatal mistake , he says , in not recognizing that the have-not vote even existed . He was able to call its shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners  --  the class which would mail back most of the Digest 's ballots . Gallup thinks it could have halved its error simply by polling 100 voters at random . His favorite story of that campaign is about the millionaire New York Republican who hired his own accountants to check the Digest 's honesty and then bet $60,000 on Landon . Only a sucker would take the short end of an election bet , after listening to Gallup . He figures that fifteen factors can keep a horse from winning a race , but in a national election the equivalent of a 5-to-1 shot at the track is no better than 50-to-1 . Short-end takers ought to realize that their candidates ' chances have to be doped , state by state , in relation to each state 's percentage of the electoral vote . Failing that , it would be cheaper for them to conduct a private poll of Summit County , Utah . It would n't cost much ; Summit County numbers only 2500 families , mostly silver miners . Its distinction is that since 1900 it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In 1912 it went for Taft . In the last three presidental elections , it represented the national vote for each candidate within 1 per cent . Gallup occasionally uses the county to check the rest of his poll . Gallup 's critics give him credit for his discoveries in averages and their application , but they smile at his belief that all the answers can be found in the back of the book ; that you have only to ask the coal what kind of furnace it likes to be burned in . When the public feels strongly about a man or a tangible thing , it is easy to take its temperature . If a man dislikes spinach , Father Coughlin , Harold Ickes or any given movie actress enough , he could n't conceal his opinion if he wished . But the public feels strongly about few tangibles , and Gallup does n't stop there . When he explores its taste in intangibles , he takes off into space .

You flatter them when you ask their opinion , and the flattery makes them self-conscious . In that state , they invariably tell you either what they think you wish to hear , or what they think they ought to think , The questioner or the questionnaire can prompt them , consciously or unconsciously . If they saw a Western picture last night and enjoyed it more than most movies , they will tell you that Westerns are their favorite pictures , and believe it . In practice , howeVer , they may not like most Westerns , and the next picture for which they toss their hats will be one they had not foreseen . Ask them why they liked It Happened One Night . They liked it because they liked it . They can not tell you more , nor can the experts tell them , for Hollywood has made no second It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has to tell the producer whether it was successful or not ; what he needs to know is what the public wants before he makes it . He guesses either on instinct or past performance , or both , as he would pick horses , and the customer is no more predictable than the horse . Four years ago Gallup was invited to spend a week end with some friends who lived deep in New Jersey . .0n the way down , ho told his wife , " One thing I 'm not going to do is buy a farm . " Eighteen hours later he owned one between Hopewell and Princeton , and by this time he is the complete country squire . He has added property until ho has about 300 acres : Rubicam gave him a herd of Aberdeen Angus ; he raises soybeans ; and he would rather run a tractor than a poll . He ran a poll on account of his tractor last spring . It broke down , along with other expensive farm machinery , and Gallup wanted to find out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . He swore the village blacksmith could reproduce it at a fraction of the price . That was part of his tuition fee for learning the farm business . The other part , $450 , he paid a fast-talking Jersey native , who bought .500 worth of bay from him for $50 , telling him it was n't worth cutting . Gallup likes the life . He likes the fifty-minute commute to New York , because it gives him a chance to catch up on his reading . And he likes best the realization that the wheel has made a full turn  --  a Gallup is farming again . When the Forecaster Failed His mother 's French-Canadian ancestors were farmers , and his father 's ancestors farmed when they were n't at war . According to Gallup 's complicated genealogical charts , there were seven Gallups at . the Battle of Lexington . The family came from England in 1630 and settled on Gallup 's Island in Boston Harbor , where ships used to quarantine . Two summers ago , Gallup made a pilgrimage to England , to the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fifty-pound tavern sign which he found under a pile of potatoes in a barn . It dates from the fifteenth century , and says " Gollop Arms . Be Bolde Be Wyse . " He has freshened the paint on it , but does n't know what to do with it : " I 'd like to hang it at the front gate , but you do n't want people dropping in and ordering a hot dog and a beer , do you ? " Despite his interest in genealogy , despite his knowledge of the laws of probability , he has never been able to satisfy his wife 's desire for a pedigreed chow dog . He bought the last one from a Broadway huckster for five dollars . When it began looking less like a chow than a cross between a hooked rug and a donkey , Gallup named it Doe , after himself , as a reminder of his credulity . Mrs. Gallup is tolerant of most of his shortcomings  --  his tricks of sucking on an unlit cigarette , of being shamelessly late for appointments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about them , of addressing everyone in the household as " my friend . " ( Their daughter is an infant , but the two boys have already caught this habit . ) But she has broken him of bringing his office work to the dinner table . Once he was astonished to find her silver card tray on his desk in New York  --  seems ho had absently swept it into his bag along with a pile of papers he had left on the hall table . Everything on this desk is always mislaid , but never entirely lost . Statistics on a Statistician Not so his hats ; six of than disappear yearly ; he has no idea where . He replaces them with others won on election bets . A hat is all that his friends will bet with him any more . Absent-minded , soft-hearted  --  he has never been able to tire an employee  --  and mild-spoken , Gallup has a ferocious impatience with small talk and sly people . He abhors puns such as his being " monarch of all he surveys " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is also a ferocious self-determinist . He threw out of his office an insurance agent who proposed a policy to guarantee his children a college education . Gallup says they 'll work for it . For a while he toyed with the idea of offering , through a New York newspaper , a monthly prize of fifty dollars for the family submitting the best story of how it helped itself out . of its difficulties . Once he called his farm hands and told them how to vote in an election , but the next day he told them to ignore his instructions . He is n't to be pegged politically . He has voted for only two presidential candidates , La Follette and Smith , which would seem to put him loft of center , but both sides , all sides , irritate him . He has come out of an all-day advertising conference damning all businessmen , and he can damn the New Deal as cordially . His greatest delusion is that he can forecast the stock market . His greatest fear , that a competitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His greatest devotion , to his family , his home and his church . He says , " I could prove God statistically . Take the human body alone  --  the chance that all the functions of an individual would just happen is a statistical monstrosity . "
