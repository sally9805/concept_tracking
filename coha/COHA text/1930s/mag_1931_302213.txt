The last edition was just off the presses , the night shift of the Baltimore Post had just gone on duty one evening last week , when muffled explosions shook the composing room floor . Clouds of smoke bearing acrid fumes sent the printers flying for exits . Flames shot up the elevator shaft , mushroomed out through the four stories of the old triangular building . Some of the 35 occupants fought their way out through halls and stairways ; others made for the fire escapes . One linotype operator , Joseph Douglass , did not wait for firemen to raise a ladder , jumped from the third floor , died of his injuries . Two hundred firemen , working with ice-sheathed apparatus in a high wind , prevented the fire from spreading beyond the busy corner of Hanover &; Lombard Streets . But the Post building was completely wrecked . <P> Next day the Post 's publishers ( Scripps-Howard ) accepted the handsome offer of its rival Sun to publish from the Sun plant . Post and Sun have been friendly rivals since the Post was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when the Post abandoned its tabloid form to compete as a full-size evening paper .
