txt An alleged job-fixing business in which numerous candidates for jobs as patrolmen and firemen were induced to pay from $500 to $2,000 on assurances that they would pass their examinations and be placed on civil service lists of 1933 through 1936 was reported to Mayor La Guardia yesterday by William B. Herlands , Commissioner of Investigation . The commissioner 's report , as released from the Mayor 's office , made charges of grand larceny against Joseph A. Ruddy , former physical examiner for the Municipal Civil Service Commission and noted athlete and swimmer , and John J. Ellis of 91-14 172d Street , Jamaica , Queens , an electrician in a motion picture theatre , described by Mr. Herlands as Ruddy 's " contact man . " Ellis was arrested late yesterday in Mr. Herlands 's office by detectives of the District Attorney 's office after he had appeared there in the morning under subpoena and been questioned during the day . Later he was booked at the Oak Street station on a grand larceny charge and lodged in Police Headquarters for the night . Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey . Robert H. Thayer , assistant district attorney in charge of the indictment bureau , after a conference with Sidney Posner and Jerrold Seymann , legal assistants to Commissioner Herlands , announced he would present evidence in the case to the grand jury tomorrow . It was learned from the authorities that Ruddy was in California and had not been at his home , 179 East Seventy-ninth Street , for some time . He is said to have returned to New York last month to attend the funeral of his son , Ray Ruddy , noted Olympic swimmer , and gone back to California immediately . Charges based on a job-fixing investigation by Paul Blanshard , then Commissioner of Accounts , were filed against Ruddy in October , 1935 . The charges were withdrawn the following November and Ruddy retired on a pension . The Civil Service Commission , of which James E. Finegan , Justice of Special Sessions , was then president , explained it dropped the charges because Mr. Blanshard failed to show Ruddy ever accepted any money from aspirants , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been friendly with persons who brought aspirants for city jobs to him . At that time Richard A. Lundy , a relative of Ruddy , named with him in the charges filed with the commission by Commissioner Elan- " clients " for him , usually men who had failed to qualify in civil service examinations . The specific charge against both men was that they had received $100 each from John Carmody of 966 Third Avenue and John Flynn of 601 Oak Terrace , the Bronx . Jailed in Default of Bail Krakauer and Curcio were arraigned later in Felony Court and committed to the Tombs in default of bail . The police voiced the belief that the job-selling racket on the city subway system was widespread . Mr. Thayer expressed surprise that Krakauer , who is said to have a police record showing a felony conviction , was able to qualify for a civil service job on the city system . The cases of the two men , Mr. Thayer said , -. would be submitted to the grand jury soon . Efforts of Mr. Dewey 's aides to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight men under arrest may have placed some of the loot from the turnstiles were reported successful in two instances . It is understood that a court order will be asked in each of these cases for examination of the boxes . It was not disclosed whether either of the two safe deposit boxes was the one in which one of the men under arrest is reported to have cached $100,000 . The two former employes of the city system who were dismissed in June , 1937 , accused of rifling turnstiles are Edward J. Rigney of 97-16 221st Street , Queens Village , Queens , former maintenance man , and Leo J. Spellacy of 298 Bond Street , Brooklyn , a station agent . According to Mr. Dewey the records of their trial before Chairman John H. Delaney and Commissioner Frank X. Sullivan of the Board of Transportation on June 14 , 1937 , shows that they admitted stealing from the turnstiles . Mr. Dewey said he was anxious to know why the thefts were not reported for criminal prosecution , Caught Rifling Turnstile The charges against the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnstile registers in stations where Spellacy served as agent . The total amount said to have been stolen was $120 , which Rigney admitted he had shared equally with Spellacy . When the men were caught by Philip E. Pfeifer , operating superintendent , in the act of rifling a turnstile , $60 was found in the toe of one of Rigney 's shoes . The record , according to Mr. Dewey 's office , showed that each man said the other had suggested that the turnstiles be rifled . The confessions made by the pair , according to the record , showed that they had worked together at various stations , such as the Forty-sixth Street station in Queens , the Broadway-Nassau Street station in Manhattan and the Thirtyfourth Street station in Manhattan . Mr. Dewey was interested espe ? cially in a sentence in the Spellacy confession which , he said , read : " it has come to my attention that the manipulation of turnstiles on the line has been going on for at least six months and by hearsay for at least two years . " Officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dewey investigation , but it became known that they continued to believe that the estimate of $1,500,000 in thefts in three years was " preposterous imagination . " Because of the recent developments , it was indicated there soon will be a revamping of the methods used on the city system for recording , tabulating and checking fare collection returns of station agents . There will be also a revision of the system under which maintenance men perform their duty of inspecting and repairing turnstiles . The board is expediting the installation of fare registers which can not be turned back and in other ways is seeking to make impossible in the future the theft of fares through collusion of station agents and maintenance men ,
