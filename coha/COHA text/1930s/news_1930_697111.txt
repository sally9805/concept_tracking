txt Governor Roosevelt today sent to the Legisla ? ture a special veto message , apply ing to items aggregating $12,258,784 contained in the revised version of his main budget bill , which the Repiblican majority sent back to him after changing many items . The bulk of the appropriations ve. toed by the Governor are in the Department of Mental Hygiene and covered personal service at State hospitals . The veto covered also a large number of salary items in the Department of Education . The entire salary list of the first-named department fell under the Governor 's ban , the total being $11,514,679 . In the Department of Education items aggregating $288,360 , all for personal service , were vetoed . Some $24,000 of this sum , added by the fiscal committees to the amount appropriated in the Governor 's original budget , he indicated , had been deleted as not meeting his approval . To Reappropriate Sums . The entire amount vetoed for the Department of Mental Hygiene will have to be reappropriated in special bills and in a form acceptable to the Governor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive stated he would approve the items if they were submitted to him in proper form , and the Republicans are preparing reluctantly to act on this suggestion . The same is true with regard to the bulk of the appropriations for the Education Department , which Mr. Roosevelt rejected because of the form in which they appeared . Another item disapproved by the Governor provided for the expendi. ture of $55,000 by the State as its share in the cost of new sewers for the village of Newark , where the New York State custodial asylum for feeble-minded women is located . He recalled that in 1920 the State paid $20,000 to the village authorities who , in return , permitted the asylum to connect with the sewer system of the village in perpetuity . The capacity of the village sewer system is now declared to be overtaxed by the diecharge from the asylum . The Executive states that while he does not feel the State should seek necessarily to enforce the terms of the old contract , there was no in ? formation before him to show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will be the last person , " he said in his message , " to stand in the way of fair treatment to the village of Newark , and if all the facts warrant State aid . " Republicans Plan New Move . In all , it was estimated by the fiscal leaders , the Governor had vetoed for good items aggregating from $475,000 to $500,000 , mostly added to his budget by the Legisla. ture for salary increases or new posh . lions . Other items added by the Re ? publicans were approved . Indications are that the protracted wrangling at the present session and that of a year ago may lead the Republicans to try to enact a bill pre ? scribing a hard and fast form for Executive budgets of the future . Governor Roosevelt could exercise his veto power over any such measure . The differences between the Gov. governor and the Legislature over the appropriations for salaries in the State hospitals were summed up by , him in a note included in his veto message in which he declared that under the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 ; 000,000 a year . Under the revised form the budget bill had tied the salary schedule for this department up to a segregated schedule filed by the head of the department last January , he explained . This would prevent the head of a State hospital , when a vacancy occurred in any position above the minimum grade , from filling , it by an appointment at the lowest rate . The revised form also would prevent the head of the Department of Mental Hygiene from shifting appropriations made for one institution to another to meet fluctuations in the number of inmates and corresponding requirement in personnel . Holds Constitution Violated . The form in which the Legislature returned the measure made it . possible for the head of an institution to transfer to maintenance and operation money appropriated for personnel and vice versa , a method which the . Governor disapproves , He also insisted that the Legislature , in substituting its own language for that used by him in the original bill , had violated the executive budget provisions of the constitution . The disapproval of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that where the Governor , in his original budget , had separated the items for the several divisions and bureaus , the fiscal committees had done away with this segregation and listed the positions involved with disregard of divisional lines . " By the method followed in this bill , " the Governor said in his message , " a future Governor will not have before him the proper information upon which to determine the necessity for increases and decreases in any division of the education department . I consider the form in which these appropriations have been submitted to me improper and detrimental to established budget procedure in this State . I will accept these items if they are returned to me in proper form , in their proper divisions and bureaus . " The Governor stressed the necessity of laying a foundation for future budget making by separating items for personal service from those for maintenance and operation . " Under the restricting language which I have vetoed the two would be scrambled together , " he added . In Section 15 of the original budget the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bare instances where it might be found necessary to transfer money for personal service from one bureau in a department to another bureau . This was sticken out by the Republicans and another Section 15 was substituted in which the " legislative intent " was set forth as a method which the Governor pronounced " the direct contrary to the principle now applying in the State service . " " I am very certain that some mistake was made by your honorable bodies in the passage of this strange clause , " the Executive wrote . " I can not believe that the Legislature wishes to open the door to an unheard-of new power to be vested in the heads of departments , givingeto them authority to shift-salary , b.ppropriations from one bureau to another at the will of the department head . " No Governor has ever asked for such extraordinary powers for the department heads , except in those cases of departmental reorganizations , and such new powers are , of course , wholly contrary to the spirit not only of the Executive budget it : ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 15 is disapproved on this broad ground as well as on the ground that it is contrary to Article 4A of the State Constitution . However , all of the items of personal service to which it refers are hereby approved , with the exception of the items specifically disapproved hereinbefore. "
