Egyptian Fraud . As everyone knows , Great Britain must control the Suez Canal , vital " backbone " of Empire trade . Therefore she must control Egypt . She does so through Puppet-King Fuad . In the past two years His Majesty has cut himself off , step by step , from the Egyptian people and their elected representatives . When the anti-British and popular Wafd party won the last election by a majority of 19 to 1 over all opponents combined ( TIME , Jan. 13 , 1930 ) , it became clear that if King Fuad was to remain on his throne and remain a British puppet the next election would have to be a fraud . Last week Premier Ismail Sidky Pasha , creature of the King , was busy perpetrating this fraud . <P> Egyptians went to the polls to elect 150 members of Parliament . Instead of winning 19 to 1 as it did last year , the Wafd lost last week 1 to 17 according to the Government 's official count . The same authority gave parties adherent to the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Rumanian Cheat . Somewhat less revolting than the Egyptian fraud was Rumania 's election last week - for in Ru mania each party has its turn at cheating . <P> Rumania 's last election was in the brief reign of Boy King Mihai , since ousted by his father King Carol II . The Three Regents for King Mihai had just appointed as Premier Dr. Juliu Maniu , leader of the Peasant Party . In the ensuing election the Peasant Party won 333 seats which they still held up to last week . <P> Recently King Carol appointed as Premier his old tutor Professor Nicholas Jorga , sly &; bewhiskered ( TIME , May 11 ) . Last week in an election held by the Jorga Government the Peasant Party 's representation dropped from 333 seats to 30 . The Jorga Party skyrocketed last week from 7 seats to 275 . <P> There can be no explanation for such electoral returns except cheating . <P> On Election day last week eight Rumanians were killed , seven by policemen . <P> Liberian Barclay . There being no general world interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained in Monrovia . No Negro paper has a regular cable news service from Liberia . Therefore the U. S. State Department is the chief U. S. source of Liberian news . Last week the big white State Department announced that Liberians had elected as their President big black Edwin Barclay . <P> When charges of ' ' Slavery in Liberia " broke ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) , Mr. Barclay was Secretary of State , answered Statesman Stimson 's urgent inquiries with tact . Presently the then President of Liberia , Mr. D. B. King , resigned . As Secretary of State Mr. Barclay automatically became Acting President , which he was until elected President . <P> So far as slavery is concerned , Liberia has now flung herself enthusiastically open to a League of Nations ' tutelary commission , preferring that to one from the U. S. Little by little the slavery scandal is being hushed and ameliorated .
