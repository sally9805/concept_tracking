txt President Hoover 's plan for a year 's suspension of payments of all war debts , including German reparations , went into effect today , so far as the entire British Empire Is concerned . Without awaiting the results of the international conference , which begins a week from today , for the consideration of details , the British Government for itself and in behalf of all Dominions has notified the President of the Bank for International Settlements that it will make no claim for its instalments of either conditional or unconditional reparations due from Germany next Wednesday . " Even if the German Government were in a position to transfer this instalment , " says the British Treasury communication to the Bank for International Settlements , " to demand it would be manifestly inconsistent with the acceptance in principle of President Hoover 's proposal . Other Countries Also Benefit . Furthermore , Great Britain has suspended debts now due her from European countries other than Germany , thus putting the Hoover plan into practical effect as from July 1 , which was the date fixed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these debts due from her former allies are not mentioned in England 's communication today to the Bank for International Settlements , the countries concerned have been notified that , they need not pay . On July 1 there were payments due to Great Britain from France , Belgium , Italy , Poland , Rumania , Yugoslavia , Estonia and Latvia . With the exception of France , all availed themselves of the British offer and oMitted payments . France placed the amount due to England from her on July 1 on deposit in the Bank for International Settlements with the proviso that it could be withdrawn when the Hoover Plan details were finally agreed upon at the international conference . England has refrained from touching this French deposit on the ground that the Hoover Plan should have gone into effect on the day named by the American President and actually did become operative on that date so far as Great Britain is concerned . Further payments of $5,000,000 and $1,500,000 will be due to England from France and Italy respectively on July 15 . They have been notif.ied they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's action by the treasury , the British Foreign Office reissued this evening its invitations to the countries concerned to send delegates to the conference in London next Friday . This time the invitation was explicit as to the date . In its original suggestion for such a conference the British Government fixed next Monday as a suitable date , two days before the 15th , on which German reparations were due . But the French demurred , saying that was too early and suggesting July 17 as a more convenient date for the Paris experts . Whereupon England issued an invitation tenta- tively for the 17th , asking all the governments concerned if that was satisfactory . There has been , no definite reply from France , but I she has intimated there might be an advantage in further delay . The British Government emphatically disagrees with that view . Hence definite notices were sent out today for the 17th . The countries invited are the United States , Japan , Germany , France , Italy and Belgium .

Considerable diplomacy is now needed to conceal the surprise and resentment felt by the British Government because of the delays in making the world 's acceptance of the Hoover plan unanimous . Premier hailed the American proposal with great enthusiasm in the House of Commons on June 22 , two days after it had been made in Washington . Two days later , after full approval by the Cabinet , Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden announced that Great Britain was ready to accept the offer immediately in the spirit in which It was made . He said there was no time for an international conference to consider the matter , and that It would be " a thousand pities " if the plan were held up by delay on the part of any country . The " thousand pities " have materielized . Ever since British public officials have deeply regretted that President Hoover consented to the negotiations with France , which have delayed for almost a month the general adoption of the proposal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now virtually insisting on holding the conference not later than July 17 so the other countries concerned may follow the example already set by England in actually suspending the debts . Officials of the Treasury and Foreign Office were asked early today , before the note to the World Bank was made public , if they considered the Hoover plan in effect now so far as Britain was concerned or whether it would have to wait until after the conference had considered the matter of the guarantee fund and other relevant questions . " In a purely technical sense it Is now in effect provisionally so far as England is concerned , " replied a high official of the Treasury . " But so far as what we have done is concerned it is in effect now and lute been since July 1 . Theoretically it is possible that the international conferences of experts and Ministers to be held in London may spoil the whole thing , but we can not conceive that as possible in any practical sense .

The text of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bank for International Settlements follows : I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty 's Treasury to inform you His Majesty 's governments in the ' United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , the Commonwealth of Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the Union of South Africa and the Government of India have accepted in principle the proposal made by President Hoover on June 20 , 1931 , for the suspension of intergovernmental payments , including reparation payments , falling due from July 1r 1931 , to June 30 , 1932 . As you are aware , certain outstanding questions as res'ards the method of giving effect to President Hoover 's proposal remain to be settled by the governments concerned . In the meantime the monthly instalment of the German annuity falls due on the 15th instant , but even if the German Government were in a position to transfer this instalment , to demand it would be manifestly inconsistent with the acceptance in principle of President Hoover 's proposal . The above-mentioned governments have therefore decided to refrain , in so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instalments of both unconditional and conditional annuities falling due on the 15th instant without prejudice to the rights of bondholders of the German external loan of 1924 and of the German Government 5% per cent international loan of 1930 , and on the understanding that the terms and conditions of the suspension of this payment and of the eventual transfer of the amount suspended will be those agreed upon hereafter for giving effect to President Hoover 's proposal . The above-mentioned governments feel it necessary to add that their decision has been taken with the object of giving immediate relief to the existing difficulties in Germany , in accordance with President Hoover 's proposal , by the complete suspension of transfers , whether in cash of in kind ; and it must not , of course , be understood as implying any derogation from the rights of these governments under The Hague agreements in so far as any payments may be transferred by Germany .

Paris Insists Details of Debt Holiday Must Be Settled First . Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TrirEs . PARIS , July ** inquiry as to . whether France regards the Hoover Plan as operative now or not until after the London parley hart developed the following official attitude : According to the theory maintained by the French Government , President Hoover 's plan can not enter into force before the signatories of the Young Plan have reached an agreement on all its details and until the experts have agreed , both at Basle on the question of the guarantee fund and at London on deliveries in kind and division of payments . In principle , however , France will admit that the plan is effective as soon as France and Britain come to an accord on the guarantee fund . Meanwhile , payments under the Young Plan must take place . In this way , payments due to the United States have already been paid , and France , on July 1 paid to England 16,000,000 marks , which represents The Hague annuities which then fell due . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , including Germany 's reparation payments , would be refunded as soon as the Hoover Plan is applied . Germany therefore , in theory , must on July 15 turn over to the Bank for International Settlements , at Basle , the total of her payments which fall due every two months . According to the Bank of France Germany is incapable of meeting these payments . It is presumed that , in order to settle this situation , France and Germany will reach some sort of understanding at Basle next Monday . The French proposal is as follows : That France shall pay in the guarantee fund by monthly payments dated from the time when the regular moratorium has been established , and that this monthly payment shall be less than one-half of France 's share of Germany 's unconditional reparation payments . By this , England loses nothing , but naturally will suffer a certain delay in her receipts . Rome Calls It Operative Now . Wireless to7ITE flaw Yosx TIMES .
