VACATION IN HEAVEN A STORY BY JESSE STUART MENNESSE1 by-grabs , " I say as the long 1 black-snake train rolls round a flank of the Cumberland Mountain , " this is the land of remembered vacations . " So , I pick up my suitcase and step upon the good old Tennessee dirt . " Hello , Shan , " says Kirby . " Hello , Kirby , " I say . " How is the world servin ' you ? " " Fine as frog hair , " says Kirby , " got the old T Model right out here to haul your trunk to the Cabin . " Kirby in his big white straw hat , going to seed at the top , puffs on a Stud-tobacco cigarette . I puff a cigar . " Where is my trunk ? " I say . " My trunk 's not here among these . " " Here 's the trunk from Kentucky , " says Kirby ; " here is your trunk . " " My trunk . My Godl Handles torn off'n it and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slabs left . " " Sure handle trunks rough on this line , Buddy , " says a man in a broad-rimmed straw hat sitting on the end of a crosstie sucking smoke from a hawk-billed Stud-tobacco cigarette and blowing it out in fine blue streaks through his broken and discolored teeth . " Where you guys going ? " " We 're going to hell if we do n't change our way , " says Kirby . We go down to the old T Model . " Wait till I twist her tail , " says Kirby . He cranks the car and the gravels fly in a little line out from the exhaust pipe . Kirby jumps in by the wheel and feeds her the gas and spark , shifts from low to high , and we pull right up by the trunk and let her chug till we throw the trunk in the back seat . It is n't so heavy . " Scarred up worse than hell , " says Kirby , " but maybe it can take it . " So we jump back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come to a store and then we turn right up Cedar Creek and keep going till we get to a mill . Right down over the hill , less than a pipe of tobacco for a duck-legged man , and we are at Mr. Dyke 's cabin . The bean-colored swirls of dust follow the chugs of our T Model down the main highway . Dust settles on the bushy-topped cedars . Dust swirls the color of white soup beans . Dust floats over the blackberry briars and the cedar tops . Dust from the turnpike not limestoned yet , dust the color of a guinea egg , clouds of thin guinea-egg colored dust go skyward on the lazy Tennessee bright-blue wind . " This will be a vacation in Heaven for you , Shan , " says Kirby . " Yes , it will , " I say . Lord , I hold my nose and put my handkerchief over my mouth . Dust . Dust . Dust . I can taste it . It tastes like a piece of dried pumpkin . Dust . I can smell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dust . Tennessee dust . My God , dust ! " You know that busybody that sucked that cigarette at the depot and ast us where we 's goin ' , " says Kirby ? " w'y he 's the son of Old Bad John Eversole . You know Old Bad John used to be king up there around the depot . He 'd go over to Bronberg , Kentucky , and bring back a quart of licker and two loaded pistols . He 'd come from the train ashootin ' . People would run in their houses and shut the doors . He run that store over there at the /eft of the depot . He 'd make one of his clerks load one of his pistols while he shot the other . He 'd just shoot up the town . One clay he started to run John Turner from the depot platform . John fed him a little load he could n't carry right between the eyes . Bad John sleeps out on Baker 's Pint now . " Dust swirls in tiny clouds . The sun beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ragweeds . The wheat , shocked in small stacks , is golden in the sunlight . It is in little bottoms between the mountains . We follow the curves . sway in and out , chug like a mowing machine . " Right over in the Canyon there , a man used to get good licker . But the Law got ' em . They ai n't no more . I used to get loaded down there . But a body ca n't teach school and fool with ticker . I used to hide in the Canyon and drink it . " The Canyon is deep . Cedars struggle with the rocks and the dirt to hold on the Canyon banks . Vines entwine the cedars . Dust blows over that way and covers the trees and guinea-egg colors the landscape . Far away on the mountain slope are black waving clouds of thick young corn . It flutters its blades in the wind . Chug . Chug . Chug . " Well , here 's the creek by the store , " says Kirby . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have been up it many a time , boy . Had many a wonderful time at the Cabin . This road is rough . " Vines cling to the rough-rock soil . Beech trees tall and shadowy and wild honeysuckle with white and purple blossoms peep from the shadows of thick-limbed roadside beeches . ' Water with white flecks of foam trickles over the rocky falls in the stream below , water that killsthe din of our engine . Ferns stick little green rabbit-ears from behind the mouse-colored rocks . We chug past the old mill and its tiny lake , a streak of silver when the sun sets , down among the green-clad bony tree-covered mountains . " The old miller lives here . Does n't know how old he is , " says Kirby , " all he can remember was the guns poppin ' over around Cumberland Gap in the Civil War . Right over there is the Cabin . About there , Shan . You 'll have to take your baths and swims here in the Mill Pond . " " Suits me , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened in . There are beds , dishes , knives , forks , spoons , cook-stove in the Cabin . It is a pretty cabin where the water will sing one to sleep every night . The creek flows right past the Cabin . " Your neighbors are fine people , " says Kirby . " Them people that live right over there . But there 's a lot goin ' around here that 's not so neighborly . " The sun is a ball of fire . It blazes over Lonesome Mountain and June dew ascends from the cornfields in the valley . " I 'll have to have a woman to clean this place up , " I say , " a man ca n't do nothin ' about a house . I ca n't cook . I burn my fingers . I could n't boil water without scorchin ' it . So I 'll see my neighbor across the creek . " She is the mother of eight  --  small . lean , at work in the garden in a blue dress and a slat bonnet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wo n't you come over to our house and eat dinner with us ? We ai n't got nothin ' but beans , tateis , and corn and cornbread , but you are perfectly welcome . " I can step on the head of my shadow . It is noon . That is the way to tell when twelve o'clock comes . I cross the foot log to the Holmes house . " Come right in here , Stranger , and take that bench over there with the children . " I sit on a bench with the children . " Hungry as a wolf , Mr. Holmes . Just pass me everything and you 'll be passin ' just what I want . The green beans are good . The young potatoes are good . The milk is good . The coffee is fine . What a meal to a hungry man . What would meals cost me if I ate over here now and then ? " " Let me and the old man think it over . We 'll tell you to-morrow . " Mrs. Holmes says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me have this house by myself . I never could do any good in a house and a man in it mussin ' around . Wimmen was made for the house , not men . " Mrs. Holmes sweeps the floors and washes the dishes . She pours water out in the yard and she draws clear well water and heats it and washes dishes again . " What do you say , " says Mr. Holmes , " that we have some fun while the old woman cleans the house . " He calls his two dogs . " Sick him , Lead . Sick him , Lun . " Into a fight they go . Around on the grass  --  snapping , biting , growling  --  under the locust trees , down into the creek . " Boy , I like to see dogs fight . Have ' em fightin ' about every Sunday . Neither one of them can whop . " " House is ready . " " How much do I owe you ? " " Well , it ought to be worth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar at least . " " That 's mighty big money for a little job like that . But if you think it 's worth it I 'll take it . " " Lum 's got the best of Lead . Got him by the ear and split it like you 'd took a knife . I stopped them right there . I had my ear split once with a man 's teeth and I know what it is even for a dog to stand . " I meet Charlie Holmes and Fad Holmes . Charlie is six-feet-six . Fad is six-feet-four . We go to the Mill Pond and swim . Fad will say , " Now Charlie , you know what Ma told you . She 'll use the limb on you if you slip off and go to town . " We walk eight miles to a town of three hundred . We fish together in the creek . We grow quite chummy . " How far you been in school ? " Fad says to me . " I 've been teaching school before I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " You do n't look to me like no damn school teacher . " Charlie says , " You look more like a man that come through here once workin ' for the Government and cleaned the Canyon out . Them fellows are right over in Nashville in the pen now except them that took through the brush like a bunch o ' wild horses . " During the pretty sunny Tennessee days I go out on the hills and watch the squirrels . They come so close above me in the trees they knock the hark down in my eyes . The birds sing and nest in the tall green chestnut-oak timber . Snakes crawl in the grass . Flowers bloom among the rocks . Wild roses are thick as the hair on a dog 's back . I often say , " I have never seen a country quite so beautiful . " I put my letters in a mail box , sometimes many as twenty of them . Some of them go to Ireland and some to England and many go to nearly every section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . He looks them over . Then he pulls them out of the bag and shows them to Mr. Holmes . Perhaps he shows them at other places . There is a grapevine telephone in this community . When I go to the river to swim , a girl comes out on a high front porch built on stilts by the swinging bridge . It is built above the reach of river backwater that gorges between the two mountains . She says , " You are the boy that lives in the cabin back up the crick and you send letters to England and Ireland and to Washington , D. C. " She is a tall blonde , rather nice to see . " How do you know what I do and who I am ? " I say to her . " That is just what we wonder , Stranger . You come right up there in the crick the other day and set on a rock and took paper and pencil from your pocket . You wrote something . You looked right over there toward Steve Meeder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did sit on a stone and look toward a house , and wrote a poem . Was she in the grass watching me ? Was she spying on me ? I am a mountain man . I am in a mountain country . Damned if I understand it all . These are different mountaineers to my own people . She is a pretty girl . Why is she interested in me ? Why is she getting next to me ? " Just what do you do ? What is your work ? What are you doin ' here ? You ai n't got no wife with you . You 're livin ' alone up there in that cabin sendin ' out all kinds of letters . What 's them Holmes boys doin ' runnin ' around with you ? You wear good clothes . " " If it is any of your business I teach school , " I say . A little girl comes out with a pink ribbon on her hair . Her blond hair is curled . She has a rubber ball . She bats it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her . She laughs . She takes the stick and throws it at a striped-winged butterfly sucking on a wisp of hollyhocks growing by the wash kettle . The woman on the porch looks at me and then she says , " Mary , you come on in this house or I 'll whop the panties off'n you . " I walk on toward the river . On my way to the river / find a church house by the road . It is old and ugly with battered , knife-carved walls , broken windows , and glass shattered on the floor . Birds build in the eaves . Below it is a stream clear as a looking-glass where water bursts on the rocks into pockets of foam white as a sheet . Ferns mangle the earth beneath the tall shadowy cool-looking beech trees . The white belly of a sycamore peers forth and there are many cottonwoods intermingled with the green , dense , heavy vegetation . One can hear the wind in the cottonwood leaves and tell they are cottonwood trees without even seeing them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings : A whistling girl And a flock of sheep Is the best thing A farmer can keep . The sheep prance and baa-baa as they go past the church house . The man turns and looks back at me after he hasgone past . Every time I look back to see if he is looking , he is looking and he turns his head so I can not catch his eye . I go back from the muddy river , edged in tall sycamores , entwined in poison vine and filled with treacherous swirling mountain water . Something is strange about the place . No one is friendly but Holmes ' family . People look at me strangely . They ask me strange questions . Kirby comes to see me every other night . We talk about this and that . He brings me books . I loan him books . As I go up the road I see a place where a house once stood . Rose vines are red with June blossoms . An old chimney stands in a black cloud of pretty young corn . I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ? " A man comes up to me and lie says , " I 'm old War Horsley . Live down here on the crick and I farm this corn . What is your name , Stranger ? " " My name is Shan Stevens . I 'm from Kentucky , living up here in the cabin across from Holmes ' . I 've been down to the river . " " I have heard of you . You are the boy that sends letters to England and Ireland and to the President of the United States . " " Not to the President of the United States . " " Walter Fortner told Press Hix and he told Issiac Meadows and old Issiac told my boy you did . " ? " WelI , I do not . " ? " You send them to Washington , D. C. " And now says old War , " People here ai n't livin ' like they ought to live . We got one token here that shook the earth . The next will be the end of times . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their graves and the livin ' and the deadwill mingle except them possessed of the Devil and they 'll be burnt up like a pile of brush . A cyclone hit right down here in these mountains and bloomed that house smack dab away . Best people in the neighborhood . Killed them . They 's all that was prepared to go . The Lord was fair . He 's givin ' these weaked people a chance . That house , when it Mowed plum over there killed a slew of ' em . right . But it got five . right here any more . " " And that is what house , " I say . " Yes , " says War Horsley , " yesterday a pretty whitewashed house and to-day only a few logs left and corn growin ' where the house used to be . That is the work of the Lord . Are you right with the Lord ? You ca n't be right with the Lord and earn your livin ' the way you do . " I leave War Horsley . Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks because I wear a white shirt that I do not work nor have ever worked . He really insulted me , the old sucker . But how could I sock an old man with one foot in the grave and the other ready to slip in ? He really said things that did not concern him in the least . I go hack to the Cabin and Mrs. Holmes comes over and says , " We have decided to charge you twenty cents a mead if you do n't think it 's too much . And if you think that is too much , you set your own price . Come right on over and eat with the children . " The Holmes children are a sturdy bunch of children . We eat and laugh and talk . Old Charlie and Fad can put away the green beans and cornbread . And when Charlie asks for more bread Fad will say , " Where are you puttin ' all that bread , Charlie ? " To-night we go to church down in the church house by the swinging bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down past the corn patch where the house was blown away , down under the tall sycamores , past the old houses by the side of the road with wells in the front yards and roses by the gates . We can hear the water in the creek moan . It is a lonesome place . Something about the quiet that gets under one 's skin . Something that keeps calling one back . The old familiar music of wind in the green brush and rose vines keeps calling one back . " The church is right down yonder . " says Charlie . " Just around this bend and we are there . " He does not know that I havealready found the church and the old graveyards in the community . We hurry down the path and cross the swinging bridge that rocks like a willow tree in the wind as we cross . Boys lurk beside the house and look in at the windows . There are more on the outside than on the inside of the house . Boys sit on the long benches inside with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , lithe mountain lasses . There are the dingy lamps hanging on the wall . The moths flit about the lamps like swarming bees . They roll over and over and do n't get anywhere . " Got a big crowd here tonight at the singin ' and the church . Everybody 's turned out on the Creek . " I go in the house and sit down . Fad sits down beside me and Charlie goes up and sits by a girl . Boys stare at me from the bench seats and from the dark windows . They look at me , but it is only because I am a stranger . They act so strange here . They look at me and they look at one another . Then they kindly grin , whisper , and look again at me and then at one another . A tall , lean , snake-eyed , mop-headed fellow comes in the house and he puts his hand on my shoulder and he says , " Is your name Shan Stevens ? " " That 's what they call me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a fellow wants to see you out there . " I know what they used to mean in Kentucky . When a man was called out he was either knifed or shot . Here I am without a gun , knife , or rock . I am going out . I get up and the crowd watches me go . Some grin . Some laugh . I am met at the door by three fellows . Two pull long pistols that gleam in the moonlight . Another pulls a hawkbill knife . " Tell me what the Goddamn hell you 're hangin ' around this country for ! " he snarls , his beardy lips like a dog about to bite another dog . " You are a Goddamn spy for the Government , that is what you are . You are spyin ' on the Canyon , " says the fellow , short and stumpy , with a block , slate-colored face and glum wooden eyes . I can see his knifeblade broad like a butcher knife and hooked at the point like a sickle . That could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole ax . " Well , fellows , you got me foul , " I say . " I have n't got a chance . I am not a spy . I am not a stool pigeon . You are wrong . But l'Il fight either one of you a fair fight . If I whip either one of you I 'll fight the second man a fair fight . " " They ai n't going to be no fair fightin ' to this . We aim to put you out of the way and not bruise our knuckles . " " You 'll have to put him out of the way over my dead body , " says Fad Holmes as he comes running up . " He 's not a stool pigeon . Do you think my mother would cook for a stool pigeon and wash a stool pigeon 's clothes and clean his house ? This fellow is a schoolteacher from Kentucky . He 's all right . " " How does he live and never work ? Wears white shirts and good pants and goes around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamited the Mill Pond last night , and the Miller said it was that strange fellar that lived in the Ca bi n . " " I set off a couple of firecrackers there last night to scare the old man , " says Fad . Fad and I do n't have anything to fight with . We walk away . We go down the creek that flows white in the moonlight and we gather us a good flat rock apiece to hold in our hand and maul with , a couple of good round rocks for our pockets . We claw the moss off of them so we can throw them straight to a skull . " This fight is not over , " says Fad , " for I know them Horsleys . Dick Horsley was back of it all . We 'll be waylaid goin ' home to-night . There are two roads hack . One is to climb the mountain and take the railroad back . The other is to go the way we come to-night . " We go back up to the church house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , " Three days for you to leave this country . " " I 'll leave when I get damn good and ready , " I say . He looks at me . I can see him talk to the other boys . They get together . We see them cross the swinging bridge and get a good lead on us toward home . I wear a white shirt and white pants . " My clothes will be a flower pot for their pistols , " I say to Fad . " Wait just a minute . " I pull off my shirt , wet it in the creek , wad it up , and stick it in my pocket . I do my undershirt likewise and put it in my other pocket . I take mud and rub all over my pants . I am not a target now for their pistols . " Let 's take the same road back we come , " says Fad , " they 're thinkin ' that we are goin ' to take the other road . They 're waitin there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have to go one road of the two . It is a chance . We meet or we miss . We do not speak . We go quietly . We watch with searching eyes the dense clumps of sycamores . One mile surely by now . And we go under the long shadows of the sycamores . We walk under their heavy foliage through thin shadows and massive shadows . We do not know what lurks there , maybe three men whose intentions are to kill us . Now we have come to the corn patch where the old house used to be . We are close to the Cabin . are are out of the dangerous place , " says Fad . " They wo n't do nothin ' this close to my home . If they 'd been goin ' to do anything they would have already done it . " We are home now . Fad goes to his shack and I go to my cabin just across the creek from him . I hear to-day that they waited for us on the railroad . War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields and Sam told it to Rick Holmes . Sam says , " Rick , your boy will be disgraced forever here . He upheld for a stool pigeon or they 'd got rid of him last night . He 's here watchin ' the Canyon . " And Rick says , " He 's all right . Do you think my wife would cook grub for a stool pigeon and wash his clothes for a hundred dollars a shirt ? We ai n't harborin ' no stool pigeons . " I fix my cabin against any attack . I hear they are going to run me from the Cabin . I go to the store and bring in a fresh supply of coffee . I get paper to write on . I get all the little supplies I need . I get me a wire and fix it across the room enough to catch anyone 's feet who comes into the darkness in the room . I tie a bunch of cans on one end of the wire . The cans will rattle at the head of my bed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club and put it by my bed . I intend to stand up beside the door that I leave open for a trap and I intend to make my club go farther than any pistol . I intend to get them as they enter the door . That is the only way they can get into my room . The window blinds are down at night . They can not tell where I sleep , and all the doors are locked but the door leading to my room and the front door . They are left open . I hope they do come after the way they talked to me . Kirby comes and he says , " If I was you I 'd leave and not have any trouble . They think you are a stool pigeon . " My vacation days are over . Time is up for me to move on . I stay three days longer to see what they are going to do . Rick Holmes has a rifle . Charlie and Fad are armed and my fight is their fight . And they are with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . They know that I am not a stool pigeon . I wait for the trouble . Let it come . They talk of coming , but they do not come . I do not go down the road any more toward the church . I understand some tactics offighting . Strange bullets often come from unseen hands . It is not all open warfare in the hills . I have had blood kin shot and my blood kin have shot others . No one comes . It is very quiet . I am ready to tear up stakes and ride back past the Canyon on my way to Kentucky . Kirby comes and gets me . We throw the old battered trunk and the suitcase and the typewriter into the old T Model . We pack a sheaf of poetry in a box and put it in the top part of the trunk . We are ready to ? move on . And we move off the creek the way we came where the honeysuckle hangs over the cliffs like white flakes of snow . Chug . Chug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had many a good time in this lizzie , ai n't we , Shan ? " The train pulls in at Lockwood . It is a long black-snake train . It goes in a hole under the mountain . Like a snake through a hole , it comes out in Kentucky . " So long , Kirby . Come and see me . " " Do n't guess ever get as far as your part of Kentucky . " " Well if you ever do , come and see me . The latchstring will be hangin ' at the door . You 'll be welcome . " I can see behind me the soup-bean colored dust and the guinea-egg colored dust meeting in tiny clouds over the Canyon and mingling . I can see the cedar tops and the wild roses . I can see the grapevines running through the cedar tops . And the Canyon fades into a dark hole under the bright blue wind of a Tennessee June . The black-snake train crawls for a hole in the mountain .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
