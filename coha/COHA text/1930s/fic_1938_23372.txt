PRELUDE A STORY BY ALBERT HALPER T WAS coming home from school , carry- ' ing my books by a strap , when I passed Gavin 's poolroom and saw the big guys hanging around . They were standing in front near the windows , looking across the street . Gavin 's has a kind of thick window curtain up to eye-level , so all I saw were their heads . The guys were looking at Mrs. Oliver who lately has started to get talked about . Standing in her window across the street , Mrs. Oliver was doing her nails . Her nice red hair was hanging loose down her back and she did n't have much on . She certainly is a nice looking woman . She comes to my father 's newspaper stand on the corner and buys five or six movie magazines a week , also the afternoon papers . Once she felt me under the chin and said , " Watch out , I 'll get you when you grow up ! " and then she laughed . My father laughed too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . My old man stamps a lot because he has leg pains and he 's always complaining about a heavy cold in his head . When I passed the poolroom one or two guys came out . " Hey , Ike , how 's your good-looking sister ? " they called , but I did n't turn around . The guys are eighteen or nineteen and have n't ever had a job in their life . " What they need is work , " my father is always saying when they bother him too much . " They 're not bad ; they get that way because there 's nothing to do , " and he tries to explain the meanness of their ways . But I ca n't seeit like my father , I hate those fellas and I hope every one of them dies under a truck . Every time I come home from school past Lake Street they jab me , and every time my sister Syl comes along they say dirty things . So when one of them , Fred Gooley , calls , " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't answer . Besides , Ike is n't my name anyway . It 's Harry . I passed along the sidewalk , keeping close to the curb . Someone threw half an apple but it went over my head . When I went a little farther someone threw a stone . It hit me in the hack of the leg and stung me but it did n't hurt much . I kept a little toward the middle of the sidewalk because I saw a woman coming the other way and I knew they would n't throw . When I reached the corner under the Elevated two big news trucks were standing with their motors going , giving my father the latest editions . The drivers threw the papers on to the sidewalk with a nice easy roll so the papers would n't get hurt . The papers are bound with that heavy yellow cord which my father saves and sells to the junkyard when he fills up a hag . " All right , Silverstein , " a driver called out . " We 'll give you the five-star at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers are nice fellas and when they take back the old papers they like to kid my old man . They say , " Hey , you old banker , when are you gon na retire ? " or , " Let 's roll him , boys , he 's got bags of gold in his socks . " Of course they know my old man is n't wealthy and that the bags in the inside of the newsstand hold only copper pennies . But they like to kid him and they know he likes it . Sometimes the guys from Gavin 's pitch in , but the truck drivers would flatten ' ern if they ever got rough with my old man . I came up to the newsstand and put my school books inside . " Well , Pa , " I said , " you can go to Florida now . " So my Pa went to " Florida , " that is , a chair near the radiator that Nick Pappas lets him use in his restaurant . He has to use Nick 's place because our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . While my father was in Nick 's place another truck came to a stop . They dropped off a big load of early sport editions and yelled , " Hey , there , Harry , how 's the old man ? " I checked off the papers , yelling back , " He 's okay , he 's in Nick 's . " Then the truck drove away and the two helpers waved . I stood around , putting the papers on the stand and making a few sales . The first ten minutes after coming home from school and taking care of the newsstand always excites me . Maybe it 's the traffic . The trucks and cars pound along Like anything and of course there 's the Elevated right up above you which thunders to beat the band . We have our newsstand right up against a big El post and the stand is a kind of cabin which you enter from the side . But we hardly use it , only in the late morning and around two P.m. , when business is n't very rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers ready for business and not hidden inside where they ca n't get a look at you at all . Besides , you have to poke your head out and stretch your arm to get the pennies , and kids can swipe magazines from the sides if you do n't watch . So we most always stand outside the newsstand , my father , me , and my sister . Anyhow I like it . I like everything about selling papers for my father . The fresh air gets me and I like to talk to customers and see the rush when people are let out from work . And the way the news trucks bring all the new editions so we can seethe latest headlines , like a bank got held up on the South Side on Sixty-Third Street , or the Cubs are winning their tenth straight and have a good chance to cop the pennant , is exciting . The only thing I do n't like is those guys from Gavin 's . But since my father went to the police station to complain they do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ago and said the gang was bothering him , and Mr. Fenway , he 's the desk sergeant there , said , " Do n't worry any more about it , Mr. Silverstein , we 'll take care of it You 're a respectable citizen and taxpayer and you 're entitled to protection . Well take care of it . " And the next day they sent over a patrolman who stood around almost two hours . The gang from Gavin 's saw him and started to go away , but the cop hollered , " Now listen , do n't bother this old fella . If you bother him any I'lI have to run some of you in . " And then one of the guys recognized that the cop was Butch , Fred Gooley 's cousin . " Listen who 's talkin ' , " he yells back . " Hey , Fred , they got your cousin Butch takin ' care of the Yid . " They said a lot of other things until the cop got mad and started after them . Then they ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back empty-handed and said to my father , " It 'll blow over , Mr. Silverstein ; they wo n't give you any more trouble . " Then he went up the street , turning into Steuben 's bar . Welt , all this happened three or four weeks ago and so far the gang has let us alone . They stopped pulling my sixteenyear-old sister by her sweater and when they pass the stand going home to supper all they give us is dirty looks . During the last three or four days , however , they passed by and kinda muttered , calling my father a communist hanker and me and my sister reds . My father says they really do n't mean it , it 's the hard times and bad feelings , and they got to put the blame on somebody , so they put the blame on us . It 's certain speeches on the radio and the pieces in some of the papers , my father told us . " Something is happening to some of the people and we got to watch our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the traffic and thinking it over when my little fat old man comes out from Nick 's looking like he liked the warm air in Nick 's place . My old man 's cheeks looked rosy , but his cheeks are that way from high blood pressure and not from good health . " Well , colonel , " he says smiling . " I am back on the job . " So we stand around , the two of us , taking care of the trade . I hand out change snappy and say thank-you after each sale . My old man starts to stamp around in a little while and , though he says nothing , I know he 's got pains in his legs again . I Iook at the weather forecast in all the papers and some of them say flurries of snow and the rest of them say just snow . " Well , Pa , " I tell my old man , " maybe I can go skating to-morrow if it gets cold again . " Then I see my sister coming from high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heck does n't she cross over so she wo n't have to pass the poolroom , I say to myself , why do n't she walk on the other side of the street ? But that 's not like Sylvia ; she 's a girl with a hot temper , and when she thinks she is right you ca n't tell her a thing . I knew she would n't cross the street and then cross back , because according to her , why that 's giving in . That 's telling those hoodlums that you 're afraid of their guts . So she does n't cross over but walks straight on . When she comes by the pool hall two guys come out and say something to her . She just holds herself tight and goes right on past them both . When she finally comes up she gives me a poke in the side . " Hello , you mickey mouse , what mark did you get in your algebra exam ? " I told her I got A , but the truth is I got a C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to me . " Pa , if he 's lying to us well fine him ten years ! " My father started to smile and said , " No . Harry is a good boy , two years is enough . " So we stand around kidding and pretty soon , because the wind is coming so sharp up the street , my old man has to " go to Florida " for a while once more . He went into Nick 's for some " sunshine , " he said , but me and Syl could tell he had the pains again . Anyway , when he was gone we did n't say anything for a while . Then Hartman 's furniture factory , which lately has been checking out early , let out and we were busy making sales to the men . They came up the sidewalk , a couple of hundred , all anxious to get home , so we had to work snappy . But Syl is a fast worker , faster than inc. and we took care of the rush all right . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cocoa factory up the block to start . We were standing around when something hit me in the head , a half of a rotten apple . It hurt a little . I turned quick but did n't see anybody , but Syl started yelling . She was pointing to a big EI post across the street behind which a guy was hiding . " Come on , show your face , " my sister was saying . " Come on , you hero , show your yellow face ! " But the guy sneaked away , keeping the post between . Syl turned to me and her face was boiling . " The rats It 's not enough with all the trouble over in Europe ; they have to start it here . " Just then our old man came out of Nick 's and when he saw Syl 's face he asked what was the matter . " Nothing , " she says . " Nothing . I 'm just thinking . " But my old man saw the half of a rotten apple on the sidewalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see he was worried . " We just have to stand it , " he said , like he was speaking to himself , " we just have to stand it . If we give up the newsstand where else can we go ? " " Why do we have to stand it ? " I exploded , almost yelling . " Why do we ? " But Mrs. Oliver just then came up to the stand , so I had to wait on her . I 'm her favorite " salesman , " she says , so my old man lets me take care of her . Besides she 's a good customer and there 's more profit on two or three magazines than from a dozen papers . " I 'll have a copy of Film Fan , a copy of Breezy Stories and a copy of Movie Stars on Parade , " she says . I go and reach for the copies . " Harry , " she says , " if you were Bob Taylor , would you let me kiss you just once ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought I was blushing . " Listen , " she laughed , " when you get ten years older you let me know ! " Then she bent over toward me and said something in a low voice how she liked fellows who blushed . My old man did n't hear her , but he chuckled when he saw my face getting more red . " Harry is a nice boy , " Mrs. Oliver told my father , patting my arm . " I 'm very fond of him . " " Yes , he 's not bad , " my father answered smiling . " Only he has a hot temper once in a while . " But who would n't have one , that 's what I wanted to say ! Who would n't ? Here we stand around minding our own business and the guys wo n't let us alone . I tell you sometimes it . almost drives me crazy . We do n't hurt anybody and we 're trying to make a living , but they 're always picking on us and wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years now and , though my old man says it 'll pass with the hard times , I know he 's worried because he does n't believe what he says . He reads the papers as soon as he gets them from the delivery trucks and lately the news about Europe is all headlines and I can see that it makes him sick . My old man has a soft heart and every time he sees in the papers that something bad in Europe has happened again he seems to grow older and he stands near the papers kind of small and all alone . I tell you , sometimes it almost drives me crazy . My old man should be down in Florida , where he can get healthy , not in Nick Pappas ' " Florida , " but down in real Florida where you have to go by train . That 's where he should be . Then maybe his legs would be all right and he would n't have that funny color in hischeeks . Since our mother died last year it seems the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has to skip a treatment once in a while because he says it costs too much . But when he stands there with a customer chuckling you think he 's healthy and has n't got any worries and you feel maybe he has a couple thousand in the bank . And another thing , what did he mean when he said something two days ago when the fellas from Gavin 's passed by and threw a stone at the stand ? What did he mean , that 's what I want to know . Gooley had a paper rolled up with some headlines about Europe on it and he wiggled it at us and my father looked scared . When they were gone my father said something to me , which I been thinking and thinking about . My Pa said we got to watch our step extra careful now because there 's no other place besides this country where we can go . We 've always been picked on , he said , but we 're up against the last wall now , he told me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after us here there 's no other place where we can go . I been thinking and thinking about that , especially the part about the wall . When he said that , his voice sounded funny and I felt like our newsstand was a kind of island and if that went we 'd be under the waves . " Harry , what are you thinking of ? " Mrs. Oliver asked me . " Do n't I get any change ? " She was laughing . And then I came down from the clouds and found she had given me two quarters . I gave her a nickel change . She laughed again . " When he looks moody and kind of sore like that , Mr. Silverstein , I think he 's cute . " My old man crinkled up his eyes and smiled . " Who can say , Mrs. Oliver . He should only grow up to he a nice young man and a good citizen and a credit to his country . That 's all I want . " " I 'm sure Harry will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and admired Syl 's new sweater and was about to go away . But another half of a rotten apple came over and splashed against the stand . Some of it splashed against my old man 's coat sleeve . Mrs. Oliver turned around and got mad . " Now you boys leave Mr. Silverstein alone ! You 've been pestering him long enough/ He 's a good American citizen who does n't hurt anybody ! You leave him alone ! " " Yah ! " yelled Gooley who ducked behind an El post with two other guys . " Pahl Sez you ! " " You leave him alone ! " hollered Mrs. Oliver . " Aw , go peddle your papers , " Gooley answered . " Go run up a rope . " " Do n't pay any attention to them , " Syl told Mrs. Oliver . " They think they 're heroes , but to most people they 're just yellow rats . " I could tell by my old man 's eyes that he was nervous and wanted to smooth things over , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets started and knows she 's in the right not even the Governor of the State could make her keep quiet . " Do n't pay any attention to them , " she said in a cutting voice while my old man looked anxious . " When men hide behind Elevated posts and throw rotten apples at women you know they 're not men but just things that wear pants . In Europe they put brown shirts on them and call them saviors of civilization . Here they have n't got the shirts yet and hang around pooh ooms . " Every word cut like a knife and the guys ducked away . If I or my father would have said it we would have been nailed with some rotten fruit , but the way Syl has of getting back at those guys makes them feel like yellow dogs . I guess that 's why they respect her even though they hate her , and I guess that 's why Cooley and one or two of his friends are always trying to get next to her and date her up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something more when Hillman 's cocoa factory up the block let out and the men started coming up the street . The 4:45 rush was on and we did n't have time for anything , so Mrs. Oliver left , were coming up . There was still a lot of traffic and a few people came up for papers , but from my old man 's face I could tell he felt the same as me . But pretty soon some more editions began coming and we had to check and stack them up . More men came out from factories on Walnut Street and we were busy making sales . It got colder than ever and my old man began to stamp again . " Go into Nick 's , Pa , " I told him . " I can handle it out here . " But he would n't do it because just then another factory let nut and we were swamped for a while . " Hi , there , Silverstein , " some of the men called to him , " what 's the latest news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers , kidding him , and hurried up the stairs to the Elevated , reading all about Austria and going home to eat . My father kept staring at the headlines and could n't take his eyes off the print where it said that soldiers were pouring across the border and mobs were robbing people they hated and spitting on them and making them go down on their hands and knees to scrub the streets . My old man 's eyes grew small , like he had the toothache and he shook his head like he was sick . " Pa , go into Nick 's , " I told him . He just stood there , sick over what he read . Then the guys from Gavin 's poolroom began passing the stand on their way home to supper after a day of just killing time . At first they looked as if they would n't bother us . One or two of them said something mean to us , but my old man and me did n't answer . If you do n't answer hoodlums , my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then it started . The guys who passed by came back and one of them said : " Let 's have a little fun with the Yids . " That 's how it began . A couple of them took some magazines from the rack and said they wanted to buy a copy and started reading . In a flash I realized it was all planned nut . My father looked kind of worried but stood quiet . There were about eight or nine of them , all big boys around eight-een and nineteen , and for the first time I got scared . It was just after six o'clock and they had picked a time when the newspaper trucks had delivered the five-star and when all the factories had let out their help and there were n't many people about . Finally one of them smiled at Cooley and said , " Well , this physical culture magazine is mighty instructive , but do n't you think we ought to have some of the exercises demonstrated ? " Gooley said , " Sure , why not ? " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted me to squat on the sidewalk and do the first exercise . I would n't do it . My father put his hand on the fellow 's arm and said , " Please , please . " But the guy pushed my father 's hand away . " We 're interested in your son , not you . Go on , squat . " " I wo n't , " I told him . " Go on , " he said . " Do the first exercise so that the boys can learn how to keep fit . " " I wo n't , " I said . " Go on , " he said , " do it . " " I wo n't . " Then he came over to me smiling , but his face looked nasty . " Do it . Do it if you know what 's good for you . " " Please , bays , " said my Pa . " Please go home and eat and do n't make trouble . I do n't want to have to call a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and tripped me so that I fell on one knee . Then another of them pushed me , trying to make me squat . I shoved someone and then someone hit me , and then I heard someone trying to make them stop . While they held me down on the sidewalk I wiggled and looked up . Mrs. Oliver , who had come for the blue-flash edition , was bawling them out . " You let him alone ! You tramps , you hoodlums , you let him alone ! " She came over and tried to help me , but they pushed her away . Then Mrs. Oliver began to yell as two guys twisted my arm and told me to squat . By this time a few people were passing and Mrs. Oliver called at them to inter-fere . But the gang were big fellows and there were eight or nine of them , and the people were afraid . Then while they had me down on the sidewalk Syl came running up the street . When she saw what was happening she began kicking them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they did n't pay any attention to her , merely pushing her away . " Please , " my Pa kept saying . " Please let him up ; he did n't hurt you , I do n't want to have to call the police ? " Then Syl turned to the people who were watching and yelled at them . " Why do n't you help us ? What are you standing there for ? " But none of them moved . Then Syl began to scream : " Listen , why do n't you help us ? Why do n't you make them stop picking on us ? We 're human beings the same as you ! " But the people just stood there afraid to do a thing . Then while a few guys held me , Gooley and about four others went for the stand , turning it over and mussing and stamping on all the newspapers they could find . Syl started to scratch them , so they hit her , then I broke away to help her , and then they started socking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three guys kept him away . Four guys got me down and started kicking me , and all the time my father was begging them to let me up and Syl was screaming at the people to help . And while I was down , my face was squeezed against some papers on the sidewalk telling all about Austria and I guess I went nuts while they kept hitting me , and I kept seeing the headlines against my nose . Then someone yelled , " Jiggers the cops ! " and they got off of me right away . Nick had looked out the window and had called the station , and the guys let me up and beat it away fast . But when the cops came it was too late ; the stand was a wreck . The newspapers and magazines were all over the sidewalk and the rack that holds the Argosy and Western Aces was all twisted up . My Pa , who looked sicker than ever , stood there crying and pretty soon I began to bawl . People were standing looking at us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help it , I started to bawl . Then the cops came through the crowd and began asking questions right and left . In the end they wanted to take us to the station to enter a complaint , but Syl would n't go . She looked at the crowd watching and she said , " What 's the use ? All those people standing around and none of them would help ! " They were standing all the way to the second El post , and when the cops asked for witnesses none of them except Mrs. Oliver offered to give their names . Then Syl looked at Pa and me and saw our faces and turned to the crowd and began to scream . " In another few years you wait ! Some of you are working people and they 'll be marching through the streets and going after you too ! They pick on us Jews because we 're weak and have n't any country ; but after they get us down they 'll go after you ! And it 'll be your fault ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Listen , " one of the cops told my sister , " are you coming to the station or not ? We ca n't hang around here all evening . " Then Syl broke down and began to bawl as hard as me . " Oh , leave us alone , " she told them and began wailing her heart out . " Leave us alone . What good would it do ? " By this time the crowd was bigger , so the cops started telling people to break it up and move on . Nick came out and took my father by the arm into the lunchroom for a drink of hot tea . The people went away slowly and then , as the crowd began to dwindle , it started to snow . When she saw that Syl started bawling harder than ever and turned her face to me . But I was down on my hands and knees with Mrs. Oliver , trying to save some of the magazines . There was no use going after the newspapers , which were smeared up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I thought I could save a few , so I picked a couple of them up . " Oh , leave them be , " Syl wept at me . " Leave them be , leave them be ! "
