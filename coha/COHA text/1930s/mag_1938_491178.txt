GREAT adventures seldom have a press agent . The thing is done first ; the world hears of it later . It was so lust . fell when a twenty-eight  --  year-old Oregon filling-station employee , Haldane ( Buzz ) Holmstrom , took a vacation from his gas pump and , in his homemade bout , did what no man had ever done before  --  ran the Colorado River alone from Wyoming to Boulder Darn . It is diflieult to grasp the magnitude of this feat . Classed by white-water veterans as the world 's most dangerous long river , the Colorado and its no less savage tributary , the Green , fall .5000 feet in these canyon-imprisoned 1100 miles , with 305 great rap  --  ids and nearly twice that number of smaller ones . Men have attempted it singlehanded before , but have never lived to tell of it . Others have tried it in groups and some have died . Buzz Holmstrom Was the first to emerge at the site of Boulder Dam alone . The tremendous gorge , in fact , had been threaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . sometimes with more than a dozen , and always with elaborate equipment . Powell 's original party of 1869 required months for the passage ; they were forced to line or portage their boats past something like a hundred rapids . With cone to help him with his quarter-ton boat , Holmstrom rode down all but five , a record born of both necessity and daring . Yet it was no flash-in-the-pun expedition , con  --  ceived in boyish enthusiasm and executed by blind luck . Buzz had dreamed and prepared for the at  --  tempt for months . He had already run the rapids of the Salmon and Rogue rivers solo ; the mastery of these formidable chutes had won him his ehevrons in the white-water guild . Only the Colorado , ulti  --  mate in roaring rapids , was left . Buying a rattletrap ear for ten dollars and build  --  ing a trailer to haul his boat , he left his home in Coquille , Oregon , on September 29,1937 , headed for Green River , Wyoming . A little more than $100 was in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , his boss and a few friends knew where he was going . Five days later , on October fourth , without publicity of any kind and only a handful to watch him go , he shoved off from Green River . Fifty-two days later he bumped the concrete wall of Boulder Dam . This is the story of that fifty-two days , told for the first time . It might have remained untold , for all of Buzz . The thing was done ; the knowledge of it was sufficient unto itself . But after returning to Green River to pick up his car , he stopped at Bingham Canyon , Utah , to see Dr. Russell 0 . Frazier , an authority on the Colorado River . Doctor Frazier told a friend on the Deseret Evening News , in Salt Lake City , of Holm  --  strom 's feat . A reader in Salt Lake sent the Post ' the Deseret News clipping . Because I live in Holm  --  strom 's state , the Pow ! , wired me to find him . I wired Coquille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhere in the south , it was reported ; he was on his way home . It was not until the day before Christmas that he rolled back into Coquille as quietly as he had left , ready to get . back into his gas-station clothes . But let 's let Buzz Holmstrom , the man who ran the world 's most dangerous rapids alone , tell his own story . A Modern Did Ironsides F IRST ( said Buzz ) I built my boat . I 'd studied boat design , of course , the specialized types cre  --  ated for running rapids . Mine was made out . of Port Orford cedar , very light but very strong . There are only two stands of this cedar in the world , one in the Holy Land and one down here in Southwestern Oregon . They make battery separators out of it be  --  cause it stands up , and Venetian blinds because it does n't warp , and so forth . It 's expensive , and if I 'd had to buy it on the open market I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and found me a windfall that was sound and had a close interlocking grain  --  the type I wanted  --  and had been naturally seasoned where it lay . I hewed out a cant about two feet square and fifteen feet long , and worked this by hand down a half-mile slope . Then I got a couple of the boys to help me load it on a trailer and brought it to town and had it sawed up . - It took six months of careful planning and build  --  ing , but when it was done I knew every joint and rib and watertight seam ; and I knew it was a good boat . You 've got to know that when you run rapids . When the grip of the rapids closes on you and you know there 's no way out except to ride ' er down , your mind has to be absolutely free of worry about what 's under you . You ca n't say to yourself : " Is the boat sound ? Will she stand up ? Will the oars crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Everything is tough and tested . The rest of it 's up to you , Holmstrom . " She was , and is , a good boat .. A man at Green River liked her looks before I started down , and I almost promised to sell liar , when and if I made it through . More than forty days later and close to WOO miles downriver , when she took me safely through Deubendorf Rapids  --  more about that later  --  I would just as soon have sold myself . She is fifteen feet long and live-foot beam , decked over , except for a small cockpit ; flat-bottomed , ex  --  cept for an inch and a half of arc for strength ; ten inches of rake fore and aft ; weight , empty , 450 pounds . All equipment was stored in watertight , compartments fore and aft , the spare oars lashed securely aft . Nothing was in the cockpit except me and my life preserver . The cockpit could be brim  --  ming and she would still be buoyant , capable of sup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roll completely over , and as long as I stayed with her I would have a chance . The stern , which was always to be downstream in rough going  --  for better visibility , control , and to reduce speed  --  had to be broad and doubly strong to stand up under the impact of solid water . I was ready to go on September twenty-ninth . I had read and studied every book published on the Colorado  --  particularly E. L. Kolb 's Through the Grand Canyon from Wyoming to Mexico , which 1101-.17.1,1034 Just Below the Rapids at Left , Holmstrom Came on These Grim Relics Mountain Men and Trappers Penetrated the Gorge Long Before Powell was priceless in its detailed description of each rapid and eddy  --  and the best Government maps . I had thought , slept and dreamed nothing but the Colorado for months . The jump-off , for me , was not Green River , Wy  --  oming , but Coquille , Oregon , where I was raised and where , when I die , I hope to be buried . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my capi  --  tal  --  a little better than $100 ? was in my pocket . I had said good-by , ready to get an early start in the morning . But I knew , as twilight deepened along the Co  --  quille , that I could n't sleep that night . There was no use waiting . So I said good-by to my mother again and headed east . At sunup , I was across McKenzie Pass and in the Oregon " high desert . " A blizzard was threatening and a biting wind was blowing when 1 got to Green River , Wyoming , on October third . I spent the balance of that day and most of the next getting my stuff ready . I did n't tell anybody there what I was up to except a friendly couple who lived down by the river . I had to tell them because I wanted some place to park my car and trailer while I was gone . Only Four Stops lo Boulder Darn I DID N'T want any publicity , and I 'll tell you 1 why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tramp . I had a good boat , but the rest of it did n't look so good . No balloon-silk tents or fancy camp kits . I was afraid some official might stop me . He would n't know my experience . He would n't know how husky I was , nor that I 'd studied and dreamed about the Colorado until I felt I knew each rapid and rock and eddy . All he 'd see would be a wild-eyed Swede with a shoestring outfit , tackling the longest stretch of bad water in the world . So I shoved off at dusk on October fourth . This couple at whose place I left my car and trailer  --  I told them I 'd be back for it in six weeks or so  --  were down at the river to see me off . Several other folks were standing around , and the usual group of small boys . I do n't think they ever expected to see me again . I was n't so sure they would , either . It was twilight  --  I was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't sleep  --  and a gray , biting twilight , it was . I could hear the boys yelling to me long after I was out of sight , and I yelled back . I would n't hear many voices again , after that . Only four stops to Boulder Dam , 1100 miles away . Shooting the Colo  --  rado divides itself into two stages . The first stretch is the Green River to the junction with the Colorado be  --  low Greenriver , Utah . This is about 500 miles and includes the upper rapids and canyons . From the junction to Boulder is around 600 miles , the last 250 of which is the Grand Can  --  yon proper . The farther downstream you go , generally speaking , the rougher the water is , the last and toughest , just above Lake Mead , ( Continued on Page 34 ) ! Cohtfnurci from Phs ? 9 ) being Lava Cliff Rapids . So the first . stretch , to the junction , might be called the breaking-in period , where you learn what it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plies : At Jensen and Greenriver , Utah , above the junction , and at Lee 's Ferry and Grand Canyon below . In between , once embarked , there are stretches of hundreds of miles where you ca n't get out of the canyon , if your boat 's smashed beyond repair and you 're afoot . You ca n't follow down the banks , because there are oftentimes no banks in the sense of an ordinary river : the walls go straight up . There are timber and game in the upper stretch ; below the junction you 're soon rolling through desolation where there is n't much liv  --  ing except lizards . Every expedition that goes through finds traces of some unfortunates , individuals or parties , who have started down and never been heard of again . My hands were benumbed with cold , dropping down from Green River , Wyoming , which is flat country . Each morning I had to thaw out my clothes before I could get them on . Wherever my breath touched on my sleeping bag during the night , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that in Oregon , and it seemed to bite into my bones . The mountains were ahead . They looked friendly , and I knew that if I could beat the blizzard to the canyon , I 'd get along . I could see the cleft coming for miles ahead , where the whole terrain tipped upward and the river began to dip down into its gorge , the first of its 5000-toot fall to Boulder . From a distance it looked as if the river was running down into a bottom  --  less crack . I thought of those ancient words , " Abandon hope , all ye who enter here , " but did n't believe them . Flaming Gorge , Horseshoe and King  --  fisher canyons were short and rapids-free , filled with sunshine and songs of countless birds , and with the call of geese and ducks high overhead . Many deer and beaver could be seen along the tree-lined shores . The First Rapids It did n't lust long . I was soon into the first of the rapids , in Red Canyon , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky stream for three days : past Ashley Falls , the scene of many earlier disasters , and where inexperi  --  enced parties usually come to grief . It did n't seem very tough , at low water and with a good boat  --  not much tougher than the Rogue  --  and soon I came to Red Creek , where it was nec  --  essary to make the first portage . Here I started to throw away equipment that I did n't need , in order to shorten the ordeal of moving the boat and duffel over the rocks . I was learning . I threw away the heavy tent and slept after that in my sleeping bag alone . Out went the heavy iron pulley , which was useless ; even extra cakes of soap . That helped , because moving the boat was bad enough . I did n't figure to portage the boat more than I had to . That was one spot where previous expeditions had it on me . There 'd always been two or more in previous parties  --  sometimes ten or a dozen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over some of those places . When you figure what it means to move a 450-pound boat single-handed over shoulder-high boulders and knife-edged fragments and down cliffs , you can see why I planned to ride everything down that was short of suicide . I portaged only five times  --  three above the Colorado junction and two below . At each bad rapids I tied the boat and wont ahead to study the lay of the land . If there was a way through . I went on through . Nights were swell . Like that night after my first . portage below Red Creek Rapids . I ate a good meal , and stretched out in my sleeping bag beside the dying lire . I was tired , but could n't sleep right away ; I just lay for a while , comfort  --  able , watching the fading glow of the flames in the branches of the mountain cedar overhead , and after that looking up at the stars  --  I had never seen them bigger and brighter  --  high above the black , jagged silhouette of the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartments of the boat mingled with the roar from distant Red Creek . The peace and friendliness and physical relaxation wiped out the hardship of the day . In some ways I was lucky to be by myself . In most expeditions there was always an unfortunate or two who could n't stand the constant strain of it . Three of Major Powell 's party balked on the lower stretch , climbed the can  --  yon wall at about the only place along there where it could be climbed , and pushed out on foot across the desert , only to be killed by hostile Indians . Every large party since has had some  --  body that cracked . I loved it . The key facet of Buzz 's character . Without it , he was doomed . Depend  --  ent on his own physical and spiritual resources in a sense possible nowhere else on the globe , the awesome environ  --  ment was not terrible , but beautiful . The Viking strain in his nature ab  --  sorbed it thirstily . I was learning fast . Remember , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the preinitiation . Beginning whore my education had left off at the Salmon , I was being prepared for the Colorado . Two more days of hard row  --  ing  --  the current was too slow  --  took me through the wide , beautiful valley of Brown 's Park , long uninhabited , ex  --  cept for thousands of beaver , to the gateway of Lodore Canyon , only twelve miles long , but packed with vicious water . The first bad rapid , Disaster Falls , had claimed a boat from Major Powell 's 1809 expedition , and just last year Tony Backus left his boat wedged there . Biting off a chew of tobacco , in accordance with the ad  --  vice of old rivermen , I was soon through and on and through Triplet Falls . At the bottom of Triplet , I fotind jammed against a pile of drift the punctured stern compartment of a wrecked boat and two broken oars . There was no way to tell whose finish was written there , When I asked about it later , nobody knew . Just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed wrong . Hell 's Half-Mile came next , where I almost guessed wrong myself . Major Powell 's expedition gave it its name , in ' 69 , and it 's a good one . The river drops thirty feet here in less than a half mile , and the roar of it warns you for miles in advance that the horseplay is-over and the rough work begins . From above , its twisted channel appears to grin , its fangs bared and dripping . Having looked it over carefully and charted my mental course down that tossing inane , I went over the brink quickly , knowing that I dared not hesitate . Have I described the proper method for running tough rapids ? Let 's do it here , in Hell 's Half-Mile . I did n't evolve it myself : it has been worked out by all the experts who have sur  --  vived the bad ones . Nature 's Chute , the.Chutes I went over stern first , facing the rapids , rowing as hard as I could up  --  hill to check the speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , made their mistake ; they went down bow first and so had to row faster than the current to keep control , which , in turn , made it far more difficult to avoid the rocks . When you understand that the speed of the current here is better than twenty-five miles an hour  --  it seems much faster , but that 's how the Government experts meas  --  ured it  --  and that the full force of the river rolls down at that speed , you can imagine how fast the rocks seem to be leaping toward you and how exact must be your control on the oars to dodge in and out . Halfway down the boiling chute , we 4 struck a submerged boulder . You ca n't see such things in advance in such water . Had we been going head-on , the boat . would have been done for , right there , but at retarded speed the reinforced stern held . We hung for a split second , head-on in the current , then swung into the full grip of the heaped-up channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks that must be avoided . I gave the oars all I had , whirled the boat and pulled for my life . The in  --  stant we were in the clear we struck again , and this time the river seized my left oar and tore it from its socket . We hurtled sideways toward a huge boul  --  der , and it was there that the boat it  --  self did the trick . It slid upon the rock instead of crashing  --  I was thankful then for the rake I 'd given her bow  --  spun , and slid off . By now I had the oar in place , and we eased between the remaining rocks to a safe landing be  --  low . It seemed like the boat almost chuckled out loud at me there , when we were in the clear . " Happy to oblige . But next time do n't depend so much on me . " We came to my second portage , where I stumbled and sweated with heavy loads over boulders , through deep sand , up a rough mountainside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never again , I decided ; HO I discarded some extra flashlight batteries , 150 feet of heavy rope that I saw would be useless now , alone as I was ; a half gallon of dry beans , two cans of coffee , tin assortment of nails , a vacuum bottle and several cans of canned heat . I might tighten my belt thereafter , but I 'd get through faster . The next day we went through Split Mountain , one of the most unusual channels of the trip , The river runs ( continued an Pay . 36 ) 36 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 25 , zeaa ( Continued from Page 341 parallel , then turns suddenly and , for no reason apparent to Use eye , knifes into the heart of a mountain . But in  --  stead of going through , it doubles back and for six miles has cut a meandering , stately gorge before returning to what would appear to have been its natural course . This was the last tree-covered canyon , and not far below Jensen , Utah , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al  --  most . entirely . The name of the next canyon , Deso  --  lation , describes the whole country . The illusion was of sinking deeper into the heart of the earth , into giant di  --  mensions . I was approaching the junc  --  tion of the Colorado . At Greenriver , Utah , just above the junction , I heard about the last expedi  --  tion before me . A daring young Idaho river runner named Hyde had started there , in 192S , with his bride , to " hon  --  eymoon " through the canyon . Women have their place in the world , but they do not belong in the Canyon of the Colorado . The amazing part of it is that they got beyond Grand Can  --  yon  --  the town  --  which is a long way down . A relief expedition went in later and found their boat . I was later to see Hyde 's name painted on a cliff . I painted my name below ' his  --  mine is now the last  --  wondering , as I did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ap  --  pear on the long and lengthening list of those who failed to make it through . The jumping.Off Place And so we came to the Colorado , where it swings in from the east to join the Green . I had covered 500 miles ; 600 of the Colorado were ahead . Here , where you start down the deceptively easy-going first stretch of Cataract Rapids , is your final chance to turn back , though the early explorers , pros  --  pectors and trappers did n't know it . It is probably the world 's most decep  --  tive and fatal river trap . You begin by easy stages  --  you 're an early explorer now , with no previous records to guide you  --  and you tell yourself that this is n't bad ; you 'll see what 's around the next bend . From the bend it still does n't look bad  --  if you 've come down the comparatively smooth Colorado above the junction , you 've forgotten , or overlooked , how much more water has been added to the stream  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look so good . It is n't bad , but the walls are speeding by faster than before ; there 's a strength  --  ening roar ahead , deep-toned and re  --  verberating ; and , altogether , on second thought , you tell yourself you 'll turn back . But it 's already too Into for second thought . You 're in the canyon now  --  the most wonderful and beau  --  tiful and pitiless canyon in the world . The walls are - beer , their ( Tests arc rising , * timing to stretch higher and higher toward the blue sky right while you 're look  --  ing at them , and the speed  --  ing water joins wall to wall . There is n't any bank . No boat or living mists can hack-trail now , upstream . Well , you say  --  being a hardy adventurer who 's seen plenty tough rivers  --  we 'll have to make the best of it and go on through . So you do , and not hav  --  ing the proper boat  --  a boat for the specific purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . If you crack up in midstream , the river claims your body and does n't give it up . If you make it to the shore , your bleaching bones will join the others scattered along a 100-mile stretch . Your equipment will litter the banks and swirl to the outer edges of the great eddies , and so come to rest among the mute records of other parties who have passed that way . How many have per  --  ished there will never be known . Toward the middle of Cataract Canyon , the river was kind to me , a neophyte knocking at the door . I had tied up on the edge of a comparatively quiet eddy and had gone ahead to study this particular rapid . I decided to run it , but just as I was turning away , a whim of a receding wave showed a great submerged rock in the only possible channel . Had I turned back two seconds sooner , I would not have seen it . There was nothing to do but por  --  tage , a 100-yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . I had to get poles and small logs from the drift to use for skids over the great rocks : I would bridge gaps and slide the boat over . Sometimes they would roll , letting the boat drop down . At other times I would work the boat up a steep pitch , grunting and strain  --  ing , get it near Use top , and then it would slide back to the bottom again . I wished I had had a partner . As twi  --  light fell , I had it back in the river . That night I had my greatest fright in the Colorado . The only strip of sand wide enough for a bed was above the rapids , so I went back up over the man-killing rocks to it to sleep . Tired as I was from the portage , I could n't fall asleep . I lay there half dreaming , thinking of the rapids ahead , rechecking my mental data on them , and most of all trying to visualize Deu  --  bendorf , the greatest test of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a friendly moon it was to me , down there in the bottom of the great fissure , insectlike . Suddenly I remembered the boat . I had left it tied in such a way that the rope lay across a sharp rock . Had the constant stress of the water frayed the rope through ? I reared on an elbow and looked down over the rapids , and there in the moonlight I saw the boat , the broken rope trailing , just swinging out and into the grip of the current . Leaping up in a cold sweat , I ran down over tho rocks , stumbling and falling . With the boat gone , I was done for . The main channel tossed and glistened in the path of moonlight , empty and lifeless , but in the shadow where the boat had been , a gray shape loomed . It was not until I could get my hands on the canvas-covered hull that I knew that I had only dreamed it . The rope was sound and good , and the boat was still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . For a long time I sat there in the shadow with my hand on the boat , drawing reassurance from it . I was tempted to stay there till sunup , but I went back up over the rapids and crawled into my sleeping bag , half ashamed . If I could get that scared about a dream , what about Deubendorf ? While toting the equipment over the rocks to the boat , I found that I still had too much duffel , so overboard went the poleax , side of bacon , three cans of chili , three cans of corned beef and a pup tent that I 'd hold out be  --  fore . It was like burning my bridges behind me ; and , on the other hand , it was just another bet that I was right . If the boat cracked up and I made it to the bank , a hundred tons of food would n't have been enough . In the end , having eaten it , I 'd starve just the same . That day I ran through Dark Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  aract , and it made me feel better . I had got farther than those who had perished in Cataract , and that was something . At the same time , I knew from my maps that Glen Canyon be  --  gan a few miles below , and after that there would be 165 miles of relatively still water to row . Just below Cataract were the names of travelers who had made it this far , and I added mine , glad that I 'd kept the can of paint : Buzz HOLNIST11031 , 11-1-37 . Few would see my name painted there , but those few would un  --  derstand . Eight miles below , I saw the name of the Eddy Expedition on the cliff , and as I approached I saw below it carved the one name and date : 111-11 ) E , 11-1-2S  --  nine years earlier to the day . Four days of rowing took me through the 165 miles of Glen Canyon . It was beautiful here , and I stopped to take photographs of abandoned mining op  --  erations and cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy days , and though I did not know it , I was storing up stamina for Marble Gorge and Grand Canyon below . Particularly Deubendorf , which was never far from my thoughts . Footprints From the Past Probably the place of most interest in this stretch  --  Glen Canyon  --  is Hole  --  in-the-Rock Creek , where the early Mormon pioneers , who could not be stopped even by a barrier like the Col orado , performed the in credible feat of lowering horses and wagons down the almost perpendicular wall of the side canyon . The horses were then forced to swim across and the wagons ferried . Not far be  --  low is Father Esealante 's . Crossing , where steps were hewn in the canyon wall to got the horses down to the water . It was hard to be  --  lieve , yet the record is there , carved in rock . I made the mistake of passing Lee 's Ferry , form  --  erly operated by John Lee , Mormon pioneer , later ex  --  ecuted for his alleged part in the Mountain Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge , the river limas started its plunge ( Conelnamad on Page 38 ) ! Continued from Page 36 ) into Marble Gorge and leaves but one exit , a perilous climb over the walls of a side canyon . Two days were spent in overhauling the outfit and worming my way up and down the walls with fresh supplies obtained from the proprietor of Marble Canyon Lodge . There were touches of civilization here , glimpses of people and life . I had a momentary rebellion against saying good-by to that bright upper world and imprisoning myself again in the somber depths of ever-deepening Marble Gorge . But the challenge of Badger Creek Rapids was in the air , Waving good-by to antlike figures on the bridge 500 feet overhead , I shoved off . Badger Creek was n't so bad , and I went . on to Soap Creek , whose reputa  --  tion was n't so good . I was sure , from my data on it , that it would have to be portaged , but when I looked at the jump-off , I could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I understood each other better by now , I walked on down to study it , Sure enough , the message was there : " Unload your boat . and start near the right shore , cutting across below this first rock , where this ' big eddy will swing- you out of the main channel , and then you will slip past the other rocks and on through . But do n't miss a sin  --  gle stroke of the oars , or you 'll answer to me . " The river having been honest with me so far , I did as directed and the boat took me through without ship  --  ping a drop of water . That gave me my first sense of false confidence . Late in the afternoon , when I came to North Canyon Rap  --  ids , the river put me in my place again . I had n't studied the currents carefully enough , and , as a result , the boat was tossed crosswise into the largest wave I had yet seen . Its trough was so deep that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wave shook it so roughly that I had to let go the oars and hang on with both hands to keep from being catapulted out . Then , when I was help  --  less , the river contemptuously kicked the boat free , as much as to say : " Lot that be a lesson to you . " Lose World I went on , head up . with violent drops coming so close together that I had no time to relax after one before ! was into the next , and on to Cave Rapid , whose rough voice fills the great cavern from whence it takes its name . It was at this point that the Government survey expedition of 1923 found the equip  --  ment of some unknown party . From this point I traveled rapidly past gloomy eaves and beautiful hang  --  ing gardens that were ten times more beautiful in the midst of all this deso  --  lation , down is wirier canyon and on to the mouth of the Little Colorado . It was low and clear at this season , bring  --  ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silt-laden currents of the main river . While eating lunch there  --  consist  --  ing of one large , cold hot cake and one can of sausage  --  I caught the sun on the wings of an airplane fur above . To the pilot , the river must have looked like a pencil scrawl . But I was close to the river , close to its irresistible power , and could well believe that it alone had done the incredible job of carving such a canyon . One day 's run brought me to Granite Gorge , where the river , using its silt as an abrasive and cutting tool , has cut through what the geologists say is the oldest rock known to man , and on to Bright Angel Trail , where I tied up and went after supplies sufficient to last me to Boulder Dam , 275 miles away . At Grand Canyon village I was told of a party of geologists representing the Carnegie Institution and Califor  --  nia Institute of Technology , who were studying the old Archean rock found in the Granite Gorge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Canals Creek . I hoped to overtake them there , as they were traveling slowly , but there were famous rapids in between . Walthenberg was partic  --  ularly bad . And finally  --  after close to 1000 miles of expectation  --  Deuben  --  dorf . The lesser rapids above Walthen  --  berg bent both oarlocks and cracked an oar . When I came to Walthenberg itself  --  I was ready to portage , but it could n't be portaged alone , and there was nothing to be done but run it . So I looked it over and then shoved off . I bumped rocks twice  --  both glancing blows that made the boat groan ac  --  cusingly , but I came safely through . The Denton Deubendorf Camp that night was fireless , since the only driftwood was that caught in clefts fully seventy-five feet above the present surface of the river  --  proof enough of the mighty cataract that is there in flood stage . The next afternoon , I came to Deubendorf , named after a member of Julius Stone 's party whose boat cracked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half without a boat . Stone says that any  --  one who runs these rapids , at any stage of the water , will know he has tackled a real job ; and I can vouch for the truth of that . The more I looked at it , the worse it seemed . And the worse it seemed , the more I wanted to run it , even though it could be portaged and I did n't have that excuse . For forty days in the canyon and for months before , I had dreamed of this moment . The smooth current curved swiftly at the start , then reared up in huge waves that crashed and thundered over half-buried rocks below , These were the rocks upon which Dettben  --  dorf himself had crashed . Yonder , on the left , were the rocks that had taken one of Clyde Eddy 's boats when they were attempting to line it down , in 1927 . On the right were other rocks and islands that thrust the channel in . But there was a way . There was no channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of water built up in those tremendous waves , there was a space  --  time for a half dozen strokes on the oar  --  and two rocks at the right . Could n't I shoot through there , dodge that submerged one below , and so pass on safely into the farther eddies ? I was n't sure but that I was kidding myself . The line of rocks on the right threw back a big curling wave toward the heaped-up mountains in the main channel . At times this big wave was n't so high ; again , its curling crest was fifteen feel , overhead . The first prob  --  lem was to get by that backwash , hugging close to the rocks on the right , becalm if it ever slapped me back into the grip of the main channel , I was done for . That 's what happened to Deuben  --  dorf ; it 's probably what happened to everyone else that tried it . But . I bad a good boat ; I could move fast in is pinch . The wave could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be time for five or six quick strokes . Maybe . And if I got out of the clutches of the main channel , hard forward on one oar , hard back  --  ward with the other , should see me between the rocks on the right , and so into easier water . Understand me about this " easier " water . A month before , it would have looked plenty tough , that stretch half  --  way down Deubendorf . To get the proper slant on it , you should remem  --  ber that the Government experts fig  --  ure 8000 second feet at that point . In other words , there 's 8000 cubic feet of water rolling down at every tick of the clock . Well , I looked it over for fifteen min  --  utes and then turned back to the boat . There was no use waiting ; when you 've got ' er figured , it 's time to go . I could feel my heart beating . It seemed like it was beating down lower than usual , clown in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he climbed into the saddle and found that his knees were shaking . " Shake , damn you , " he said . " You 'd shake worse than that if you knew where you were really going . " Sure I was scared . I saw to it that the spare oars were properly lashed down , the proper side of the blades up . Those oars , lashed aft on each side of the deck , were always within my range of vision , because I was facing the stern , downstream . Then I felt of my sheath knife to see that it was hanging at the proper place on my belt . if an oar broke , I 'd have no time in the rap  --  ids to unlash a spare ; I 'd have to cut it loose  --  fast . Like the fellow said about the gas attack at the front , there 's only two kinds of folks left in the rapids when an oar breaks : the quick and the dead . Then I shifted my life preserver so it fitted comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute freedom , tilted my hat , braced my feet exactly right in each corner of the cock  --  pit and took a big chew of tobacco . In the rapids you 've got to have some  --  thing to sink your teeth into . Then I spit on my hands , took hold of the oars and shoved off . How long do you think it takes to run rapids like Deubendorf , once you 're over the brink ? About as long as it takes to say that old tongue-twister : " The ragged rascal ran around the rugged rock . " And that 's about the way it went too . Skirting Eternity I was over , crowding as close as I dared to the right . The water in the main channel was a heaped-up muddy mountain at my left ; my eyes were fixed on the big , curling wave that would tell the story . We came to it and the boat rode up it . We were standing on end ; we were thrown in toward the main channel ; we were halfway up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was waiting , the oars free ; when we struck , the oars dug in . I did n't count the strokes , but I think there were about five . On the second I thought I was done for ; it seemed that the channel had me . On the third I was sure of it . I said to my  --  self : " Well , Holmstrom , you came this far , anyway . " On the fourth we rode up a twenty-foot wave in the channel , but on the right-hand side of the crest ; we were sliding down . The boat had had that extra margin that it takes . On the fifth , the two rocks I 'd aimed at were alongside . Hard back on one oar , hard forward on the other ; and we were through , scuttling down between the rocks in the easier water below . It was that simple and that fast . I rode on through the eddies , the danger past , looking up toward the sky . To my amazement , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outdo the roaring of Deubendorf behind me . More than that , I 'd remembered four lines of Barnacle Bill that I 'd tried to recall for 1000 miles back . I had ' ern now , and I 'll never forget . them again . Two days ' traveling took me down past Havasu Creek , a quiet little stream that enters the Colorado through a narrow slit in the walls , but which opens up , in the interior , into a fertile , hidden , rock-walled valley , in  --  habited by the shy Havasu Indians . Toward evening of the second day , the roar of Lava Falls strengthened . Its vicious waters , twisting down between great blocks of lava , have never been run , and for a while I played with the idea of trying it rather than portaging . The Last Lap But I decided not to crowd my luck  --  you get that way while the mem  --  ory of Deubendorf is fresh  --  and port  --  aged over . The scientific party had portaged here , and it was plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a lot about their boats . White paint scraped off on sharp rocks told their color ; slivers of wood gouged out by the jagged lava showed that they were planked with mahogany . I put on speed , anxious to overhaul them ; and when night brought me to a camp site in Granite Park , I came upon a tripod made of driftwood and bearing a single sign . Two words . I read it , blinking . " Hello , Buzz " and the date : " 11-17-37 . " They knew I was coming ; they were expecting me down below . They had also left a can of cocoa , the most welcome imaginable addition to my limited fare . That cocoa warmed my stomach and the greeting warmed my heart . Next morning I entered lower Gran  --  ite Gorge , and at noon came to Dia  --  mond Creek , where the geological party were eating lunch . I had n't real  --  ized before how lonely I 'd been . With so much in common to talk about , we practically drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to tear my  --  self away the next morning . But they had plenty of time ; I had to get on . Lava Cliff Rapids  --  last , and classed by some as the toughest on the Colo  --  rado  --  was ahead . I was close to Boulder . As I was ready to pull out the next ; morning , Frank Dodge , head boatman of the party , and one of the greatest living river runners , followed me over to my boat . He was a heavy-boned , towering , silent man who 'd been run  --  ning rapids before I was born . He had n't said anything to me the night before , nor that morning . After he 'd looked the boat over , he stood there looking hard at me . He said , suddenly : " Buzz , you 're all right . " Then he walked away . Separation Rapids were the next hurdle , so named because it was hero that the three men left the Powell Ex  --  pedition of 1809-70 , choosing to go out overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , they met death at the hands of the Indians . Sotne authorities on the Colorado be  --  lieve that a quarrel with Powell , rather than fear , was responsible for their desertion . It sounds reasonable to me . After all , they 'd come through close to 1000 miles of the Colorado . They should have been used to rapids by that time . The tragic part of it , of course , was that they were almost through , though they did n't know it . Only Lava Cliff Rapids were ahead . After that , the last great barrier , the home stretch . To tell the truth , though I had maps whose reliability I had proved beyond doubt , that showed how close it was to Boulder , it did n't seem possible . You 'd never know it to look at the canyon or the river . I should n't use the words " only Lava Cliff Rapids . " They are supposed to be as bad as Deubendorf and are classed by some as worse . But From the first they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Deu  --  bendorf , and it did n't seem likely that they could be as tough . I 'd known all along that they could n't be lined by one man , or portaged ; so they had to be run , and that was that . , It was a jolt when I Caine to them . ' I 've never seen anything like them , and unless I run the Colorado again I never will . A delta had pushed in from the left , at the very brink . On the right a tremendous lava cliff , from which the rapids take their name , thrusts out into the channel . The full force of the current roars through and down directly upon bristling rocks . Because it is narrowed by these inthrusting escarp  --  ments , the heaped-up flood , bursting through , has a peculiarly sinister and savage appearance ; and there is abso  --  lutely no chance to ride the main cur  --  rent directly down , because the rocks are waiting . But there was a back eddy at the left , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the jump-off at an angle and rowed hard to the left , I 'd have a champ to miss the main channel and on a case where he ca n't use his rmouchards , and he 'll be as helpless as the average American flatfoot. simi  --  larly deprived . A couple of years ago an elderly Englishwoman , Mrs. Hunt , was found murdered and robbed in a hotel be ? , tween Cannes and La Boeca . Her bed  --  room door was bolted on the inside . A ladder was leaning against the balrony of her window , but it stood balanced so precariously on a garden table that it was impossible to climb and was dis  --  missed as a phony clue . Just before the crime was discovered , the police had chanced to collar a bum who was peace ? ' fully sleeping in a vacant house near by . As soon as they were notified of the murder , they very naturally tagged him for it . A few days litter , however , Mrs. Hunt 's empty pocketbook was found some miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this i  --  leared the bum , but they were so proud of their quick pinch that they merely laughed the pocketbook off , Then an anonymous letter came from Bordeaux , over at the other side of France . It said , in effect , " Turn that tramp loose . He had nothing to do with it . I did the job singlehanded . Before I strangled Mrs. Hunt , I took one shot at her and missed . 1 t made so much noise that I did n't risk another . I will not tell you how I got in and out , but i y f ou want to prove to yourlves ' that , I am telling the truth , lookse for a bullet in the mattress . " Shrugging skeptically , the cops cut open the mat  --  tress  --  and found the bullet ! Roughly as I have remembered and sketched it , you can see that this was a the roeks and case down alongside the wall . A chance being all I could hope for , I made ready and shoved off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it in and through and down , hard to the left and so into the swirling but easy eddies that wheeled along the wall . A few minor rapids were left , so the maps said ; and I proceeded cautiously . No use taking chances now , this close to the tape . In the morning I ate a big breakfast , filling my stomach for a hard day . Shoving off , I eased past the corner of the wall , and was surprised to find my  --  self in quiet and deepening water . It lapped gently against the walls on either side . The great waves smoothed out . For the first time in forty-four days on the river , the grip of the cur  --  rent relaxed , changed from steel to vel  --  vet , and from velvet to a last , lingering touch , and was gone . My momentum carried me on , but it was momentum alone . It could n't be . No still water like this was recorded below Lava Cliff . The maps said so , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it . Sine 's the maps had been made , Boulder Dam had been built . The impounded water had crept back this far into the canyon  --  much farther than I had dreamed . This was Lake Mead , created by the dam . There were no more rapids . Already the roar of the river was a whisper in the canyon . Ahead , the lake was widening , becoming more brilliant . Sunlight was beyond , flashing on the water . I drifted on for a while , head resting on my arms . Do n't ask me how I felt beautiful mystery . There were scores of other angles , all of them promising . There were even fingerprints . There was everything the French sleuth in the American Sunday supplements could ask . For the real French sleuths , however , there was everything but  --  renuchards . Due to this deficiency , the murderer of Mrs. Hunt is still at large . In 1925 . I think it was , a farmer in Aix-en-Provence reported to the police that the garden of the vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , there were strange , malodorous fragments lying around , and indicat inns that sulphuric acid had been poured upon the flower beds . Now here , you will say , was a fine chance to use the " scientific methods " you have often read about . The truth is that those methods are so archaic , and the facilities for applying them so ridiculously inadequate , that the cops simply did n't bother . As a matter of fact , they did n't bother much about anything . It was known , for in  --  stance , that the villa had been tenanted by an ex-lawyer named Sarret and two lady friends , now in Marseille , but no effort was made to look them up . No mouchard came through with any in  --  formation , so the cops advised the farmer to stick to his potatoes and forget it . About six years later an insurance company had reason to suspect that Sarret and the girls were pulling some fast ones , and asked for their arrest . It then developed that the fragments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gent named Chambon and a lady known as his wife , who had tried at that point ; not many would under- stand . It was n't exultance . It was a kind of all-gone feeling . The rapids were behind me now  --  Deubendorf and Lava Cliff and Walthenberg and two hundred others  --  and I would probably never run them again . I would never be so young again , nor so fit . I rowed around in circles for a while , within sound of the river . Once again there was no way out but ahead . So I spit on my hands and headed out ? into the open , through the widening canyon . It was warm here ; the sunlight was dazzling . The silt had vanished from the water like mist at morning ; it was crystal-clear . They had heard at the dam that I was coming , and a speed  --  boat had been sent out to tow me in . But my goal was the darn , and I would n't take the tow . It 's a big lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to row it . When I got to the landing , there was quite a crowd there  --  photographers and tourists and the like . After I did an errand that was on my mind , I posed for pictures and put the boat through her paces to show what she could do ; though I know she felt self-conscious , like I did , out there in the open quiet water . I was wearing close to two months ' whiskers ; my un  --  dershirt was ragged ; I looked like a tramp . She was battered and bruised by the rapids . Her original paint was almost gone . But she was a good boat still . The errand was to send a wire , like I 'd promised . It happened to be Thanksgiving Day  --  November 25 , 1937 ? and I knew my mother would be glad to hear from me . So I wired her : OKAY AT BOULDER DAM . HALDANE . I to muscle in on Sarret 's insurance swindles and been rubbed out for their pains . Between his sojourn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erased several other people and collected several million francs on their policies . Thanks to the insurance com  --  pany , and not to the police , he went to the guillotine . But if you want to see the Aix coppers in action . just drop into headquarters some morning , men  --  tion that you 're a journalist , and ask the way to Villa L'Hermitage . Then start running ! All France was still talking about the Sarret business when the police of Marseille , which is only seventeen miles from Aix , were waited upon by I the proprietor of a cheap hotel who complained that three Chinamen had messed up one of his rooms and then beat it without paying their bill . The commissaire hooked the complaint and sent a cop around to the flop joint to appraise the alleged damage . The room looked like a slaughterhouse . There was blood even on the ceiling . The cop , however , was inclined to take a cheer  --  ful view ; he deduced that one of the Chinks had fallen prey to nosebleed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital by his solicitous pals . Now , Chinamen do not , as a rule , snitch on one another , so the police had no Celestial mouchards to tip them off in this ease . But Chinamen are fairly scarce in France and , therefore , by an 1 obvious paradox , they are fairly easy to find . Three Chinamen would have been a cinch , had the police troubled to
