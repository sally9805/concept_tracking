" Archbishop Curley ? Morning Sun . Government forecasters report a severe storm moving up the coast from the Carolinas . What 's that going to do to your 100,000 ? " <P> ' ' You may disregard the storm warning . Tomorrow 's weather has been prearranged . " <P> Such a conversation took place one night last week between a Baltimore newshawk and Most Rev. Michael Joseph Curley , Archbishop of Baltimore . Next day Archbishop Curley was to pontificate at a solemn military field mass in Baltimore Stadium , in commemoration of triple anniversaries-the 300th of the founding of Maryland and the first Catholic mass on Maryland soil , the 100th of the birth of the late great James Cardinal Gibbons , the 20th of Archbishop Curley 's consecration as bishop . With good weather , 100,000 pious folk might be present to fill the stadium as it never had been filled before , and to participate in the largest U. S. mass since the Chicago Eucharistic Congress of 1926. * <P> The skeptical Sun printed the Government forecast and the morning of the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the stadium sat Governor Ritchie , Mayor Howard W. Jackson , State , city and military officials . Archbishop Curley , Archbishop McNicholas of Cincinnati , seven bishops , many a Jesuit and Most Rev. Amleto Giovanni Cicognani , who as Apostolic Delegate to the U.S. brought the blessings of the Pope . <P> Beneath the sullen sky , 70,000 Catholic priests , nun , 8 monks , seminarians , students , lay folk , Papal nobility and members of the Holy Name Society and Sodality of the Blesses Virgin Mary gathered along nearby streets to parade past the reviewers into the Stadium . They began marching . And suddenly the sun burst forth . It shone on the marchers , hotter and hotter . Not until they had watched the parade for three hours could Archbishop Curley and his party gather up their trains and skirts and swing in line to enter the Stadium . <P> On the greensward at the north end of the Stadium field stood a portable altar flanked with thrones for the celebrants of the mass and surmounted by a tabernacle of rare woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one before which the first Maryland mass was sung . In the stands behind the altar sat 10,000 Catholic schoolchildren to chant the music of the mass . And on the hot , hard benches sat the rest of the 100,000 . A bugler sounded " Attention " ' at the Sanctus , Consecration and Communion , and two French 75 's boomed on a nearby hill when Archbishop Curley held aloft the consecrated particle . <P> Enthroned on the epistle side of the altar , the swart Apostolic Delegate looked cool and content . In mitre , gloves , amice , alb and stiff brocaded chasuble , 54-year-old Archbishop Curley perspired heavily but went through the ritual as valiantly as if he had not passed a winter of poor health and fasted 13 hours before the mass . Not so stalwart was many another Catholic in the Stadium . By the time the mass was under way people in the stands were dropping by dozens . By the time Rev. Dr. Peter Keenan Guilday , Catholic University historian , was in the midst of his long sermon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up &; down the cinder paths of the Stadium . Hospital tents were swamped . Fifty extra nurses were recruited from the stands to help out the 100 already on duty .
