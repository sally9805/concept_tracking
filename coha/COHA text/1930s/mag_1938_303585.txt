The closing days of Maryland 's sizzling primary fight between brusque , well-to-do Senator Millard E. Tydings and homespun little Representative David John Lewis brought Democrats something new to talk about almost hourly last week . Items : <P> A pamphlet deriding " The Life &; Times of Milord Tydings , " picturing his Chesapeake Bay estate ( whence Washington clubs and hotels buy 1,000 hens ' eggs a day ) as a feudal manor and his rich New Deal in-laws , Ambassador &; Mrs. Joseph E. Davies , as a royal family . <P> Declaration by the Senate Campaign Investigating Committee that two Federal job-holders-Collector of Internal Revenue H. Hampton Magruder at Baltimore , Postmistress Maude Toulson at Salisbury-had violated Federal laws in politicking for Candidate Lewis . <P> An order from PWAdministrator Ickes-acting at President Roosevelt 's express bidding-telling a subordinate to give " prompt attention " and " right of way " to two new PWA bridges for Maryland. * <P> A cartoon by Jerry Doyle in the Philadelphia Record and New York Post twitting Senator Tydings for claiming he embraced the ' ' bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <P> But none of these excitements touched the heart of the issue , which remained what Franklin Roosevelt had made it : a specific judgment by Maryland on the past , present and future of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal . In a memorably heavy vote , Maryland passed this judgment with relatively little disorder for a primary in which feelings had risen so high . Result : Millard E. Tydings unPurged by a ratio of 3 to 1 . <P> <P> * last week , just four days before the Georgia primary in which the President sought to beat Senator Walter George with Atlanta 's District Attorney Lawrence S. Camp , WPA announced a $53,000,000 road-building program for Georgia 's rural counties .
