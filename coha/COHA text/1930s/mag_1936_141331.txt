Out of the bleak little port of Churchill , Manitoba , on the west side of Hudson Bay last week churned the freighter Firby , bound for England with six passengers , a cargo of wheat , flour , timber . under an organized booking service . In the past , passengers have occasionally been taken , usually listed as crew . The new arrangement is the latest Canadian effort to make a paying proposition out of Churchill , which was developed as a port five years ago at tremendous cost , has so far proved a failure . <P> For ten months of the year Churchill is icebound , snow-laden . Sole reason for making it a port was to reduce Western Canadian wheat-growers ' freight rates to Europe . Churchill , at latitude 59 , is no farther from Liverpool than are Montreal and New York , both of which are twice as far from the Saskatchewan wheat fields . For 50 years Canadian wheatmen agitated for a railroad over the frozen muskeg to Churchill . In 1931 they got it , at a cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin from The Pas , Manitoba , prime junction on the Canadian National Railways . Another $25,000,000 went toward fitting up Churchill as a port , building a 2,500,000-bu. grain elevator ( TIME , Sept. 24 , 1931 ) . <P> Last year only six freighters visited Churchill . The five-year average of grain exported is a mere 3,000,000 bu . The town , itself , once planned to become a metropolis , remains a huddle of shacks on the naked shingle beside the Bay . The Hudson Bay Railroad runs but one train a week . <P> This year promises to be Churchill 's best by a small margin . Eight ships carrying freight alone , seven more also carrying passengers are scheduled to sail before the freeze-over about Sept. 30 . Costing $70 per ticket , the voyage takes from 14 to 20 days , offers a view of a part of the world where few besides explorers have been . According to the booking agent , last week 's six tourists-four from Vancouver , two from Regina-were merely " curiosity seekers . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
