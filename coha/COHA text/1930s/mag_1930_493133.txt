Two American Boys in the U. S S. R. WE HAVE now been in Moscow four weeks . We have had our own room for two weeks ; are earning our own living ; I have barged into the newspaper game ; we understand more about Russia and the Russian language every day and expect to have the latter well under control within the next few months . I am certainly glad I came . The trip was hard as hell , but wort1 : , while , considering the end . I find here a mental stimulus that I need . - Moscow is the most unusual and different place that I have ever seen , and for that reason among others , is the most - fascinating , There are more beautiful cities than Moscow : there are cities with more pretty women , and more pretty , shops : there are cities with good pipe tobacco : but they all lack that current of real life that you feet flowing here . I have lots of fun . Of course , the main thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know , when you buy something , that the dough is n't going into the pocket of some fat guy or on his wife 's back . It 's great to pass swell buildings that used to be the gilded r , e : sorts of the rich and see them being used by the finding that they ca n't have all the butter and eggs they want , and that their bathtub perhaps does n't drain well , and that people jostle them on the street instead of stepping into the gutter as the august personage goes by . They damn the whole works on account of these few personal discomforts . They forget that these are quite minor things and that the really important things are ridding the country of the kulak , starting collective farms and carrying out the Five Year Plan . While the personal discomforts are , no doubt , a trifle disagreeable at times , I am glad on the whole that they exist . Never before did I realize how much a good crop means and how dependent we are on bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . All my views are being clarified and organized by the experience I am getting here . At home I felt as if I were merely dawdling away and wasting my life , but here I feel as if I were really living and seeing life as it is . Things are going fine . My visa has been extended six months , so I sha n't have to bother getting one every month , and today I received my correspondent 's card , which gets me a lot of privileges , including permission to buy butter , bread , eggs , etc. , at the big market on the Tverskaya . We are now living by our own efforts . We had a meeting of the treasury department yesterday and find we have enough money on hand to guarantee us an easy living until we get our next pay for work we are doing now . We want to save some money to travel next summer and to tide us over in case lessons peter out in the summer . It 's lots of fun earning our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here another year at least because it is so interesting . From time to time I shall take a little trip to Ware saw for a week in the lap of luxury and then come back . We want to travel all over Russia too . We plan to make a trip to Leningrad before summer . It costs only five dollars to go there and takes overnight . There is no trouble about finding a place to live there . R. K. Mrs. B ( our hostess ) has a job now in a chainaya ( tea house ) and goes to work every day at about eight o'clock . B has no job , so he stays home , sweeps , cooks and generally keeps the house in order . So the conditions are reversed in this house for the time . The wife goes out and brings in the bacon , while the husband stays home and does the domestic work . B works as an interpreter or guide , when he can get a job . Business in that line is slack at this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wall paper now and then . lie says now that he thinks he will try to get a job as somewhere . He has a hard time getting a job because he comes from the wrong sort of /2 ? e ? 131e . He does n't harbor any bitterness about it ' Rough . He realizes that there is nothing personal itrit at all and frankly says that things are , on the I'vbule , much better now than they were before . He says , that he is discriminated against because it is felt that if any counter-revolution comes , it will , of course , come from the old aristocrats . Ninety-nine out of a hundred old aristocrats , if they gave jobs to them , might be perfectly 0 . K. in every respect and a help to society , but one might be a bad one . There 's no way of telling , and they ca n't give the ninety-nine jobs and run the risk of letting the one who might do real damage into the inside of things . B ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first month 's pay . As soon as she arrived she took the money out of her purse and handed it over to B and he calmly put it into his own pocket . It seemed funny . After all , though , why is it any stranger for a wife to hand money to her husband than for a husband to hand money to his wife ? And no matter who holds the money it will be spent for the same things . D. K. Thursday night , when we went over to D ? ' s weekly " salon , " we stayed so late that the trams had stopped running . It was about two and they stop at one . So we bargained with an izvoschik who was sitting there . We asked how much to our place and he said four rubles . We parried with " one " and he snapped " three , " which we ducked and sent in a " two . " He shook his head , so we started walking off yelling " two " over our shoulders once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to take you , he will come running after you in the sleigh . He did n't , so we went on and soon found a line of them . We picked the first boy and suggested that he take us home for a ruble . " Three , " said he . " One-fifty " we came back . No ? All right . So off we started . But he whipped up his nag and came after us , and motioned to get into the seat , which is so narrow that half of me hung over one side , and three-quarters of David , as he is bigger . We sang jolly ditties on the way home . Every time a militiaman hove in view , the izvoschik would hold up a warning hand and we would pipe down , to break forth again once we were by him . You feel as if you were really in Russia when you ride in one of these things over the frozen ground . When we got home I was conscience-stricken at the low price I had bargained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was tickled to death . Tomorrow B is going to get bread cards for us . We have lived here " a month now and are both working , so we have a right to them . It will enable us to get more of the cheap tea . You can buy all the tea you want at a ruble-fifty for one ? hundred grams , but with the card you can get the same amount for about half . The sausage they sell here is all one kind , quite a bit on the order of bologna . But it tastes much better . I am fond of it fried and have it every morning for breakfast , and the other day I felt hungry when I was going over to see Mrs. P so I bought three hundred grams of it , about two-thirds of a pound , and took it with me . She had bread and made tea for me , so I had a fair meal for twenty-five cents . R. K. It is surprising the way Russians pack themselves into rooms . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here when we come home at night . Last night we came in and ' found five sleeping in the other room : on the regular bed were Mrs. B and her sister , on the couch were B ? and his uncle , while little Boris was draped over a couple of chairs . D. K. Do you know , in the new community ' dwelling houses the people have no more privacy than in a fraternity house , which set me to wondering whether the desire for privacy is innate or acquired . I shall see Professor X , who is one of the planners of this style of dwelling , tonight and ask him what he thinks about it . Last night they had a big parade , in lorry buses and on foot , of all the engineers and technical workers in Moscow . They all gathered in Theater Square and had what in America would be called a " pep " meeting on the Five Year Plan . There must have been about ten thousand gathered , in all . Speeches were made and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is astounding the amount of energy that is let loose in Russia now . Take one of my pupils at the AMO works . He works four out of five days at AMO . On the fifth day , instead of resting as he should , he works at some institute . After dinner he gets together with some of his pals and works at something , I do n't quite know what , until ten or eleven o'clock at night . He studies English too . And still he seems to be fresh and full of vim and vigor . How can they do it ? P ca n't fathom it , either . He says that so many people refuse to take their fifth day that they are considering passing a rule to make it compulsory to take it . When you see some of the things they are doing and some of the blunders they make , you wonder how they accomplish the wonderful things that they do . It must be because there is such an enormous lot of energy turned loose that even if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apace . We get a big kick out of our new hats , and besides it 's fun to walk along the street and not be stared at . Our other clothes still afford some amusement for the natives . The other day , as I was standing in the street , a stranger came up to me , tapped me on the shoulder and pointing to my French shoes said , " Citizen , where did you get those shoes ? " I replied that I had got them in France . He nodded his head and kept on looking me up and down . Suddenly his eye lit on my flannel shirt with the zipper down the front and he became puzzled again . " Citizen , where did you get that shirt ? " " I bought that shirt in America . " This staggered him and he walked away . When I got on the street car a few minutes later , I looked back and saw him standing , still staring after me . If he had carried on his little investigation to its natural conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and that would have finished him , I think . My lesson at AMO is at four o'clock . At about three I put on my nice warm fur-lined coat and my bizarre black hat and plunge out into the cold and snow . I walk about a block and a half to Kalushkaya Square , where I fight my way into a B tram . A lot of other Muscovites want to get on the same street car at the same time , so that in the fracas I very likely have another button ripped off my coat , my hat is knocked sideways and anything soft in my pockets is crushed . But I get on all right , because there are few men in Moscow who can best either of us in a rough-and-tumble fight . As everywhere else , for some reason , the fat , middle-aged women are the worst elbowers of all . If I am lucky , I get a seat . When I sit down I immediately begin rubbing with my fingers and blowing to make a hole of about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . Once I get this peephole made , I cock an eye out of it every time we come to a stop to see where I am . When I first arrived it was as scary as hell to ride on the trams because I felt so shut up , and even if I could see out , I was afraid I could n't recognize the place where I wanted to ' get off . But now I am an expert , and am never carried by my station . After about fifteen minutes I get off this moving refrigerator of a tram car at Taganka . Here I stand around another fifteen minutes stamping my feet until a Number 16 car comes along . When it finally does come , I go through the same battle to get on as before , and after about twenty minutes I am at AMO , the end of the line . Once there I show my pass to a mild little red soldier at the gate , and walk in . My shoemaker has put me off no less than seven times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian boots . Damn his soul ! It seems he gave them to somebody to put the finishing touches on and he knows only the first name of this man and does n't know where he lives and the man hasp t turned up with the boots yet . I would like to beat him up , but that would n't do . These are the times when it would be nice to be able to speak Russian fluently . I should like to make some cutting remark to him that would rankle and make him lie awake nights trying to think of an answer , but so far . I. have been able to think of nothing satisfactory . I am now earning between a hundred and fifty and two hundred rubles a month with my group and private lessons . You can live cheaply in Ws ' cow . I could easily get along on a hundred rubles a month . From all that I have seen and heard I am convinced that Russia will be the leading country or the world before long . They have unbounded energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed toward one clear and definitely defined goal . They make mistakes , of course , and big mistakes , but such a wealth of energy and singleness of purpose are bound to succeed in the end , barring a big catastrophe . As for me , I am enjoying it no end , and if 1 do n't actually take up permanent residence here , I shall at least stay for some time to come . It is interesting , new , different , stimulating ? all that goes to make for a lively mental life . History is in the making here and if you do n't actually see the big things going on under your very eyes , you feel very definitely that they are going on and everyone is forever talking about them . P --  -- - is most enthusiastic . Among other things he says that he thinks that the youth , energy and determination of the new engineers will more than make up for the terrible scarcity of old and experi enced engineers . Also he says that in the first year of operation the new communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming crop The other day I was sitting in a bus and a couple Of militiamen climbed on . I noticed that one of them looked extremely young and boyish for a policeman , and upon looking closer discovered that it was a woman , and just a young woman at that . What a surprise . You can imagine women in almost everything else , but somehow you never imagine a woman as a policeman . On the tram that I just came in on from AMO the motorman and the conductor were both women . I see lots of women shoveling snow in the street every day , but I have n't seen a woman with a pick yet . Good for the women ! D. K. This climate is greatly exaggerated . It really is n't as bad as New York from the point of view Of any suffering from it . Now the weather is hanging Just below freezing and the snow is a bit sticky so that it makes " good packing " for the kids who want to throw snowballs . I must be growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old joy in throwing them . I once tried throwing a couple at a bunch of kids who bombarded me as I stepped out of Illy door . The government encourages skiing and other snow sports by selling the equipment at a very low price . For instance , you can buy a Pair of ordinary clamp skates for three dollars , and a good pair of skis for seven dollars , which is low , considering the prices they charge for other things . ? We miss our good old Edgeworth smoking to- bacro . But if we ca n't get that we can have other things , Right now I am puffing on a pretty good Russian fag . Last night we smoked a lot of Camels which an American lady whom we met at the dinner given by M gave us . I like the Russian r ? es almost as well now because I am getting used them . Then , too , whenever I want to , I may step out into the street , walk a couple of blocks to the store and buy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cognac , rum and brandy that I want . Asa result of being able to do this , I rarely take advantage of it . R. K.
