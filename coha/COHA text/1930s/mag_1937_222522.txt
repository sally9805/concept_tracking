THE MENTALLY ILL IN AMERICA - Albert Deutsch- Double day , Dor an ( $3 ) . <P> Haunting U. S. psychiatrists almost as much as it does their prospective patients is the alarming increase of modern mental diseases. * One out of every 22 persons , promises a New York State survey , may expect to spend some part of his life in a mental hospital . The gloomiest statisticians predict that in a couple of centuries everybody will be insane . The Mentally Ill in America is an authoritative , well-organized account of how the U. S. has coped with mental defectives thus far , attempts no predictions . <P> That modern treatment of mental diseases has gone a long way since colonial times is well illustrated by a description of such early methods of treatment as burning at the stake , iron shackles , " Madd-shirts , " liberal doses of such drugs as " Spirit of Skull " ( moss from the skull of a dead man unburied who had died a violent death ) . With exclusively mental hospitals limited to two until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited in cages for a fee , peddled at night from town to town in the hope of losing them . Called incurable until about 1830 , insanity then enjoyed a craze of " curability , " claiming 90% effectiveness ( one patient " recovered " 46 times , died in an asylum ) . A pessimistic reaction revived an old slogan , " Once insane , always insane . " <P> Of the doctors and reformers who pioneered U. S. psychiatry , Benjamin Rush showed the greatest ingenuity , Dorothea Dix ( credited with founding or improving 32 mental hospitals ) the greatest energy . Better known to present-day readers is Clifford Beers , whose autobiography , A Mind That Found Itself , published in 1908 , created a sensation by exposing his typically brutal treatment in private , endowed and State hospitals during a three-year stay . On the crest of the ensuing public indignation was launched the modern mental hygiene movement , which during the World War received an impetus like neurology in the Civil War . When IQ tests tried out on the Army revealed that nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrists decided to look into the matter again , presently announced sweeping qualifications . <P> Most likely to interest readers are the closing chapters , dealing with the types of modern mental diseases , methods of treatment and their results , the difficulties which will continue to baffle psychiatrists until something is done about eliminating such breeders of mental diseases as poverty , wars , the wear &; tear of living in a world that grows more disordered from day to day . <P> <P> * On the books of 477 mental hospitals in the U. S. in 1934 were 451,672 patients ( estimate first quarter of 1937 480,000 ) , an eightfold increase during the last 50 years as against a twofold increase in population .
