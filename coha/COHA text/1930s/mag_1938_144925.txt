Year ago , the 1,650-ton Spanish Leftist destroyer Jos Luis Diez limped into Falmouth , England , seriously damaged by Rightist air bombs . Most of her crew of 60 left the ship , claiming that they would be shot as " Reds " if they returned to Rightist Spain , as " deserters " if taken back to Leftist Spain . A loyal skeleton crew took her to France for repairs , and fortnight ago the Jos Luis Diez was again ready for action . <P> A 27-year-old commander , Juan Antonio Castro , took her out of Le Havre , France with a new loyal crew , determined to sail around the bulge of the Iberian Peninsula and through the Straits of Gibraltar to the Mediterranean . Meanwhile , Rightist warships vigilantly patrolled the Straits . One night last week , when land fighting on the stalemated fronts was comparatively quiet with only a minor Leftist counteroffensive in the South being waged , Commander Castro decided to run the blockade . About midnight , with lights out , the Jos Luis Diez passed Tangier , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of Spain , the destroyer caught two armed Rightist trawlers . Commander Castro put their crews of 24 men in chains in the destroyer 's bow and sank the trawlers . Ten miles east of British-owned Gibraltar , at 2:15 a.m. , just when Commander Castro thought he had successfully eluded his enemies , the 8-inch guns of the Rightist cruiser Canarias began to boom out of the dark . Soon three Rightist destroyers joined the attack . <P> A direct hit in the port bow killed the 24 chained prisoners and eight of the crew . <P> Disabled , the Jos Luis Diez crept back to Gibraltar , and was beached in shallow water behind the Mole . That afternoon the British destroyer Vanoc gave Rightist and Leftist dead a sea burial . For the superior Rightist Navy the battle was partial revenge for the sinking a year ago of its battleship Espaa , the torpedoing last winter of its cruiser Baleares.
