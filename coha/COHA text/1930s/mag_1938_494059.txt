A Journal of Opinion The Same Old GOP For the last year or two , a lot has been said in the press about a new spirit in the Republican Party . We have been given to understand that the Tories were no longer in the saddle , that the party realized it must keep up with the times and was prepared to do so . Yet a few days ago when these new principles were tested , they seemed dismally lacking . The Republican National Committee elected to its executive committee former Senator D. 0 . Hastings of Delaware , a spokesman for the duPonts and as complete a reactionary as can be found in the country . In doing so , the committee passed over Kenneth Simpson of New York , one of the younger and more liberal leaders . While Mr. Simpson is far from being our idea of a leftist , he is a tower of light and learning compared with Mr. Hastings . It is our guess that the election of November has had a lot to do with the sudden Republican recidivism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is tired of the liberals and that the GOP can safely go in for black reaction . We hope they continue in this frame of mind ; it will greatly lessen the chance of a Republican victory in 5940 . The Case of the Electrical Workers In the Supreme Court decision on the Consolidated Edison case in New York the National Labor Relations Board has suffered its first important reverse among the many cases that have been appealed to the Court . This reverse , however , is extremely limited in its ap plication . The Board had issued an order invalidating a contract between Consolidated Edison of New York and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , on the ground that there was no proof that this A. F. of L. union really represented the employees . A CIO organizing campaign was under way , the CIO union had many members , and the Board believed that the contract was signed to head off this campaign , much in the same way that employers sometimes organize and contract with company unions ? an illegal practice . The order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on several grounds . The Court held that the Board had jurisdiction , since the company was not a purely state affair . But it decided ? with two dissenting on this point ? that the Board did not present sufficient proof that the IBEW did not represent the employees , and that it should have given this organization a chance to make good its claim . The Court , however , specified that the union could not , in the circumstances , be the sole bargaining agent , but could bargain only for its own members . While the Labor Board is thus partially defeated in this particular case , the way is still open to stop the kind of unfair practice against which it wishes to protect the workers , if it will adopt a different procedure . The Lamb Signs with the Wolf France and Germany have solemnly gone through with the hocus-pocus of a non-aggression pact , accompanied by negotiations looking toward an increase in trade . It would be unfair to say that the new under- 158 standing between two old enemies means absolutely nothing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chamberlain 's desires for a four-power agreement in Western Europe . Beyond that , however , it has little significance . Hitler said in ? Mein KampP ' that France is the great enemy and that finally she must be attacked ; he has not changed his mind . There is good reason to believe that the Nazi timetable of aggressive demands includes in the fairly near future an attempt to seize Alsace . It suits Der Fiihrer 's schemes to give an appearance of solidarity in the West now , partly for its effect on Poland and Soviet Russia ; but the mask will be removed when the time comes . The French know this , which is an added reason why the life of the Daladier government is not likely to be long . Manufactured Agitation in Italy There is no spontaneous public opinion in Italy , any more than there is in Germany . When Italian newspapers and orators suddenly begin to demand that territory be taken away from France , including Tunisia and part of the Riviera , it is perfectly certain that Mussolini is behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to why he took this action at this time , there are several things to be said : r . The standard procedure of the Italian and German dictatorships is now for them to take turns in abusing France and England respectively , as a part of their general blackmailing process . 2 . Germany wanted the Italians to raise a row on the eve of the signing of the French-German non-aggression compact , in order to show France the impossibility of a general German guarantee of all French frontiers , including those in the North African colonies . 3 . Mussolini himself feels that he is being left out of the picture too much , and that the louder he screams the more likely he is to get some attention paid to him . In particular , he would like to get a sharp reduction of Suez Canal tolls and of freight charges on the French-owned railway from Jibouti to Addis Ababa . In fact , however , he might about as well have saved his breath . Mr. Chamberlain is going to Rome in January to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are saying now in England , " if at first you do n't concede , fly , fly again . " The dictators are insatiable ; the Chamberlain policy is an impossible one , yet it is dear that he intends to push it still further . The C. of C. , Guns and Money To our mild surprise , we find ourselves agreeing in part with the committee on federal finance of the United States Chamber of Commerce . The committee is opposed to vast outlays for the national defense . It says ? and we think it is right ? that such expenditures make a poor sort of " pump-priming . " At this point , however , we part company with the C. of C. We look askance at the schemes for armament 1 , " . nqe Vie fear that they will be made a device for ladling out vast quantities of government money in quarters where it ought not to go and for purposes which have nothing to do with genuine defense . The C. of C. wants relief projects suspended and the unemployed sent back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dole . It demands an end of deficit budgets without any increase in taxation . The authors of this report are true Bourbons in that they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing . The government took their advice in 1937 and brought on the depression from which we are only now emerging . Our own program is simple . Let 's spend on the national defense only as much as it is proved that the national defense really needs . Let 's spend on the pump . priming projects whatever can be expended profitably to the end that the country shall have the benefit of the work done , and that we shall preserve the great national asset to be found in the morale and the skills of our millions of workers for whom private industry , which the C. of C. represents , has found no room . Battleship Budget A month ago we printed a short editorial discussing the size of the private bids for three out of the Navy Department 's four new battleships . The estimates came to about $55,000,000 apiece for hull and machinery alone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each to about $70,000,000 . There was no real competition in the bidding ( each of the three companies entered an estimate for one ship only ) and , in comparison with the cost of the last three battleships , built for about $27,00o,000 apiece , the price seemed steep . The New York Union of Marine Draftsmen and Technicians , which is the Brooklyn Navy - Yard chapter of the Federation of Architects , Engineers , Chemists and Technicians , has the same feeling . The union charges that the contracts let by the Navy Department to the Newport News , Bethlehem and New York companies for the 35,000-ton capital ships represent approximately $15,000,000 more per ship than the Navy Yard estimates for the same work on the 35,000-ton " Washington " and the " North Carolina , " now under construction in Brooklyn and Philadelphia . In a telegram to President Roosevelt the union declared that $45,000,000 could be saved by having the three new ships constructed in government navy yards and that these yards have the facilities and man-power to handle the job . Battleship building and its cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opinion on the merits of these charges , but it seems clear that the Navy Department should not give the job to the private companies unless it can prove the union is wrong . Funny Business in Birmingham Who runs politics in Alabama ' This question may appropriately be asked as a footnote to the article lay W. T. Couch , on page 168 of this issue , reporting the Southern Conference for Human Welfare . Mr. Couch describes the trouble that was made for the conference over the matter of segregating the white and Negro delegates . There is solid evidence that before the conference even began , deliberate plans were laid to make as much trouble as possible . Individuals connected with the Republican Party in Alabama ( did you know there was one ? ) broadcast the false charge that this conference was inspired and controlled by Communists . Mr. Eugene Connor , the commissioner of public safety in Birmingham , who is himself in politics , was asked well in advance to provide police officers to direct the crowds entering the city auditorium so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first refused and finally , under great pressure , consented . He failed to make good on his promise , however , and the police were not present at the beginning . The fictitious issue of race segregation is now being used by the Birmingham , Jefferson County and Alabama Women 's Democratic Club for purposes of their own . They are trying to force Mrs. Louise 0 . Charlton , honorary chairman of the conference , to resign from the State Democratic Committee . The Tory ladies of these clubs are seeking to have the Alabama delegation at the next National Democratic Convention pledged to Senator Bankhead , as a move hostile to President Roosevelt . It might be a good idea to hold another Southern conference on human welfare devoted to the funny people and the funny doings in Birmingham . Connecticut Get-Together A spy reports to us that the Connecticut Writers ' Conference , held in New Haven on December 4 , was quite a lively affair . There are lots of writers in the Nutmeg State , and about sixty of them attended as delegates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascism and Censorship and the Writer 's Role ; and in fact they did so , at no small length . But they were also confronted by local needs and problems ? for example , by representatives of the A. F. of L. and the CIO who wanted speakers at union meetings , teachers in labor schools and contributions to trade-union papers ? with the result that the discussions had a practical , down-to-earth quality that was somewhat lacking in the two national writers ' congresses held in New York City . The Connecticut conference was also distinguished by two of the dozen papers that were read . One of them was by Van Wyck Brooks , who was making what we are told was his first appearance on any public platform . He analyzed the Yankee tradition and gave a candid statement of his own political beliefs , recapturing the confident mood of those early essays in which he announced America 's coming-of-age . Odell Shepard had been asked to speak on " Connecticut Culture : Its Past and Present . " He did speak , for twenty minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger against billboards and filling stations and the water companies that are now drowning out159 whole villages . It was the first time on record that a writers ' conference had actually produced a poem . What Does Ford Think ? Many of the newspapers carried a story from Detroit with a November 3o dateline . It contained an " authorized " statement by Henry Ford in which he recommended the United States as a haven for the Jewish victims of Nazi terrorism , praised the " ability and loyalty " of his Jewish employees and disavowed any sympathy with Nazism . The statement was supposed to have been issued by Mr. Ford as a result of his meeting with Rabbi Leo M. Franklin of Detroit , a leading worker in the task of finding refuge for the homeless Germans . About a week later Father Coughlin , in his radio address , described the statement as " inaccurate . " Coughlin said it had been written by Rabbi Franklin , not by Mr. Ford ; that Mr. Ford had actually said he believed there was little or no persecution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( according to Father Coughlin ) it was due not to the German government but to the war mongers , the international bankers . He expressed his humanitarian feeling for all people , but he believed Jews would n't be content to work in factories . He did not mention or criticize Nazism . All this information Father Coughlin had , indirectly , from Harry Bennett , Ford 's personnel manager , who was present at the meeting . For fifteen years or more there have been reports that Henry Ford is an anti-Semite . In recent months there have been suspicions as well that he is a friend of Nazism ; suspicions seemingly supported by the fact he received a decoration from the German government . If anyone cares what he thinks about such matters , it is time for Henry Ford to speak his mind . One Tablet and the Other There are two Catholic papers called The Tablet , one published in London , one in Brooklyn , New York . In its issue of October t s , the one in London published an article by Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Collins , who had just returned from a trip to Spain , reported that there are 3,000 Roman Catholic priests in Barcelona , and that no one has any difficulty in attending mass there , weekdays or Sundays . She said the government was anxious to open the churches publicly and that this move has not yet been taken only because the Vicar-General of the Church had advised against it . Thus The London Tablet on October 15 . On November 16 , a month and a day later , we find The Brooklyn Tablet denouncing the persecutions in Germany but regretting that the general protest has " not been widened to include the far worse crimes committed against the Catholics of Spain . " Required reading for Father Francis 5 . Healy , editor of The Brooklyn Tablet : The London Tablet . New Magazine Frank Gannett , the newspaper publisher and chairman of the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government , has sent us a copy of his new monthly magazine , America 's Future . It contains twenty-four pages about Saturday Evening Post size and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . The title , America 's Future , is misleading . Mr. Gannett 's latest publishing venture might have been called , more properly , Smear Roosevelt . For it contains almost nothing besides ponderous broadsides aimed at the President and the New ; ) Pal administration . Amos Pinchot contributes his open letter to John L. Lewis , Representative Samuel B. Pettengill writes on " The Purge Comes to America , " and there is an assortment of similar material by Ray Tucker , James Truslow Adams and Conrad H. Mann . The leading editorial , " America 's Future Is in the Balance " ( in which the phrase " our Constitution " appears eleven times ) , sets the pace for this and , we suppose , the succeeding issues . It says our constitutional form of government is threatened by President Roosevelt 's " titanic effort to obtain a rubber-stamp Congress " and the choice before us is to go ahead under our present form of government or " to be led astray on a road that leads to one-man rule , to serfdom , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
