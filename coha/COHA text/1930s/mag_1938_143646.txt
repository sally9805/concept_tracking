Above other British news last week towered the fact that King George and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had finally done something handsome about " Van . " In the Empire 's tight little ruling caste no great figure is more generally admired and heeded than Sir Robert Gilbert <P> Vansittart . He is the exception to the English rule that no man of brilliance , dash and flair can long hold the respect of the British Cabinet , proverbially composed of steady and stodgy John Bulls who mistrust genius . <P> As Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs since 1930 , Sir Robert is generally conceded to have " made " British foreign policy in its more important aspects , and he more than anyone else has kept the British &; French Governments in a position of ' ' maintaining the balance in Spain " between Rightists and Leftists . It is Sir Robert 's view that nothing would be more dangerous for Europe , nothing more likely to provoke an immediate war , than for Germany to feel there had been a clear-cut " Red " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a clear-cut " Fascist " victory ; that instead compromise-the traditional British virtue-must ultimately triumph in Spain , preferably by setting up a democracy under a constitutional monarch , with due respect for every man 's property and religion . <P> Incidentally Sir Robert has had the British Secret Service under his immediate control , and has disbursed many thousands of pounds of the Foreign Office 's " secret funds " - money for the spending of which the law not only does not require but forbids any detailed accounting to Parliament . Beyond all this , Sir Robert , himself , is recognized as a brilliant , persuasive and what the British call " sound " man , at whose London house the Prime Minister of the day and even the King are glad to lunch or dine . It was no wonder , therefore , that two small news items about Sir Robert last week provided official Britain with its chief topic of holiday conversation . <P> The first item declared that His Majesty had been graciously pleased to elevate Sir Robert to the title of Knight Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second announced that the Prime Minister had caused to be created for Sir Robert the new post of Chief Adviser to the Foreign Office . His duties , according to this unusual official announcement , will be " advising the Secretary of State Anthony Eden upon all major questions of policy concerning foreign affairs . . . and representing the Foreign Office on any occasions , whether at home or abroad . " <P> While Mr. Eden , whose good looks and idealistic pro-League reputation are reputedly worth some 1,500,000 votes to the Government at election time , remains Foreign Secretary , sound Sir Robert was thus given the widest conceivable authority and mobility in conducting British foreign policy . Technically he will still be subordinate to Mr. Eden , advising the Foreign Secretary only on request , but the terms of the new appointment show that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain intends to use Sir Robert much as President Roosevelt uses Ambassador-at-Large Norman Hezekiah Davis , to , handle big diplomatic jobs wherever they crop up .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
