The American chestnut tree used to flourish from the Atlantic to the Mississippi , from the Canadian frontier to North Carolina . It often reached a height of 100 feet , a ripe old age of 600 years . Today , where the once verdant chestnut forests stood , are scattered grey skeletons , a few scrubby little second growth trees . For Endothia parasitica , the chestnut fungus imported from Asia at the end of the last century , has systematically destroyed the American chestnut . Only a few stands are left in the Southern Appalachians and Endothia has started on them too . <P> Last week , John A. Casterline of Dover , N. J. , a modest , patient man who loves trees , eagerly showed reporters four luxuriant chestnut trees on the New Jersey estate of Success Coach Walter Boughton Pitkin . Then he displayed two more in his own backyard . They had been struck with the blight , he said , but he had saved them with his new tannic acid treatment . Method of treatment is simple : on the theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tannic acid of tree-sap is as actively disease-resistant as human blood ; and 2 ) the circulatory system of a tree will by suction pressure carry medicine to diseased organs just as effectively as does the bloodstream , Tree Man John Casterline attached a rubber hose to the taproot ( main root ) of a chestnut tree , planted the other end in a gallon of tannic acid . Within a day , the acid working upward with the sap had begun to check the fungus . Once the parasite was killed , the trees began to flourish again . For protection the acid tanks were allowed to remain connected to the taproots for several months . <P> Experts last week admitted that John Casterline 's idea was scientifically sound , for modern tree healers have been injecting medicines directly into the trunks as well as packing fertilizers into the earth surrounding the roots . However , they withheld judgment pending further investigation . Said John Casterline , who has been doctoring trees for 20 years : " My wife and I decided to devote our lives to the curing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great success . We have cured the chestnut blight . . . and in addition we believe we can cure most of the other tree diseases . "
