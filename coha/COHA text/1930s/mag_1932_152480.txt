To avert an overthrow of the Japanese Constitution , an upset which loomed as a distinct possibility , the aged Prince Saionji came clop-clopping on his wooden sandals back into Japan 's political arena last week . Crisis factors which perplexed this last of the Genro or " Elder Statesmen " and made Prince Saionji delay for three whole days his advice to the Sublime Emperor included : <P> 1 ) Japan 's majority farmer class has been suffering for more than a decade from chronic low agricultural prices , and 75% of the Japanese Army personnel are farmers ' sons . Thus the peasantry and the Army are one in blaming on the politicians and the leisure class Japan 's depression which set in soon after 1921 . <P> 2 ) In no other country is so much ot the national wealth concentrated in so few hands . Japanese know that control of virtually all banking , Japanese foreign trade &; shipping , domestic industry , insurance and even Japanese department stores is closely held by five so-called " Merchant Empires " owned by the Japanese families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These families have continued to wax rich during a decade of deepening Japanese depression . Every Japanese knows that their wealth has fostered corruption of both leading political parties , the Seiyukai and Minseito . <P> 3 ) Control of Japan by men of politics instead of men of the sword is a new-fangled arrangement , dating de jure from the reign of Emperor Meiji who introduced an Occidental ( Prussian ) style of Constitution in 1889 and de facto from the founding of Japan 's oldest political party ( Seiyukai ) in 1900 . Naturally the Army &; Navy with their ancient traditions scorn Japanese Constitutionalism which is only in its swaddling clothes . The lower classes ( both proletarians arid peasants ) tend to approve each fresh assassination of a politician or financier by a civilian or a member of the fighting services . <P> 4 ) In this situation , closely bordering on anarchy by popular and military consent , the Imperial House " unchanged since ages eternal " continued last week to enjoy universal Japanese respect , except from the Communists who since 1928 have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogans have almost dropped from public notice . <P> Cultured , aristocratic , fragile and 83 years old , Prince Saionji conferred last week with half a hundred Japanese notables , his ancient brain cells turning over slowly what they said . He could advise 31-year-old Emperor Hirohito to appoint a political premier , which would further infuriate the fighting services and lower classes . He could advise the appointment of Japan 's outstanding reactionary , Baron Hiranuma , who stood pledged virtually to sweep the Constitution aside and put down the dominance of politicians and the rich . Or was some third course possible ? <P> Day after day the betting odds in Tokyo favored Baron Hiranuma but finally old Prince Saionji took the nation by surprise , bethought himself of a retired admiral who served as Naval Minister in the last Cabinet of which Prince Saionji was Premier ( 1911-12 ) . Quite a youngster is this Admiral , only 74.
