txt Ignoring President Roosevelt 's demand that Farm-Bill costs be held to $500 , - 00 ? , 000 a year unless new'taxes were imposed to cover any additional amount authorized , the Senate to- 1 day rejected by a vote of 49 to 23 an amendment by Senator Vandenberg to limit expenditures under the measure to the half-billion . The test came after Senator Pope , co-author of the bill , indicated that 1 processing taxes might be enacted at the regular session , and Chairman Smith of the Agriculture Committee chided colleagues who would " try to fool the farmers " by prom- ' ising parity prices with one hand and limiting available funds with the other . In letters to Senate and House leaders early in the special session , the President said that , without new taxes , he would not approve 1 Farm-Bill appropriations beyond j . the amount heretofore made available for soil conservation programs . The measure now before the Senate would authorize whatever appropriation was necessary to carry out ! the purposes of the bill . Committee Protests in Vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm-Bill sponsors to assume their " full responsibility " for the measure and write into it some definite limitation on the amount of funds which should be set aside for its operation instead of " passing the buck " to the committee . Those in charge of the bill insisted , however , that no one could say in advance what the cost of the measure would be in any given year . When first brought before the Senate , the bill provided an appropriation of $400,000,000 a year , of which $250,000,000 was to be available for soil-conservation programs and the rest for making so-called parity payments . Another $100,000 , - 000 was to have been authorized for capital stock of the Surplus Reserve Loan Corporation , which , under the present draft , may issue stock up to five times its paid-in capital . As the Farm Bill now stands , all limitations on expenditure have been deleted and " such sums as are necessary " for making parity payments on wheat , cotton and corn are authorized . The only specific ' restriction is that 55 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parity payments and the rest for soil-conservation payments . Veto Threat Is Recalled In vain Senators Adams and iO'Mahoney tried to convince the Senate that the bill called for full parity payments and that it would be unfair to farmers to promise such payments in the measure 's declaration of policy and , in a subsequent section , to provide for the pro rate . disbursement of whatever funds were made available:I When Chairman Smith differed with his committee associates as to the intent of the bill in respect of parity payments , Senator proposed that for the first year of its operation $275,000,000 should be appropriated for parity payments and $225,000,000 for the soil conservation program . As the debate went on over the meaning of the measure , Senator Vandenberg asked for a vote on his $500,000 .. 000 amendment , and SenI ator withdrew his own " perfecting " amendment to permit a test of sentiment . " The sums which are necessary for the bill after it has gone through the process of amendment during the last two weeks are certainly a. total mystery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to a mystery , " said Senator Vandenberg . He recalled President Roosevelt 's implied veto threat , placing himself in the unusual position of supporting the President . Night Session Is Planned Before the vote on the Vandenberg proposal , Senator Barkley , majority leader , again warned the Senate that he would request a night session tomorrow unless the bill was disposed of by that time . He had . threatened to hold the body in session tonight , but relented . Earlier In the day an amendment offered by Senator Bailey intended to aid small tobacco producers was rejected , 43 to 35 . It was his proposal that growers of 5,000 to 10,000 pounds of bright flue-cured tobacco should not be required to curtail their acreage more than 10 per cent , and if they produce less than 5,000 pounds , by not more than 5 per cent . A heated exchange developed between Senators Bailey and Barkley when the former implied that some of those opposed to his amendment knew little about the problems peculiar to flue-cured tobacco production . In reply , Senator Barkley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's tobacco fields in Kentucky . Senator Barkley contended that I1 the Bailey proposal would exempt from the bill 's marketing control provisions a large proportion of to ( bacco produced in North , Carolina , to the detriment of producers in other States . Senator Ellender of Louisiana , also opposing the amendment , said that the Department of Agriculture has expressed the opinion that it would make the tobacco section of the bill unworkable . Thereupon the amendment was lost . By 46 to 30 the Senate rejected an amendment by Senator Copeland to exempt from marketing quota provisions corn and wheat for feeding to dairy cattle .
