Orton raises in a letter to THE TIMES the much-discussed question of the alleged obligation of the several States to enact enforcement legislation within their respective borders under the terms of the Eighteenth Amendment . , , Human nature being what it is , the answer to this will always depend to a great extent ; if not wholly , on the personal attitude of the individual toward prohibition as a whole ? in other words , on the will to believe . Experience will have shown , I think , that there is no language so lucid and free from ambiguity in itself as not to be liable to an interpretation reflecting the wishes of the interpreter , however at variance with its obvious meaning . But assuming the correctness of Mr. Orton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforce their own . prohibition acts , what of the question of double jeopardy , or , if Mr. Orton objects to the expression , of double punishment , under a State law for a single act connoting an offense both against the State and also against the Federal Government ? Facing Two Ways . Mr. Orton defends such double punishment , denying it constitutes double jeopardy , apparently not realizing that , in doing so , he undermines his own position as to the duty Of the States to enferce constitutional prohibition , because , having postulated a situation in which both the States and the ' Federal Governments are engaged in a joint enterprise of enforcing prohibition , the theory and practice of double punishment which is not at the same time double jeopardy are intelligible only on the ground that the States and the nation are engaged in separate and independent prohibition enterprises  --  State and national  --  for on no other supposition can it be logically or constitutionally held that a single act violative of a State prohibition law and punishable thereunder is punishable under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Orton can not have it both ways here . He can not have " concurrent power " implying a concurrent obligation between States and nation to cooperate in a common task of enforcement and at the same time treat the State and national operations as independent and non1 concurrent so as to punish a single act of violation twice  --  once as a national offense and once as a State offense . But even if we were to concede that , under the " concurrent power " clause of the Eighteenth Amendment , neither national nor State law superseded the other , it would not necessarily follow that double punishment for the same act of violation would be morally justifiable , although not , technically , contrary to the Fifth Amendment . The true end of punishment is to furnish an example calculated to deter the offender himself and all others from committing that particular offense , thus reforming the criminal and protecting society . While the punishment of a criminal does satisfy a primitive sense of justice , nevertheless such punishment is not retributive in its nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to afford compensation for criminal wrong , nor can it in fact afford such compensation . No punishment , however great , can undo a committed wrong , however slight , and punishment inflicted on the theory of compensation would be as barbaric as it would be ineffective . For this reason , then , a single act of punishment calculated in the first instance to be an adequate deterrent to a repetition of the act would be sufficient , even though the single act connoted a double offense  --  against two jurisdictions  --  because what would be effective to prevent the one act would be effective to prevent the double consequence . We may condude , therefore , that double prosecution and double punishment in such a case by a State and then by the Federal Government would be not only morally wrong but violative of the Eighth Amendment , prohibiting " cruel and unusual punishments , " as being unhecessary and therefore cruel . It was to put an end to this wrong that New York repealed its enforcement act . A Non-Existent Analogy . Though at first sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that no proper analogy can be drawn between multiple punishment for the same criminal act and multiple damages to compensate for its multiple consequences . Self-evident as the difference might seem , it has sometimes been too much for the prohibition mind to perceive , as the following from an ardent clerical prohibitionist 's letter on the subject under discussion will show : " If a man should deliberately aim his gun so that with one bullet , at one shot , he should shoot off the nose of each of two men , he could not plead that he had been placed in double jeopardy if each man claimed civil damages or brought a criminal charge . Because the criminal had paid damages to one man for the loss of his nose would be no reason in justice why he should not pay the other man for the loss of his nose . He has injured two persons by one act . " If an educated man , one whqse profession inculcates mercy and ' loving kindness , can be the victim of such mental confusion , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose inclinations are toward strict enforcement to the end that prohibition shall become an accomplished fact in this country ? F. J. DUNDON , New York , Dec. 4 , 1930 . SELF-CONTAINED WITHIN LIMITS Raymond B. Fosdick , in his " Diagnosis of Our Ailing World " published in THs Times , questions the accuracy of President Hoover 's statement in his recent address before the American Bankers Association when he said : " We are able in considerable degree to free ourselves of world influences and make a large measure of independent recovery because we are so remarkably self-contained . " Mr. Fosdick then claims that we are not self-contained and independent of other nations , because in order to manufacture steel necessary for our automobiles and locomotives we must import " nickel from Canada , vanadium from the Andes of Peru , manganese from the Caucasus , chrome from the Southern Pacific , " &c.; I think it can be shown that the President and Mr. Fosdick are both correct in their statements and that there is really no conflict . That no nation is entirely self-contained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted . President Hoover 's statement is qualified in two important particulars  --  first , when he said " In considerable degree , " and , second , by his saying " a large measure of independent recovery . " The President 's address was confined largely to a discussion of the present business depression and a way out . He rightly , it seems to me , Insisted that , even if all nations were affected by present economic conditions , the United States was not obliged to wait upon other nations , but could itself " make a large meas- ure of Independent recovery because we are so remarkably self-contained . " And in saying this the President was simply repeating what he said , as Secretary of Commerce , in his opening address to the President 's conference on unemployment in September , 1921 : " What our people wish is the op- , portunity to earn their daily bread , and surely in a country with its warehouses bursting with a surplus of food and clothing , with its mines capable of indefinite production of fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess the intelligence to find solution . " What the President said in 1921 was implied a few weeks ago in his message to the bankers , viz : we are a self-contained , self-sufficient country ; we have practically inexhaustible natural resources , ample capital and unimpaired labor power . To sustain Mr. Fosdick 's contention of dependence upon other nations we must presuppose a world condition in which we could not purchase and transport to our shores the materials needed in certain manufacturing processes . Such a condition ? if ever conceivable  --  could only arise when the combined military and economic forces of the world were at war with us , our seaports effectively blockaded and other world ports closed to our shipping . Even then we would , by working together in the war spirit of necessity , have plenty to eat , ample clothing and adequate housing for all , DARWIN J. MESEROLE . Na.v York , Dec. 1 , 1930 .

The record of babies who survive during the first year of life is so remarkable in Norway , compared to the rest of the world , as ' almost to indicate a different race .

Norwegians produce the largest families of any nation in Europe , the number of children averaging 4.7 : per family . The average length of life has been greatest in Norway for generations , although this is largely due to the extremely low child mortality rate . They are born strong . Educational ' standards are among the highest in Europe . The Norse folk read more books per capita than any people in the world .

Richmond , Va. , Dec. 2 , 1930 . TAX ON CAPITAL PROFITS JUST Present Impost Is Held to Overcome Objections To the Former Rate To the Editor of The New York Times : I disagree with some of the statements and conclusions reached by Percy W. Crane in his letter to THE Mass . Mr. Crane states that the revenue act which taxes capital gains realized on the sale of property , particularly securities , was a material factor in the disastrous decline , in the Autumn of 1929 and he adds the statement that . " In an advancing market , security holders often refrain from realizing profits in order to avoid the tax . " If the present rate of 121/2 per cent maximum tax on capital gains , which has been in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the tax should have any effect on security sales . Taxpayers , knowing that a maximum tax of 121,4 per cent on all profits realized must be paid , attempt to sell their securities at the highest prices obtainable . As a matter of fact , this was the reason for the insertion of the provision , for the first time in the 1921 act , for taxing capital gains at a maximum rate of 121/2 per cent . Prior to 1921 , when capital gains were taxed at the maximum normal and surtaa : rate of 73 per cent and there was a prevalent feeling that the tax would be materially reduced In the future , security holders delayed the realization of profits . But this is not the present case . Investors know that a maximum tax of 121/2 per cent must be paid on capital gains , and that it ai/ ? therefore to their advantage to jell at the highest prices . This method of taxing capital gajas can in no way interfere with a normal trade in securities . Mr. Crane also objects to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are repurchased within thirty days from the date of sale because this creates a sellers ' market and drives down the prices of securities . The purpose of this restriction is to prevent the deduction of paper or unrealized losses from other income in determining the taxable net income . For , if a holder sells securities at a loss and then repurchases them immediately at the sme price , he is in effect in the same position that he was in before the sale , and he has not sustained a loss . This is only fair since the government does not tax unrealized gains . This restriction does 1not affect security markets adversely ; investors who feel that their investments are sound will not sell to establish a tax loss if a possibility exists that the market value of these investments may increase during the thirty-day period . Mr. Crane advocates the " repeal of the tax on such ( capital ) profits and the deduction of such ( capital ) losses as arise from the sale of securities or other property not used in the regular trade or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventory " so that the income tax would be more nearly on a true income basis . It seems to me that one who has sold securities for a price higher than that which he paid therefore has realized income and should pay a tax thereon . This is in keeping with the principle that income tax is based on the ability to pay the tax . I also disagree with Mr. Crane 's alternate remedies . The first is that the " tax on capital profits and the tax saving from losses be at the normal rates only . " The revenue acts since 1921 have always specifically given the taxpayer the option of being taxed on regular rates or on the capital gain rate . A taxpayer can treat these capital gains and losses as ordinary items of gain and loss , when it is to his advantage to do so . His second proposal to " limit the tax on profits and the deductions for losses on sales to securities acquired within two years prior to the date of sale " would allow some investors to realize tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations in this country have never paid a cent in cash dividends , but have reinvested their earnings in additional plant which is represented by additional stock Issued as dividends . These stock dividends are not taxable . If an investor purchased one share of stock in 1910 for $100 and by the end of 1930 has , let us say , fifty shares which he sells for $5,000 , he surely has realized a gain that should be taxed , when it is considered that he was not taxed on all the stock - dividends which he received . EMANUEL TODER . Brooklyn , Dec . I , 1930 . ITALY WAS ROUGE ON RACKETS To the Editor of The New York Times : The racketeers here are doing just what the Mafia did in Italy . In fact we have the Mafia here . It is therefore of interest to know how the Italian Government stamped out the Mafia in Sicily . Up to 1926 for many generations the people of Sicily were under a tyranny of the worst and most powerful criminal oligarchy that ever existed . The situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Sicily . Murder , robbery , blackmail , kidnapping and every form of violence prevailed . In a. single year the Province of Palermo with about 900,000 inhabitants had 1,750 murders . The Chicago region , which now has ten to thirty times the murder rate of Northern European countries , would have to have 7,000 murders a year to equal the rate of the Province of Palernao under Mafia rule , in place of 300 , or more than twenty times as many murders as the number today . All Sicily was enslaved , all businesses were levied on , especially farming . And it was always assumed that nothing could be done . When Garibaldi finished his work and , so to speak , handed Italy over to the King , he said the one unsolvable problem was Southern Italy with the Camorra , Black Hand and Mafia . Mussolini determined to extirpate thesegreat handicaps . He sent one man to Palermo , Prefect Mori , whose work was to destroy Mafiaism . Mori had been Prefect of Bologna and Rome , but when a younger man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written a pamphlet on the Mafia twenty-five years before . He combined special knowledge and great courage , as is evidenced by the fact that he has been awarded four gold medals for valor . He selected additional police . A court was established in a little town near Palermo . During the preliminary operations several of the police were killed but M due course 3everal hundred of the Mafiosi were arrested . I was present at the very beginning of the trial and heard the opening address of the prosecuting attorney . He was a young man of fair ability . The judge and the jurors could be duplicated in ability , courage and learning in any city of the United States . But behind the law officers was all Italy organized so as to protect the witnesses , and witnesses testi fled freely for the first time in history . - Probably leas than two thousand charged with crime were arrested and about half of them were convicted and sent to prison .

RICKSHAS STILL IN SERVICE To the Editor of The New York Times : While traveling through the Orient It has been my good fortune to be able to purchase copies of THE NEW Yortic TIMES , which is not merely a New York newspaper but rather an institution of the English-speaking world  --  a world nedtspaper , if you please . A correspondent , Ernest W. Clement laments the doom of the jinrikisha , which he believes is imminent . Mr. Clement need not mourn the passing of the rickshas . The vehicle still rolls quietly through the streets of Japan and China and the rhythmic pat-pat-pat of the ricksha puller &; feet will continue to be heard for many years to come . In America the mass-made flivver has relegated the sun-down buggy and faithful old Dobbin to songs of driving to Dover through fields of clover as grandfather did on his wedding day ; but flivvers can not banish the ricksha to the museum of antiquities .

OTHER PARTS OF CONSTITUTION ALSO HONORED IN THE BREACH Extradition of Criminals , for Instance , Has Come to Be Regarded as a Favor To the Editor of The New York Times : The drys among us reproach the wets with violation of the Constitution of the United States , while the wets retaliate by upbraiding the Southern drys with disregard of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments . There is another provision of the Constitution , or rather two provisions of it , which , if interpreted literally  --  and there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to fare no better by those on whom the obligation to respect them rests . They are contained in Article IV , sections 1 and 2 . The first is : " Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts , records and judicial proceedings of every other State . " The second is : " A person charged in any State with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another State , shall , on demand of the executive authority of the State from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime . " It will be noted that the language of the second provision , considered in itself , is inconsistent ? with the supposition that the executive authority in the State in which . a fugitive from justice from another State has taken refuge may exercise his discretion as to whether he will , in such a case , deliver up the fugitive on the " demand " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand " and " shall " * * * be delivered up " preclude such a supposition . The whole passage seems to create a right on the part of the requisitioning State which the executive of the asylum State is constitutionally bound to respect . Requests and Privilegas . In practice , however , it has been otherwise . The " demand " has often , If not always , been considered as a request and the granting of the request the concession of a privilege . If the executive of the asylum State does not inquire into the sufficiency of the original charge , he will set his own opinion as to the identity of the accused against that of the " demanding " State , and , as has frequently happened , will refuse extradition on the ground that he is convinced that the alleged fugitive could not be guilty of the crime charged , because he could not have been in the place where it was committed at the time of its commission , although the alibi thus successfully pleaded ? I use the word " alibi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere " at the time  --  might be a clever concoction , which , while it could not be upset at the requisition hearing , might be refuted at a regular trial , where the prosecution would be in a position to produce all the evidence and an its witnesses , an obvious impossibility at a requisition hearing , as Governor Fuller of Massachusetts once declared when extradition was denied him . Apart from the legal obligation to comply unconditionally with the " demand " for the giving up of one charged with being a fugitive from justice in a sister State , which the unequivocal language of the Constitution seems to create , there is a moral obligation in the situation . When an executive refuses to give up such a person , it is clear that , instead of giving full faith and credit to the findings of a grand jury in another of our States , he substitutes his own judgment for the verdict of that body , and gives it no faith or credit at all . Such an ' act implies distrust of the legal processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own in everything but political and geographical area . Why ? Even if the matter were *holly discretionary with them , one ? might think that executives- would consider it for the best interests of law and order to trust the accused to the orderly legal processes of a sister State , even if he were innocent , than to protect a possible erim4 inal from the consequences of his crime by shielding him against his accusers there . Law of Averages Should Count . Rules should be based an what may be termed the general run of things , or the law of averages , not on exceptional cases . The unques. tioned , unconditional granting of requisition might occasionally result in delivering up an innocent man for trial ; but in the great majority of cases those sought in requisition proceedings will be sufficiently implicated in the offense charged against them to warrant their being delivered up for trial , which , of course , does not of itself mean ultimate condemnation . It is certain that the exercise of discretion hero must frequently result in the triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a legal proviskin is neither inherently Impossible ( nor manifestly unreasonable there can be no warrant for not interpreting it literally . Unless we are to assume that the word " de . mand " is synonymous with " request , " and , that " shall " means " may " and " may , " " shall , " the Constitution lays a mandatory , not a , discretionary , duty on State execu ? fives to honor a demand for the gm ? render of an alleged fugitive from justice from a sister State . An appeal to precedent has no bearing on the case , for precedent can not alter the meaning of words in themselves devoid of ambiguity . To decide that the provision in question IS perm's-. sive because it has hitherto been generally considered so would be , in the language of Calhoun , quoted by Lin . coin , to make the error of yesterday the law of today .

And what of " Roderick , ( O'Connor ) last of Irish kings , " who " in dull oblivion sleeps " ? He did not sink to rest until more than a century and a half after the death of Brian the Martyr , in 1014 . And Roderick was not even the last High King of the Race of Heremon , though born long after Brian 's time . Hugh Roe O'Neill was the last Ard Righ of Erin . He exercised all the I rights and prerogatives of that ex alted office  --  was even crowned ? in the time of Elizabeth . His authority was recognized by all the native clans , and by the Normans of the Pale  --  then " more Irish than the Irish themselves . " He was styled " The Hannibal of Erin , " for his military feats . As for X. N. J.
