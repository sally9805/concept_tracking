Into a German munitions factory last week walked Field Marshal Hermann Wilhelm Goring , most popular ( after Hitler ) and most portly of Nazis . On the eighth day of Germany 's advance into Poland , he had a great job to do . To munitions workers standing with outstretched arms in the shadow of long-barreled artillery , to Germans waiting at the radio all over the Reich , to listeners in countries at war with Germany or neutral , Adolf Hitler 's second in command came bearing tidings of victory , offers of peace , warnings of struggle , and bad news . <P> The Marshal did not speak softly . He knew his audience . Cheering workmen wanted to hear of the victory . He told them : " German arms on land and in the air have achieved what has been considered unbelievable . " They wanted to hear that the Westwall was safe . He said so : " If they should be mad enough to attack our western line , streams of blood will flow . " They wanted something to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live to see the day when Hitler would be removed . Well , he has reached Methuselah 's age , and I 'm not sure he 'll attain his goal . " They wanted praise : " No power on earth has such a munitions industry . None has as good skilled workers . None has such intelligent workers . " <P> But along with all this there was : " You must believe me if I tell you that the thesis of a long war weakening a nation is not true . With every year we will grow stronger . " <P> There went the dream of the Blitzkrieg , the lightning war , over in no time . <P> Where was Italy ? For two hours the Field Marshal talked , joked , praised the Fhrer , talked of Russia 's raw materials , did not once mention Mussolini or the Axis . <P> What about the blockade ? " In the World War the blockade was complete . That was uncomfortable . Then we were not prepared for that . Now we are . But how does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Hardheaded , commonsensical , down-to-earth , tough guy-to-tough guys as the Fhrer is mystical , Field Marshal Goring made a good job of it . For home consumption he piled up the cheering news : Victory in Poland within two weeks ( " our divisions marched as humans never marched before " ) would release 70 divisions for the Western Front . At the moment Germany 's coal ran short- " and I might say at that very exact moment " - the seizure of Polish mines* relieved the strain . The failure of Britain to attack meant " their desire to fight does not seem too great . " Reassuring was the failure of Britain to bomb Berlin . Then there was the hope that Britain and France could be divided- " England will fight to the last Frenchmen-remember that , you Frenchmen . " <P> For foreign consumption Field Marshal Goring adroitly suggested that Germany would consider peace negotiations . But " you will not dictate another Versailles to us , my dear Britons . . . . Do not mistake our offer of peace for weakness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater and deeper in the spirit of the Fhrer. "
