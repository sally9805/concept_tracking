txt From an almost casual phrase in a speech by Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer , at the end of the Conservative party conference tonight , it is reasonable to conclude that the British Government is not planning to play any major part in land fighting in any European war in which this country may participate . That it does not contemplate conscription may be part of the same inference from that speech . Referring to the present rearmament program , the Chancellor of the Exchequer said : " Wheirthat program is completed we shall have a navy adequate to protect our vital lines of communication . We shall have an army trifling in numbers beside the vast conscript armies of the Continent , but equipped with the most modern weapons that science can give us , and we shall have an air force which , in speed , range and power of the machines and quality of the personnel , will be second to none . " Warning to Germany Mr. Chamberlain then added another remark concerning the air force that certainly was intended as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation , " he said , " has to some extent deprived us of our insular position , and the possibilities of what war might mean to our civilian population are present In our minds . But 1 let us not forget that those possibilities are even more present in the minds of other nations , and I can imagine no more sobering thought to any ruler who might be contein ' plating aggression against his neighbor than the knowledge that within a few hours his action might be followed by the retaliation of a force of such terrific striking power as our new air force will possess . " Except for theac remarks , which made a deep impression on the delegates , Mr. Chamberlain said nothing concerning defense that had not been covered yesterday by Sir Samuel Hoare , First Lord of the Admiralty . Mr. Chamberlain was speaking as a substitute for the absent Prime Minister , whom he is expected to succeed as head of the government soon after the coronation next May . But , naturally , there was not the slightest indication of that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exchequer paid a great tribute to his chief and said : " The time has happily not yet arrived to make a final appraisement of Mr. Baldwin 's long and eminent services to his party and country . " The conference , which yesterday adopted three resolutions adverse to Mr. Baldwin 's personal wishes , today gave him a resolution of " warm appreciation of his leadership . " As the chief finance minister of the Cabinet Mr. Chamberlain devoted the bulk of his speech to domestic and international phases of economic questions . He hailed the cooperation of the United States and Britain in helping to safeguard the French devaluation move as a step toward sounder world finance . He praised the Ottawa agreements as providing a great bond for the empire but said their operation had caused some difficulties and intimated they might have to be revised next year . Sees More Stable Conditions " Only last week , " he said on the subject of the franc , " when the French Government decided to propose to its parliament readjustment of the exchange value of the franc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them and with the government of the United States in minimizing the disturbing effects of that operation . I am hopeful that the declarations issued by the three governments will prove a step toward restoration of more stable conditions in international monetary systems . " We must remember that the causes of the present uneasiness of the world in general and Europe in particular are not simple but complicated . Partly they are political ; partly they arise from financial stress or unremunerative prices of commodities ; partly they come from want of balance between the value of certain currencies and the level of world prices . " But if we are ever to get back to settled conditions and normal relations between nations we shall have to deal with every one of the difficulties I have mentioned , and the British Government will at all times be ready to take part in any steps to help restore confidence and remove or at least reduce the more excessive forms of restriction whereby the flow of international trade is hampered. -t . " All indications are that we have left free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abolish tariffs on imports , which comes to pretty much the same thing . No doubt it is possible to carry the idea of protection to excessive lengths , and one of the great benefits derived from tariffs introduced by the National Government is that they enable us to obtain remission of excessive duties against our goods by other countries in return for concessions in our tariffs on goods they wish to sell us . Considers Criticism of Pacts " It is suggested that at the earliest moment we should free ourselves from the Ottawa agreements in order that we might give foreigners treatment more generous than we can afford to our own kinsmen in the dominions . Now I can understand objections to the Ottawa agreements on the ground that they gave too much to the dominions and not enough to Britain . " I have , in fact , heard objections of that kind , and I am free to admit everything has not worked out in practice quite as we expected and that when the time comes for renewal we may have to ask a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not represent that the Ottawa agreements were a bad bargain for us but that to make any distinction between members of the empire and other countries is wrong in principle and ought to be abandoned . In my opinion if that view were . adopted we should presently see the end of the British Empire . " Whatever difficulties have arisen over interpretation of the Ottawa agreements , they did provide a new starting point for an exchange between members of their respective viewpoints and they began a new consciousness of the mutual sympathy which has shown itself since over and over again in conversations and conferences with Dominion Ministers . " I can truly say I can not remember any period when the harmony between the governments of the dominions and ourselves in all matters of common interest  --  foreign policy , defense or trade  --  has been so complete as in the four years elapsed since Ottawa . " We are accustomed to hear of the dangers of fascism and communism and to speak of the three great countries , the United States , France and ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But are not Canada , Australia , South Africa and New Zealand democracies also ? " If their population is small today , will they not have a vast increase as soon as economic conditions justify it ? Who can venture to say how far they will have advanced in numbers , resources and powers fifty years from now ? " And who can doubt that , if in the fifty years ' time they and we have continued to work together in pursuit of the aims and ideals which unite us today , we shall together form a fortress of democracy that need fear no onslaught from without . " The national executive committee of the Labor party tonight framed a resolution on armament policy for submission to the party conference at Edinburgh next week . It will undoubtedly be adopted by the party as a whole , and for all practical purposes it supports the rearmament policy of the Baldwin government . Although there are various clauses in the resolution condemning the government for its foreign policy , the gist of the document is the first paragraph , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorships which are increasing their armaments at unprecedented rates , flouting international law and refusing to cooperate in the work of organizing peace , this conference declares the armed strength of countries loyal to the League of Nations must be conditioned by the armed strength of a potential aggressor . " The resolution was agreed upon in the committee only after a long and serious dispute . There will be a similar controversy on the floor of the conference , but the advocates of arming have a large majority of the delegates . The central committee of the British Communist party , which has about 3,000 members and one Member of Parliament has asked for admission to the Labor party . The Communists pledge themselves to accept the constitution of the Labor party and carry out all decisions democratically arrived at in the interests of the working class . This plea for admission on the ' basis of a " united front " will be considered by the Laborites at Edinburgh and rejected .                  @ @ @
