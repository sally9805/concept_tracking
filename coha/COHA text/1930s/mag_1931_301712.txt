From the Hugoton gasfield of Kansas and from the neighboring Amarillo field of the Texas Panhandle to Rockville , Ind . is about 805 miles as the plane flies . In 1928 a young promoter by the name of Frank Preston Parish formed Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co. to run a natural gas line over this distance . In June 1930 , it became apparent that Mr. Parish needed more funds . Three months later potent Morgan-affiliated Columbia Gas &; Electric Corp. , in order to avert a rapid descent of the entire gas balloon , and to avert what might have turned out to be unwelcome competition , bought a half interest in Mr. Parish 's company ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) . Work went ahead ; last week the final sections of pipe were joined , tests begun . Within the fortnight the line is expected to be in actual operation and within three months the link to Columbia Gas 's big eastern network will be completed . This will mark the completion of the longest natural gas " super-system , " furnishing fuel from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored by many natural gas men who devoutly wish Mr. Parish had never started his line . <P> Last week tests were still being made on the 24-inch pipe running from the Texas Panhandle field to Chicago , covering 950 miles , expected to be in operation by the end of the year . Backed by the strong Insull interests together with Texas Corp. , Cities Service Co. , Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey and other big companies , this line is thought to have an auspicious future , especially since the gas will be sold on heat units instead of cubic feet ( natural gas has nearly twice as many B. T.U. as manufactured gas ) . Apparently most sure of its success is Continental Construction Corp. , the builder , for last week this concern announced that by the end of 1932 it will build a parallel line with 30-inch pipe , shoot natural gas from the South past Chicago , into New England . <P> Last fortnight the first gasoline flowed from several big Oklahoma refineries directly into St. Paul-Minneapolis . This line is backed by Barnsdall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skelly Oil Co. , Pure Oil Co .. and Phillips Petroleum Co. , is the longest gasoline pipeline ( 1,500 mi . ) . <P> Despite these culminations of the great pipe dreams of 1929 and early 1930 , last week there was by no means the same interest in pipelines . The public seemed inclined to await results before it increases its stakes in the industry . And no more was heard about such wondrous projects as a pipeline to carry grain , another to transport pulverized coal , a third to gush milk into big cities .
