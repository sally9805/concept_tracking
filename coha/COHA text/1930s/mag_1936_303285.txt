Each major U.S. airline has some exclusive quality to boast about . TWA calls itself the " Lindbergh Line . " American brags it is " the largest airline in the U.S. " United is proud of carrying more passengers , mail and express than any other airline in the world . Last week United had something else to be proud of : Its statement for 1935 showed that it almost made some money . <P> In 1934 United lost $2,283,525.31 . In 1935 it lost only $1,392.81 . This encouraging report was due in part to a 22% rise in passenger and cargo revenue , in part to a new depreciation policy changing all planes from a three-year to a four-year life basis . The fact that United still shows a loss is due , according to President William A. Patterson , to the inadequacy of its airmail subsidy rate , which was 12% less per pound-mile in 1935 than in 1934 and only about half what other domestic airlines received .                @ @ @ @ @
