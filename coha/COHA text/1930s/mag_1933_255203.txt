ANTHONY ADVERSE - Hervey Allen - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3 ) . <P> Shouldering its way through the froth of summer fiction comes this leviathan of U. S. novels . Pre-eminent in size ( 1,224 pp. ; 2 Ib. ) but not in size alone , this big-boned romance may well strike terror into readers effetely accustomed to smaller , more playable fish , or to the monotonous diversity of a blank waste of waters . But those readers who allow themselves to be swallowed whole will emerge , some time later , grateful for the experience . <P> Anthony Adverse is a three-decker , picaresque-historical novel , crammed with enough people , action , scenery , philosophy , comedy , bloodshed , love and death to furnish a dozen books . Built to an old-fashioned design but modern specifications , it starts off like a Waverley Novel , soon gets beyond the purport of its traditional beginning . Like Tristram Shandy 's , its hero makes a belated appearance , but when he does his fortunes hold the unwieldy tale together . In following him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters whose disappearance is disappointing , whose reappearance is sometimes anticlimactic . From France to Italy to Cuba to Africa to Europe again the story goes , then heads west to Louisiana and loses itself among the deserts and mountains of Mexico . Spanning the Napoleonic period , it introduces many a historical personage in human guise : Napoleon himself , Talleyrand , Slaver Mongo Tom , the Rothschilds ( n Meyer ) . Though this lavish scene forms only the background for the hero , he is the least " real " ( i. e. , objectified ) person in the book . A picaresque Everyman , he wanders the world searching for his soul , finally finds it ; but most readers will be less interested in his quest than in his adventures by the way . Not a great book , except in size , Anthony Adverse is a solid , worthy addition to U. S. Letters . Postponed from month to month , it finally appears as July choice of the Book-of-the-Month Club . <P> Anthony 's mother was the wife of Machiavellian Don Luis da Vincitata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother died in the wintry Alpine inn where she bore him ; his reckless young father saw the point of Don Luis ' swordsmanship too late . The nameless orphan was deposited anonymously by Don Luis at a Livorno convent . After a peaceful childhood there he was adopted by old John Bonnyfeather . Scottish merchant in Livorno and actually his grandfather . Both suspected their relationship but neither , out of respect for his mother 's memory , ever openly acknowledged it . Anthony was given a solid education and brought up as a gentleman-heir in his grandfather 's establishment . Arrived at years of discretion and having survived his first passionate love-affair . Anthony went to Cuba to collect a long-standing debt to the firm . Havana suited him . and he fell in love again , but business once more tore him away , this time to Africa , where he spent long years as master of the slave-trading station of Gallegos . When he had amassed a tidy sum he sold out , went back to Europe to enjoy his wealth .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
