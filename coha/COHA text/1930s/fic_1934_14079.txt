IT is a sultry Saturday afternoon in early summer , and a group of Negroes are sprawling around OLD QUIVIENE 'S front porch , dozing , laughing , singing in relaxation and stringing one another with catches and drolleries after their week 's work is done . The shack of a house , with a drunken chimney at the right , is set diagonally across a little yard ; and beyond , a narrow alley runs at right angles to it . Tacked on a post near the steps at the center is a plank sign  --  " Lockley 's Bording Hous . " A thick cypress vine , lacy-leaved and with scarlet tubular flowers , overruns the left end of the porch and house and hangs down along a windowed shed room built in the side somewhat farther back . A smaller shack is a step away at the left  --  not much larger than a good-sized dog kennel but proclaiming in crooked letters on its front that it is " Parr 's Shavin Parler . " At the right a path leads in from the alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front is a small thick china tree . Along the path and here and there in the yard are borders and beds of purplish red petunias with zinnias and marigolds planted among them . The whole scene is florid with the mixture of colors from the flowers and cypress vine  --  yellow , orange , purple , and scarlet  --  which seems to increase the already intense heat of the summer day . Somewhere far off at the right an intermittent blasting in the earth goes on . Nearer , children are heard screaming at play , and now and then a sleepy inhabitant of the valley wanders aimlessly by in the alley at the right . LEVIN FARROW , a restless alert young fellow , and quick on the call , is standing by a low stake near the china tree with two horseshoes in his hand . He has been addressing one of his vulgar stories to the boarders on the porch who for the moment are interrupting him with their laughter . QUIVIENE A slatternly gray-haired woman about sixty years old sitting in a chair near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitten for women-folks to hear , Levin . But still she looks interested and takes a large dip of snuff with her brush in anticipation. p. 3 GRAY A bold-eyed girl of twenty who is sitting on the edge of the porch at the right dangling her feet down . Pshaw , women-folks know more'n men , Aunt Quivie . She smiles broadly at FARROW , revealing a row of pearly teeth set off by a gleaming gold one in the corner of her dimpled mouth . FARROW Then uh  --  uh , one night when they were feeling for Jesus with the lights blowed out , them two preachers got to working on her tin britches with can openers . Hah-hah-hah . The boarders on the porch laugh and slap each other , and even UZZELL who is sitting at the right bent over in his chair lets out a twisting smile . The fun suddenly dies out of FARROW 'S countenance and for an instant he raises his face to the sky and gives a high-calling Negro " holler "  --  oodle  --  oodle  --  oo ! He listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the deep above , and then from the deep bowels of the earth far away the blasting does seem to reply to him . UZZELL Cryptically . And he puts a question up to heaven ! Wherefore ? But the earth do answer him . FARROW and all the others listen intently a moment . FARROW With a touch of uncertainty in his voice . Dynamite on the big road , chillun , having a word with man . p. 4 UZZELL As if warning them all . That blasting coming nearer every day . Gazing morosely around him . The road , I said  --  coming nearer every day . FARROW Yah , yah , old sour face . Letting fly his horseshoe , he slaps himself in triumph at the result . Hot damn , a ringer ! BAD-EYE SMITH , who is sitting on a blacksmith 's anvil near the china tree , bent under an old felt hat , shifts himself around and stares quietly at the stake . FARROW sets himself and throws the second shoe which knocks down the first . PARR Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sandwiches from a greasy paper bag . Yeh , you knocked it down . Choking with a piece of biscuit . Harr  --  p ! PARR is a squatty black fellow of middle age , dressed in a dirty barber 's coat . The stems of his waxed and rolled mustache protrude on either side of his nose like a pair of steer horns , and he is ever petting and fingering them . FARROW moves over , gets the shoes and begins throwing them back to the first stake . STERLING A strong , handsome young mulatto of twenty-eight , sleepily and reminiscent as he lies on the porch at the right by MILLY WILSON 'S side . Knowed of a man in Mobile could ring ' em forty times in a row . p. 5 FARROW Yeh , knowed of a man  --  Turning and pushing BAD-EYE off his seat . Wake up , gim me room , son o ' man . SMITH Turning up a gnarled face set with two crossed and blood-shot eyes . ' Scuse me . Thinking . Son ? Defensively .

GRAY To UZZELL , looking back over her shoulder with wide luminous eyes . You know heaps the ladies told you . Wise , wise man . She touches him gently on the knee , pulling her hand quickly and coquettishly away. p. 6 UZZELL Giving her a sharp and penetrating look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat .

" For they got another daddy on the Salt Lake Line . " UZZELL No . Sharply to FARROW . That 's right , you ai n't singing to me . He pulls a newspaper from his pocket and begins reading it . PARR With an exclamation . Push my face ! Looking up from an old magazine he is reading . Says here Charlie Chaplin done spent a million dollars on his divorce . And ai n't free yet . Listening to the roll of blasting now a bit louder . Ah , that old road coming on down to our door  --  every day he slides a little bit nearer . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blasting .

" I axed her do she love-a meAnd she say she do . " He flaps his arms like a chicken . UZZELL makes a restless movement in his chair , settles himself and goes on reading . STERLING When that judge writes a little word on a piece of paper , you gon na see the procession . FARROW Stingingly .

GRAY Come here and fan me , Levin honey boy . FARROW I do n't wear no dress . GRAY Po ' Ed needs a little fanning . She climbs up on the porch , takes UZZELL 'S hat and begins to fan him and smooth his head. p. 9 FARROW Heah now ! PARR Oh-ho .

Papa 's silent partner , gland-glad extract , one dollar , sent postpaid . FARROW Hah-hah-hah . Gland-glad extract ! Niggers in Potter 's Field do n't need that .

STERLING Looks like a week 's work 'd be enough for Levin and he 'd rest on Saturday evening . LEVIN sits down on the anvil , fanning himself with his cap and staring fixedly at the ground .

QUIVIENE Hush now , and go build me up a fiah in the stove . Getting supper time . WILLIE gets up and goes in . A guitar begins playing in a shack across the alley at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the whistle and roar of the Florida Limited are heard across the valley . Some of them move from their places and stand in the yard looking off up the alley like eager expectant children . The train comes on like a rising storm , its melodious whistle splitting the sky .

Oh , honey , if we could just get on that train and ride  --  ride forever and never think of trouble . p. 25 STERLING Laughing softly and happily MILLY Searching his face and then smiling . Yeh  --  oh yeh . ZEB VANCE Dere she come ! Along the side of the bluff that shows above the shacks in the distance a train dashes with a shower of sparks and smoke , the low running locomotive seeming to stretch its neck forward like a racing black stallion , and the lighted windows of the coaches flying behind with a tail of flame in the dusk . The Negroes stand gazing off , lost in a deep wonder and delight . FARROW With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawg ! The others nod jubilantly at him and to themselves and gradually return to their places without a word , a few of them cutting steps , or gesturing with their hands , expressive of the longing each one feels . The blasting sounds again , and the romance and wonder die from their faces . ZEB VANCE Feel de ground shake . A moment passes and then across the alley at the right a hullabaloo sets up , and a woman flies out of a shack . She stops in the alley , looking back , waving her hands about and crying to the silent houses . FARROW and ZEB VANCE go lazily over to the edge of the yard and look out. p. 26 QUIVIENE Quit that fussing over there ! FARROW The law ! the law ! To PARR .

He stumbles across the yard toward the alley . FARROW signals to SUDIE , and she runs weeping into old QUIVIENE 'S yard . She is a little pasty-faced woman of forty , snaggle-toothed and thin . Her hard rounded breast-bone shows above her torn dress like a piece of wood . MILLY Waking up . What 's the matter , Sude ? p. 27 DODE Now in the alley . Is she over dere , Quivie ?

" I heah 'd God say he 's bigger'n me , Made de high mountains , dug de deep sea , And all my strength been taken away , Taken away . " DOODLE has motioned to WILLIE who comes out into the yard .

PARR twists his mustache most mannishly and settles himself in his chair . FARROW Do n't mind Sport 'll bite it off for him . He scampers around the yard , then falls down on his knees watching DOODLE and WILLIE at their marbles . PARR continues to twist his mustache like a cocky vaudeville villain and smile knowingly to himself . DOODLE Angrily . Venture dubbs . WILLIE Piteously . I knocked two out . FARROW To DOODLE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and slips away home at the left , and MILLY goes back and sits with STERLING , lost instantly in her love . QUIVIENE rises and goes into the house. p. 31 DODE Tell ' em ' bout de po ' man you read me last night , Doodle . He sits with his head bowed over , his own misery filling the world for him . UZZELL Rest , Dode . DODE Dat you , Ed ? Tell'em , Doodle . DOODLE reluctantly leaves his marbles and stands before them twisting his cap about . DOODLE Will speak you a little bit ' bout de man God treated wrong . Reciting . Dere was a man in de land of Ooz , a righteous and a upright man . And he was afraid of God and done good .

HENRY , a stranger , comes into the yard from the right and stands near DOODLE . He is a well-dressed heavy man with a bluish sooty black face  --  wearing a derby hat , yellow gloves , a silk handkerchief protruding from his outer breast pocket , and a large rose in his lapel . He carries a small satchel in his hand . The boarders look at him in astonishment. p. 32 DOODLE And de devil kicked up sand coming to Job 's house  --  and so fast he come sparks flewed out'n his heels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and  --  He stops as he sees HENRY . Dat 's all I 'll preach you dis time . HENRY Smiling and showing a set of stout gold teeth .

FARROW As they all watch the newcomer . Good evening , suh . STERLING raises himself up , looks out , and then lies suddenly back on the floor by MILLY . HENRY Winking at them all and singing in a low bass voice . " A black evil spirit , hanh ? One hundred years he slept in the hill , Could n't turn over , Could n't lie still.They thought he was a rock deep underground , And they blasted him out with the earthquake sound .

" Heard mighty rumbling , heard mighty rumbling , Heard mighty rumbling under the ground.Must be John Henry turning round.Nine pound hammer , nine pound hammer , Ca n't kill me , well , it ca n't kill me.Nine pound hammer could n't kill me .

UZZELL watches him with growing interest . His face before sagged and dead now seems alive . The others look on not knowing what to say . HENRY Pulling a sheaf of papers from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have power to ordain others into the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ wherever and whenever found full of grace and good works . Signed . Suddenly arching his back over and staring DOODLE in the face . This young man is full of grace and power . What 's your full name ? DOODLE Roosevelt Wilson . Call me Doodle ' cause I used to ketch so many doodles . Chanting with his eyes closed and boring downward in the air with his forefinger like an auger bit . " Doodle-doodle , yo ' house burning up , Doodle-doodle , yo ' house burning up . " HENRY Thou shalt be consecrated . STERLING Pshaw , he 's a little boy . HENRY Staring close at STERLING where he lies on the porch . This ai n't  --  well , oh  --  pardon me , pardon me . STERLING Steadily .

QUIVIENE No bed  --  but can feed you . How long , suh ? HENRY His eye cutting by the group . ' Bout a week , I suppose . QUIVIENE Want supper ? HENRY If you please . QUIVIENE It 'll be ready soon . Make yourself at home  --  Come on , Milly . She and MILLY return into the house . HENRY opens his satchel and takes out a little black packet wrapped tightly in a string. p. 36 HENRY In a honeyed rolling voice . Little dark secret wrapped in yellow gal 's hair that walks among flowers sucking their sweetness . Told me in a dream while I slept high up in the mountain . UZZELL Whispering . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggers . HENRY Smiling at them sweetly . Makes me strong . Pulling another packet from his pocket . See . He lays them both down and tries to lift the anvil . Ca n't do it . He puts the packet back in his pocket . Now I do it easy . He raises the anvil with one hand . The boarders are dumb with amazement . Can read your names in it . Bad-Eye  --  Farrow  --  Zeb Vance , anxious to be married  --  I 'm the preacher  --  Dode Wilson , father of Bantam and Doodle  --  Uzzell  --  Sterling , oh ,  --  maybe  --  in love with another man 's lady  --  Parr , barber and undertaker . The boarders look at him with open mouths . HENRY stares down at the packet on the ground . Look at it  --  got life in it . See it move . He picks up a twig , touches it and causes it to move along toward BAD-EYE who springs out of the way terrified and trots across the yard on all fours . He crawls under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of STERLING 'S hanging feet. p. 37 SMITH With a blubbering whicker . Do n't you set dat thing on me !

SMITH Sticking his head from under the porch . Little black hairy thing big as a dollar . HENRY Never try to see what 's in it  --  power evaporates away like the morning dew  --  Surveying them .

Now you watch and see him have good luck . He quickly sticks a packet into ZEB VANCE 'S pocket . DOODLE follows his movements as if hypnotized . ZEB VANCE starts to take the packet out of his pocket . Nanh  --  Nanh  --  let it stay there and get to work . Maybe two hours  --  maybe sooner  --  you begin to have good luck . FARROW Zeb , that thing sets your britches on fire . PARR laughs . HENRY Maybe it do n't like the smell of your body  --  soon get ' climated . ZEB VANCE Slapping himself . Quit tickling me , Emma . HENRY To the others . Have one and receive light to heavenly truth ? Singing . " Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son ? He catches the waiting DOODLE by the shoulders and moves him into the ring drawn off for marble-shooting . Down on your knees . DOODLE kneels down with his hands crossed on his breast , his eyes lowered . HENRY takes a small Bible from his satchel and opens it . OLD QUIVIENE and MILLY come to the door and look out , a distrustful interest on QUIVIENE 'S face . HENRY lifts up his hand and reads . " But some of them said , he casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils . And others , tempting him , sought out a sign from heaven . But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth . " So readeth the gospel according to Saint Luke . Lead us in a word of prayer , son . HENRY gets down on his knees in the yard , motioning to the others to bow down likewise . But only WILLIE and DOODLE kneel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got over his fright comes out and sits down on the steps , and leans his head over in his hands . DODE sits upright , and UZZELL , again in his chair , stares out towards the west from which the light has all but died. p. 39 DOODLE His childish voice babbling in the falling gloom . O Lawd , dis is Doodle , Lawd , and I wanter do dy will and preach de gospel to de sinners . I'se twelve yeah old , and I wanter serve and I want you to make my pappy so he kin see ag'in . His name 's Dode and he live down heah in Potter 's Field . And take trouble from my mammy . Huh name 's Sude . And I ai n't much size yit , Lawd . HENRY stands up , and taking DOODLE by the shoulders dips him into an imaginary pool of water . HENRY I baptizes and ordains you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost . ZEB VANCE Spontaneously . Amen . QUIVIENE Sharply . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back into the house . HENRY lifts DOODLE up and wipes his face and eyes with his flowing silk handkerchief as if drying away water . HENRY I give you yo ' papers . He pulls out a paper like the former one , unstops his fountain pen and writes . DOODLE In a small voice to his audience as he jumps up and down . Feel saved . Glory ! Feel happy . Hallelujah ! Jesus ! Watching HENRY write , he makes a snuggling sound through his nose like a young pig sucking . Dat mine ? p. 40 HENRY Folding the paper and handing it to DOODLE . You are now ordained the Reverend Doodle Wilson and go preach ye unto every name and nation . Lifting up his voice . I let my power come unto you . Travel the paved street or miry road , the banks and the hollows , seeing through the houses and walls to people 's souls . And some will call you prophet and some will call you devil . And what you know , like me you will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to whim per again . ZEB VANCE Running up to DOODLE to look at the paper . You 's a real preacher now ? DOODLE Pushing him off with his elbow . Hyuh . BAD-EYE gradually bends over from the steps and rests his knuckles on the ground like a huge ape , his face caught in a study over some problem . WILSON Coming out on the porch across the street and calling . Come on home , Dode ! DODE I had gre't trouble wid my fust son , suh . Allus wildish sort in trouble and de law tuk him and put him away . Bantam was his name  --  With sudden and pathetic eagerness . Maybe , suh you could  --  With a half-outstretched hand .

Led by DOODLE he goes out at the right , singing in his hoarse voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the palm of God 's great hand , And all my strength been taken away , Taken away . " HENRY sits down in his chair and bows his head over . The others look at him in silence and stir restlessly about in the yard . The waning moon has come out in the middle of the sky and mixed a faint light with the gloom rolling in from the east . The figures on the porch and in the yard have lost their distinctness of outline and merged into the pallid twilight , appearing as if seen through a gauze or slightly moist glass . In the gap of silence UZZELL relights his pipe , and some of the others light cigarettes . QUIVIENE Her voice calling as it does every day in the year . Sup-per ! At the same instant other women 's voices in Potter 's Field begin calling  --  " Supper  --  supper ! " FARROW Supper ! Hot ziggity ! He steps waveringly by HENRY and goes up into the house , singing with forced bravado as he goes . " Soupy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and UZZELL rising knocks the fire out of his pipe and goes in . As ZEB VANCE starts across the yard toward the steps , FLOSSIE TUCKER is heard calling off at the left. p. 42 TUCKER Yo-ho  --  Zeb ! ZEB listens an instant , then turns and darts away . PARR gets up and locks his barber shop with a big barn lock . Then he starts sauntering off . PARR Stopping by HENRY . Brother Henry , how about filling our pulpit tomorrow ? HENRY So  --  so ? Well , now I 'll consider it , deacon . PARR Eleven o'clock sharp tomorrow  --  the sabbath . HENRY Good night . Sure , sure , I 'll do it . PARR Good night . He chuckles softly to himself and goes away at the right . HENRY stares after him a moment , then picks up his satchel and goes toward the house . STERLING moves forward and bars his way . STERLING In a low voice . I did n't know you at first . But now I do  --  when you lifted that anvil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You changed your color . HENRY With mock courtesy . A little chemical mixtry , suh . STERLING I 've met you  --  p. 43 HENRY ' Way down in Gawgy on a hog ? I know you too , brother . STERLING Levelly . And you know nothing but good about me . HENRY Chuckling . Sure , sure . And I 'll hold my peace . STERLING With sudden and low vehemence . Since I come here to work I 'm living straight ! I 'm gon na marry and do right . All the past is past . HENRY Ai n't the good life my specialty ? I congratulate you , brother . STERLING Stop it . HENRY Huskily . Who tells Henry to stop what ? STERLING All right  --  all right . But remember  --  if anything happens you 're to blame . HENRY Amiably . So-so . Stay quiet , brother , and I stay quiet . HENRY lays his hand gently on STERLING 'S shoulder , but he shakes it off . STERLING turns and goes up into the house . HENRY waits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the china tree . The blasting sounds in the distance , louder , more ominous . He straightens up listening. p. 44 QUIVIENE Calling inside the house . Supper  --  supper  --  HENRY adjusts his tie and goes up on the porch , clearing his throat in announcement as he approaches the door. @x A FEW minutes later . The front wall of old QUIVIENE 'S boarding shack has been removed and we can see the interior of the house , lighted by an oil lamp . There is a sort of lean-to at the back where the cook-stove is . A bed is in the left rear corner of the main room , and farther front to the left a door which leads into the little shed . In the center is the eating table , around which the boarders are crowded eating away . At the right front is a smaller table where HENRY sits alone , eating his supper in great mouthfuls . More than once he rakes out a dish which AUNT QUIVIENE politely passes on to him  --  much to FARROW 'S sorrowful astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table cloth , is tucked under his chin . STERLING is standing on the little porch outside leaning against the corner of the house . MILLY who has been waiting on her babies in the shed room at the left notices his absence from the table and comes out to him . He moves restlessly from the porch and steps down into the yard , she following . MILLY Clutching his hand . What 's the matter ? STERLING Nothing . MILLY Yes , they is . STERLING Nothing . p. 46 MILLY Everything 'll be all right some day . STERLING Some day  --  yeh , yeh . He wanders over to the left . MILLY Putting her arms around him . I do love you so . STERLING Suddenly drawing her to him and kissing her . And me you  --  me you . And you 'll always love me no matter what happens ? MILLY I will  --  always . He pulls her tightly to him and stares hungrily down in her face . What makes you get to thinking like this , honey ? STERLING Almost harshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? STERLING No , no . MILLY Three mo ' weeks we 'll have a little house all to ourselves . Think of that , honey , we will ! STERLING Softly . I do . Go back now  --  I wanter think . She gives him a long kiss and returns to helping QUIVIENE . After a moment he hits the side of the post with his knuckles and goes up on the porch again. p. 47 FARROW As STERLING enters . Po ' Tom 's got the fo ' day blues coming on . What that preacher , suh , mean  --  seem to think you somebody else ? STERLING Sitting down at the table . You keep begging for trouble , Levin . QUIVIENE From the lean-to at the back where she is working at the stove . Yo ' babies crying again , Milly . MILLY Wearily . They 're hungry  --  but they wo n't eat . She goes into the shed room . STERLING rises from the table and follows her . HENRY Them twins in there belong to Milly Wilson and their daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long road , anh ? Ta  --  room go the blasting  --  dig  --  dig  --  dig  --  anh ! He pulls a pair of beribboned glasses from his pocket  --  fastens them carefully on his nose , then looks genially around him and falls to eating again . UZZELL Muttering laconically . Dig  --  dig ! HENRY Yes , my good man . A car is heard coming down the alley , its horn honking pridefully as it draws up by the house . FARROW rises and comes down the porch , as SPORT WOMACK enters the yard. p. 48 WOMACK In a drawling voice . Hy . FARROW Hello , Raleigh Sport  --  old frazzle tail . SPORT is a small slender Negro of twenty-five , dressed in a gray suit , a gray felt hat , shining black oxfords , and withal the despair of fashion . A diamond pin sparkles in his silk cravat . WOMACK Thought mebbe could take you and Seeny foh a little drive in the rumble seat . FARROW Forlornly . I swear ! But she 's up at the Cafeteria . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive around and come back later  --  say so ? FARROW Right as rain . BELLE From the car . Yoo-hoo , Levin ! FARROW Yoo-hoo , Belle ! WOMACK Heah baby calling ? He digs FARROW in the side . Purty moonlight , boy . FARROW Slapping him in turn . Um-um , ai n't it ? WOMACK Two haystacks in a big field by the woods . A little road leads that way . BELLE Yoo-hoo ! p. 49 FARROW Yoo-hoo . Loving Momma honing foh sweet clover grass . Bending double in his gale of laughter , his face bursting with merriment . Now  --  now  --  done said . WOMACK Yeh , done said .  --  Bye , old beau-hunkus  --  see you after supper . He goes away . FARROW stands staring after him , then turns back on the porch as the car is heard driving off . FARROW Listening to the music of the motor . I 'm gon na ride like that someday , Goddamn I am ! HENRY From inside the house , with a chuckle . No , you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebe , lie still Little Dick ! FARROW goes sharply into the house and slinks by HENRY to his seat . Foolishly he picks up an empty dish and scrapes it wrathfully out . SEENY comes tripping into the lean-to at the rear . She begins washing her face and dolling herself up before a mirror that hangs on the wall . FARROW Oh , there you is , light of the summer 's eve ! He gets up and goes into the rear shed and is seen telling SEENY about SPORT 'S invitation . She seems tickled at it and gives FARROW a pecking slap on the cheek . UZZELL raises his head and stares around at the two . p. 50 GRAY With a round resonant voice as she comes down to the table . How you all come on now ? To HENRY who rises somewhat mockingly courteous . Good evening , suh . HENRY Displaying his gold-chained vest as well as his gold front teeth . And how do you do ? FARROW Miss Gray , meet Mr. John Henry  --  Reverend John Henry . Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we do n't know what he is . GRAY Stretching out a quick impetuous palm . Glad to meet you . HENRY Bowing over it unduly long . The pleasure 's mine , all mine . GRAY Where 'd you come from , Reverend Henry ? HENRY Winking broadly at FARROW who looks back at him with a puzzled face . Mebbe out of the great darkness . Pulling out his watch again . Now reading eight-twenty and a half , railroad time . Singing . " Tumbled me out with the thunder 's howlLittle dogs whistle , the bad boys growl . " p. 51 FARROW Said they blasted him out'n a hill . GRAY Archly . Really ? WILLIE With a squeal . I heah dat old blasting again . QUIVIENE Listening . Why  --  pshaw  --  they ai n't no blasting . Suddenly there is a great scamper in the yard outside and ZEB VANCE comes running in , opening a suit box as he enters . ZEB VANCE Going up into the house and singing . " Come all you rounders if you want to seeWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hurries up to the table , opens the box and pulls out a new suit of clothes . FARROW Crowding forward .

Look lak it growed on you . FARROW As he fumbles in the box . I swear to  --  Hyuh 's a letter . STERLING and MILLY come in from the shed room and stand looking on. p. 52 ZEB VANCE Opening the letter  --  with a shout . Polecats and buzzards  --  a nice strip of green-back ! He crams it into his pocket . HENRY stands watching him blandly , his thumbs in the armholes of his vest . FARROW Turning excitedly around . They 's sump'n to it  --  they is ! ZEB VANCE Cake-walking about and singing . " Well , she said unto her momma  --  Momma , what you think of this ? A sporting guy with a new suit onGimme a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be my man . " With a whoop . Shake hands everybody . I 'm free and twenty-one . Going in here and try on the britches . With the gesture of a girl he wriggles off into the shed room with his box . GRAY Zeb 'll be in devilment now . Go wake Flossie Tucker out of bed . FARROW Singing . " Get him Momma mad , Make his soul glad "  --  ZEB VANCE Suddenly reappearing in the door at the left . Land o ' Goshen ! One o ' them Emmas was in my pocket . p. 53 HENRY I told him he 'd have good luck , Mrs. Lockley . QUIVIENE Had good luck befo ' you come , suh . GRAY Bet you an interusting preacher , Reverend Henry . The blasting sounds suddenly through the night . HENRY grabs up a cup from the table . HENRY Peering into the cup . Believers , on believers ! Peoples in the valley . Lifting up his voice . Peoples on the mountain , listen to the word ! FARROW throws up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , Levin . That man maybe got power . Softly . Yeh , he got power , strange power . HENRY Passing his hand back and forth before his eyes . I see sorrow and I see pleasure . Both pleasure and sorrow I see . UZZELL Reaching his fork for a biscuit . And where do you see ' em , brother ? HENRY I sees the face of Levin Farrow . And it looks mighty sad . SEENY cackles out loud , and FARROW moves his chair around in discomfiture . WILLIE backs away from the table , goes over to the corner at the right rear near the lean-to and stands looking on in fear . BAD-EYE now full of food and nodding in spite of himself , has laid his head over on the table. p. 54 FARROW Suddenly afraid . Cut out that prosticating ! HENRY In the first place I see you about to lose your gal . FARROW turns quickly and looks at SEENY . GRAY Tossing her head as FARROW eyes her . Ooh  --  say on . HENRY Impressively . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it equal then  --  first sorrow  --  then pleasure . He beams unsteadily around at the others who with the exception of BAD-EYE watch HENRY with growing interest . Even UZZELL turns his chair around , waiting to see what will happen . HENRY Bending low over the cup . What do I see ? Suddenly shouting . Bad-Eye , Bad-Eye ! SMITH Starting up with a clatter . Who dat call my name so loud ? WILLIE Quavering . He done see sump'n in dat cup ' bout you . Keep away f'om it . SMITH Dat bizness ? Looking around for his hat . Great Lawd  --  spell bizness ! p. 55 HENRY I see money waiting for you here and yonder . UZZELL Yeah , waiting for him to dig it out'n a ditch . HENRY Staring more intently in the cup .

They all look at him mystified , and some of them cut their eyes around toward the yard . ZEB VANCE I 'll go see , Bad-Eye . But BAD-EYE suddenly springs from his seat and comes tearing down the porch into the yard . He strikes a match and crawls around under the china tree looking at the ground . Some of the others in the house rise from the table and stand looking out through the door . BAD-EYE grabs a packet up out of the dirt and stares at it stupefied . SMITH Murmuring . Ai n't nothing but a fixment o ' some kind . The burning match dies down into a coal against his fingers . ZEB VANCE From the porch . What you got there ? p. 56 SMITH Sticking what he found into his pocket and returning to the table . Nothing . ZEB VANCE goes in after him . HENRY Look , he found it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written on his face . Did you find sump'n , Bad-Eye ? HENRY Tell ' em , Bad-Eye . Plenty more waiting when you git a little Emma in your pocket .

SMITH His crossed eyes gleaming . Whah 's some mo ' ? HENRY Shrugging his shoulders . Put a little Emma in your pocket , soon it 'll come to you in a dream . SMITH Muttering . Gim me one dem things quick . HENRY And the little price is five . SMITH Throwing the three dollars on the table and adding two dollars to it from his breast pocket . Heah she is . HENRY gets a packet from his satchel and slips it into BAD-EYE 'S hand. p. 57 QUIVIENE Draining down a cup of coffee . The mischief ! FARROW Lend me five dollars .

HENRY Bad luck working ag'in you . Mebbe about two days your luck 'll turn . FARROW Sho ' damn better turn soon or they 'll be a ruckus . QUIVIENE Starting up . Ai n't that Zeb Vance 's ten dollars ? ZEB VANCE Who has got the five dollars change back from FARROW . Just lending him a little . QUIVIENE Do n't want no more of that , Reverend Henry , in my house , nary another bit of it .

Sorry but the spirit moves in me tur'ble strong . QUIVIENE Lord have mercy , keep it back from me ! He throws the coin on the table and sits down silent by the stove .

" When I get ' bout forty more dollarsTake my hammer to the Captain , Tell him I 'm gone , boys , Tell him I 'm gone . " GRAY Coming in again . I ca n't go tonight , Levin . FARROW Licking his lips .

But FARROW makes no answer as he and ZEB VANCE go up the alley . SPORT and BELLE go out at the right . In the shed room at the left , TOM STERLING sits down on the edge of the bed and takes MILLY into his lap . STERLING Honey child . MILLY Yeh , sweet  --  ah  --  STERLING Want to ask you something . MILLY Sitting up in alarm . What is it , Tom ? STERLING  --  Want to ask you let 's move away from Potter 's Field . MILLY We are , honey , in three more weeks . STERLING Tomorrow . MILLY Tomorrow ?

See dat old house shining in de moonlight . HENRY Right , right . Go get your money , keep searching . SMITH Sho ' ' nough ? Yeh , yeh .

UZZELL , who has stood up to go , moves over and stops by her . UZZELL A little drink of water . GRAY Looking at him out of the depths of her smiling eyes . Cool drink of water . HENRY Singing , as he thumbs his Bible . " Cool drink of water ' fore he dies . " SEENY takes a dipper of water from a bucket in a chair near WILLIE 'S squirrel cage and sticks it out toward UZZELL . He takes the dipper with one hand and with the other catches SEENY 'S outstretched palm . GRAY Softly , as she looks at HENRY 'S bowed back . Ed , Bad Ed , you used to be . p. 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it . He glances slowly behind him and then looks hungrily at her . GRAY With quiet hardness . Old hawks and young pullets , you 've said so much . UZZELL His writhing smile playing about his lips  --  whispering . I like you , Seeny . SEENY pulls her hand from his and goes back into the kitchen . UZZELL returns the dipper to the bucket and stands thinking , his hands shoved deep into his pockets . HENRY In the darkness of the valley . But the weary struggler must keep climbing . UZZELL Up the mountain that never ends . HENRY says no more . SEENY comes to the back shed door . GRAY Petulantly . Now why has Aunt Quiviene gone to crying ? WILLIE In the kitchen . Stop , Mis ' Quivie child , you make me cry . UZZELL Jocularly . Eigh , sister ! As near to a chant as he ever gets . " Let the tears come twinkling down like rain . " p. 66 HENRY Singing . " Let the tears come twinkling down like rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody . See you in the morning , let us hope . He stands whistling a moment to himself and then goes off across the yard to the left . In the shed at the left MILLY has gone to sleep in STERLING 'S arms . Presently he lifts her up and sits down in a rocking chair and begins rocking her . With one hand , he reaches over and turns down the lamp to a faint flame . The blasting sounds again . By the barber shack a NEGRO creeps up and stands in the moonlight as if listening . He is an ebony black little fellow , squat , agile and ape-like , with slender legs and powerful shoulders . His massive hands hang down below his knees . Peeping around the edge of the shack , he sees the bent figure of HENRY through the door . He starts with a low exclamation of surprise and then gives a low sly whistle . HENRY raises his head up and listens . HENRY After a moment , calling to SEENY . So hot I 'll take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Gray . GRAY In a moment , Reverend Henry . HENRY comes down into the yard . The NEGRO by the shack whistles softly again. p. 67 HENRY Moving indirectly toward the shack and chanting his information as if to himself . " Some fair weather and right much cloud , Better sit easy and not crow loud . " He turns suddenly and grabs the LITTLE NEGRO by the collar . You the biggest fool that ever walked ! BANTAM Standing still and docile . Easy , big Sampson , and do n't scrush my neckbone . HENRY Dropping his hands . What you doing here ? BANTAM Thought I 'd take a little fresh air too . HENRY Them officers 'll be here in an hour after you . BANTAM Not hardly . I went to bed early  --  sick . A wad of guano sacks is sleeping in my bed . HENRY You 're a big fool for a little man .

QUIVIENE has finished cleaning up and is sitting in a chair dipping snuff , every now and then lifting the lid of the stove to spit . WILLIE is lying on the floor looking at his squirrel .

BANTAM Going in . Nobody but me , Aunt Quivie . How you come on ? QUIVIENE How 'd you get here ? HENRY Interposing as BANTAM hesitates . He 's been pardoned . BANTAM Yessuh .

And how is everybody ? You too , Willie . I ai n't gwine hurt you . Debonairly he goes around , shaking their limp hands . GRAY Laughing . Same old Bantam . I 'll declare , seem good to have you back . p. 72 QUIVIENE Ai n't gon na seem good to some folks . STERLING opens the door at the left and stands looking in . MILLY has thrown herself down across the bed in the shed room . HENRY Punctiliously . I want you gentlemen to meet one another and be friends for a short while . Mr. Sterling , this is Mr. Wilson . BANTAM Sticking out a huge paw . Glad to meet you , suh . STERLING stares blankly from him to HENRY , his face gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned loose from the roads and mighty ' fectionate this evening . BANTAM Still holding his hand out . Bantam Wilson , suh , high stepper , Lawd , I 'm gwine be free . STERLING continues gazing at him saying nothing . Damn , do n't seem so happy over sump'n . Turning and slapping SEENY affectionately on the back . And how 's the old gal ? Any yo ' tail fedders missing ? GRAY Ai n't shedding time . BANTAM His gaze sweeping by HENRY . Coming close to it . p. 73 QUIVIENE Stirring herself . Had your supper ? BANTAM Could eat a little bit mo ' ! QUIVIENE With a glance by HENRY . Everything been cleaned out here . With forced gaiety . Now you 'll rest easy . Plenty good work up at the college  --  and new warehouses going up in town  --  need men . BANTAM Lighting a cigarette .

BANTAM Laughing . Den she cai n't be in de house . He glances at STERLING as he blows rings of smoke into the air . You got only three rooms . De kitchen , dis room , and de shed room dere . She ai n't in de kitchen , she ai n't in dis room , and she cai n't be in dere. p. 74 HENRY Softly , a brief flash in his eye as he glances at STERLING . How come , Brother ? BANTAM ' Cause dat 's Mr. Sterling 's room . QUIVIENE Ai n't Mr. Sterling 's room . BANTAM Oh-ho , den goddam it what he doing in dat room wid her and de do ' closed ? Listening .

My eyes do n't tell me that . BANTAM Bouncing around . Who 's talking so loud to King Bantam ? HENRY Singing slowly and deliberately . " There was a bad man MurdockAnd he wore the ball and chain " p. 75 STERLING Hush ! Hush ! MILLY is heard sobbing loudly in the shed at the left . BANTAM Hanh , ne ' mind . Calling again . Do n't grieve , Momma , de comforter have come ! STERLING Over his shoulder , keeping his eyes alertly on BANTAM . Stop , Milly , I 'll see to him . BANTAM His eyes shining , but his face never losing its smile . Dat man ai n't bad , he just smell bad . QUIVIENE Quavering somewhat like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STERLING Appearing more at ease . Pardoned ? He 's broke loose from the roads . And this devil of a preacher mixed up in it . BANTAM Dat hardly relative to de case in hand , as de judge said . Wanter see my pardon ? GRAY Coming up to STERLING . Be easy with him , Tom . BANTAM Guffawing in sudden fun . Easy wid me ? He do n't know I 'm de baddest man in de hollow . Better tell him , folkses . Whup my weight in wildcats and cold steel . Onct I fou't a circular saw and broke out a handful of his teeth  --  haw-haw-haw. p. 76 STERLING Do n't care how bad he is . If he lays hands on her , I 'll fold ' em for him in his grave . BANTAM Dat sounds lak real talk , bo . With sudden pleasantness . Well , you sho ' gyards dat do ' . Reckon you wins , big boy . Gradually STERLING somewhat relaxes his watchful attitude . STERLING You let her alone , I let you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his face . Why you come stepping in ' twixt me and my ' oman ? Twelve months breaking dem rocks . Let her rain , let her shine , de old hammer swinging all de time . Spreading out his huge calloused palms . Look-a-dere , dem horny hands . I broke enough rocks and drove enough steel down  --  HENRY Softly . Steel driving . BANTAM And drove enough steel down  --  amm  --  from de end of Kayntucky to Alabam . Vehemently . Twelve months and all de time no word from my ' oman . In a worker 's sing-song . " Let he up  --  hunh  --  let her down , Muscle dat make  --  hunh  --  de world go ' round . " As BANTAM repeats his song , HENRY begins to sing and dig in pantomime . Suddenly he realizes what he is doing and stops before SEENY 'S questioning eyes . BANTAM begins walking back and forth across the room by STERLING as he tells his woes. p. 77 BANTAM Dat sun and dat rain , and in de winter freeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dey all skeahed . Weaving his head from side to side . And de white folks pass in deir cyars and de colored folks pass in deirn  --  on dat long , long road built wid our sweat and muscle power and bone  --  and dey look at you lak sump'n quare . Savagely to all around him . What you know ' bout it ? To STERLING as he passes . Wait till dey beat you and de blood run all over de barrel , yea , de barrel , same lak it was made to ketch it in . Talk ' bout de blood of Jesus . Shaking his head , he reaches over and gives SEENY 'S cheek a playful pinch . And den , honey , dem yaller gals come out in July wid deir sunbonnets on picking blackberries by de way . And dey laugh , and deir laugh sound cool , but dey stand way off . Skeahed of dem gyards , skeahed of de po ' convicts . Fiercely . And all de time my ' oman heah messing up wid him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , him dat walks in freedom while you wear the ball and chain . BANTAM suddenly sticks his foot before STERLING and throwing his arm around his neck sends him sprawling across the floor . At the same time he whips out a pistol and stands in the door guarding it . With a loud laugh he continues his speech. p. 78 BANTAM But King Bantam Rooster never say die . One night he come home and find a creeper fooling wid his bed  --  what he do ? Why , mebbe lak I once took a rock and mashed a moccasin 's head tried to bite me . He smiles quietly at STERLING . The blasting sounds again in the distance . STERLING Gasping as he climbs to his feet . I kill you ! I kill you ! MILLY is seen rising from the bed and going to the window . QUIVIENE Moaning . Go away , Tom , go away from here . GRAY Clinging to STERLING . He 'll shoot you ! WILLIE suddenly seizes his squirrel cage and tears out through the shed at the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chokes with fury , staring at the pistol . HENRY Stepping before him . Here , Mr. Sterling . It 's his wife . In a little while she 'll be yours maybe . GRAY He knows , Tom , he knows . STERLING whirls upon him and strikes at him , but HENRY knocks the blow off with his arm . In the shed , MILLY raises the window and tries to jump out , but BANTAM runs in , seizes her and drags her back. p. 79 BANTAM Ho , little Birdie , do n't fly away ! Dere , dere , honey . Gi ' us a kiss . With a loud smack . Dat 's it , several of ' em , a whole armful . MILLY Tom , Tom ! STERLING I kill that Wilson ! BANTAM Cocking his pistol . Nunh  --  unh , you wo n't . Old QUIVIENE moans and rocks in her chair . BANTAM stands in the door with one arm around the sobbing MILLY , the other grasping his gun . He coos over her . Momma , momma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Stress and grief make a ' oman so loving . GRAY Turning from STERLING and pulling at HENRY 'S arm . Come on ! Come on ! STERLING Quietly . Let me loose . HENRY gradually releases him , and he stands bent over on the floor . GRAY Laying her face against HENRY 'S . Come on , come on . Take me ' way from here . HENRY waits a moment and then takes her arm . HENRY Giving STERLING a long look which gradually changes into a smile . You ai n't bad , and let everything rest . I 'm your spiritual friend . p. 80 QUIVIENE Rousing herself . For God 's sake , Tom , git away and do n't bring trouble on me ! She pulls at STERLING in a frenzy of hen-like activity . BANTAM I gi ' you one minute and den trot . MILLY tries to claw at his face , but BANTAM holds her suffocatingly against him . STERLING stares at him blankly . Do n't git wild , honey .  --  Heah me ? I said one minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do , Tom . She sits down in her chair weeping . STERLING stares at MILLY . STERLING Wetting his lips . Plenty I can do . I done told him what if he lays hands on her . MILLY Wailing . Nothing  --  nothing ! Go on , Tom . STERLING turns and comes out of the house , walks around in a circle a moment , and then as if deciding on something , runs suddenly away at the left . STERLING Muttering as he runs . I come back . I come back . Wagging his head . Jesus , Jesus ! BANTAM Lowering his pistol and kissing his hand after him . Good-bye , good-bye fohever . Turning back with MILLY into the shed-room , his huge hands spread fan-like over her breast , as he pushes her before him . Honey babe , you 's a soft bunch of flowers . Nunh-unh , sweet . He closes the door behind them and is seen pulling her down to him . After a moment he bends far over and blows out the lamp. p. 81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his satchel and derby from the cot and taking SEENY 'S arm , comes down out of the house . GRAY Something gon na happen . Oh , it is ! HENRY The world keeps turning , things bound to happen . Pointing . A big star by the moon . GRAY Shivering . Sell me one them little balls . HENRY Do n't you worry , you do n't need it . GRAY Clinging to him . Never any man like you , Reverend Henry . Dreamily as she leans against him . Yes , look at that purty little star and the moon . Let 's take a little walk . I 'm not afraid , not with you . HENRY Chuckling and bending over her as they go across the yard . I 'll be your shepherd , sister . GRAY And I yo ' little lamb . They go away up the alley at the right . QUIVIENE Crawling up and making her way to the door at the rear . Willie , come back , honey ! Ai n't nothing to hurt you now ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting down , she rocks her head back and forth in her hands . Presently she pulls off her shoes , drops her skirt , turns down the cover and wraps herself up in the sheet . WILLIE comes cautiously in at the rear p. 82 WILLIE Whah is he ? QUIVIENE Her shoulders jerking with suppressed sobs . Shet the do ' and git to bed , son . WILLIE shuts the door at the front , blows out the light , takes off his shoes and trousers and crawls into bed with her . The room is dark , save for a dim trickle of moonlight that comes in from under the eaves of the porch . BANTAM 'S caressing voice , broken by MILLY 'S low sobs , is heard from the shed-room as the convict goes to his long awaited rest . MILLY 'S sobs gradually die away to low moans , and presently BANTAM is heard snickering , even giggling . MILLY 'S moans also gradually take on a different tone . WILLIE Fohgot my prayers . QUIVIENE Yeh , better say ' em , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees begins to mumble . WILLIE Our Father who art  --  QUIVIENE Joining in fervently as he mumbles in forget-fulness.  --  Thy kingdom come , thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven . WILLIE AND QUIVIENE Fohgive us our truspasses as we fohgive those who truspass against us  --  p. 83 WILLIE Starting. @x AN hour or two later . The curtain rises revealing the shadowy lump of QUIVIENE 'S boarding house bathed in the silvery radiance of the moonlight . Somewhere in the night a mocking bird is chirping out his light but melancholy note . A moment passes and then BAD-EYE comes wandering in from the left thrumming his Jew's-harp . He stops and stands eyeing the house . SMITH Calling to the house as if it were a man . Heigh ! He listens a moment . Heigh ! Plucking his harp . Whah dat preacher man ? Calling . Which way he go , Aunt Quivie ? QUIVIENE Within . Do n't know , do n't care ! Mebbe towards hell ! SMITH Going over and staring at the foot of the china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ai n't I a fool ? Hot weather mess my haid up . Spitting , he eyes the moon a moment , then with his Jew's-harp going , wanders mournfully along the alley at the rear . Now and then he is heard giving a cold calling whistle that echoes over the valley and among the houses . The blasting is heard in the distance again. p. 85 WILLIE Inside the house  --  throwing the cover from his head . Ooh , dat old blasting ! QUIVIENE Pulling him back . I take care of you , honey . They lie wrapped in each other 's embrace under the sheet . The sounds in the house die away . Presently FARROW comes stepping into the yard from the right . He beckons behind him , and ZEB VANCE and FLOSSIE TUCKER come in , holding each other by the hand , FLOSSIE now and then giving her high suppressed giggle . FARROW goes up on the porch and knocks at the door . WILLIE is heard whining in fright . FARROW Nobody but Levin , Aunt Quivie ! QUIVIENE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp , and opens the door , her gray hair sticking out in a flare around her face . QUIVIENE What the name o ' God you want ? FARROW Going in  --  ZEB VANCE and FLOSSIE following him . Brung you a new daughter . QUIVIENE Throwing up her hands . Oh , you  --  you  --  Fool ! WILLIE Poking his head out from the cover . What 's de matter  --  police ? p. 86 QUIVIENE Ejaculating . S-sh ! This mush-headed Zeb Vance done got married ! She puts the lamp back on the table and sits down on the edge of the bed . ZEB VANCE Placatingly . Now , Mammy  --  QUIVIENE Snapping . Yeh , call on mammy the first thing . Now two of you to be calling . ZEB VANCE Flossie can help wid de cooking . QUIVIENE And the eating . Bitterly . And first thing you know be a baby , then another  --  yeh , mammy  --  mammy  --  She makes an angry guttural noise in her throat . Haruck ! Getting into bed again . Du n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it ai n't gon na be in here . This mine and Willie 's room . FLOSSIE stands in the middle of the floor , her eyes cast down . ZEB VANCE Help me move dat cot , Levin . He and FARROW take the cot into the kitchen shed . QUIVIENE Settling her head on her pillow . Ai n't you two a pair in this world ! Who married you ? p. 87 TUCKER Dat new preacher . FARROW From the kitchen . Me'n Seeny witnessed . QUIVIENE Beating her pillow angrily and fitting her head to it again . Ai n't no preacher . He 's a plumb devil wearing black . Well , make de best of it . Ai n't gon na worry no more if the world blow up . Did n't have no license , did you ? ZEB VANCE As he and FARROW come in again . Preacher give us a paper . QUIVIENE Reckon it 'll hold long enough anyhow . FARROW Mournfully . Somebody 's gon na be weak wid de pick on Monday . Goodnight , everybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and goes into the alley . Pacing up and down a moment undecidedly , he raises his voice in his lonely " holler " and goes away in the direction he came . ZEB VANCE walks around the room , waiting for somebody to say something . QUIVIENE For Jesus ' sake quit that walking . Bofe of you fools , go on to bed . Know what 's in your minds . FLOSSIE gives her foolish giggle and ZEB VANCE takes up the lamp . He latches the door , and he and FLOSSIE go into the shed at the rear . The light streams in partially illuminating OLD QUIVIENE 'S room . The bride and groom begin to undress in embarrassment . FLOSSIE continues to give her foolish giggle . Presently ZEB VANCE blows out the light and pulls FLOSSIE down to him . A moment passes , and TOM STERLING slides in by the barber shack with his hand in his shirt . He tiptoes over and stands by the window to MILLY 'S room , pressing himself flat against the wall and listening . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand along the sill and pushes the window around on its hinges . The moonlight shines into the room. p. 88 MILLY Within . Must be the wind . But there is no answer from BANTAM . STERLING stands still as a statue as he waits , looking like a dark bronze bas-relief against the house . The round gleaming barrel of a pistol is gradually pushed out over the window sill from within . It stops as if surveying the scene with its round hole of an eye . Then in the shadow of the room behind it the dim outline of BANTAM 'S head and shoulders rise , stopping and then rising a bit more . BANTAM With a low chuckle . Yeh , a little breeze . He reaches up cautiously to close the window , when STERLING suddenly sticks his hand out with a pistol in it and shoots him twice . MILLY lets out a loud scream , and BANTAM is heard struggling and cursing around the room . He breaks through the door into QUIVIENE 'S room , where she is hugging the moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lintel of the front door , his knees sagging under him , moaning and cursing . BANTAM Goddamn him  --  de goddamn snake he killed me  --  ooh  --  killed me ! ZEB VANCE rushes in from the shed , half-dressed and carrying a lamp . The light pours out over BANTAM 'S body twisting in agony. p. 89 QUIVIENE With a loud cry . Help , help ! BANTAM Gasping for breath , his voice already gurgling in a death choke . Whah is he ? Crawling along the porch . Jesus , gim me a chance at him ! I shoot  --  I kill  --  Ooh  --  He catches sight of STERLING and tries to lift his pistol , but it gradually falls with his weakening hand , and then suddenly he turns over and rolls half-way down the steps and lies still , his body only half-covered in a single shirt . MILLY , in a loose skirt wrapped hastily around her , runs through the room and out onto the porch . She holds BANTAM 'S head upon her lap and moans over him . Her wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . They 's blood all over him ! Screaming . Git a doctor ! Git a doctor ! STERLING Throwing down his pistol and coming mechanically up to her . Do n't need no doctor  --  Milly ! Now the vengeful blasting goes off near at hand , jarring the earth . STERLING listens aghast . Listen there ! MILLY Clinging to him , forgetful of her nakedness . Somebody shot Bantam  --  oh somebody did  --  She clings to him weeping wildly. p. 90 STERLING Calling to the others in the house . Hush now ! Nobody gon na git hurt . MILLY Running back up on the porch and fluttering her hands helplessly . He was all right  --  Bantam was good . Childishly . I did n't want you to do it . STERLING Told him you was my woman . MILLY Ai n't , ai n't . Shaking her head . Nobody 's woman . Naked , she runs back into the house and flings herself on the bed with QUIVIENE and WILLIE . STERLING looks at BANTAM and then gently lays his head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go git Sport Womack , somebody . He 'll take Tom away . She fastens a sheet around MILLY . STERLING Sitting on the edge of the porch . You all go away  --  leave . I stay heah . MILLY runs back on the porch and hugs STERLING to her . MILLY I am yo'n , too . And you 's mine , honey . I wo n't let ' em take you away . The babies set up a squeal in the shed. p. 91 STERLING Calling to the terrified group in the house . Take the babies and all you go to Sude 's and Dode 's . Bitterly . Say somebody in the hollow killing cats . He begins walking helplessly back and forth in the yard . JIM PARR runs in at the left . PARR What 's happened- ? With a shout . O Good God A'mighty ! Going over and feeling BANTAM 'S body . Dead as a rock . There is a hurried scrambling and grabbing up of clothes by the four in the house , QUIVIENE constantly pushing WILLIE 'S clinging arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lawd ! Oh , Lawd ! PARR How come he heah ? QUIVIENE Say he been pardoned . PARR Thinking a moment . You all keep quiet as you can . I 'll be right back . Do n't say a word . Do n't , I tell you . He hurries out the way he came . Excited shouts and halloos sound around the house , and several figures come running up the alley and stand in the edge of the yard , looking on , whispering and gesticulating , appearing in the half light like grotesque life-sized puppets . Some of them are half-dressed and some are busy pulling on their shirts and coats . QUIVIENE and the others go out of the house at the rear and then into the alley . After a moment they come around and join the group at the right end of the porch. p. 92 QUIVIENE Somebody killed Bantam , there he lie on the porch ! She hugs WILLIE to her , and the others stare at the stretched-out figure in horrified silence . MILLY Following STERLING up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group at the right . Go on away , you 'll all be slammed in jail . A lamp is lighted in DODE 'S house across the alley , and DODE comes out on the porch , calling in his heavy voice . DODE What 's happened over dere ? No one answers . The men and women begin to moan and growl mournfully to themselves . HENRY and SEENY come up the alley and stop at the edge of the yard . STERLING sits down on the anvil , and MILLY drops on her knees beside him , laying her head in his lap , her arms around him . FARROW bounds into the yard from the left and stops thunderstruck . QUIVIENE Setting up a sort of low frightened keen . Bantam 's gone from here . OTHERS From the group in a rasping whisper . Bantam 's gone . DODE WILSON comes blundering in , led by DOODLE , with SUDIE blubbering behind. p. 93 GRAY With a gasp . Po ' Bantam Wilson . She jerks loose from HENRY 'S arm and flies across the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands looking on , swaying his shoulders from side to side like a restless ape . DODE Dully . Bantam ? Bantam on de road , on de big road . WILSON With a cry as she stares at the body . My boy ! She turns and holds tightly to DODE , who stands still as a post . HENRY Stepping before them with a Bible in his hands , raising his voice rhythmically above the chant which has been started among the NEGROES around QUIVIENE . Brother done gone to his long home . He done gone . They called his name  --  hush  --  hush  --  OTHERS Chanting . " Hush , hush , somebody called his name . " STERLING Going on quietly . Now everybody get away from here . Go back to your beds , I 'll talk to the Law . The chant dies down a moment but still no one makes a move to go . DODE Swinging his arms . Who shot my boy ? Where is de God-damned dawg ? p. 94 HENRY With quiet oily persuasion . Nobody knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue again . Hush  --  hush . JIM PARR and UZZELL come in at the left with a long splint-woven basket . They put it down and lift BANTAM into it . The chant of the NEGROES suddenly breaks out again . NEGROES " Hush , hush , somebody call-a his nameHush , hush , somebody call-a his nameHush , hush , somebody call-a his name.Oh , my Lawd , oh my Lawd , what shall I do ! " Putting his Bible into his satchel , HENRY goes over and looks down into the basket . DOODLE moves up and stands behind him . HENRY reaches out and puts his hand on DOODLE 'S shoulder . PARR Let 's get him away quick . STERLING Jumping up and throwing MILLY from him  --  yelling . Do n't you move him ! Let the Law come . He begins walking up and down in the yard again . PARR and UZZELL set the basket down and stand undecided . The wailing NEGROES gradually creep into the yard and surround the basket as if fascinated . After a moment , HENRY lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UZZELL Have nothing more to do with it . Throwing up his hands and wiggling them despairingly over his head . Fools ! Fools ! He turns abruptly and goes off by the barber shack . HENRY To DOODLE . Po ' sinner man come home one night . Death was waiting at his door . Preach it , Brother . DOODLE Crying out , his eyes flashing as he begins to preach . Soon one mawning Death come creeping at yo ' do ' . HENRY Chanting . Soon one morning !  --  The NEGROES catch up the words . NEGROES " Soon one mawning Death come creeping at yo ' do ' , Soon one mawning Death come creeping at yo ' do ' , Soon one mawning Death come creeping at yo ' do ' , Oh , my Lawd , oh , my Lawd , what shall I do ! " The chant goes on , and DOODLE 'S voice rises above it . DOODLE Why do n't he say sump'n now ? What makes him so still in dat basket ? Why do n't he move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , Death done struck him down . HENRY Death , oh death  --  The NEGROES stare down into the basket as if mesmerized . OLD QUIVIENE leads the chant into another tune. p. 96 QUIVIENE " Death , O Death , Death , O Death , Death , O Death , Spare me over another day . " The other NEGROES join her . DOODLE goes on preaching . DOODLE Bantam gone  --  gone  --  gone  --  Bantam gone to come no mo ' . Us gon na miss him , us gon na mo'n . Us gon na miss him now he 's gone . HENRY With a loud shout . Amen ! He begins singing with the NEGROES . MILLY follows STERLING around in the yard , wringing her hands . HENRY We gon na miss him  --  NEGROES Changing back into the former chant . " We gon na miss him  --  miss him now he 's gone , We gon na miss him  --  miss him now he 's gone , We gon na miss him  --  miss him now he 's gone , Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ? " DOODLE Bantam , whah is you now tonight ? Us in Potter 's Field axes you what is you at now ? Is he in heaben , is he in hell ?

Dere he stand on de edge o ' de world and de wind blows loud on him ruffling his feathers . Crying out . Tell us whah my brudder gone . Listening as the mourning song goes on . He do n't answer me  --  hanh . Up in heaben or down in hell ? Shuddering and hiding his face in his hands . Look down in dat deep hole , see de gre't flames burning and br'iling . Mercy , mercy , I sees Old Satan , setting on his red-hot rock , Lawd , setting in de fiery furnace wid his feet in de hot ashes . Look , he spet on de rock and gre't steam bile up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listening . Hanh , he pop his tail , he shake his hawns , he make no answer .

" DOODLE Look up dere behind dat moon all pale like flour on its face  --  pale like a sick man . See my Lawd and Savior . Sending a high call up to Him . Whah is po ' Bantam now ? See how de Lawd 's tears fall down . He so sorry dey lay de po ' body down . With a high cry . What dat sweeping and winking thoo them stars , looking lak a rainbow and burning cloud ? Babbling . Dat 's de mighty God of Jacob and Job wid his beard lak a burning bresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Is Bantam up dere wid you , God ? He listens and then ecstatically answers himself in a faraway voice . Bantam done got home to his rest , Bantam sleeping in his Father 's breast . And do n't you weep and do n't you mo'n any more . A moaning cry of gladness runs among the people . WILSON Falling on the ground and bobbing her head up and down . Yeh , he is , yeh , he is ! He 's in heaben . Po ' Bantam. p. 98 DODE Shouting out . And he gon na rise  --  rise ! He waves his guitar , beating time . HENRY Rise ! NEGROES Breaking into a happier refrain . " He gon na rise like dew wid de mawning sun , He gon na rise like dew wid de mawning sun , He gon na rise like dew wid de mawning sun , Oh , my Lawd , oh , my Lawd , what shall I do ? " STERLING Falling on his knees by the basket . I Killed po ' Bantam , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks , I did n't mean to do it  --  sump'n made me mad , I lost my senses !  --  Jesus !  --  Jesus !  --  Bantam !  --  Bantam !  --  Several of the mourners draw away from him in fear . HENRY Death could n't spare him  --  QUIVIENE Leading back into the second chant . " Death , O Death , Death , O Death , Death , O Death , Spare me over another day . " From somewhere in the distance a huge rasping voice calls  --  a voice so loud that like the blasting it jars the ground . It is the Law. p. 99 VOICE Heigh ! I say heigh there ! Immediately the group of mourners are transformed as if by an electric shock . They scatter right and left , running low in the shadows with hushed and excited cries . MOURNERS As they flee . The Law , the Law !  --  OTHERS Police ! Police ! DOODLE is left standing on the porch with HENRY near and STERLING and MILLY in the yard . MILLY Moaning . Run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tries to pull him away , but he still rests on his knees as if waiting for something . HENRY starts casually away at the left . STERLING grabs up his pistol from the ground and springs before him . STERLING Half-sobbing . Get right back . Yeh , you caused all this ! HENRY Starting . Hunh ? STERLING You move out of this yard and I kill another man . HENRY Stop fooling , I 'm in a hurry . STERLING Yeh , and I know the law wants you . We 'll go together . p. 100 HENRY Snarling . Get out of my way ! STERLING Raising the pistol . Make another move at me and I kill you sho 's your name 's Bad Man Bolis . HENRY Smiling . Bolis ? Bolis ? Watching him . If you gon na keep me here do n't mind I light a cigarette , do you ? STERLING Put that hand in yo ' pocket and you 'll never take it out . HENRY Throwing back his shoulders . All right , I 'll explain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right weeping . The high purposeless wailing of the babies sets up in the house . VOICE As before . Height ! STERLING With the pistol stuck against HENRY 'S back . This is Bad Man Bolis and Red Murdock , Cap'n . Take us . With a cry MILLY runs out of the yard at the left . HENRY throws up his head with a half snarl , and STERLING marches him to the right as if to meet their doom . And now with a low sardonic chuckle as if releasing the evil of his whole inner nature , HENRY moves ahead of him . A great wind begins to blow through Potter 's Field , the china tree is twisted in its grip , the houses shake , sag and sway , and with the whistle of an oncoming shell a terrific blast goes off in the center of the scene . The pallid light of the moon mixes in with the turmoil as QUIVIENE 'S house totters and falls . Then the light goes out . The moon drops down the sky like a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the valley flying across the scene like stray autumn leaves in a storm. @x THE light comes up again into the bright glare of a day in August . It is a few weeks later . Eight or ten striped convicts in the right background are digging on the blazing new road that runs through Potter 's field  --  one stouter and more lusty-hearted digging ahead , all swinging their picks aloft and bringing them down together . BAD-EYE 'S truck is drawn up in the alley back of the wrecked boarding-house , and QUIVIENE , WILLIE , and MILLY are loading their household goods in it preparatory to moving away . The white dust is thick as a haze in the air , resting like a cement dew on the ruined zinnia and marigold beds . The heat of August shimmers across the land as far as the eye can see . Lazy Lawrence dances his fiendish monkey dance . The sweat pours down , the only dampness in the world for the ten mourners on the road . On a stump to the left a GUARD squats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crook of his arm keeps alert , its muzzle warns like an eye , it threatens . On the bankside to the right another GUARD sits . He also is sleepy , drowsy . His rifle also keeps alert and watches , its muzzle threatens . The convicts dig with their backs to the GUARDS , their faces set down the infinite stretch of road . Like soulless puppets , they lift their hands towards the sky and bring them down , never any slower , never any faster . And as the picks come down against the earth with a thud , a husky desperate groan bursts from their baked lips . As rhythmic as the beating of their hearts the " hanh ! " accompanies the falling of the picks , carrying over long maddening hours of pain until the sun sinks cooling in the west and the GUARD stirs and says , " Call it a day . " At times their voices are raised in a chant , level , patient , as eternal and tough as the earth in which they dig . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the staccato of conversation breaks up the rhythmic routine of labor and that 's what they 're here for  --  labor , labor , working on the roads . " Ten years on the roads , TOM STERLING , alias RED MURDOCK , and twenty years for you , JACK BOLIS , alias the REVEREND JOHN HENRY . " The judge dropped his tobacco by his foot , rose , addressed the jury , and gave sentence . " These niggers , these everlasting niggers , always fighting , always shooting , always killing . They 've got no sense . They 'll never have no sense . Peace  --  peace , I say . The law  --  the law ! For this is the Republic , these the institooshuns . " HENRY 'S spirit still walks unbroken . STERLING 'S has gone under . The feel of iron and abuse of tongues have broken him . His great shoulders are bent , his legs hardly sustain his weight , and his arms fling up the pick and let it fall hour after hour , day after day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightless face stares at the earth beneath . HENRY Driving in his pick , the monosyllables dropping at slow intervals from his lips , as if they had no meaning other than their sound . Dig-dig-dig-hanh  --  dig-dig-hanh  --  The GUARD at the right stirs in his sleepiness and beats at the flies with his hat. p. 103 FIRST GUARD Rain or shine , the old dog-flies stay with you . SECOND GUARD Lighting a cigarette and throwing the package across to the first . And the damn muskeeters allus drilling for blood . HENRY Dig-dig-dig-hanh  --  dig-dig-dig-hanh . FIRST GUARD To the CONVICTS . Stir up there  --  ketch the preacher ! SECOND GUARD Heigh you , Sterling , raise up that pick and let her come down . The CONVICTS dig on , accompanying every blow with their everlasting " hanh-hanh , " saying never a word , except HENRY with his " dig-dig-dig . " FIRST GUARD Hear me ? Put some pep in that digging ! Hell freeze over ' fore you git this little digging done . They lapse into silence again . The SECOND GUARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sleepy  --  sleepy . FIRST GUARD Better leave her off a few nights There is a snickering among the CONVICTS . SECOND GUARD Brutally , his voice sharp with hate . Somebody begging for the little rawhide ! The CONVICTS , terrified , drive their picks deeper into the earth but never any slower , never any faster . MILLY with the one remaining baby in her arms comes around from behind OLD QUIVIENE 'S house and stands on the edge of the road-cut . BAD-EYE is with her , his face full of sorrow . He stands swaying his body from side to side in a restless apelike motion. p. 104 SMITH Softly . Tom , Tom . But STERLING pays no attention to him , nor do any of the other CONVICTS , carrying on their digging , and carrying it on . MILLY Tom , Tom , please look up . This is Milly . FIRST GUARD Ai n't visiting time till Sunday . MILLY Holding out a bottle . Brung him some medicine . He needs it , he needs it bad . SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We got doctors . Go on now . FIRST GUARD Hurrying her . Heigh , heigh . MILLY turns and goes despairingly off the way she came , helped along by BAD-EYE . SECOND GUARD Water ! I want some water . FIRST GUARD Goddamned water boy 's fell in and drownded . Standing up and calling . Water boy , water jack ! Could a-been there and half-way back . The CONVICTS begin a wordless hum that rises like a dry gusty breathing from their mouths , pitiful and pleading . HENRY In a wooden voice . Mercy , mercy , it calls , water , water ! Give them water ! The hum of the CONVICTS faintly increases its volume. p. 105 FIRST GUARD Go to it , preacher , get this road built . Wheels got to turn . SECOND GUARD Traffic got to move . HENRY Chanting . Seas  --  rivers of bricks , mortar and iron  --  let it flow on  --  open the way  --  FIRST GUARD That 's right , Preacher . Sing him up . Water boy ! Sing him out'n them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive ' em to the eye !  --  Jesus Christ ! STERLING suddenly tumbles over and falls with his face flat in the dirt . A convulsive shudder runs through the other CONVICTS , save HENRY . All keep to their digging , never any faster , never any slower , their faces set down the infinite stretch of road before them . Only their humming increases in volume , full of begging , full of pain . With a cry MILLY runs in . QUIVIENE with her arms around the frightened WILLIE is seen behind her . Still clasping her baby , MILLY tries to make her way over to STERLING , but the FIRST GUARD pushes her back with his rifle , and she stands among the loose clods , an anguished moaning coming from her throat . HENRY Dig-dig-dig-hanh ! SECOND GUARD Marching up to the prostrate body . Get that mouth out'n the dirt . Whirling on the CONVICTS . Dig ! Dig ! Who wants the little cat-tails ? p. 106 HENRY As his companions ' hum takes on a moaning wail . Mourners on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sterling . SECOND GUARD Getting a leather thong from his coat . Put a fire coal on his tail and rise him . MILLY Moaning . Mister ! Mister ! SECOND GUARD Stand back ! Great God ! Great God ! FIRST GUARD Gon na step to it , Sterling ? But STERLING makes no answer . He 's a stall boy . Hell , he 's stalling . SECOND GUARD This ai n't no party . FIRST GUARD Hell , it ai n't no party . The SECOND GUARD smoothes the thong with his hand and looks at the FIRST GUARD . WILLIE Shuddering in QUIVIENE 'S arms . Mis ' Quivie ! Mis ' Quivie ! HENRY **32;452;TOOLONG ! FIRST GUARD Make ' em work , that 's right . SECOND GUARD Work  --  work  --  that 's what he 's here for work . p. 107 FIRST GUARD Work  --  work  --  let him taste it . SECOND GUARD Raising the strap above his head . Thirty-nine , thirty-nine . His voice comes out stronger now , more sharply , strengthened by the strap in hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather poised without bringing it down . The bumming of the CONVICTS rises higher and louder with sorrow  --  full of hate also , full of its deep begging , but helpless withal . HENRY Suddenly beginning to sing as he wags his head and drives his pick deep into the earth . " They say their sister  --  hanh  --  They mean their sister  --  hanh  --  They call their sister  --  hanh  --  Eigh Lord . " FIRST GUARD Hold ' er a minute we 'll see , we 'll see . He goes up to STERLING and pokes him gently in the ribs with the muzzle of his rifle , but only the twitching back makes answer . SPORT WOMACK , BELLE UTLEY , FARROW and SEENY come down the alley . They stop terrified at what they see before them . SECOND GUARD Try him in the collar . He cuffs him gently in the collar , then with more insistence , at last with vehement roughness . A low whine , different from the CONVICT hum , is heard. p. 108 FIRST GUARD Bending down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what song is he singing now ? FIRST GUARD Do n't say nothing . Grunts and slobbers like an old steer . He do n't say nothing . MILLY Horror pouring from her breaking heart . Jesus ! Jesus ! SECOND GUARD By God , we 'll see !  --  Oh yes , he 'll talk . He 'll tell us a mouthful . The humming grows fuller , deeper-toned , and the rhythm begins to shape the picks , to hold the rising and the falling arms to their labor , UZZELL comes up in the background and stands by the corner of the house looking on . His face is sombre and brooding . BAD-EYE is with him . HENRY With a high call . Air , air , under this tight pot ! Singing . " They call their brother  --  hanh  --  They say their brother  --  hanh  --  They mean their brother  --  hanh  --  Eigh Lord . " UZZELL Joining in for an instant , his voice hoarse and tuneless . Eigh Lord . FIRST GUARD Shouting . Let him have it ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around the world as if for a witness of justification , begins to beat the prostrate figure . The humming of the CONVICTS now is a shuddering groan . They drive their picks deeper into the ground , but never any faster , never any slower. p. 109 HENRY Singing . " They say their mother  --  hanh  --  They call their mother  --  hanh  --  " SECOND GUARD Six-seven-eight-nine-ten  --  FIRST GUARD And now you 'll work  --  and I reckon you 'll work . SECOND GUARD Eleven  --  twelve  --  thirteen  --  fourteen  --  MILLY Falling on her knees and lifting her baby towards heaven . Mercy ! Mercy ! Blessed Jesus ! HENRY " They mean their mother  --  hanh  --  Eigh Lord . " And the watchers in the sky cry blood  --  blood . Hanh  --  cry  --  blood . Earth , earth , sweet earth receive it  --  hanh . Keep it , save it till the next harvest  --  hanh . FIRST GUARD Oh , yes , he 'll work , and I reckon he 'll work ! DOODLE , the water boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , stands a moment terror-stricken and then dropping his bucket with a clatter tears down the road . The NEGROES of the settlement stand huddled behind the house and in the alley . Their mourning song , much like the hum of the CONVICTS , is faintly heard coming from their throats. p. 110 HENRY Grave , grave , swallow them up , hide them away , till the next harvest , keep them .  --  Dig  --  dig  --  dig  --  dig hanh  --  SECOND GUARD Fifteen  --  sixteen  --  seventeen  --  eighteen  --  In a last burst of life STERLING staggers to his feet . FIRST GUARD Go to work  --  look out ! The SECOND GUARD turns to grab his rifle , but STERLING is upon him . The CONVICTS ' hum grows louder . HENRY Beat him to the earth  --  hanh  --  mash down the flowers . The golden rod is trampled down  --  hanh  --  the lady fingers broken and torn  --  Singing  --  and some of the CONVICTS suddenly begin to sing with him . " They call their father  --  hanh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal scream . Hah-hah-hah ! He beats the GUARD 'S upturned face with his fists . SECOND GUARD Kill him ! Kill him ! The hum grows still louder , a fresher triumphant note creeping into it . HENRY Interpreting it . Revenge . Revenge . Hope is not perished from them . Their arms are still strong . Singing  --  several of the CONVICTS now joining in with their choking voices . " They say their father  --  hanh  --  They mean their father  --  hanh  --  Eigh Lord . " p. 111 SECOND GUARD Kill him ! Kill him ! The FIRST GUARD stands stupefied . Then as if suddenly awakening , he steps back , raises his rifle and shoots STERLING through the back . He rolls over and lies with his face upturned in the burning sun . MILLY suddenly lets her arms with the crying baby drop to her lap and sits cold and still . Down the alleys the NEGROES are seen on their knees crushed and stupefied , their arms wrapped across their breasts , their heads bent down . The FIRST GUARD stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  --  sing on  --  beaten  --  darkness  --  night  --  God sits on high , his face from the Negro . The poor and needy cry in vain , the iron palings hold them  --  hanh ! The steel and the iron divide them  --  hanh ! FIRST GUARD The God-damned fool , he 's dead , dead ! SECOND GUARD Sitting up with a high laugh as he wipes the blood from his face . Had to kill him , we had to kill him ! Peering forward . Dead as a fly . Moaning . Something wrong . Wrong here . FIRST GUARD Sing , you bastards ! Dig , you sons of bitches ! HENRY Chanting . Moonlight , starlight all the singing , lay the po ' body down . Hear the fly say zoom . The buzzard roosting on the throne of God . And they sing , and they sing . Earth give answer ! Jesus hear them ! Shaking his great head savagely , sweeping his pick over the scene and driving it to the eye . Dig-dig-dig-hanh ! He steps boldly forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the CONVICTS have dug along the road half-way across the scene , HENRY always several steps ahead . The sinking sun illuminates their faces , faces set down the road and toward the sun as if it were a goal calling them on . The pleaders in the alley still bow on their knees , their hands beating the air , their faces too shining in the evening light . Their lips move , but now no sound is heard coming from them . Suddenly the SECOND GUARD bursts into loud sobs and flings himself down on his face in the grass . MILLY with her wailing baby in her arms drags her broken form over to STERLING 'S body and lays herself across it , pressing her silent lips against his face . UZZELL suddenly springs down into the road , seizes STERLING 'S pick , and takes his place next to HENRY. p. 112 UZZELL His voice bursting from his lips in a trumpet cry . Dig on the road to heaven ! Digging towards the sun ! SMITH Bowed on his knees , his face lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty throat . Dig on , dig on ! The people in the Valley take up his cry , and as HENRY leads the pleading CONVICTS into song again , they begin joining in . HENRY AND THE CONVICTS Singing . " They call their Jesus  --  hanh  --  They say their Jesus  --  hanh  --  " The lost and forlorn Potter 's Field people now begin coming out from behind the wreck of their houses and onto the road . POTTER 'S FIELD PEOPLE Some of them joining in the song . " They mean their Jesus , hanh  --  Eigh Lord ! " HENRY All the woodenness dropping from him as he moves before them swinging his pick . The merciful Jesus ! Leading the swelling chorus . " They call King Jesus  --  hanh  --  " And now the pleaders of the valley begin falling in behind the CONVICTS , and HENRY moves ahead as he digs and he digs , as if leading them on  --  down the infinite stretch of road ahead. p. 113 PEOPLE OF THE VALLEY More loudly still , with their rising song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SECOND GUARD springs out into the road before them . Flinging up his arms , he screams . SECOND GUARD Stop it ! stop it ! But the CONVICTS dig impassively on and on , never any slower , never any faster . And they sing and they sing . CONVICTS AND PEOPLE Ever more loudly . " They mean King Jesus , hanh  --  Eigh Lord ! " A radiant light from the setting sun begins to spread over Potter 's Field , illuminating everything , even the flat senseless body of MILLY lying upon her love . And the CONVICTS dig impassively on , never any slower , never any faster , their faces set toward the beckoning goal.
