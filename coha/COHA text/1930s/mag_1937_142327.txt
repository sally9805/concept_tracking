LIVING CHINA-Edited by Edgar Snow - Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $2.50 ) . <P> In China , biggest and oldest civilized country in the world , few people can read and write . Of those few , many fewer know the " correct , " classical language , in which all Chinese masterpieces have been written , time out of mind . In 1917 , when China 's civilization began to come rapidly apart , plain speech ( pai-hua began to be literarily respectable , is now the accepted written language for China 's literates . To give a sample of what present-day Chinese are reading , Journalist Edgar Snow last week published a translation of 24 pai-hua stories . <P> Since China has been heaving with revolution for the past 20 years , the great majority of these stories have social upheaval for their background . Most of the authors are Leftwing ; many have been shot or imprisoned . Their names , well-known in China , will be mostly just queer names to U. S. readers : Lu Hsn , Jou Shih , Ting Ling , T'ien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lin Y-t'ang ( My Country and My People , but Lu Hsn , " China 's Chekhov , " and Mao Tun , " perhaps the outstanding novelist of China today , " will be new acquaintances . <P> Editor Snow admits his translations are very free , admits also that he has freely used his blue pencil , because even pai-hua is too discursive for occidental taste . Open-eyed readers of Living China will find these stories queerly human , may be surprised to find many of them bitter , strong , ironic stuff . Because they are written in pai-hua , China 's national cussword appears frequently . A mild-seeming expression , " his mother 's " ( shortened form of " rape your mother " ) is apparently used to express any shade of any emotion . <P> Some of the stories : <P> Because it is well known that a dose of fresh human blood is a sovereign specific against consumption , an old tea- house keeper goes to an execution , gets a roll saturated in blood for his dying son . But the son dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their sons are lying next each other . <P> An older brother , in a fit of older-brotherishness , wrecks his little brother 's kite . Remorse pursues him ; when they are both grown men he finally nerves himself to ask forgiveness . The younger brother has forgotten all about it . <P> To save himself and his son from starvation , a poor man leases his wife for three years to a childless rich man . She fulfills the contract , bears the rich man a son , then returns to her poverty , her heart torn between her two children . <P> An old woman , hearing the young people talk revolution , and understanding only that " they " ( the Communists ) are goodhearted , will take care of everybody , gets her old cronies together , makes a revolutionary flag to send " them . " <P> When a village girl is caught in the act of love , her mother spends everything they have on a feast for the local big men , hoping that they will then commute her daughter 's sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes off to starve while her penniless mother stays home .
