txt In the fear that publication might cause trouble in Cuba , part of a letter from the files of the Chase National Bank , containing a confidential report on the financial embarrass-. ment of President Machado 's regime in the Fall of 1932 , was suppressed today by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee investigating banking practices . The decision followed a hurried consultation between the committee and Winthrop W. Aldrich , president of the Chase National , after Senator Goldsborough had moved the adoption of a suggestion by Ferdinand Pecora that certain portions of the letter not be included in the public record but be considered by the committee in executive session . Mr. Pecora said he thought the last paragraph of the letter should not be read because " I think it might lead to acts of violence in Cuba . " Later in the afternoon another . letter from the Chase Bank files was suppressed in its entirety , Mr. Pecora 's only explanation being that the communication " related to the bookkeeping of the bank . " Charges Cabinet With " Graft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was ' spread on the record , however , and with other letters from the Chase files dealing mainly with the increasingly difficult situation confronting the bztn4 in its relations with the Machado government , : presented interesting revelations , some bordering on the sensational . One asserted that $18,000,000 had unnecessarily been spent on the Cuban Capitol , and charged that I members of the Machado Cabinet " all have a big graft in this Havana water works proposition . " Another said that President Machado had reduced the army budget $1,000,000 to " keep up the debtpaying reputation of Cuba and of himself " with the Chase Bank . Others referred to former Ambassador Guggenheim 's displeasure over some aspects of the Cuban financial situation . Still another revealed that after his appointment as Ambassador to Cuba , Sumner Welles , while en route to his post at Havana last May , conferred with Chase officials in New York and obtained an " outline " of the Machado government 's financial position . He appeared " rather stand-offish , " however , and " not inclined to take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This letter was written May 3 , 1933 , ' by Adam K. Geiger , a vice president , to T. M. Findlay , assistant manager of the Chase National 's Havana office , and read in part : " Mr. Welles was in the office yesterday and talked with Mr. Aldrich , Mr. Morgan , Mr. Rosenthall and myself . " Rosenthal/ gave Mr. Welles quite a bit of background and in response to Mr. Weiles 's questions outlined as nearly as any one can outline the present financial position of the government . Mr. Welles did not , however , Indicate to us just what is in his mind with respect to Cuba , but in closing the interview we suggested that.our Havana office would be very happy to be of any assistance possible to him . He accepted this suggestion and stated that he expected to avail himself of our information and service . " This note is to tell you of the meeting and to say that you may put yourself on a confidential basis with Mr. Welles . Shortly after his arrival it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meet Mr. Welles and again offer your services . " We have been unable to find a complete- record of Mr. Welles to furnish you . He is a career man and is very highly spoken of as being most capable . For your strictly personal and confidential information , he impresses us as being rather standoffish in his attitude and not inclined to take any one into his c8nfidence . He may , therefore , , be somewhat difficult to . get on an entirely satisfactory basis With , but I am quite sure that you will , be able . to establish friendly relations . " Did Not Come for " Instructions . " Turning to Mr. Geiger , Senator Couzens asked : " Do you knew why Mr. Welles called ' on your people in New York ? " " No , sir , I do not , " Mr. Geiger replied . " I met him there in the office . " " He did not come to get instructions ? " Senator Couzens inquired . " Not from us , " the witness answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing Shepard Morgan , a Chase National vice president , asked : " Now , have you in your files and records , Mr. Morgan , a memorandum signed by ' L. C. R. , ' who , I take it , is L. C. Rosenthall , dated June 3 , 1933 , relating to the Cuban loan situation , bearing the identification number of 61.17 ? " Mr. Morgan stepped over to Mr. Aldrich , both conferred with Mr. Pecora and members of the Senate committee , those present being Chairman Fletcher and Senators Couzens - and Goldsborough , and the " L. C. R. " memo was withheld from record . To whom it was written was not revealed . Mr. Rosenthall is a Chase National vice president . No further allusion to this letter was made . The first letter introduced from the Chase National files was from James Bruce , former vice president , at Havana , July 17 , 1930 , to Messrs . Freeman , Callahan , Batchelder and Panthan of the bank . It read , in part : " There is no question but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there is only one boss . I met all of the Cabinet , . and they are all rubber staWSficir the chief , with the posst1g4 ... ap , tion of CespediSpdinistetiftgall , ' Works ) */* ? : Nirthits to speti.d'illf the money ' he can possibly extract from us or any other credit givers . " He ? was not content only with having spent $18,000,000 unnecessarily on the capitol , but had in mind building a large legal centre at government expense , of which the chief item was to be an institute of international law , costing $1,000,000 . " Also his ideas for the Havana waterworks and paving have risen from ' an ' estimated cost of $18,000 , - 000 up to $40,000,000 . The American Ambassador is putting up a stiff opposition to any further waste of money . " After somewhat of a struggle , on which Mr. Guggenheim put a good deal of pressure , they have their budgetrof this year just about balanced . I do - not think that We should ' make : aily advance of any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their future financial program , and particularly so long as Cespedes is Minister of Public Works . Fears " Dumping " of Bonds . " For instance , if he carries out certain ideas which he now has , of paying contractors in Cuban bonds for work they do on the Havana waterworks , as Havana will become in a few months a Federal district , it would only mean that these bonds would be ' dumped ba. %k on the American market add would have a very bad effect on the bonds which we had already placed or might place . ' " The ' various members - of the Cabinet were ' very careful not to discuss with me this Havana waterworks proposition , because naturally they all have a big graft in it , and what they , would like to do is lo " get our money- first for building the highway and then it would be eady for them to pay for the . other in obligations of various kinds , thereby impairing their own credit . " The worst- thing we could do would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in entire control of their capital expenditures for a reasonable time . I think this would be very welcome , both by Mr. Guggenheim and the State Department . We may have more trouble in forcing this issue , as the government now has approximately $18,000,000 in cash and foreign bills , and can probably run along for another six months . " Tammany Enters the Inquiry . Mr. Rosenthal ! , testifying later , was asked by Mr. Pecora what he thought of Mr. Bruce 's " reference to graft . " " Mr. Bruce went to Havana and stayed eight or ten days , " Mr. Rosenthall testified . " I do not think Bruce 's letter was based on facts in many instances . It could not have been . It was his impressions after being down there , hearing conversations around various places and then he wrote thatletter as a result of that . " Q. ? Did any one connected with the bank in New York get in touch with you about any of those . comments of Bruce to find out froin. you , view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all the , time , - whether any of those observations of Bruce were flights of imagination or based on facts ? A. ? I do : not recall that they did , " although I do . think they were the usual thing a person might write after being - there  --  a few days and ' talking to people in general around . Q. ? You mean that was in the atmosphere down there , so that even a visitor for a few days would get the notion that graft was quite prevalent in all the public works ? A.=No . I do n't think that . Senator Couzens ? I know it would not be as bad as Tammany . Mr. Rosenthall ? Oh , I do n't think that . Mr. Pecora ? I am a judge of Tammany . But I promised not to campaign here , Senator , so I will not go any further . Machado Tells of Pressure . The suppressed paragraph which it was feared might lead to acts of violence in Cuba was contained in a letter dated Nov. 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Havana , to Vice President Rosenthall , in New York . It told of Mr. Findlay 's conference with Machado relative to the bank 's proposal to advance Cuba $1,650,000 to be used in paying the Dec. 31 gold bond coupons and the interest on the bankers ' credit , this advance to be guaranteed with a tax of 10 cents a bag on sugar . " As soon as this plan was outlined to the General , " Mr. Findlay wrote in part , " we could see he was very much displeased with it . We could see that trouble was brewing . He said he could not understand why the bank did not feel a moral obligation to him and to his government , and also to the investors who had purchased securities sponsored by the Chase . - " He said he is making superhuman efforts to meet his obligations with the Case , that he is holding everything down with an iron hand , starving government employes and is confronting tremendous opposition , not only from his opponents but even his own followers who advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the foreign obligations and devote the entire government income to local needs . " He advised that he was preparing to balance the budget , that a reduction of $6,000,000 had been agreed upon . A million dollars of this is taken from the army appropriation , and he said that he had convinced the high officials of the army that this was necessary in order to keep up the debt-paying reputation of Cuba and of himself with the Chase bank and that it had been constant pull on his part . " To be forced to admit publicly that.he is unable to obtain what- he promised leaves him in a frightfully embarrassing situation . He said that unless the bank could give him the $4,000,000 he requested that there was nothing to do but go into a complete and total default and that he had no objection to doing so ' immediately . " Attitude on Silver Coinaire . William H. Eddy , vice ' president of the Chase Securities Corporation , in a memorandum Sept. 23 , 1930 , from Havana to President H. G. Freeman of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the State Department in Washington is somewhat different now than formerly , especially in view of the proposed investigation by the commission of which Grosvenor Jones may be the American representative , " adding that Cuba " is up against a serious financial situation and needs money badly . " Mr. Eddy reported on June 12 , 1931 , that Ambassador Guggenheim " felt ' it ' was highly important that the Chase discuss the financial situation with the President during the coming week " and that Mr. Guggenheim insisted that every effort should be made to induce Cuba to reduce expenses to meet revenues . Mr. Morgan , Chase vice president , on March 24 , 1933 , telegraphed to Assistant Manager Findlay at Havana to inform Secretary Averhoff of the Cuban Treasury that " we feel strongly that moratorium on foreign debt should be avoided " and that " any benefits to be deTived from moratorium would be far out of proportion to the ' . disastrous effect on Cuban credit . " Mr. Findlay made known that Secretary Averhoff had replied that he has public employes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind in theirvi4salaries , " and to continue that " uld mean a complete breakdown in the functioning of the most important governmental activities . " Mr. Findlay , on March 30 , 1933 , reported to Mr. Morgan that he had interviewed Ambassador Guggenheim before the latter , after resigning , left for the North by plane . Whitney Sees President . " I do not think he the Ambassador fully approved of all our past transactions , " Mr. Findlay said , " and he said he had spoken with Mr. Aldrich last Summer and had remarked that some of the measures taken were , in his estimation , merely makeshifts . " During examination of Mr. Morgan , who was questioned most of the day on details of Chase National 's Cuban financing from 1930 to date , Mr. Pecora developed that the total profits to all who had participated in the bank 's Cuban financing from 1927 to 1933 amounted to $3,091,023.56 . Mr. Morgan said that the total commissions paid to the Chase National and its securities affiliates during this period were $596,252.34 , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " on $80,000,000 worth of financing managed primarily by us and in many cases recurrent . " ? The inquiry into Cuban financing closed this afternoon . Tomorrow the committee will resume its examination of Albert H. Wiggin concerning the operation of trading accounts in Chase National - shares and also concerning transactions of the Shermar Corporation , a Wiggin family institution . Richard V. Whitney , president of the New York Stock Exchange , spent forty-five minutes with President Roosevelt today . Afterward he would not discuss his visit .
