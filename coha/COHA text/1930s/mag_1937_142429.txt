Last autumn Transcontinental &; Western Air infuriated its two major rivals , United and American Airlines , by cutting its fares about to railroad levels ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) . TWA took this risky step for two reasons : to counteract the usual traffic slump in winter and to counterbalance the fact that both United and American temporarily had more luxurious equipment . American got the first Douglas DC-3 sleepers last year , did not dare put an extra fare on them in the face of TWA 's cuts . United , however , did add a $2 surcharge for the non-stop run from Newark to Chicago which it inaugurated two months ago on the Skylounge DC-3 , which has 14 swivel chairs instead of the usual 21 fixed seats ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) . Meanwhile TWA got along with the three-year-old model , 14-passenger DC-2 's , gradually found that its fare cuts had been too drastic . <P> In a month . TWA will have the first of its DC-3 's and the three transcontinental airlines will again be on a par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to compromise the rate war , profit by each other 's experiments . United and American agreed to lower their rates half as far as did TWA last year . TWA will now raise its rates to that level . In addition , the three lines agreed to set up the first rate structure in air transport history with three distinct classes of travel corresponding to railroad sleepers , chair-cars and day-coaches . As of May 1 , the basic transcontinental fare will be $149.95. * This will buy a seat in a standard DC2 or DC-3 . An extra fare of $4 will buy a swivel chair in a deluxe DC-3 , while $8 will buy a berth . For shorter flights the extra fares will be less . Holders of scrip tickets will still get a 15% reduction . <P> <P> *TWA has been charging $139-95 , United and American $160.
