' , CC ) cpi69 Cc ct G THE CATALOGUES A STORY BY GEORGE MILBURN catalogues came in one August afternoon on the 5:45 . The 5:45 stayed at the depot twelve minutes , eleven minutes longer than usual . The postal clerk had all the mail bags ricked up in front of the mail-coach door , but it took eleven minutes to load the catalogues on Five-finger Earp 's truck . The conductor stood by with a big gold watch in his hand , timing them . The catalogues did not come in without forewarning . About a month earlier Postmaster Shannon had received the mail order companies ' long , purple-printed rolls of names and addresses for correction . Montgomery Ward had made him a gift of their 845B6455 Gold Bond fountain pen with his name stamped on it , and Sears Roebuck had sent him their 18K18e2A genuine steerhide billfold with his name in gold for his courtesy in correcting the mailing lists . It was a favor that Postmaster Shannon was glad to do anyway . It saved time and work to have few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon knew that the Fall-and-Winter catalogues were to be expected any day , and the R.F.D. carriers knew that there was no getting round the catalogue delivery , and all the postoffice patrons were waiting eagerly for their new catalogues , it was surprising and exciting to have the catalogues come . Thatmuch mail came only once a year . The Christmas rush was nothing to compare with it . The Spring-andSlimmer catalogues were thinner and lighter . That year the Sears Roebuck and the Montgomery Ward catalogues all came in on the same mail . That was extraordinary . It made an even bigger load than usual . When the mail clerk heaved the last squared bag out onto the great gray stack in Fivefinger Earp 's truck , the grumpy little conductor stopped chewing his white mustache , snapped his watch lid to , and threw up his gold-braided arm to give the high ball . The throbbing locomotive let off two blasts , spewed a low fog of steam , and the three-coach train began moving out at once . The conductor swung himself up on the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed out two thin lock pouches that held the first-class mail and Fivefinger Earp , who had only one hand , caught them deftly by their leather-strapped necks . Fivefinger walked round toward the front of his truck and tossed the two lock pouches in on the ruptured oilcloth cab seat as Harry Conklin , the Katy depot agent , a sallow little man with a stringhalt step , came out of the sanded-paint green depot with a telegram in his hand . Harry slid the door of the freight house to , snapped the lock , and started off down the cinder platform . That ought to be a big enough mail to suit you , Fivefinger , " Harry said loudly , pausing by the truck . Fivefinger Earp bent his neck and lighted a cigarette . " Yeowp , I 'll say it is , " he said . " Monkey Ward catalogues . " " Well , that 's a load of ' em , all right . But it still ai n't nothing like it was before they put in these here hard-surface roads . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel bus he used to have to make two or three trips to get ' em over to town . " " Nawp , I do n't guess they 're putting out as many of the big ones as they used to . Mr. Shannon tells me that they 're putting out more of these here little special catalogues ever ' so often . But it sure looks like these here would be enough to keep ever'body in strikin ' paper for a while , do n't it ? " Fivefinger Earp grinned slowly and Harry Conklin tittered . " How many you estimate you got on there ? " " Better than a ton , I reckon . " " I mean , how many catalogues ? " " Well , let 's see . I 'd have to do some figuring to tell you . Them Number 2 slip pouches will hold 20 catalogues each . I counted 26 Number 2 's . That 'd he 20 times 26 is ? " " Four hunderd and  --  No ! Forgot to carry my one . Five hunderd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 3 pouches . Them holds ten each . Ten times nine is ninety . That 's clang near a thousand catalogues ! " " Six hunderd and ten , I make it . " " Yeowp . I guess that 's right . You headed for town ? Git in and I 'll carry you over . " The depot agent climbed into the truck cab and turned on the switch . " I got a telegram going over to Double S Winston 's , " he said . " That ornery Tom of his is wiring home for money again . " Fivefinger Earp reached down and twirled the Ford crank . The engine gave three phlegmy pants . Fivefinger came around and put it on the magneto . " Goose her for me , " he said . Harry Conklin pulled out the choker wire and Fivefinger Earp spun the crank again and the engine banged . Black smoke rose up around the quivering mound of dingy , ridged mail sacks as the Ford truck ground out of the gravelled depot yard in low . The Conchartee County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press . R. W. E. ( " Swede " ) Ledbetter , its energetic editor , was helping Red Currie , the linotyper , bolt the forms in the flatbed press . Hot August sunlight was striking in through two grimy back windows , and the rear of the Democrat shop was like an oven . Editor Ledbetter , holding his blackened hands spread away , dabbing with his elbow , kept trying to push his hemp-colored forelock up from over his sweat-sticky spectacles . Red Currie had just pied the Whipple Mercantile Company 's quarter-page ad , and R. W. E. Ledbetter had almost reached the end of his patience . Waldo Ledbetter , Junior , came dashing in at the front door , waggling a red gasoline can , his short bare legs thumping against the over-large , ink-stiffened canvas apron he wore . Gasoline was sloshing out of the metal spout as lie ran . A black smear streaked one side of Waldo 's startled , wide-eyed face . " Gosh , papa ! " he cried shrilly as soon as he was in the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Ledbetter jumped and dropped the key with which he had been tightening a form . " Do n't holler at your papa like that ! " he shouted . " You ought to have better sense . " " But , gee whiz , papa , just go take a look at the load of mail they 're bringing over from the depot . About a million bags of mail . They got such a big load they 're stalled out in front . " Red Currie went on tightening a lug . Editor Ledbetter poked at his pale forelock with an elbow and yelled , " You git on back yonder and finish cleaning that job press like I told you to ! " Waldo Junior moved off slowly . " Yes , but papa , a whole truck load filled up with mail . It 'd make a piece for the paper . " " If you do n't quit running in here storying to me , I aim to cut me a hickory and wear you out ! I 'll break you of that lying habit if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor bawled . He stamped his feet toward his small son . Waldo hurried on back to the job press , his smudged face puckering . " Papa , I 'm telling you the truth this time , honest I am , " he whimpered . " If you do n't believe there 's about a thousand sacks of mail coming in today , just look out front and you 'll see . " Editor Ledbetter turned and looked toward the front windows . He could see the truck standing there in the street . A dozen men were clustered round it . He sauntered up to the front door , stretching his neck to get a better look . Then he went outside . " What you 'd ought to do , Five-finger , " an onlooker was saying , " is turn around and back ' cr up . She 'll take that grade in reverse . " " If he 'd coast back and get a little start on it , he could make it easy . This here Broadway grade ai n't sich steep grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , boys ? " the editor called pleasantly . " The catalogues have come in ! " one man shouted . " A whole truck load full of Monkey Ward catalogues ! " " Sears-Sawbuck catalogues . Earp 's truck mint make the grade , he 's got on sich a heavy load . " " Swede , you 'll have to give this here a write-up in The Weekly Struggle . " " Yeowp , I guess we 'll have to ! " Editor Ledbetter said , scowling at the load of mail . Back in the shop he heard Red Currie starting the gasoline engine . Above the explosions came the wheeze of the flatbed press . He turned and walked in briskly . " Hold it , Red , hold it ! " he shouted above the noise . " We got ta rip out that front page ! Stop it and tear ' er out ! I 've got a Page One Must editorial to stick in there . Two columns , 14-point , spread right down the center of the front page ! start shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy God , we ai n't never going to get this rag out , " Red Currie said sullenly , killing the engine . Before the flatbed press had stopped gasping Editor Ledbetter was at his desk , rigid forefingers stabbing at the keyboard of his dusty green Oliver . The pyramidal type bars clattered down on the ragged purple ribbon TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF CONCHARTEE 'S TRADE TERRITORY Once more there has arrived at the Conchartee Post Office a whole truck load of mail-order catalogues . This constitutes the Kansas City and Chicago mail order concerns ' bid fur your Fall and Winter trade . You will see in these catalogues split-penny prices printed in big type with the actual higher prices printed down below in small type . You will read the prevaricating , highly exaggerated descriptions of merchandise . DO Nom tzr THEM FOOL YOU . Before you send off one red cent to these foreign concerns , the Conchartee County Democrat wants to ask you a few questions . Then if you think you can go ahead and send your money off to these companies without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT . But when you discover that you have gotten " STUNG " do not say that you did not have fair warning . Now just ask yourself : Who helps to support your ministers of the Gospel , helps to keep up your churches , lodges , etc. ? Who does their part in paying taxes to support your roads , schools , law enforcement , etc. ? Who has worked and slaved to build up this town so as you would have a market for your produce , etc. ? Who pays cash for your cotton , corn , cattle , hogs , poultry , etc. ? Who pays highest prices cash or trade for your butter , eggs , hides , etc. , and all country produce ? Who hires Conchartee County labor ? Who gives you credit for food and clothing when you are waiting for your crop to come in and have not got the cash to buy with ? Is it a K.C. m.o . company ? USE YOUR THINK TANK ! Your HOME TOWN MERCHANT is the only one that does all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage by patronizing HOME INDUSTRY ? Did your HOME TOWN MERCHANT ever show you a picture and make you read a mess of fancy description and then ask you to buy " a pig in the poke " the way these mail order companies do ? If you feel like you can answer these questions honestly by sending your money off to the millionaires of KANSAS CITY and CHICAGO , go right ahead . Do n't let " ye ed " stop you . But then do not come bellyaching around about hard times here in Conchartee County when you have helped cripple your HOME TOWN by mailing off your money to fill the larders of some rich man 1000 miles away . KEEP HOME TOWN MONEY AT HOME ! Nuf Sed ! " I wish we could do a red-ink job on it , that 's what I wish we could do , " It W. E. Ledbetter muttered , pulling the second page out of his typewriter . " But we ai n't got time for the extra run . " A town can have two or three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . It can have two or three general stores , two or three filling stations , two or three hardware stores , two or three meat markets , two or three barber shops , but they do n't make towns big enough to have more than one post office . " What kind of price you all got on two-cent stamps to-day , Mr. Shannon ? " they say , slapping a coin down at the stamp window . " Five for a dime to-day , Harve . " " ' Y goddie , if I do n't reckon I 'm going to have to start me another post office in this town yit ! What this here post office needs is a little competition ! " Then they both laugh , because it is a joke that nobody ever gets tired of . They know that there could not be more than one post office in town . And only one man at a time can be postmaster . That afternoon Postmaster Shannon sat at his desk beside the broad front window , waiting for the 5:45 mail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock , and the stamp window , the general delivery window , the money order window , the parcel post window , all were closed . One of the Jerks was checking up on the stamps . Postmaster Shannon was running up the money order receipts on his desk adding machine . The 5:45 had whistled out twenty minutes before . The postmaster had a feeling that the catalogues had come in , but he did n't say anything . " Earp certainly is late to-night , " Gladys Ferguson said at the stamp drawer . " He must of had a breakdown with that old truck of his . " Then Postmaster Shannon heard the noise . He looked out the plate-glass window and saw the loaded truck struggling toward the alley that led to the back door of the post office . " Yonder come the catalogues , " he said calmly to the clerks . Gladys Ferguson stopped counting stamps . Elvira Draper dropped the tweezers with which she had been changing the date in the wooden-handled steel canceler . They both came running to the big front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mail sacks heave past and out of sight into the alleyway . Gladys looked at Elvira and Elvira looked at Gladys . Their mouths gaped for a moment and their faces went blank with surprise . " Ah-o-ouh ! " they groaned together in elaborate dismay . Then they began shrieking with laughter and fell into each other 's arms . " I suppose we had better stay and separate them to-night , " Postmaster Shannon said . " But we wo n't put the notices in the boxes until to-morrow . That 'll keep them from pestering us in the morning while we 're separating the first-class mail and getting the newspapers up . Get the rural routes separated to-night , too , and the carriers can start taking them out right away . " Fivefinger Earp clanged open the steel-barred back door and walked in dragging a half-filled slipcord sack and carrying the two lock pouches . He slapped the lock pouches down on the worn separating table and grinned sheepishly . " I sure enough brought you some mail to-night , " he said . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This here is the Tribune sack . Three packages of parcel post . All the rest is catalogues . " Fivefinger went on out and unfastened the end gate on his truck . He hoisted one sack up on his right shoulder and pulled off another sack with his hand . Carrying one and dragging one , he went back and forth , and the gray stack grew in the rear of the post office . Gladys Ferguson reached in the locks drawer and pulled out the master key at the end of its long brass chain and quickly unlocked the two pouches . She shook out about a dozen letter ties . Elvira , Draper slipped the cord on the other sack and dumped out two bundles of Tulsa Tribunes . She tossedone bundle into a lock bin for Blind Lund , the news agent . She ripped the wrapping off the other bundle and held the opened roll curving in one arm while she walked along the honeycombed inner side of the partition , mechanically stuffing newspapers into lock boxes . " I wish Slemmons had been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wo n't he howl , though ! He claims that Route Four gets twice as many catalogues as any of the others . " " Last year he took two weeks getting shut of his . " " Well , he 'll have to get ' em out quicker this year , " the postmaster said crisply . " Nothing causes patrons to complain like having their catalogues delayed . They 'd rather miss their newspapers . " Postmaster Shannon sat on a stool separating the first-class mail . He flipped the R. F. D. letters up into five pigeonholes and the town letters into a larger box . The clerks kept taking away handfuls , dealing them expertly without looking at the box labels . " Slemmons 'll have to have a truck , " Elvira Draper said . " Oh , no , " Postmaster Shannon said . " He can get a lot of catalogues in the back of that flivver of his . It should n't take him more than two trips to clean up his pile . " " Ah , Mr. Shannon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until to-morrow ? Me and Gladys can get them separated to-morrow afternoon when things is slack . " " No , sir-ee ! You and Gladys go on to supper if you want to . I 'll stay and separate the catalogues . The Democrats ' 11 be coming in to-morrow and we 'll have plenty to do to get them up . Meanwhile the patrons will be here faunching for their Fall-and-Winter catalogues , and I do n't propose to have the patrons disappointed . " He did not talk loudly enough for the townspeople , milling outside in the lobby , to hear . The three voices , muffled by the blank-windowed partition , came as the mysterious murmuring of an oracle . Shoes scuffed on the cement floor , tobacco spit rustled in wastepaper baskets , throats were cleared , fingers drummed on the wooden desk shelf , but there was little talk . People were too nervous with expectation . Now and then , when a bit of white flicked in a lock box , one of them would stop pacing and step up to twiddle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small door to . Or another would stop reading the afternoon paper and stoop to peer through a glass panel in an empty lock box with the door left ajar . Meanwhile , at the back of the post office , in and out , in and out , went Fivefinger Earp . One sack gritting across the concrete floor , one sack thudding down from his shoulder , the gray pile growing . " Mr. Shannon , you got ary a Mon'gom'ry Wand catalogue there for me ? " ? " Not yet , Mrs. Tinsley . Wo n't be distributed till morning . " " Mr. Shannon , I was aimin ' to go to Telsy to-morrow morning , first thing , and I was wonderin ' if I could git my catalogue to-night ? " " Catalogues ' re still in the sacks , Ira . It 'll take us some while to get them unsacked , let alone sorted . " Wilbur S. Winston , the richest man in town , came walking into the post office lobby behind his paunch , walking with great dignity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He went over and turned the combination on the Conchartee National Bank 's lock drawer and took out a large sheaf of mail and the afternoon paper . He glanced at the headlines and then took out his watch . " Mail all up , Mr. Shannon ? " he asked gruffly . " All up , Mr. Winston . " Double S Winston followed his belly out of the post office . One by one the other townspeople followed Banker Winston . It was a ritual . Every night , as soon as it was apparent that the mail was all up , when there was no longer any sound of letters clicking into lock boxes , Wilbur S. Winston , on the outside , asked " Mail all up ? " and Postmaster Shannon , on the inside , said , " All up . " Then , filing out slowly , one by one , everyone followed Double S Winston out of the post office . Only the dogged Ira Rogers stayed on that night , waiting for his catalogue . He could hear the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slip-pouch cords , the pellmell thumps of the catalogues falling out of the sacks on the separating table , the swish and sough of empty sacks flapping down on their neat flat pile . He heard the voices droning : " All this sack for Route Five . " " All this sack for Route Three . " " All this sack for town . " " Is C. R. Butts still on Route One ? " " C. R. Butts gets his general delivery now . " " James R. Sloat ; what become of him ? " " Moved to Yellville , Arkansas , two weeks ago . " Thin dust floated up back of the partition , softening the electric glare , making milky little moons of the unshaded light bulbs . About eight o'clock Postmaster Shannon walked up to the front and snapped back the Yale lock on the partition door . " Here 's your Sears ' catalogue , Ira , and here 's your Ward 's , " he said dryly . Ira Rogers , peering past the postmaster , saw five square brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks and , on the floor near the separating table , a long low rank of hard-packed edges , showing , between broad layers of gray , the colored inserts , bright stripes of yellow and orange and green and pink . The catalogues looked very compact , all tightly bound in their manila paper slip-covers . The next Tuesday , after everyone had finished his small dipper of banana-nut icc cream and slice of pound cake , up at the head table Albert T. Kimball , Lions Club president and proprietor of the Sanitary Barber Shop , hummed to give the other boys the pitch and started them off on their club anthem , " Roar , Lions , Roar . " Then they sang " Pack Up Your Troubles " and a comic after-luncheon favorite about Mary , who ate some johnny cake , ham , oysters , jam , and a number of other things , each thing she ate making a verse . All of the Lions tried hard to keep from laughing when they joined in on the final stanza : up came the johnny cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a verse at a time , that they had sung about Mary 's having eaten in the first stanza . After that song everyone was laughing and in good humor . Harve Whipple tried to start a necktie pulling . But before many ties had been yanked Al Kimball stood up and made his empty water glass ring by tapping it with his knife . " Boys , " he said , as soon as everyone had quit scuffling , " to-day we are going to hear a message from R. W. E. , better known by his alias of ' Swede ' Ledbetter , our popular publisher . Now if ye ed ' will kindly get up I 'll let him speak for himself which will be better than me talking for him . How about giving Swede a hand , boys ? " Al Kimball started clapping his hands and the other Lions joined in riotously . Everyone was chuckling and grinning , but when R. W. E. Ledbetter stood up he was not smiling . His long pink cheeks were set and his eyes were serious back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushing back his hempen forelock , " I guess you have allheard that poem about where a certain community in the olden times was so infested with rats that nobody could n't hardly live in it . So the town dads calls in a fellow to rid out the rats , and it seems like this fellow claimed to be able to get them out , I mean the rats out , by playing music on his pipes and had made quite a rep for himself , being reputed far and wide as the Pied Piper of Hamburg . Well , I do n't know as this has got much to do with what I 'm going to say . But I was reminded of it , because if you boys do n't dub me the Pied Piper of Conchartee ( Laughter ) when I get done outlining this proposition I have worked out in the interests of this town , I 'm going to be mighty disappointed , and uh --  " The point I am making is , I guess you all know that the plague of Monkey Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again this year . Now anyone who read my editorial in last week 's Democrat will appreciate my attitude on this subject . " Men , year Erfter year we are confronted with this situation of our farmers ' and fellow-citizens ' money being milked out of our trade territory . It seems to me like , as I look back on it now , we have been taking this tough situation laying down and thus far have not done anything about it . Oh , yes : we have tried to hock the mail order companies by making fun of them and talking about the shoddy goods they put out , and so on . But what effect does that have ? Men , I think it was about time something actually was done to correct this situation of Kansas City and Chicago mail order firms taking this business right nut from under our noses and  --  and uh  --  taking thousands of dollars out of our trade territory , and , and so forth . " Boys , there is nothing like a little gray matter applied to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Arthur Brisbane , who makes fifty thousand dollars a year , the highest-paid editorial writer in the world , has said , ' It takes a combination of four G 's to put anything across : Gumption plus Grit plus Git-Upand-GO ' ( Laughter and Applause . ) Well , there is this to be said : I think this scheme of mine has the Gumption . Now all we need is the Grit and Git-Up-and-Go to counteract a tough situation . " Just to be brief , my idea is to get hold of every one of these mail order catalogues that came in here last week and get them out of circulation . Absolutely destroy them . That is the one and only way we can manage to keep home-town money at home . " Now I see some of you looking doubtful already , and you 're probably going to ask me : ' O.K. , Swede ; but how 're you figuring to put this proposition through to final completion ? ' Boys , right there is where the Home Town Industry Jubilee and Bonfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for this scheme . " Last Friday afternoon when I saw that truckload of mail order catalogues coming in , I says to myself , R. W. E. , that is just like a truckload of pests being brought in to be turned loose on the community . ' And then I said to myself , If the State was able to almost rid this country of coyotes by paying a bounty for coyote pelts , why could not the merchants of this town work the same scheme and get rid of mail order catalogues ? ' Now the mail order firms claim that it costs them better than a dollar apiece to get those big catalogues out . I do n't doubt it a bit , because I know printing prices . " So what I want ever ' merchant in town to do is agree to pay one dollar in trade for each one of these catalogues that is brought in to them . Do n't worry about whether the country people 'll bring ' em in . Just depend on me for that . By working fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can clean up ever ' single one of the six hundred catalogues , which I understand was the number shipped in here , in two weeks ' time . We ca n't take a day longer , because ever ' day means just that much more money being drained out of our trade territory . And to keep from causing any ill-will among the country folks , we end up on the deadline set for bringing in the catalogues by having a big Home Town Industry celebration with a big bonfire made out of the catalogues . " Now all I want to know is , are you boys with me with the Grit and GetUp-and-Go to put this proposition over ? " R. W. E. Ledbetter sat down , and there was loud applause . Then there was a moment 's silence until Flarve Whipple said , " What about financing the proposition , Swede ? A proposition like that would need some financing . " Two or three men who had been looking dubious nodded their heads and said , " Yeah , what about the finances , Swede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Harve " the editor said , springing to his feet and pulling a folded sheet of paper out of his hip pocket . " Now about taking in the catalogues . Some merchants , of course , will get more , some less , depending on the number of customers he has . But with every business in town that stands to lose by mail order competition lined up on this  --  no reason why a single merchant should hold out  --  we 'll have Q0 businesses taking catalogues in trade . This would make each take in around 30 catalogues , more or less , and $30 is not going to break anybody up . More especially $30 in trade , which you can figure as representing between $15 and $20 actual outlay at wholesale . All this you can count on coming back tenfold with your increase in business when you get shed of the catalogues . " Now here I have a two-page advertising layout . Down the center runs a full explanation of the Home Town Industry Jubilee , explaining in big type the catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ads . I want ever ' merchant that comes in on this deal to take one of these spaces . We 'll run this , a double-page spread , in the Dernoffal . I contribute the idea free of charge , and the Democrat will take in catalogues on subscriptions or job printing work . Also we 'll want to run off 30 by 22 circulars , about a thousand , which I 'll do at cost . So do n't suspicion that I 'm trying to make any big profit on this deal . " Now by all of us pulling together on this , we can put it across in fine shape , and the financing had n't ought to worry anybody . " The country people began arriving early . Their gray , mule-drawn wagons with extra plank seats laid across the weathered sideboards were lined with children , little girls in lye-bleached floursack smocks and tightly braided pigtails , bigger girls wearing starched gingham and stiff straw hats with elastic chin-straps , grown girls dressed in georgette crepe or tub silk ; small boys in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits . The young men came on horseback or in buggies with their sweethearts sitting alongside . Not many came in automobiles , but those who did rode in aged flivvers , tattered folding tops fixed with baling wire . The alley hitching racks were crowded . The courthouse square , all but the block on Broadway that had been roped off , was black-fringed with parked cars . The Home Town Industry Jubilee promised to be a great success from the start . There were special features to keep up interest all day long . Pollack Brothers ' Bargain Bazaar hadadvertised that at straight-up noon they would throw away from the top of their store building one hundred dollars in coins . Small boys scrabbling in the dust of Broadway picked up a large number of one-cent pieces , and some nickels and a few dimes were found . There was a rumor that a farmer had caught the coveted twenty-dollar gold piece as it fell through the air . He was a tall man , but his name was never known . All afternoon the sidewalks on all sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who was headed somewhere could scarcely get through . The De Molay Band was playing on the southwest corner of the Square . At two o'clock there was a hog-calling contest for the men and a rolling-pin throwing contest for the women . There was a sack race and a potato race and a calf-tying contest . The white people kept to the west side of the Square , where it was shady , but the niggers liked the east side of Broadway , taking the full heat of the afternoon sun . At first the catalogues had come in so slowly that the merchants had supposed that the Home Town Industry Jubilee was going to be a flop . More than a week passed before they had accumulated enough even to start a bonfire , much less make a big one . Then , toward the last , the farmers began bringing their catalogues in steadily , and the merchants thought they had the catalogues pretty well cleaned up before the final day . But they got almost as many catalogues on the day of the celebration as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogues were brought together and counted late Saturday afternoon it was discovered that more than a thousand had been brought in and traded for merchandise . This puzzled everyone until Editor Ledbetter happened to think that there was nothing to prevent farmers who got their mail at post offices ten , twelve , or even twenty miles away , from bringing in catalogues , or to prevent farmers nearby from ranging that far to collect them . At any rate , they had the catalogues there , a great sprawling mound of them dumped on one corner of the circus lots south of Standpipe Hill . Little Muddy Creek goes dry every summer , but it is swift enough in other seasons to have cut a long narrow gully through the sandstone . Dry brush had been piled into the deep dry creek-bed . After supper the crowd began gathering in the twilight . R. W. E. Ledbetter struck a match and set it to the brush . As the flames crackled up , six members of the Lions Club worked bard , dousing the catalogues with coal oil and tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long poles , poking up the slow-burning catalogues . Others held dripping gunny sacks , ready to flout any blazing patch of grass . August is a dry month to have a bonfire . The crowd had thinned out since afternoon . So many of the farmers had to get back to see after their stock before dark . But there were several hundred people there , nearly all town dwellers , standing along the flaming ditch , their faces showing drawn and ghastly in the firelight . Little ember-spangled wisps of black floated up into the darkness . Sometimes , when the goaded flames flared high , the small boys would whoop , but only the bustling Lions seemed to have much enthusiasm . No one seemed happy to see all the mail order catalogues destroyed . Monday morning , before opening for business , Postmaster Shannon noticed that the stamp window needed some postal cards . He went over to the reserve stock in the big safe and tookout four packs , adding one hundred postal cards to the stamp-window store . He did not think anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner , Elvira Draper sold the last postal card at the stamp window . She got up and added one hundred more from the reserve stock . Slemmons came in off his route earlier in the afternoon than the other carriers . He bad hard-surfaced roads all the way on Route Four . He walked in the back door , set his beveled tin stamp box down on his desk , and hung up his big leather mail pouch . Pretty soon he came up to check in his money orders and to replenish his stamp supplies . " Give me fifty postal cards , " he said , reading off the list of stamps he needed . " Give you fifty ? " Gladys Ferguson said in surprise . " Yeah , fifty , " Slemmons said in a surly voice . " Sold ever ' one I had and could ' ye sold fifty more if I 'd had ' em .
