emenra ... ? THE ELECTRIC KING A STORY BY LORD DUNSANY T HIS is a story Jorkens told me one day . It goes to prove that he does not talk always of himself , as some of the members of our club have chosen to assert and , since there is no personal motive to be served by any inaccuracy , I see no reason for doubting it . And if this story of his be true , why not his other ones ? That is the way I look at it , without any wish whatever to interfere with the judgment of others . He had fallen asleep after a somewhat heavy meal , and all the other members but I had left : some had business to attend to , while others were irritated by Jorkens ' snoring , though I could n't see what harm his snores were doing , or what good their business did , if you come to that . And presently one of Jorkens ' snores turned to a gurgle , which seemed for a moment to be going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being all alone with him , I made the remark , " I suppose you have seen some pretty queer things in your time . " " And people , " said Jorkens . And very soon he was well started , wonderfully refreshed by his sleep and by whatever he may have had with his lunch . And this is the tale . He was in America , knocking about in New England , and chancing to be somewhat out of funds . And he had taken up reporting for a paper and interviewing , whenever he could get a scrap of work to do , in order to get onto what he called a financial footing ; which I expect meant money enough to go back to England third class . And one day they had senthim to see Makins , the millionaire , who had been having a good deal of publicity lately , and to get an interview from him . In case the name of Makins conveys little , he was better known as the Electric King ; and his publicity had come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was capable of administering his own affairs . That he was so capable had been triumphantly proved by his lawyer , chiefly by full details of the organizing , the working , the tending , even the very oiling of the giant dynamos that were watched and directed personally by Makins himself for fourteen hours out of every twenty-four , the whole year round , year after year . What the dynamos were used for was a point that was brushed aside with such consummate brilliance that unless my reader be thoroughly trained in the law he would never be able to appreciate it . These were the dynamos that Jorkens saw when he went to interview Makins . Jorkens would never have had the job if it had been an easy one , and yet he got the man 's whole story . There was something about him that Makins had liked , even if it was only that " he took his wine like a man , " to use Makins ' own words , and so he had got his story . Jorkens had congratulated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had just been proved capable of controlling his own affairs , and Makins had said , " Is n't it just marvellous ? " And then he had been silent for a quarter of an hour , sitting , sometimes shaking THE ELECTRIC KING his head , in a large carved chair , till he suddenly muttered , and soon his voice gained strength , and he told Jorkens this story . " I had the idea of busting the whole electric light of America and then gathering it all up again into my own hands : one company to illuminate every city of the United States . We should have been a power , at the lowest computation , equal to the full moon . I had it all clear in my head , and I could have done it -- -I ca n't give you the details . It is n't clear now , but it was in those days  --  clear to the last cent . You might have asked me any question about the minutest part of the scheme , and I could have answered at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that light ; think of it  --  as much as the full moon sheds on the North American continent . Then my leisure went . I suddenly lost my leisure . A slight attack , the doctor called it . But it was n't an attack : I was perfectly well in body . And it certainly was n't my mind : that was clearer than ever , too clear in fact ; my thoughts were crystal-clear , but too many of them . I simply lost my leisure . It takes a good deal of work , a good deal of thought , for one man to control big business ; and when I stopped to breathe at the summit of my career , on a pinnacle higher than I had ever dreamed of , my thoughts ran on . They would not stop . and so I lost my leisure . Weil , I did n't mind at first : they all went into the business . But when I found that the most trivial thoughts began to run through my head , like a mob of dirty children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrelevant even to mention , and no keeping them out , why then I began to panic , and went to a doctor and said to him , ' What about it ? ' And he said , ' Sea voyage . ' And I sailed from New York for Bombay . " Well , I found the sea voyage was not doing me any good , and I did some thinking then . I was always thinking ; and I figured it out then that whatwanted was not a doctor , but one who dealt with the terrors of the soul . Yes , I do n't exaggerate : I was pretty well frightened by then . I began to see that those thoughts were hunting my reason . Noses down , tails up , ears flapping , that 's what they were after , as surely as hounds a long way behind a fox . Well , there were one or two priests on board , of various denominations , and I talked to them a good deal , walking round the decks in the evening with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as soon as he began to listen . But they mostly talked to me about going to Heaven , and I figured that their advice was too like my doctor 's , who had sent me to Bombay ; not that Bombay 's like Heaven , in the hot weather not at all . And besides , I knew their talk pretty well already ; and my thoughts went racing on . " And then I remembered that I had heard that there were a good many religions in India , some with idols and some without ; it was all one to me ; I was being hunted over a precipice and was anxious to clutch at anything . I mean any prejudice I may have had against idols seemed now merely absurd : you may n't like brambles , but you 'd grab them going over an edge and to such a drop as I saw . Yes , sir , my wits were tottering . And that thought went on hunting them . " It had come down chiefly to one thought now . It was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . That was the nearest one , the leading one of the pack : night and day you know , and of course no sleep to speak of . " I got to know a man on board who had been in India a good deal . I guessed it by his face and began to talk to him . And in a day or two I had put my whole case before him , as near as I dared , for I dare n't speak of the rat in those days . Ebblit his name was , and he told me about the Ganges . Our acquaintance began in the Mediterranean ; we used to play chess at first and sit and talk when the game was over . But he never really spoke out , never told me all he felt , or half he knew , till we turned that corner where de Lessens stands , with one bronze hand held out to the eastern gate of the world ; and the corrupt city of Port Said drops astern , a cluster of white domes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on waking , just leaving it behind him , you know , as we were . And Ebblit soon after that began to talk of the East , as though it were really there , and there were nothing odd about it ; while the West and its ways seemed to drop farther and farther away from him , till he seemed no longer intimidated by its prejudices and customs . And then he spoke of the beauty of that river . He did not seem to know whether the calm of its beauty molded the thoughts of those people , soothing and lulling them to an undreamed content , or whether it was the thoughts of generations of people that had given the river that surpassing sanctity . But I began to see there was ease to be found on the Ganges , and rest , as I dared to hope , for my hunted wits . And I asked him what part of the river was best to go to ; and he thought for a little while and answered , Benares . ' " I had a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded tail was terribly close . I forgot to tell you that its tail was broken . Gosh , I 'm a tough man . l 've known hundreds of men right through , their little minds clear as glass to me , and I do n't know one of them , not one , that would have held out against that rat through the Red Sea . " They had a large tank ou board rigged up as a swimming bath , and I used to get some coolness there after sunset , floating on the water and looking up at the stars and thinking of the rat . " And then I used to go and talk to Ebblit . Every bit of information I could get from him I used to collect like a stamp collector  --  the name of the best hotel , the best part of the river to sit at , the priests , the temples , the legends  --  everything I could get from him while we walked up and down in the heat . And one day I very nearly mentioned the rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it coming . After that I found it more difficult to get him to have a talk with me , especially when alone . " I was practically all alone with the rat after that . " And at last we reached Bombay . " Of course there are things to see in India between Bombay and Benares , quite a lot in fact . The eighth wonder of the world is at Agra , and the earthly paradise in the old palace at Delhi , not to mention the marvels of history which are the equal of legends in other lands . There 's a lot to look at beyond the pinnacles of the Western Ghats . But by now I could see nothing but the slow blood oozing from the battered bruise in the tail . So I hurried on to Benares . " There was a man outside the Cow Temple who would help me , Ebblit had told me , at the right-hand side of the door . He was there three years ago , Ebblit had said , and would probably still be there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dirty in fact . I would have laughed at the idea if I 'd been able to laugh in those days . Dirty , indeed ! What was dirt to that rat ? " I went to that temple in terror . What if the man had gone ? Three years seemed a long time to me . But it was n't long to him , just as Ebblit had said . He was there right enough , at the right-hand side of the door that leads to the Cow Temple , loin-cloth , bare skin , and dirt , sitting upon the ground with a bowl beside him . So I found an interpreter and went back to the dirty man and put my case to him at once , before I had ever gone to my hotel . Of course I did n't tell him about the rat . Perhaps I might have done so had be been cleaner ; but I said that I was a business man much troubled by business worries , and that other thoughts intruded themselves on me too . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done , he replied , ' Speak openly . ' " You may guess that I did n't like being spoken to in such a way by a man like that , and I was silent a moment . And then in my utter despair I mentioned the rat . And the instant I mentioned it the whole thing poured out ; I had never spoken of it before . Its eyes , its whiskers , its fur , I described it all to him from its eager nose to the mangled bend in its tail . " And he said to me , if the interpreter got it right , ' The River Ganges is beautiful beyond the conception of man , and beyond the capacity of any mind to estimate . In the contemplation of this beauty is complete fulfilment of all desire . No ambition transcends it . Nothing even hoped for can surpass it . It is the fitting occupation of any lifetime . Go , and sit by it until the picture of the river dwells in your innermost mind , as it does with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit by it , if needs be , all your days . The reward hereafter is infinite ; and for the seekers like yourself , for immediate gain , even for these it is adequate . ' " It 's odd , but it seemed to me that the man was talking sense . The rat was still there , but a ray of faint hope had shone from beyond the sound of his voice . I felt like some wayfarer lost and terribly hunted who suddenly hears in the darkness a music of bells , and beyond the bells at last some cottager 's light . That was no mad fancy , but only came from the stress of weeks without sleep . " Well , I went to the Ganges . Boys , it 's a jewel ! I went down to it about sunset , and it lay there like a vast piece of a semiprecious stone , one of those very pale beryls or aquamarines . I realized at once it was no use just looking at it ; I was n't a sightseer now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever hunt the body : I would cheerfully have sat and played with a tiger , to get away from that rat . " Suicide may be suggesting itself to you as an obvious remedy . But I would n't do that , because I felt that the rat was after my reason , and I wanted tosave it from him with all its power , not to throw it away . So I had gone to the Ganges , not to gaze at it , but to let it sink into my soul , to contemplate its beauty as I had been told , till it became more to me than my hands and feet , and nothing else should matter , not even the rat . " It seemed the world 's end , that river ; so many steps led down to it . It was not like tracks that rim down to a ford and go onward the other side , or paths that lead to a ferry , to wait a while ; these steps thronged down to the water 's edge and ceased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat down on one of the steps near a tiny temple and watched the day fading , and the more it faded the more easy I found it to take my first lesson in the lore that should save me from the rat . And the beauty of the river began sinking into me , as easily as if I 'd been there for years and years . Pilgrims came down the steps by twos and threes ; pigeons came to the little temple beside me , dropping down to their rest among the tiny domes , and the color went out of things with the loss of the sun , all but the river , which seemed to keep a light of its own . Now for the first time I noticed the fires of death , flickering up from the burning ghats . Sometimes a ship with great sails stole down the river , with never a ripple upon that wondrous calm , so that it seemed that the ship was a ship of ghosts or the river something from dreamland , something far out among dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw vividly a slanting moon , young in the west like a horn , over the little temple . And , as the moon brightened and the fires of death grew stronger , the color that had faded out of the sky with sunset began to return with the afterglow , coming back more gorgeous than it had been before , like a traveler returning to some rural home clad in the silks and splendors of wonderful lands . It increased and increased , till the luminous river seemed dark beside the astonishing glow of it . " As Makins spoke of the Ganges he talked very fast , gazing straight in front of him over Jorkens ' head , without a thought of his scurrying pencil . Jorkens was writing shorthand and even then scarcely kept up . It was n't so much the beauty of the Ganges that was entrancing him , Jorkens thinks , as the first escape , of a kind , that he had ever had from the rat ; though he had n't really got away from it . As he put it himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , draping the holy city with all their glory : you know how pieces of evening , slabs of light , seem to fall between you and buildings at this enchanted hour , buildings on solid earth , and sky between you and them . It was like that with me and the rat . There was something at last , at last , between me and him . The beauty of the Ganges . It could not overcome him , the thing was too strong for that . But the rat was now on the far side of the river . " A most intense beauty filled the sky with the deep colors of India , a hush hung heavily at the brink of the river , a hush as though the world had ceased its spinning to watch for the first star : the door of the little temple opened noiselessly , showing all dark within , and the hush deepened over all the river . And suddenly bells at the very water 's edge sent up a melody clanging across the hush ; wide windows opened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of instruments utterly strange to us ; drums beat unseen from the little temple near ; the rapidly darkening air throbbed to a strange rhythm that boomed and resounded among the walls of Benares  --  that was their way of worship ; they were giving praise to the river . You 'll excuse me a moment , wo n't you ? " And Makins rose and went to a little shutter , a sliding panel in the library where they were sitting , and moved the panel aside . And at once a great purr filled the room , the voice of a hundred dynamos . Jorkens had heard the murmur of them before , all the time that Makins was talking about the Ganges , but now the roar of their purring filled all the room , and he could see the rows of them , like a vast stable of elephants . What stupendous energies that iron multitude was unloosing Jorkens did not then know , only that a vast power was going invisibly forth . They were looking down on the hall of the dynamos from the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark rounded shapes , oiling machinery . " My dynamos are being fed , " said Makins . Jorkens said nothing ; the hugeness of the power so near to him , the humble service these monsters were giving to man , and the incompatibility between the organized might of science and the devoted worship of an Indian river seem to have taken his breath away . And Makins continued : " I stayed there for three days . The rat was now , as I said , on the far side of the river ; but it went no farther away . In the gloom of thought I could see its whiskers twitching whenever it sniffed , and I knew whom it was sniffing for . So I went back to the dirty man and told him all about it . And he said , ' The Ganges flows from a hill too high for our feet . And on that hill is a city of pure gold . Everything there is gold , pavement and houses : even the shops are gold . And all the people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beauty of the river he had me heat ; that was a thing he understood ; but when it came to a definite fact of geography that set me arguing . ' How did he know , ' I asked , ' that the golden city was there ? ' I have seen it , ' he said . ' I walked for months up the river , walking in my youth great distances every day ; and I came to the hill , and it was all white , and there was no city there . I was young and had not the faith . And I stayed there looking at it for seven days , fasting and sometimes praying to those to whom prayer is due . And at the end or the seventh day I thought I noticed a change . And the sun set , and there was no change . And all the hill grew dull . And I was faint with fasting . And all of a sudden the golden city came , street upon street of it straggling along the hill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a city of purest gold , as the Brahmins teach . ' " ' Should I see it ? ' I asked . " ' Not yet , ' he said . " ' When should I see it ? ' I asked him . " ' Stay for three months upon the bank in Benares , ' he told me . Well , it seemed a long time , but I did as the dirty man said . And the rat stayed all that time on the far side of the river , and I got some sleep at nights , yet things got no better than that ; I could still see the country of madness too near to my borders , the edges of my imagination almost touched it . " One day at the very end of the three months , as I sat watching the pilgrims , it suddenly occurred to me that it was not my river ; that I should never believe the story of the golden city , and its gods could never be my gods . I made up my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose he is sitting there now by the door of the Cow Temple , with the cows and the peacocks strolling about inside , and the worshippers tolling a bell whenever they pray so that their god shall hear them . I left at once . I suppose I valued too lightly the rest I had had from the rat , or thought that the respite would last . The moment I left the Ganges he crossed the river and was back again as close as ever he was . He might have driven me back to Benares , but I knew by now that the Ganges could never get rid of him : the holy river was only a palliation , and I had a hope of shaking him off altogether . You see from the first I thought religion could do it . I am pretty shrewd as men go and make up my mind quickly , and from the very first I had spotted that that rat was one of the terrors of the soul . So that spiritual help was what I needed , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to fight the rat . And I had not given up hope . The greatest religions , I said , have al-ways come out of deserts . And it must be so ; for before a man can even look at the verities , let alone ponder and value them , he must clear off the dust of all the things that do n't matter , like to-day 's news , to-day 's opinions , to-day 's fashions , yesterday 's customs , and to-morrow 's fears . So I left the opalescent city of Benares , traveling in search of a desert . And the rat traveled with me . " I took a train for Delhi to begin with . There I intended to inquire my way to a desert , and in the desert I hoped to find some holy man who might have found enough wisdom , out of the way of cities , to be able to solve the terrific problem I brought him . Well , I was sitting in my railway carriage towards evening , thinking of the rat , when all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw a range of mountains that I did not know was there . " While we waited at the next station I asked the station-master about them , and he told me they were the Himalayas . The Himalayas Imagine seeing a waterfall had asking its name , and being told that it was Niagara ; or entering a church by chance , and finding it was Westminster Abbey . So I came to the Himalayas . " The station-master told me the names of the peaks , pale mauve a long way off . I 've always found you English very obliging . And then I asked him the name of a white one , all alone over the rest , and he answered as though it were not there at all , or at any rate need not be bothered about . ' Oh , that 's in Thibet , ' he said . Is n't that like you ? You 're nearly all like that . It was outside the British empire , and so it did n't count . " Of course Jorkens said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather more of a foreign country if anything than of our own , and would do anything rather than show we thought it was foreign . So a few moments passed over international courtesies , meaningless and polite , while the dynamos purred on faintly the other side of the shutter . And then Makins continued , " I had n't been looking at them for long when I said to myself , ' Mountains . Mountains , ' I said ; ' they 're every hit as good as deserts ; and I 've heard strange tales of Thibet . On a mountain a man may do as much thinking as he could down on the sand , provided he goes high enough ; all the silly little phrases that buzz round thought and obscure it would n't get far up a mountain . I 'll go there , ' I said , and I decided at once . At the next stop from that T got out . And the rat hopped out with me . " I hired a motor in course of time  --  you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight for those mountains . I was getting no sleep now at all and I made the chauffeur do sixty . We startled the little tree-rats as we shot past . Wonderful little animals . How I wished it were one of them that was after my reason , instead of the foul brute that I knew . Or even a monkey . But I suppose a man ca n't choose what terror will hunt his soul . And looking at it reasonably , as one always should at anything , I suppose one curse is as bad as another ; only I could n't think so then . " Well , we motored on towards the mountains in the afternoon , the afternoon of the day following my talk with the station-master , until what had been patches of blue laid upon lilac began to be great ravines rent in the slope of the mountain . Thibet by now no longer peered down on one , but was hidden by this huge wall , shutting it off from the world . " We did a lot of mileage that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the car could go no farther . Not that I bothered about that , for I had had from him the rumor of a monastery fifty miles or so farther on , the very thing I was looking for ; and I would gladly have walked without food or rest with that ahead of me and the rat behind . " As it turned out I did n't have to walk , and as it turned out it was a lotmore than fifty miles ; but we got hold of a bullock cart at a village , a thing they call a tongs : two bullocks drag it , and they can go anywhere . I do n't say it was comfortable , but comfort had gone from me since the coming of the rat , and I found bodily discomfort rather pleasant than otherwise . I had come to that pass long ago . We were traveling in the bed of a great river , the man that was driving the oxen , and / , and of course the rat . Our wheels were going over white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow pools of shallow water lying like shreds torn out from a mountain-oread 's dress . The sambhur came out of the forest to gaze at us , not the least afraid of the bullock-cart . So thick was the forest all along the dry river that we seldom saw the mountains ; when we did see them their imminence was tremendous ; we were all among them now , as though we had strayed unannounced into the assembly of giants , ancient ones of the earth , deputed by Nature to deliberate on her plans . Now night began to fall , and the mart halted his oxen and built a little circle of fires for the night , to keep away tigers . I kicked one of his little fires all golden into the darkness . ' Will that keep it off do you think ? ' I blurted out at him . But he was thinking only of tigers . " I regretted ray violence almost immediately . ' You must forgive me , ' I said , ' I ca n't sleep . ' But he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him . " One tiger came very near ; I heard his whispering footfall above the thought of the rat . The night passed , like all sleepless nights , in about a year ; and dawn came suddenly . We made some tea , and the man ate some food he had brought , and we pushed on for Thibet . We went on all that day , our wheels climbing over the boulders and dropping down with a crash on the other side . But none of these jolts could shake the rat away . " We made our little bivouac that night far up the slope in the cold with only one fire , above the fear of tigers . Not that I feared tigers . I had only one fear now , and my reason was tottering before it . Another sleepless night dragged by like a long chapter of history ; and in the golden morning my driver pointed , and there , far enough off , but shining bright as the morning , there on a mountain was the monastery I sought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ; the rest of the way was sheer mountain . We had already changed bullocks twice , and done over sixty of the fifty miles that they had said it was to the monastery . I found that distances in India were often like that . But here was the monastery at last in sight . I was able to get more men to carry my kit from the tonga , and I pushed on ahead of them up the mountain . A tiny little path went winding away over what was otherwise nearly precipice : by the look of it they did n't often go from that monastery , whoever they were , and few seemed to go to them . A bell sounded as I climbed up to them , but there was hardly a welcome in the sound as you might expect in this voice from the lonely mountain ; it was too unearthly for that , too little concerned , so it seemed , with any cares we know . The way to the door seemed almost quite untrodden . By the door a bell-handle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light chain . I went up and pulled the handle , and an astonishing din reverberated through the monastery . By some system of pulleys the chain that I pulled so easily must have swung a bell weighing little under a ton . And out came a wizened man in a monkish robe , and to him I tried to explain what I wanted without an interpreter , and without knowing a word of his language , or he knowing any of nine . But I think he must have guessed from some look of fear in my eyes , for he led me in ; and presently the men came up with nay baggage , and it was easier to explain more about myself by pointing to that . Had I come with less kit , and perhaps barefooted , they might have sent me on sooner . As it was , I sent one of the men who brought my baggage to go and get an interpreter , and it took him a week to find one . And all that time they housed me and gave me their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when the interpreter came I had a talk with a younger monk , telling him all my ease ; and he told me to ask the interpreter to come back in a year ; and that at the end of that time I should have prepared myself by suitable meditation to have speech with their Lama . " That was an unthinkable year . The rat gnawing through my thoughts and working into my reason , and they would not even let me ask for the cure . A year of horror . A year of the pit . I will not speak of it . They kept the rat from doing its worst , I will say that for them ; they knew of exercises , exorcisms and spells , fastings and meditations that kept up the walls of the soul and kept the powers of night from actually taking the citadel ; but I was beleaguered by terrors all that year , and they would not even let me ask for help . A ghastly , unspeakable year , and the rat so close that were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell , I do n't know what would have happened . " It came to an end at last .. At last they sent for me and said that their Lama would see me ; and they had the interpreter all ready . " I was shown into his cell  --  a man in a yellow robe , with a flat-topped head , sitting calmly at a table , and eyes like the scrutiny of the entire night , like the whole night solving a riddle , unraveling the mystery of courses of worlds that were older than ours . I spoke to him through my interpreter , but he did not speak to me . When I had spoken he merely pointed upwards , not to the sky but up the slope of the mountain , then he sat motionless with his gaze before him and his hands stretched out on the table . I saw that it was time to go , and I bowed to him and left the room , and soon afterwards left the monastery , and started , where he had pointed , up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger monks I should find another monastery before nightfall . Something in the reverence with which he spoke of it , something in the awe with which they watched me set forth , gave a fresh hope to my hard-hunted soul . It was in the early morning , and I climbed all day . No track whatever led up from the monastery I left ; late in the afternoon I met a track arising out of nowhere and winding upwards . They did n't seem to call on each other much . I could not see the monastery to which 1 was going , but they had pointed out the direction , and I had no doubt that this insufficient track was the road of the people I looked for . The heat and fatigue were nothing to me , for without the protection , such as it was , that I had had from the monks of the lower monastery , the rat was hunting me sorely . And before the sun set I heard a bell above me ; but so faint it sounded , lonely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its notes , so aloof from our joys or troubles , that it hardly seemed to ring from a habitation of men . " I had brought my interpreter with me , a Hindu from near Naini Tal ; that is to say he had left the lower monastery with me ; but I had let him follow at leisure , not being driven , as I was , over the rocks by the pursuit of the rat . But besides the interpreter I brought nobody ; nobody to carry my kit , and no kit to carry . I had an idea that it might be better to arrive like that this time . They do n't set store by the things that we set store by . " Over a rise the track I was following rambled , leading down to a little valley , and on the far side of the valley the upper monastery stood , with the little rocky valley to look out on , and the mountain going up like a sheer wall behind it . The sun set then , and a queer glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the door hung a bell-handle of silver , obviouslyshaped as a symbol , but a symbol of something of which I was utterly ignorant . I pulled the bell-handle , and a gentle note turned all the air of the monastery to music . And presently I heard monkish feet coming slowly down a passage , and the door opened . I had picked up some words of their language in the year at the other monastery , but not enough in which to speak of the terrors of the soul , the soul 's affairs being so far more intricate than are those of the body . So I asked him for lodging , trusting to these people 's hospitality , and told him that I had come from the lower monastery , and that my interpreter would soon arrive . When I spoke of the lower monastery , looking in his face , I might have been speaking of another world , so little it seemed to mean to him . I hoped from that . I hoped that they had some wisdom here of which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trusted in vain ; he took me in at once ; and as soon as the interpreter arrived I went with him to the cell of one of the monks and told over in all its terror my old story . Well , they certainly had spells : they used to chant them round my bed at evening , spells in no language I knew , not even the language that they usually spoke on this mountain and of which I had picked up scraps . They were only like reinforcements on tottering ramparts : they kept the rat away while I got some sleep ; but I was nearing my end now , and palliatives like this could not postpone it much longer  --  the end was near , and the rat would get my reason . They occupied my day by reading runes to me that were all of them greater than curses if you could get the right rune against the right curse . But I had a feeling that the rat was winning . And you 'd think that when he was winning he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fur would be smooth and shiny , and the rat in fine condition . It was just the other way about . His fur was like dead fur ; his lower jaw was drooping , his lips were shrunken , his THE ELECTRIC KING e77 sides were sinking in , and the wound in his tail was rawer and more revolting . Everything was shabby and mildewed about him except his eyes , and they were as keen and penetrating as ever . " About a month went by . And then one day their Lama sent for me . I went in terror , for it seemed like my last chance . But all the monks smiled at me , and seemed to be telling me that all would be well . We were shown in , the interpreter and I , to the dim room in which the Lama was sitting , in a yellow robe , at a table of red lacquer . Nothing spoke but his eyes when we came in . And then I told my story . The interpreter knew the grim details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence after me rapidly . At the end , in the silence , the Lama spoke one word . I could not believe it . One word to my interpreter , and then that empty look upon his face that shows one that the interview is over . " I looked at the interpreter , but he rose to go . And so I left in despair , having only got one word . " ' What did he say ? ' I asked , as much out of curiosity as anything . " ' Prayer , ' said the interpreter . " But prayer ? What prayer ? Did he think I had n't prayed ? As well advise a hunted fox to run . What did it mean , this one word that he spoke to me , I asked monk after monk . And they all of them said the same , they did not know ; I must go farther up the mountain . " ' Another monastery ? ' I asked . " Yes , one more , they said ; a monastery at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand feet , and pretty steep ; but I could not miss my way , it was right at the top of the peak . And so I started , though it was late in the afternoon , and soon night fell on my climbing . But 1 did n't mind that ; it was better than lying awake on sleepless beds , with the sly rat in the dark , gnawing and gnawing its way through thought to my reason . I climbed all night , letting the interpretercome on when he would , and in the heat of the day I dropped at their door and rested . Here at least they could send me no higher . And after a while I got up and pulled a plain iron bell-handle , and a. hell like a cow-bell clanged in the monastery , and a smiling Buddhist with a friendly face opened the door for me , and I staggered in . And for a while I said nothing . And then I said , ' Prayer . Prayer , ' using the word that the Lama had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language , trying to tell of my stress and the near approach of the rat ; but I did not know enough of the language for that , yet he seemed to understand , and took me in and fed me . Then he took me to a cool room , where there was a bed , and gave me a pitcher of water , and there I slept for some hours . When I awoke the interpreter had arrived , and I wanted to tell my terrible story at once ; but some of the monks quieted me , and I rested for some while longer . And when I woke again in the cool evening they seemed to know my story already ; I suppose the interpreter had told them . " And an older monk came hi , and gave me a small square of paper with red writing upon it ; and smiled , and said , ' The prayer . ' " I grasped it , and he went out of the room . But it was all in Thibetan . What was I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . The monk who had taken me in at the door came back with a tiny wheel , which he gave to me . Then he slipped the prayer into a catch in the wheel and showed me how to turn it . One did not pray orally , but turned the wheel . " He went away and left me with my prayer , and I began to turn it . Oh , man , it was the right prayer ! " It was the right prayer at last . Imagine a man cold , weary , bitterly cold , taken instantly from the uphill road he is trudging to a soft chair by a fire in a warm room , instantly , without troubling to walk to it ; or a man lost in a desert without water suddenly finding it is not true , suddenly finding himself safe at home ; even so the rat faded . " Well , I need n't tell you that I turned that wheel all day and far into the night . It was the first real rest I 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the moment I tried to get to sleep , and stopped turning the wheel , the rat came back . Not that I minded that much at the time : it was such a relief to be able to keep that rat away that I turned the wheel till morning and troubled no more about sleep . " Bright morning poured into my room , and T rose and looked from the window on a land more full of mountaintops than any field is of ant heaps , always turning my wheel . A bell tolled , I did not know whether for breakfast or prayer , but it showed that the monks were about , so I went down and met them walking in one of the wide corridors . They greeted me and asked me if I had slept well , and then I explained my difficulty . " A cheery laugh went up when I came to the difficulty about sleeping , as soon as I made myself clear . There was no difficulty in that , they said ; and they sent for the interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little water-wheels all along a mountain-stream for several yards that turned prayers night and day , and they said they would put one of these at my disposal . A kinder act I never knew ; it meant rest by day , sleep by night ; it meant at last a safe retreat from the rat . " So two or three of them came down to the stream with me , and it was my turn to laugh when I saw their little wheels . Very crude compared to anything we can do over here . And one thing I did n't quite like about them was that they went slower than the one that you turned by hand . Too slow wo n't do , you know . It gives the rat time to slip in between thoughts . However , I said nothing of that at the time . I was too grateful io them to risk hurting their feelings . And they showed me the wheel I might use , and I slid my prayerinto it . And though thoughts of the rat slipped in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer got round to its starting point , they were gone too soon to be able to keep me from sleep . " A few days in that bright crystalline air , with regular sleep every night , and my prayer-wheel turning , and the company of these men , keen as pioneers , giving all their days to extend the limits of human thought . did wonders for me . I put on weight rapidly , and my face began to get some likeness again to the face that my friends would have recognized . And as my health came back my keenness came with it , my old capacity began to return , my grip of business and industry . And one day I went to one of those monks and said to him , ' See here . You want to let me move those prayer-wheels fifty yards lower down . It will give you a fall of another fifty feet . Or let me move them a hundred yards , and you 'll have another twenty feet onto that , seventy feet in all , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've another stream , just as good , quite close , and a hundred men could dig a connecting trench in a day , or say ten days , working as the people you 're likely to get will work ; and that will double your power again . See ? ' " I was speaking as much by signs as by the interpreter . The thing was such obvious sense there was nothing to argue about . But would they do it ? They would n't even think about it . They would n't turn it over in their minds . Instead of thinking , they said it had always been like that . Instead of improving it , they said it was good enough for their fathers . " I grant you the wisdom of the East : it had saved my reason . But when it comes to organization , you have to go a long way west for it . God 's own country every time . And back to it I returned very soon after that . It was n't that I was ungrateful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I could n't stand their lack of horse sense . You know , a man may have the wisdom of the ages and yet be unable to put gasoline into his car if his chauffeur is n't with him . It was the same with these people . I did all I could to teach them , but in the end I had to leave them alone to go their own way . It was n't that I was ungrateful , and it was n't that I was not happy there , but those absurd little prayer-wheels were more than I could stand . Why , they had the water-power for ten times the speed they were doing , and I could have quadrupled it in a day or two . But I told you that . And , mind you , all the time the rat was gaining on the wheel . Very slowly , but gaining . And they stood helpless , and letting nobody help them , because it had been good enough for their fathers . So that , even if I had been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have got me in the end , slipping in between thoughts a Kale bit quicker than the wheel , just before it completed its lazy revolution . So I came home to these dynamos . I took the little prayer-wheel with me and left them . I tried to get the monk that gave it me to come out here , to see what these dynamos could do . I wanted to pay his way across the world . But he would n't come , and so we parted forever ; some slight regret on his part , as I always like to think ; and I in tears . " In three days I was out of the mountains , and in a few more down to the coast , twiddling my prayer-wheel day and night all the way . You 'll wonder how I slept all the way from Bombay to London . That was a very small piece of inventiveness for a man who has controlled the businesses I have controlled . I fixed my prayer to the electric fan in my stateroom . " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn one wheel . And it 's doing nine thousand revolutions a minute . My prayer is on that wheel . - " Not much chance for the rat . Not much chance for him to slip in a thought between one turn and the next . My prayer is down on him before he can dodge it . " He may try to slip in sometimes . If I have been talking too much of him , as I have to-night , or remembering my time in India ; then when my thoughts are all leaning his way he may make a grab at one of them before the wheel comes round , but he has to be mighty quick . And on just such a night as this , with all that talk about him , and calling to mind those days on the jewellike Ganges and with the monks in the mountains , he might well be likely to try . But I take no chances . Smedgers , " he called through the shutter . " Is Mr. Smedgers there ? " And the man answered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Accelerate , " said Makins . At once the drone of the dynamos rose to a wail , nearly drowning Makins ' voice when he spoke again . " Get them up to twelve thousand , " he shouted . Smedgers nodded . " For bag an hour , " Makins called down to him . " Right , sir , " shouted Smedgers . " That will stop him , " said the Electric King . This is the story as Jorkens took it down , word for word , in shorthand , and it would have been printed years ago but for some doubt there chanced to be raised at the time as to whether or not the interview was authentic .
