In Manhattan last week a great courtroom drama reached a sudden denouement . Prosecutor Thomas Edmund Dewey having shown to his own satisfaction that Tammany Leader Jimmy Hines was the political fixer for Harlem 's numbers racket , had rested the State 's case . The defense had begun to put its witnesses upon the stand . One of them , young Lawyer Lyon Boston , onetime assistant to Tammany 's District Attorney William C. Dodge , testified that Tammanyite Dodge had deputed him to investigate Tammanyite Hines 's long-rumored connection with the numbers racket , that he had found no evidence against Hines . Prosecutor Dewey started cross examining . Suddenly he asked : <P> " Do n't you remember any testimony about Hines and the poultry racket ? ' ' <P> Up jumped ponderous Defense Attorney Lloyd Stryker , waving his arms at the witness . " Wait ! " boomed he . " I ask for a mistrial . " <P> The courtroom shivered . Witness Boston 's jaw dropped . So did Prosecutor Dewey 's . He and Attorney Stryker strode to the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the prosecutor 's remark had nothing to do with the trial at hand , was deliberately prejudicial to his client . Prosecutor Dewey insisted that the question was proper and justified . Justice Pecora , with face sterner than ever , recessed court for the week-end to decide . <P> Thereupon the spotlight of the trial shifted from Thomas Dewey and James Hines to Ferdinand Pecora . As the reform candidate whom Tammanyite Hines helped Tammanyite Dodge beat at the polls in 1933 , as a Democratic judge presiding over a case that might make Republican Dewey Governor of New York , Justice Pecora was put to hard test of judicial impartiality . <P> For two days Justice Pecora pondered , then convened his court , announced he would hand down his decision . With the courtroom locked , he read in a firm , dry voice a flat and lawyerlike end to one of the most sensational cases in New York jurisprudence . Because Defendant Hines was charged only with conspiracy to " contrive a lottery , " said he , the question about the poultry racket was improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To a trial which had filled the press of New York City and the nation with surprises for a month , this was a fittingly strange ending . For grinning Jimmy Hines and alert Attorney Stryker , it was a masterstroke . In a new trial before another jury the hand of the prosecutor will be lying face-up and the opportunities for cross-examination by Attorney Stryker vastly enhanced . For the " Great Prosecutor " whom Republicans had already slated for the gubernatorial nomination at their State convention this month , it was the humiliation of being caught in an ABC legal error .
