txt Hints for Announcers . To the Editor of The New York Mout : Why do not the broadcasting companies reserve a man of special qualifications for the announcing of such an event as today 's celebration in Washington ? It was one of the occasions of a generation , yet the announcer burbled about Mrs. Hoover , a symphony in brown , and the charming Mrs. Hurley . He might have been describing a garden party . As if that was n't enough , he committed the most excruciating fault of announcing , that of talking while the listeners want to hear the program . Before President Hoover arrived , the announcer told us in detail what was to happen . As the President came on the scene , the band greeted him with its finest playing . But could we listen to it ? Not by many little air waves ! Hardly had the band got well started before its sound was weakened , and the voice of the announcer cut across it , repeating ad nauseam what he had told us only a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Feb. 22 , 1932.
