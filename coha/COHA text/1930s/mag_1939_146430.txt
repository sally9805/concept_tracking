For most U. S. citizens the month of June means weddings , graduations and reacquaintance with the great outdoors . Last week , in almost every U. S. home that boasts a patch of green grass , families were thinking up ways of amusing themselves or entertaining their week end guests . For those who are too fat , too feeble or too lazy to play golf or tennis , the new-mown lawn is the No. 1 arena for summer pastimes . <P> There , this summer , thousands of men , women &; children will for the first time try their skill at badminton , most popular lawn game of the year . Practically unknown as an al fresco pastime five years ago , the British-born game of badminton-batting a shuttlecock ( or " bird " ) back &; forth over a high net-has become a U. S. vogue as quickly and ubiquitously as women 's open-toed shoes . <P> Today one may buy a domestic set ( two racquets , a bird and a net ) for as little as $1.45 ; or one may pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , French-kid-covered , **30;2742;TOOLONG birds ) like those used by Bette Davis , Pat O'Brien , Douglas Fairbanks and other Hollywood enthusiasts . Although serious badminton addicts play indoors where there is no breeze to affect the true flight of their birds , many a tournament player , such as Mrs. George Wightman ( donor of the Wightman Cup ) , Tennist Sidney Wood and William Faversham Jr. , plays outdoors with heavier birds just for fun . <P> Another 1939 lawn favorite is croquet , staging a comeback along with other Victorian fashions . Among U. S. croquet players : Secretary of State Cordell Hull , Socialite Mrs. Margaret Emerson , whose Port Washington estate is the scene of the annual Long Island croquet championship , Novelists Charles and Kathleen Norris , whose summer place is virtually built around a croquet court , Poloist John Hay ( " Jock " ) Whitney , Social Cynosure Herbert Bayard Swope , who plays very solemn croquet with Broadway celebrities at his Long Island home , Publisher William Randolph Hearst , Drama Critic Alexander Woollcott and the four Marx Brothers . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them take the game as seriously as Britons their cricket . One of the best croquet experts in the U. S. is Averell Harriman , board chairman of Union Pacific R. R. <P> For bowling-alley habitues , lawn bowls is a good summer substitute . Played with a 31-lb. , lignum-vitae ball ( weighted on one side to give it bias ) , the object of the game is to throw the ball ( called " bowl " ) down a narrow green to land as close as possible to a previously thrown white ball ( called " jack " ) . Although most good lawn bowlers play at clubs where velvet smooth greens have been coddled for years , many a rip-roaring bowling match has taken place on a private lawn . Scoring is similar to that of horseshoes . Sets ( four pairs of bowls and two jacks ) range in price from $25 to $75.
