Sedate Parisians strolling in the Bois one day last fortnight were startled by unfamiliar sounds : the music of ukuleles and harmonicas , wild cries of " Yipee ! Yipee ! " Drawn by these noises into the Bagatelle Polo Grounds , they saw about 30 young men &; women in outlandish foreign dress-broad-brimmed hats and broad-legged pants , loudly checked shirts and brass-studded belts . They were riding horses and twirling ropes . <P> What the strollers witnessed was the first big show of the three-year-old Club de Lasso . Founded by Serbian-born Artist Paul Coze Dabija , who is a student of Red Indian lore , the club meets weekly at the fashionable riding club Menage Olive . The members , dressed in authentic cowboy clothes ordered from Denver , Colo. , learn bronc riding , Western music , plain &; fancy roping . Only requirement for membership is sincere interest in Le Wild West , but since its quarters are limited , the club has a long waiting list . Members are all French except for Chief Oskomon. a bonafide Indian , and Pauline Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. N. , assigned last spring to command of the Yangtze River patrol . <P> Last week , after the show , Artist Coze prepared to sail for America for a visit to Indian reservations and to the Cheyenne rodeo in July . When he returns , the Club de Lasso may found a dude ranch . so that Parisians may ride hard across the mesas of the Loire Valley or along the buttes of the Midi .
