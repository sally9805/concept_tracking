txt Earnings of Air Reduction Co. in the second quarter continued at the stable rate shown during the first period , resulting in a net profit of 52.045,491 , equal to 52.43 a share on 841,288 shares in the first half as compared with 52 , - 883,845 or $3.64 a share on 791.781 shares in the corresponding 1930 period . Thus , Air Reduction is maintaining its earning power relatively well in view of the generally severe decline in industrial profits . Earnings started well in the second quarter , but tapered off in May and June . Results in the third quarter will be less favorable since this is seasonally the least profitable period of the year for Air Reduction . Railroad shops which use a large amount of welding gases and supplies are shut down during the summer months and industrial activity is at a low ebb . In 1930 net in the third quarter was 51.264.357 or $1.53 a share against $1,360,569 or $1.72 a ehare in the second quarter . A similar decline in profits this year would bring earnings for the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it is of course too early to estimate results accurately . Fourth quarter in 1930 showed a net profit of 31,102,176 or 51.32 a share , continuing the declining trend shown in earnings during that year . Important operating economies all along the line apparently have halted at least for the time being , the downward trend in profits but unless there is marked improvement in business in the fall it would appear that earnings in the last half of the current year will be somewhat less than in the first , resulting in a net of around $5 a share for the year . The following table shows Air Reduction 's comparative quarterly earnings in recent years : Air Reduction can , of course , expect no further income from its holdings in U. S. Industrial Alcohol Corp . which recently passed its dividend . This contribution , however , has never been an important factor in its earnings since holdings probably do not exceed 50,000 shares . It is possible that further reserves may be set up at the end of this year to offset the decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at around 30 a share against a low of 50 last December . Announcement was made recently of an increase of 1 cent a gallon in alcohol prices which includes only denatured alcohol treated with the new government formula . This price advance will have no effect on earnings this year , however , since the entire year 's business has been booked at an unprofitable price level . There is a fair basis for expecting- more profitable results in 1932 , since the difficulties of the alcohol companies have been due more to price wars within the industry than to external conditions . Apparently , however , much more work must be done before stabilized price conditions can be assured . Disagreements among distillers have so far proved " more damaging to profits than any danger of synthetic competition .
