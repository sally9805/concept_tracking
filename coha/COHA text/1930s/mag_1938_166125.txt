One Saturday night recently in Boston , the Shubert Theatre 's SRO sign was out . Inside , Leave It to Me , a musicomedy soon to open on Broadway , sailed ahead to roars of laughter . Victor Moore wowed the audience in the role of a dumbbell U. S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union . The pretty Goodhue girls revived memories of the Florodora Sextet . The box office had counted up a huge $25,000 for the week , and the show 's press-agent remarked : " I 've never seen a show run so smoothly before it reached Broadway . " <P> Meanwhile , a few blocks away in Boston 's Hotel Ritz-Carlton , Authors Bella &; Sam Spewack , shuddering at the thought of Broadway critics , were slashing the script of Leave It to Me , rushing off to hammer typewriters . While the audience was holding its sides over Act II , Act II was going , bit by bit , into the Spewack wastebasket . While the audience was filing out after the show , behind the curtain the cast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts and rehearsing them far into the night .
