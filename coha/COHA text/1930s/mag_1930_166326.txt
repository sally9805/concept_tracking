Dsseldorf is grimy , hard and real , a city of 500,000 working souls , a mechanized inferno where the Gates of Hell turn out to be only blast furnaces . Last week in this German Pittsburgh baffled detectives and frightened citizens were enacting a tense , bewildering drama , macabre and outrageous . <P> Twenty atrocious murders in a few weeks , ten more slashings have reduced the citizens to a state of mind in which respectable women were to be seen in Lutheran Churches screaming that Satan again walks the Earth , imploring Heaven 's protection . For several weeks Dusseldorf schoolchildren have been toddling to kindergarten or walking fearfully to gymnasium ( high school ) accompanied by armed posses or riding in busses guarded by policemen with cocked Mauser pistols Entirely baffled , the Dusseldorf police recently sent for Berlin detectives whose methods-typical of the deepest dyed Austro-German psychiatric and psychoanalytical school-have been scaring the citizens out of what wits remained to them . <P> Satanism and Vampirism-two popular explanations among superstitious Dsseldorfers of what was going on-were promptly rejected by the Berlin detectives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " Club of Sadists . " <P> In cosmopolitan and perverse Berlin , Sadism and kindred anomalies are well known and understood . The Sadist is recognized as an individual who commits acts of cruelty upon animals or humans not in a spirit of simple violence but because he derives from them complex sexual satisfaction . As every Berlin detective knows , Sadism takes its name from a Frenchman born in the reign of dissolute Louis XV , famed Donatien Alphonse Franois Comte ( " Marquis " ) de Sade , whose incredibly voluminous and wearisomely detailed writings glorify " the philosophy of cruelty for its own sake " much as Christian writers exalt Divine Love . <P> In Dsseldorf the sagacious Berlin detectives had in full swing last week two amazing ruses to trap the members of a Crime Club* supposedly patterned on the notorious 18th Century Cercle des Amis du Crime described by the " Marquis " de Sade . In the first place , the detectives arranged for a Dsseldorf stock company to put on a Sadistic drama likely to appeal to members of the Crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who entered the theatre stood persons-mostly girls-who had recently been slashed in the vicinity of Dsseldorf but had escaped with their lives . Thus by a stratagem worthy of Dr. Sigmund Freud-said to have been consulted in this case-the police boasted that they were obtaining " important clues . " <P> Second and most macabre of the detectives ' stratagems was a scene enacted every night last week in the more popular Dsseldorf beer halls . While the clinking of mugs and the chomping of sausages were at their height three black-clad detectives entered , carrying a coffin . Perhaps the orchestra had been playing the German jazz hit of the year : Ich Ksse Deine Hand , Madame ! ( " I Kiss Your Hand , Madame ! " ) *As one of the detectives clapped his black-gloved hands , the jazz snapped off into thundrous silence .
