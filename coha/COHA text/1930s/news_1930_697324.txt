txt MR . WALSH EXCEPTS . He Did Not Imply Cowardice Nor Accuse Bay State Republicans . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES editorial " A Disharmony Conference " calls for comment from me , a participant , whose name is mentioned . I did not say or even intimate that Mr. Fitzgerald was a coward . I suggested only that his position of opposition to the taking of a vote to indicate the preference of the Democratic leaders which he had theretofore invited might leave him open to the charge of cowardice , which would be unfortunate after his long years of service to his party . Mr. Fitzgerald has time and again demonstrated his courage " e'en at the cannon 's Mouth . " Indeed , I regard any man who offers himself as a candidate for a high elective office at a primary as something of a hero , when we know what obstacles he faces . Nor did I say " the Republicans have poured money in certain places to overburden our ticket . " That was said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished . It . just happens to be a fixed principle with me that I will not make charges I can not prove . There is no evidence that the Republican party of Massachusetts is engaged in any such nefarious business as spending money to sway Democratic councils . The Republicans have too many troubles of their own in Massachusetts to make any such attempt . May I add that the Massachusetts Democratic conference was by no means futile ? Despite the fact that it did not settle upon a slate to be recommended to the Democratic electorate , some gains may be recorded . For instance , many of the avowed candidates for Governor and United States Senator had a chance to measure their strength among those who will be expected to carry on the campaign . Hundreds of Democrats had a chance to hear and see their leaders and those who aspire to high place in politics . Some candidates and their friends , if they wisely interpret the temper of the conference , will be safeguarded against futile efforts , useless expenditures and the bad temper which often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole was good-natured . The only intemperate men I saw at the conference , two in number , clashed for a moment . Out of this was manufactured the dramatic story of a riot . JOHN JACKSON WALSH . New York , July 30 , 1930 . THE WAR ON TUBERCULOSIS . Reaction in Favor of Physico-Dietetic Methods Is Seen . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES editorial " Anti-Tuberculosis Inoculation " will serve to direct renewed attention to the opposing attempts to control the disease . So long as specific preventive measures , . whether applied to infants or adults , are not wholly free from . risk or confer impermanent immunity , so long will therapeutic procedures play the leading role in the fight against tuberculosis . Successive failures of the so-called specific remedies have led to a reaction in favor of physico-dietetic methods . Foremost among these stands the new **32;57;TOOLONG dietetic treatment , which for the first time prescribes a salt-free diet in combination with vitamin-flooding and administration of certain medicaments . Thanks to the far-sightedness and generosity of August Heckscher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , following exhaustive trials on all forms of tuberculosis in the clinics of the Universities of Munich , Berlin and Giessen , which these clinics carried out during the past five years . Extensive clinical trials by American Government , city and private institutions are now being instituted , the results of which will be watched with profound interest by the profession , patients and the general public . The development of modern medicine trends away from artificial remedies toward simple , natural procedures . ROBERT WOLLHEIM . New York , July 28 , 1930 . The Late Dr. W. E. Lambert . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I , on behalf or the British community in this and the neighboring States , express the sympathy of all my nationals in the death of Dr. Walter Eyre Lambert , a gentleman highly thought of and beloved by us all and who was the distinguished president of the St. George 's Society a few years ago and previously had held a similar position in the British Schools and Universities Club ? Dr. Lambert had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came froni the State in which he was born  --  South Carolina . During my long term of office I frequently had occasion to refer cases of distress to him . These were always dealt with with the greatest consideration , and he never spared himself where he could do his fellow-man a good turn . Indeed , he was an unusual person  --  tender , generous and chivalrous , utterly without malice and full of loyalty  --  while his close friends found him a most delightful and congenial companion . He has gone to his well-earned rest , but he has left with us a memory that should encourage us to follow in his footsteps and continue the good work that he was ever associated with . H. G. ARMSTRONG , British Consul General . New York , July 30 , 1930 . A Battery Park Eyesore . To the Editor of Ths New York Times : While we are on the subject of the " Gateway to America , " would it not be a fine thing to urge the removal and abandonment of the public bath building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago outlived its necessity and usefulness ?
