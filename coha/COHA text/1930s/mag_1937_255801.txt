" We find on the one hand , " reported the resolutions committee at the A. F. of L. convention in Denver last fortnight , " the dominating and fulminating Caesar of the C. I. O. marching his Roman legions to the White House with bludgeoning threats , while on the other hand we find the Machiavelli of the same C. I. O. pursuing the methods typical of that old master of cunning and conniving , working through the catacombs of politics , pouring oil upon the troubled machinery of national politics so that where the one smashes through in ruthless effort at conquest , the other follows after with soft words , with the trappings of intellectualism and the tenuous and slithering tactics of the ancient masters of deception and ensnaring . We refer to one called Sidney Hillman . " <P> For once an A. F. of L. spokesman had turned out a brand of invective as good as that of John L. Lewis . The report , attributed to the pens of little Matthew Woll and'John P. Frey and adopted by a convention vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. executive council be empowered to expel suspended C. I. O. unions at its own discretion . The rebel unions marked for first expulsion were John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers of America and Sidney Hillman 's Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America-C . I. O. 's twin financial pillars . Least likely to be ousted was David Dubinsky 's International Ladies Garment Workers , for Mr. Dubinsky has long wanted peace . Moreover , Mr. Dubinsky , who has always played second fiddle to Mr. Hillman in the needle trades , though his union is bigger , is now in a jurisdictional war with Mr. Hillman . <P> So A. F. of L. tried a double maneuver , appealing over the heads of the C. I. O. high command to the C. I. O. rank &; file , with the idea of driving wedges between : <P> 1 ) Mr. Dubinsky and Mr. Hillman , and <P> 2 ) Messrs . Hillman &; Lewis and their own union members . To Mr. Lewis ' miners the report spoke of " . . . officers who levy upon them huge assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillman 's clothing workers it mentioned " . . . undue special assessments for purposes of political aggrandizement . " As for Mr. Dubinsky 's garment workers , A. F. of L. could not believe that they would " . . . long tolerate invasions of their jurisdiction , the ignoring and belittling of their officers , the whispered and undercover ridicule of their leaders . . . . " <P> Since John Lewis had a pretty good hunch that something like this would happen at Denver , he scheduled a national conference of all 32 constituent C. I. O. unions which opened last week in Atlantic City 's Hotel President , where the C. I. O. was conceived at the A. F. of L. 's historic 1935 convention . <P> There were no social functions , no civic ceremonies . All sessions were to be closed but President Heywood Broun of the American Newspaper Guild got them opened after the first day . Like A. F. of L. , C. I. O. declared for a Japanese boycott , condemned the National Labor Relations Board . It unanimously resolved that contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past 16 months , more than $900,000 on the steel strike alone . But just as C. I. 0 . was A. F. of L. 's principal business , so A. F. of L. turned out to be the most important concern of C.I.O.
