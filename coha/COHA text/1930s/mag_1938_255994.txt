Last week the U. S. Government did the following for and to U. S. Business : <P> Relaxed its tax laws to a certain extent as Congress passed the Doughton-Vinson Tax Bill ( see p. 11 ) . <P> Improved its relations with the utility industry ( see p. 52 ) . <P> Sharpened its vigil against monopoly in the oil industry . A 1935 law stipulates that no one operator , individual or corporation may hold more than 2,560 acres of oil land in any one petroleum structure or 7,680 acres in any one State . Big companies have dominated more territory than this , however , through prospecting permits and operating contracts with prospectors . Last week Secretary of the Interior Ickes ruled that the companies must include such territory in their list of holdings and ( he total must cleave to the law . Object : to keep down overproduction , give wider scope to the small independents . <P> Continued its slow legislative moves to help the hard-pressed railroads ( carloadings last week were 30% under those of a year ago ) . Added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft of a bill presented by Labor Executive George Harrison to allow railroads to reorganize without entering the courts under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act . This section , the roads ' only present recourse when they go to the wall , is so phrased that not one of the 25 Class I roads to try it has succeeded in reorganizing because bondholders have been unable to agree with stockholders as to which will take the loss . Mr. Harrison proposes that upon application to a Federal district court certifying that it had reached an agreement with creditors representing 35% of its debts , a railroad could file a voluntary plan of reorganization to become effective when approved by the remaining creditors . <P> Considered licensing all companies doing interstate business . SEC proposed the idea to protect investors from a number of abuses it has unearthed in various corporate reorganizations and to counteract a general laxity of corporate law in certain States . Alternate proposal : use of taxing power to make more difficult incorporations under the statutes of these lax States . <P> Relaunched its stalled drive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission established a set of minima , but after coalmen brought suit , charging the Commission 's methods were too dictatorial , these minima were shelved , B. C. C. Chairman Charles Franklin Hosford Jr . resigned and there was a general collapse of the coal price structure ( TIME , Dec. 27 , et seq . ) . Since then the Commission has wearily begun all over again , this time under the guidance of Percy Tetlow . Last week , with data for new minima almost complete and with Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. of Arkansas filing the only suit now pending challenging the B. C. C. 's constitutionality , the Commission made grim-faced , 62-year-old Mr. Tetlow its official chairman . Coal miner 's son , Percy Tetlow entered the mines himself at twelve , was a charter member of the United Mine Workers , began his career as a U. M. W. executive alongside William Green . When Percy Tetlow was fighting in the Argonne. his job was filled by none other than John L. Lewis . Now Miner Tetlow is Miner Lewis ' right-hand man on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the work of two-.he lost his left in an auto accident .
