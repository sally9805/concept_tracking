THE BASIC WRITINGS OF SIGMUND FREUD-Edited by Dr. A. A. Brill-Modem Library ( $1.25 ) . <P> Among scientists the theories of Sigmund Freud are still disputed , most vigorously by former . Freudians . But modern novelists have followed him like children after the Pied Piper . His influence has been the greatest single factor in determining the course of modern fiction , and future literary historians may well refer to Joyce and Mann as great Freudians in the way that Thackeray and George Eliot are now called great Victorians . Freud has exercised a greater literary influence than any other living writer . His 35 volumes are packed with literary allusions , with shrewd criticisms on poetry and fiction , with case histories that read like novels ; but critics have not investigated his standing as a man of letters , which may turn out to be as great as his standing as a man of science . <P> Last week readers had a chance to see for themselves where Freud stood as a writer , when his faithful disciple , Dr. Abraham Arden Brill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his major works . The demonstration was not quite fair to Freud . For Dr. Brill included as Freud 's basic writing heavy , abstract works like his Totem and Taboo , which is an important contribution to psychoanalytic theory , but hard reading for laymen . He left out such Freudian classics as The Case of Miss Elisabeth R , and The Case of Miss Lucy R. These early works of Freud , simply and artfully written , revealing an extraordinary grasp of character and a lightning insight into human motives , are as readable as the stories of Maupassant , which they somewhat resemble in their worldly , ironic tone . <P> Freud 's writings are always dramatic . In the world that he pictures , man 's ego is always at war with his unconscious ; sons are at war with their fathers ; man 's sexual instinct , as deeply rooted as his hunger for food , is at war with the norms and conditions of social life . And contrary to the usual impression , most of Freud 's writing deals with the simplicities and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreaming , blundering and forgetting , not with sexual aberrations and sexual crimes . <P> The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud begins with Freud 's amiable observations on the common phenomenon of forgetting . Aside from its jawbreaking title ( The Psychopathology of Everyday Life ) this is homely and domestic stuff , telling about people who forget their keys , lock themselves out of rooms which-unconsciously - they do not want to enter , forget the names of people they pretend to like , and forget engagements they do not want to keep . In this universal comedy of psychological errors , typesetters drop words from headlines , proofreaders overlook absurd mistakes , genteel ladies make slips of the tongue which transform innocent sentences into obscenities . But all these accidents , says Freud , are meaningful . People forget-which means that they drive from their conscious minds-incidents that have unpleasant associations for them , such as feelings of guilt . Chance or faulty actions bring them to light again , reveal the character of buried repressions , and in such actions the unconscious expresses itself .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
