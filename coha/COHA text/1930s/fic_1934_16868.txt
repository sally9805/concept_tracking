From the distance we hear the sound of gourd drums  --  the sound nears , and now we hear the rattle of the feathered gourds which are a part of the ancient dance still cherished by the native Hawaiians . As the music grows clearer , we hear the musical thrumming sound of the stringed instruments  --  and one by one , in thrilling spectacle the first native girls , in shredded palm-leaf skirts , dance out of the jungle toward the fires . The music and the drums swell until the girls are followed by the men into the clearing beyond the lagoon . The beauty of the native hula is thus doubled by the smooth , mirror-like waters of the still lagoon .

With her is Lieutenant Quibble ( played as a fawning comedian by Oskie . ) Dick ( the Private ) is seen carrying in the new Colonel 's bags ... Kit takes over the Hawaiian Post in feminine manner ( which is the basis for the whole play 's satire )  --  she complains about the barrenness of the Army quarters , wants a maid . Dick explains that the Army has n't started to enlist maids as yet . Kit calls for her aide : " Quibble , Quibble , I want Quibble ! " Quibble appears . Kit demands , pointing to Dick : " Who is this man ? " " He 's a Private , Colonel . " " A private what ? " Quibble explains that that is the lowest rank  --  79  --  in the Army .. then comes a Corporal , a Sergeant , a Lieutenant . The Lady Colonel beams : " Oh , I know about Sergeants ... I 've seen them in the movies ... They 're named Quirt , are n't they ? " Quibble bows , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a commanding gesture  --  " Well , name ALL Sergeants Quirt  --  I like the name !

The Colonel stamps her foot : " Well , I do n't like it  --  it 's too olivey-drabbish  --  paint it pink . I like pink . From now on , the Army 's color is pink ! " " Yes , Colonel . " The aide reminds her of a conference awaiting her with the officers of the Post . " Call it off I have n't had a bath or anything . Call all conferences off . We wo n't have any in my Army . " " Yes , Colonel . " And Quibble goes . The Lady Colonel focuses on Dick , her Private . " So you 're a Private ? " She surveys him . " Yes , ma'am .

I mean Colonel ... but we have to do  --  80  --  lots of things in the Army  --  we would n't choose to do outside , Miss ! " ( The CAMERA plays on a close shot in the above speech , and we realize that aside from the play for the audience , the flames are afire between the real boy and girl on the stage  --  Dick 's lines are double-edged . ) " I want my bath !

" " Yes , Colonel . " And the door closes  --  leaving Dick to sing a plaintive lament along the lines of : " How can I call her Colonel  --  When it 's Sweetheart That I Mean ? ? " At the end of the song , Kit comes out in a clinging silk dress , designed on Army lines , with a Colonel 's eagle over her heart  --  but seductively beautiful . The Colonel finds her Private standing at attention outside her bathroom door . She feels languorous . She looks up , murmurs : " Are n't you going  --  81  --  to salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's against orders . " " Then let 's go outdoors ... let 's go look at Hawaii and volcanoes . " " But the reception in your honor , Colonel ! " " But my orders , Private ! " " Yes , ma'am ! " They pause at the door , and we see our Colonel weakening . She pauses in the doorway , enroute to her car : " Are the volcanoes active ... Private ? ? " " We 'll know better after we get there , Colonel . SECOND SCENE  --  THE CLIFF : The Colonel orders the Private to take her to the beach ... just as Kit had once ordered Dick out of the car . THIRD SCENE  --  NATIVE VILLAGE , LUAU . The Lady Colonel finds herself just a woman after all ... and sings plaintively to the audience : " How Can I Run an Army When I 'm Having Private Troubles Of My Own ? " " We intercut the pleased General and Audience ... and the face of Lieutenant Biddle  --  grimly unamused as he sees : ) Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding his commanding officer in the arms of her private . Oskie plays the scene in a bravo-heroic manner and denounces the boy for playing ping-pong with their Lady Colonel on the sand . Dick is ordered back to the barracks , as Oskie croons his sorrowful  --  82  --  lai : " I 'd like to Be an Aide to My Colonel , But I 'm no Good at Love .... " ( Biddle , in the General 's box , is sitting up rigidly by this time  --  there is no doubt left in his mind as to the real background of the farcical scene on the stage before him . ) Kit interrupts Oskie 's solo , protesting in song that : Under a Private 's Coat There Beats the Heart of a Man . ( NOTE : These songs can be designed as comedy or special numbers as the spot demands . The " Smoking in the Dark " number , if it is used , Dark stage ... glowing tips , dance number ... huge cigarettes glowing , smoke trailing .... ) FINALE TO FIRST ACT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lieutenant denounces all Private 's attentions to their lovely Colonel  --  she is only for the officers of the Post . Whereupon all the officers strike , singing " Off for West Point " ... to Become Officers and come back for Their Lady Colonel . As they march off in body  --  Dick in the lead , the Lady Colonel tearfully rushes out declaring : " Where My Army goes  --  there go I ... " and leaving her aide and officers flat , she runs from the stage . ( Through the progress of the play , we intercut scenes between the real Kit and Dick in the wings  --  we know their hearts are aching , but in defense , they are the more cruel to each other . Dick sardonically reminds her that whether she likes it or not , the plot calls for a kiss they have never rehearsed  --  at the final curtain ; he assures her that it will be just as painful to him as it will be to her ! At intermission , Biddle 's blood is hot in his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83  --  because of the dowagers on each side of him ... he awaits the Second Act with a set jaw . ) SECOND ACT WEST POINT The Privates are now cadets , singing mournfully the West Point Lament  --  " No Mustache , No Hoarse , No Women Allowed . " Our Lady Colone1 is now Superintendent of the Academy , Quibble is her devoted Aide ... the weaknesses of womannd are brought out  --  she wo n't go to observe battle practice because the guns scare her when they go off  --  she refuses to allow Dick to take part because he might get hurt ! Quibble protests , so the head-strong Lady Colonel calls the whole thing off . She WO N'T have all those nice boys off some place shooting guns and fighting and catching their death of colds ! So it is that the Government countermands all earlier orders over-night with the wisdom borne of experience  --  that the woman 's place is in the HOME  --  not giving ORDERS ! !

The Finale brings the time for the kiss between Dick and Kit , as Biddle stares , green , from the audience . The two youngsters come together in the middle  --  84  --  of the stage , and Kit gazes defiantly up at Dick as he finishes his song to her ... takes her in his arms ... The orchestra softly plays a reprisal of the Hawaiian music that had stirred their hearts three years before ... their music .... Dick turns her proud chin up ... all of the unspoken thoughts in his heart are in his eyes as he bends to kiss her . Their lips melt together as Kit 's eyes close ... and for those few seconds , all turmoil and conflict are washed away ... they are back together in Hawaii , loving each other impulsively , intensely ..... Biddle 's jaw tightens , as Oskie , leading the b.g. chorus , has to repeat the last line of the song twice  --  wide-eyed  --  in order to give that kiss time to dissolve .
