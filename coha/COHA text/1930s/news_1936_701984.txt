txt Twelve members of the Police Department , including several who have been cited for bravery or otherwise commended , face departmental trials on charges of having paid sums ranging from $500 to $1,000 to a fixer in unsuccessful attempts to buy promotions to the rank of sergeant , it was disclosed yesterday . Five of the men named have confessed the charges and one of them is being kept under constant surveillance by detectives , it was revealed by Police Commissioner Valentine , because of his threats of violence against the investigators and the informer who bared the alleged conspiracy , identified by officials only as Pat . The seven others deny the bribe payments , but in their cases " some supplementary evidence has been produced to throw doubt on their denials , " according to a report made by Paul Blanshard , Commissioner of Accounts , to Mayor La Guardia , who transmitted it to Mr. Valentine . Got $18,000 , Informer Says Mr. Blanshard , Irving Ben Cooper , his special counsel , and members of their office have been engaged for two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the department paid him $18,000 in 1930 and 1931 for advancement on the list of eligibles for promotion to the rank of sergeant . Investigation of the affairs of eight of the men , however , has failed to develop any corroborative evidence to support Pat 's assertion , and accordingly their names were withheld from publication in Mr. Blanshard 's report . One man was dismissed from the force in 1933 and , while he has admitted payment , no action will be taken in his case . No criminal charges can be placed against any one involved in the affair because of the operation of the statute of limitations , Mr. Valentine said , and only one of the men has been relieved from duty . Patrolman James M. Walsh of the Flushing precinct , the man alleged to have threatened the examiners , has been suspended because of his " nervous and over-wrought condition , " according to Mr. Valentine . Pat , the informer , who started the investigation , is the man who was planted in the Tombs prison recently to act as an undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he obtained from a fellow-prisoner , a woman and two men were arrested last Monday on charges of conspiring to sell counterfeit bonds . Pat will appear as a witness at the departmental trials but meanwhile his name will be kept secret , Mr. Valentine said . He declared that Pat was a former accountant and a man of intelligence , and Mr. Blanshard said that six weeks of the most rigorous investigation had failed to refute a single detail of his story . Says He Split the Money Pat told Mr. Blanshard that he expected to be able to make good on the promised promotions through John Meyers , with whom he said he split a large part of the $18,000 he received . Meyers or Meyer , a former member of the Examining Board of Plumbers , disappeared during the Seabury investigation in 1932 and has been a fugitive from New York ever since . As a matter of fact , however , none of the twelve men facing trial was promoted to sergeant and only one of them even made the list of eligibles , some 600 places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " there is no evidence whatever that Pat or any other fixer had the power to change the results of any civil service examine. - I tion . ' Pat has twice previously been convicted of fixing activities and is now on probation under suspended sentence . He was indicted last year for fixing on evidence developed by Mr. Blanshard 's staff , the report asserted , and was located in a New Jersey jail , where he was serving a sentence for a crime committed in Passaic . He was extradited here and in effect turned State 's evidence by telling his story to the investigators . The patrolmen who face trial , with the amounts they are alleged to have paid , are as follows : Sidney Walsh , $1,000 ; James M. Walsh , $1,000 ; Louis Waxman , $750 ; James Kennelly , $500 ; John V. Halk , $500 ; Louis Schwartz , $1,000 ; William Vatter , $1,000 ; Wilfred Childs , $1,000 ; Daniel Kerrigan , $1,000 ; Frank Schettino , $500 ; John Lynch , $1,000 , and Charles Bowman , $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Halk and Lynch have confessed , according to Mr. Blanshard , as did Charles J. McCarthy , who was dimissed from the force in 1933 . Departmental charges have been placed against all the men now in the department except Schettino , who is now on vacation . They will be placed against him on his return . Halk and Kennelly are both detectives , and Halk has an exceptionally fine record . He was cited for excellent police duty four times , in 1927 , 1929 , 1932 and 1934 , and in 1933 he received a commendation . Lynch also has an unusually good record ; in 1935 he was commended for capturing two burglars , and Vatter 's record has been good throughout twenty-four years ' service , ' the report said . While James Walsh was being examined in Mr. Blanshard 's office March 13 by Donald K. Marcus . and Gilbert E. Goodkind he made several general threats against them , the report said . " He declared that if he was ' breken ' he would not go out without causing plenty of fireworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric chair , and said ' I would either shoot my brains out or be willing to burn . ' He continued in this vein for half an hour and clearly indicated that the objects of his threats were our examiners and Pat . Try to Shield Informer While Mr. Blanshard and Mr. Valentine were very secretive about Pat 's identity , it became known that last March Mr. Blanshard wrote General Sessions Judge Donellan asking a suspension of sentence for Harold Paroly , 42 years old , of 882 Fairmont Avenue , the Bronx , who had pleaded guilty to a fixing charge before him . Mr. Blanshard explained in his letter that Paroly had given him information " which will enable us to bring charges against certain city employes . " Judge Donellan suspended sentence , but he said he did so " indignantly " because Paroly 's record showed that he had several times previously got into trouble " and out of it by squealing on some one else . " Paroly 's record showed that he was convicted in 1932 in Federal court of aiding a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he received a sentence of one year , which was suspended . In the same year he was convicted of grand larceny in the Bronx and sentenced to two and a half to five years , but sentence was stayed . In July , 1935 , he was arrested in Paterson , N. J. , for embezzlement but was discharged after he had made restitution , and on Aug. 16 , 1935 , he was discharged at Passaic , N. J. , on a charge of obtaining money under false pretenses and was turned over to the New York authorities . He was tried before Judge Donellen on a charge of having taken $500 to obtain an appointment as a motor vehicle inspector . He turned State 's evidence against his co-defendant , David Culkin , alias Kolker , who was acquitted by direction of Judge Donellan . Mr. Blanshard 's report said that ' Pat ' employed a David Kolke ? as a " gobetween. "
