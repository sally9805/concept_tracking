The Sabbath calm at turreted Windsor Castle , where King George , Queen Elizabeth and their daughters were spending the weekend , was shattered last week as the castle was " bombed " in a mock air-raid . No airplanes flecked the sky and the Royal Family strolled about the grounds as the " bombs " went off around them . The " bombs " : nothing more than mighty firecrackers . The only damage : a window in the Royal Mews which fell clattering to the ground as a " bomb " went off too close . Windsor volunteers , organized in decontamination and first-aid squads , raced over the grounds aiding the fake " victims . " All this was part of a test cf the air-raid preparations for the castle , recently fitted with anti-gas and bombproof chambers . Eton College , just across the Thames , also was " attacked . " The mock-raids began with an evening blackout , ended with divine service in the Windsor Parish Church .               @ @ @ @ @ @
