The more they charge us with their separate problems the more we know they are vitally and humanly alive .

To accomplish that , the 19th advised that districts , counties and communities should organize ( using existing organizations where intelli gently possible ) for child health , education and welfare . They should have : 1 ) trained full-time public health officials with public health nurses , sanitary inspectors and laboratory workers ; 2 ) available hospital beds ; 3 ) full-time public welfare services for the relief and aid of children in special need from poverty or misfortune , for the protection of children from abuse , neglect , exploitation , moral hazard ; 4 ) voluntary organization of children for instruction , health , recreation .
