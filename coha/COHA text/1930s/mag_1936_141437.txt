Corn , a humble U. S. crop that usually stays on the farm to feed hogs , cattle and chickens , had its day last week . What had been expected to be one of the greatest corn yields in history had shriveled under Drought , as of Aug. 1 , to 1,439,000.000 bu . <P> ( normal : 2,500,000,000 ) , smallest since 1881 . Buyers scouring the country for corn were finding that farmers were not selling , needed far more feed than they had grown . Husking bees had been postponed for want of ears to husk . And in the Chicago grain pit , traders suddenly realized that outstanding sales of corn for September delivery were double the supply in terminal grain elevators . Suddenly corn bounced up 3 ? per bu. , nearly the full 4 limit allowed by the Chicago Board of Trade for one day . <P> In the two great corn states of Iowa and Illinois , the temperature rose to 115 and in the grain pit corn kept pace , next day mounting a full 4 to $1.16 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $1.14 a bushel ) for the first time in six years . Next day September-delivery corn rose 3 ! to $1. igf , a price unequaled since the great days when War-starved Europe bought all the U. S. grain it could get . and cash corn sold up to $2.17 per bu . <P> Meanwhile corn truckers were paying farmers better than $1 a bushel at the farm and spot corn in Chicago was bringing as much as $1.37 . <P> Since corn is the staple hog diet , " corn on the hoof " ( i.e. , hogs ) last week rose too . Headlines read : RETURN OF THE $12 HOG . As corn passed wheat , it became too dear to feed hogs , whose diet was thereupon switched to wheat , which is a better meat-builder , anyway . <P> Alarmed by the corn flurry , the Chicago Board of Trade Clearing House last week raised trading firms ' margins from 3 to 4 ; a bu. , equalling the margins for wheat , oats and barley , and the Board of Trade required non-members to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This made the official requirement 8 instead of 4 , but grain houses were already asking from 8 to 10 margin per bu . <P> At $1.19 ! a bu. , corn was far above the world price . Promptly toward the U. S. <P> sailed part of Argentina 's estimated exportable surplus of 246,000,000 bu. including Argentine corn that had already reached Rotterdam . At Buenos Aires corn cost only 54 Thus shippers could pay the 25U . S. tariff and still have a 51 margin for shipping cost and profit . Last week some 20,000,000 bu. of Argentine corn were already bound for the U. S. Most of it will not reach Chicago before mid-September . <P> With the frightening approach of Argentine corn and the ' ' pessimistic " news that showers had wet down Illinois , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Indiana and Iowa , corn sold off at week 's end , dropping below wheat again .
