txt This Country 's Position . I commend your editorial on the necessity of our declaring that we shall permit no trade with Italy as long as she shall make war . The President and his advisers have not gone far enough , in prohibiting shipments of arms and : their accessories , and the Neutrality ' Act was and is a futile gesture if we continue to supply one belligerent to the. , ' detriment of the other . An immediate declaration cutting our- ; selves off from an avowed aggressor is ' necessary and imperative ; not that as ' a country we need to decide the Judicial aspects of the case , but because we have maintained all along we shall be neutral . Sentiment against the injustice of Italy and the miserable plight of the un der dog represented by Ethiopia can soon be fanned into flame in our coun- ' etry , and w must avoid the possibility . ?
