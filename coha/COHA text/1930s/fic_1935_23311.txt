FELLOW-ALUMNI OF MAMMOTH ! PORTRAIT OF AN ALUMNI SECRETARY BY JOHN R. TUNIS E ERY year about this time , 28,956 graduates of Mammoth University receive the following letter , the date and place only being different for each locality . Dear Brother of Mammoth : I am writing you a personal letter regarding the annual meeting of the Mammoth Club of Chicago , because it is my belief that your name may not be on the mailing list , and that you may not , therefore , have received any notice of the dinner which will be held on December 8 at the Stevens . Professor Robert H. Moody spoke to me recently about you and your activities since you left the College of Liberal Arts in 1920 . I hope very much that you will be present to renew old contacts and hear the speakers : President E. Medingwell Jackson , Head Coach William J. ( Doc ) Maguire , and George F. Murphy , ' 14 , vice-president of General Electric . With every good wish , In the service of the University , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of recipients of this letter throw it into the wastebasket along with the department-store advertisements and the market letters from stock dopesters . Enough of them respond , however , to make Chuck Walker 's job a paying proposition . In describing Chuck and his activities , do not make the mistake of assuming him to be typical of the genus alumni secretary . No one ever saw a typical alumni secretary . They are all different . There is Ned Baker of East Dakota , put in by the power trust which controls the university , to sell East Dakota to the taxpayers . A magnificent job he does too . Ned is the prize go-getter of alumni secretaries , he has the rest of them up there swinging and missing , because he has money to spend ( at /east so I hear ) , knows how to spend it , and puts his stuff across with the old Los Angeles whoopla . Then there is the dean of alumni secretaries , George ( Deacon ) Smith of Michigan ; and the high and mighty type like Brownell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money-grabbing activities under such a cloud of lofty disinterestedness that he fools everyone but himself . No , Chuck is not typical . By no means , and please do n't write in anger to the editor to point out that he is n't like Smith of Ohio State or Johnson of De Pauw , because I am as well aware of this fact as you are . However , there is a good deal of Chuck Walker in every alumni secretary , and a little of them all in Chuck . Back in 1925 , Chuck  --  who at graduation had been voted most popular man in his class , man most likely to succeed , and man who had done most for Mammoth  --  was an extremely successful insurance salesman , for he knew more graduates of the old coil by sight than anyone , not excluding Dean Jones himself . Why he ever came back to Mammoth is one of those mysteries . It is no secret to anyone ( including himself ) that he could make ten times his salary in business . Yet he turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 of General Motors , and more recently one from Rogers ' 09 of Midland Steel , something even he hardly understands . Undoubtedly Chuck is touched with a fanatical zeal for Mammoth , a feeling which seldom inspires Head Coach William J. ( Doc ) Maguire , the football coach , or Eddie ( Good Clean Sport ) Morgan , the athletic director . There is more in it than this too , because they both have large salaries and perquisites , whereas Chuck 's salary is only $6,000 , and his perquisites are non-existent . The fact is that he believes in the divine right of Mammoth . Is there a duty greater than that of a graduate to his alma mater ? Is there any loyalty finer than a degree holder 's to the University ? When Chuck hears the name Mammoth he thinks of Senior Sing-Songs on a warm evening in June , of the famous football victory over Minnesota back in 1924 , of the crew racing ahead to victory at Poughkeepsie , of the long line of distinguished men who have brought fame to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious fervor . Chuck is a curious mixture of enthusiasms and common sense ; at one and the same time he is a high-powered Rotarian and a hard-headed business man ; he combines sentiment with a knowledge of the fact that two and two add up to four . To those who imagine that he has a softish job with all kinds of furious motion and nothing much to do , it may be well to point out that he is a terrific worker , that he knows not the meaning of the word discouragement , and that the demands upon him have no relation to the eight-hour day . He is a Chesterfield , a party whip , a ward heeler , and a big business executive as occasion and the company demand . Chuck 's qualifications for his job are many . He has a sense of humor as prominent as his red hair , which after ten years ' service as alumni secretary is now slightly sandy and speckled with gray . He is Disraeli , Jim Farley , Stalin , and Gladstone rolled into one ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , and he eats self-sacrifice three times a day with his meals . Years of disappointment have given him a hide like an elephant even though they have not squelched his spontaneity . He still loves a good fight , is able to down an opponent in public battle , and can cheat fairly and squarely when the moment and his adversary demand such tactics . Of course Chuck is a good mixer , never forgets a name or a face , has a vast and amazing knowledge of human nature ( which never surprises him ) , and is all things to all men from that prince of prigs , President Jackson , down to poor old Tompkins , ' 13 , who has just been released from the State prison for a slight mix-up in the books of his company , and who  --  naturally  --  turns to Chuck when he must find something to eat . II Part of Chuck 's job , and by no means the least part , is to obtain publicity for the University . Favorable publicity if possible , but publicity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public eye , and is fairly successful . Thanks to Head Coach William J. ( Doc ) Maguire and his winning Conference eleven , little effort is needed on Chuck 's part from August until December ; but unfortunately the football season lasts only three months of the year and during the other nine his ingenuity is thoroughly tested . Once he instituted a beauty Contest that has since become an annual event , in which Mammoth 's most lovely co-ed is chosen by a committee of leading artists including John La Gana , Russell Patterson , and Howard Chandler Christy . The lady 's photograph , with a release for the press headed " Mammoth 's Most Beautiful , " goes to all newspapers on Chuck 's Iist . When the seniors have their annual questionnaire each spring , he has the results on the desk of every city editor within a few hours . As the seniors invariably choose the New York Times as their favorite newspaper , Kipling 's " If " as their favorite poem , Joan Crawford as their favorite actress , and Harvard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually written and ready weeks before the actual poll . His relations with the daily press are especially harmonious , and many an harassed city editor calls on Chuck for help and assistance in time of trouble . Does a trustee of the University die suddenly ? Chuck is ready with the man 's obit and his latest picture . At graduation he sends out to a hundred different newspapers the names of the graduates from their city with a word or two about the activities of each man . If the graduate has not been prominent in the athletic , social , or intellectual life of the University , he is always " one of the most popular men in the senior class . " Tacked on as a rider is a short account of the Commencement activities at Mammoth , which not infrequently is also printed . Naturally , publicity is harder to obtain between times , but Chuck is always in there pitching . Once John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , visited the graduate school of Business Administration . Chuck managed to get him interviewed in the Mammoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of the story that every newspaper in the country the next day carried a front-page yarn headed " John D 's Son Says Frats Waste Time . " Chuck denied any part in this , but those on the inside know better . One bleak winter afternoon Chuck , wandering across the campus , met Professor Schmaltz , a Leipzig chemistry savant ejected from Germany for the crime of doing his own thinking , who ended up at Mammoth in much the same bewilderment in which an English novelist ends up at Hollywood . " Hullo , Professor , what 's new ? " asked Chuck cheerily . The professor , not certain whether Chuck was subservient to the President or the other way round , explained haltingly that he was doing research on a synthetic substance resembling porcelain which could not be broken . Two days later every daily in the country carried this information under a heading such as : " Housewives , Attention ! Prof At Mammoth Discovers Unbreakable China . " This , however , is not to say that all Chuck 's publicity work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligently prosecuted and carried out with the aid of several Mammoth graduates in the State Legislature , to make automobile license plates in red and green , the University colors . It was also his idea to have Commencement a week earlier as a convenience for farmer graduates . " Opportunities for soul friction " is the phrase which Chuck uses in his advance publicity to lure the graduates back to the University at Commencement time . And he it was who induced President Jackson to send out Christmas cards to all alumni , with a picture of Mammoth Hall snowbound . " Costs a lot of money , Chuck , " said of his alirumni , and secretary worth a lot too.too. morning " ever realize this the only time of the year the alumni hear from us that we are n't asking for cash ? " the President , scrutinizing the budget The President realized this , and those Christmas cards you now receive bearing Mammoth 's best wishes are the result . Alumni activities pay big dividends and , as the President immediately appreciated , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up good will for the University . And that little ten-page booklet you Mammoth men get every year explaining how wisely the University funds are invested and administered , and how easy it is to make a Bequest to Mammoth by tearing out the blank form on the last page which is a testamentary devise with everything filled in except the sum  --  well , that was Chuck 's idea also . A great money-getter too . ( In case this is n't clear , President Jackson or Raymond G. MacCracken , Treasurer , will be glad to write you about general or specific needs of the University in which you may be specially interested . ) III Occasionally Chuck 's zeal for Mammoth gets him into trouble , but rarely into such trouble that he can not find the way out . Obviously Chuck never overlooks a bet , and whenever he discovers that a good prospect had any connection with the University , the man is slapped on to the mailing list with no questions asked . In 1929 , when Rollin Thorndyke  --  who rose from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mason , Matthews and Thorndyke  --  was putting out his investment trust , Bank Stock Investors , Inc. , Chuck discovered that Rollin had once taken a six weeks ' course in business bookkeeping at Mammoth . Did n't that make him a loyal Mammoth man ? And Chuck instantly wrote him a letter ( form fib , Miss Botsford ) congratulating him on his success and ending with cordial good wishes . Have you forgotten Rollin 's disaster ? He tried to control that pool in International Copper  --  rememberwith disastrous results ? In 1932 he was broke , in 1933 he was bankrupt , and a year later was on his way to prison charged with  --  horrid word  --  embezzlement . Luckily Chuck by then had discovered that Rollin was not really a Mammoth man at all , but had simply attended one session of the Summer School . To his best friends in editorial chairs Chuck sent a personal letter explaining that Thom-dyke , the defaulting hanker , was not a graduate of the University , " in fact had never been actually enrolled in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of intellectual Jim Farley . He is the whooper-up for the whole University . Nor does he stay in Mammoth the year round ; wherever the alumni are , there are his constituents . You may be interested to see how he keeps in touch with them , and also to take a look behind the scenes in Alumni House , which is a first-class laboratory of applied alumnistics . Chuck 's offices are on the first floor , for he believes that nothing stops traffic like a flight of stairs , and he sees to it that his own room , the headquarters of the organization  --  which might be described as a mail-order house selling Mammoth  --  is extremely accessible . Over the four doors leading out from the main central hall are huge placards . Above Chuck 's door the placard reads : " HAVE YOU GIVEN TO THE ALUMNI FUND ? THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF ITS FRIENDS , FACULTY , AND GRADUATES . MAKE YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS IN ROOM 406 . " Let 's go in . Excuse me , could we see Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of friends of Mammoth . Thank you . No formalities , notice this ; right away his secretary is ushering us into the great man 's presence , and we are re-ceiving his hearty handshake and hearing his cheery voice . Chuck 's job is to sell Mammoth . He does not hesitate . " We figure it this way , " he explains , leaning intently over his desk at the two heathen before him . " Now that tuition you paid , 1360 ? no , you boys were class of ' 14 , I mean ' 24 , yes , ' course , I remember you both very well , ? now that tuition was 1250 then , was n't it ; well , now , $250 was only 42 per cent of what it cost the University to educate you . Think of that ! Therefore Mammoth gave you a scholarship of 58 per cent of your tuition for four years , did n't she ? " He pauses and looks at us triumphantly . We look at each other . We guess maybe she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now we do n't ask you to make this up . Oh , no . We do n't expect it . We only want a gesture , something to show you appreciate what the old school did for you . Say just a mere ten dollars a year , nothing more . " Ten dollars ! This makes us feel like a couple of pikers . Only ten dollars when we owe the old toll all that money ? The fact is , though Chuck does n't tell us , he would be glad if we 'd only pay a dollar , but he knows that just as many will pay ten as one if good salesmanship is used . And , as he explains to the President , it 's better to get everyone in at ten dollars than to have to chisel $50,000 out of a few rich graduates who gripe at the idea even when it saves them money on their income taxes . Chuck can make you feel an awful tightwad , but maybe that 's because no one ever takes the trouble to analyze his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consider the salaries the University had to pay to steal Professor Romaine away from Johns Hopkins and Professor Johnston from Yale , and if you add in the cost of building the new two-million-dollar Sociological Laboratory . The trouble is that most of us never saw these illustrious savants or the inside of the Sociological Laboratory . We had what passed for an education from a lot of half-baked instructors little older or wiser than we were . To us , the heads of departments were vague figures who waved pointers from a platform once a week during our senior year . If we counted only the cost of the men who actually taught us and the equipment we used , Mammoth ought to be paying us a generous sum yearly for the money we wasted . Naturally few graduates trouble to think things through , and if they did they would n't be allowed much time by Chuck , who hustles us from room to room in order that we may get an idea of the workings of the organization of which , not unjustly , he is proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking down letters from dictaphones  --  an indication of the way Chuck works . On the walls of the office are pictures of famous athletes , track stars , crews , and football All Americans . Here and there you see faded glimpses of Mammoth back in 1890 , and gorgeous views of the luxurious , up-to-date Mammoth of 1935 , showing what we have done in the way of progress in the past fifty years . Bookcases are piled high with photographs and documents from other colleges . If Northwestern comes out with a handsome book on " Educational Giving , " Chuck has it on his desk in twenty-four hours . That bulletin board marked " Other Universities " ? what does that mean ? Just one of Chuck 's ideas . On it are pinned the various folders , booklets , letters , tricks , gadgets , and devices sent out by his rivals . Any dodge that looks good ? which is , in other words , a moneygetter  --  is sure to be used immediately by Chuck , who knows a good thing when he sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into the next room . Over the door the sign reads : " HAVE YOU JOINED THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION ? ENROLL IN ALUMNI OFFICE , ROOM 203 . " This is the Stencil Room . If you graduated from Mammoth your name is on the stencil , or to put things bluntly , the college sucker list . Try to get offl IV The first thing here which catches your eye is a vast map covering one side of the entire wall , showing the United States dotted with pins and flags . Flags represent alumni clubs , pins show cities where there are more than twenty Mammoth grads , as yet unorganized . Below are two huge steel safes , six feet high , with small drawers . The drawers are full of cards , each card bearing the name of some alumnus , often with a dozen addresses written on it , for no address is ever discarded . Another steel and fireproof safe lists them geographically . Thus if Chuck wishes to start a Mammoth Club in Scranton , Pa. , he simply looks over the files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is the Holy of Holies of the office , those files are Chuck 's most valuable possession ; without them he would be worthless and he knows it . Along the other side of the room is a series of wooden files . These contain folders of every graduate : his picture for the papers , and any information about him that might in future be useful , such as newspaper cuttings or letters . " ARE YOU READING THE ALUMNI WEEKLY ? " So asks the placard over the door to the next room , where sits the editor of the Weekly hard at work . When Chuck came to Mammoth , one of his first jobs  --  he has long since turned it over to an assistant  --  was reorganizing the Alumni magazine . He YrYr found the Weekly a sorry affair , costing the office considerable money and more worry annually , with a subscription list of only a few thousand men , most of whom did not pay for it . As a rule its pages were filled with wheezy articles and dismal illustrations of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of Our Beloved Alma Mater , " or " Ezra McPuddle , Class of ' 63 , in the uniform of a Major in the Confederate Army . " Chuck rightly surmised that the brisk young graduates working in brokers ' offices wanted something more up to date , and he proceeded to give it to them . His cuts became modern  --  photographs of the new buildings of the University , of its championship eleven , of a record-breaking high jumper . Chuck to-day is not entirely convinced that the alumni as a body can read ; he therefore makes the magazine as snappy and pictorial as the National Geographic . The result has been a steady increase in circulation figures until at present he has one of the best , most popular , and most profitable alumni weeklies in the country , a sheet in which he can write about anything except defeat in athletics or the need of Mammoth for cash , two subjects never mentioned . The Weekly is Mammoth 's house organ . The leading article is generally on sport , profusely pictured . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big Conference game of the week . The largest amount of space is devoted to athletics , the next largest to personals . Chuck tries to mention every subscriber at least once a year . " Asa F. McOstrich , ' 08 , formerly president of the Apex Post Hole Co. , is now vice-president of the Goshen National Bank of Goshen , Texas . " Every Mammoth Club except the one in Sing Sing has its activities faithfully and fully reported . Moreover Chuck tries to have one good scrap going on all the time , and during the dull season he often starts the ball rolling himself by denouncing the R.O.T.C. , Head Coach Maguire , or some worthwhile institution of the University , signing himself , " Class of 1924 . " V Climbing the stairs ( we arc still in Alumni House , if you do n't mind ) , we are greeted by a minor league boiler factory in action . Bang , bang , clash , slam , bang  --  up here we are in the realm of action . Four addressograph machines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they bombard the Men of Mammoth for money , more money , and more money still . Chuck does n't care what you are : right wing or left wing , Communist or Ogden Mills Republican , Nazi or Seventh Day Adventist , so long as you are a Mammoth man and can sign a check . In the next room a battery of electric typewriters run by one girl is typing out personal letters to prominent graduates . To these personal letters only the name and address need to be added . With his mailing list of 28,956 , Chuck sends out 250,000 pieces of mail annually . When you realize that these go all over the world to Mammoth men situated in Chattanooga and China , you can imagine what his postage bill must be . All these letters are of course devoted to one subject , the precarious financial condition of the University . The next room is the headquarters of the Alumni Fund . Do you happen to enjoy statistics ? Well , Chuck has them ready to hurl at you on a moment 's notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best record for money-grabbing ( Chuck calls it by the grandiloquent term of " alumni generosity " ) , having raised $9,390,412.02 at a cost of one-half ofone per cent , while it cost Yale four and a half per cent to get her $44,558,683.08 ? Whereas Mammoth  --  here there is a long pause while Chuck lets the shameful fact sink in upon us  --  was seventh in the list , getting $26,735,854.66 from her alumni at the dreadful cost of eight and three-quarters per cent ? This plainly enough puts it up to us as loyal Mammoth men to come across and help make things right . The three Alumni Funds which produce the most revenue , says Chuck , are those of Dartmouth , Cornell , and Yale . He hands us their material , Please observe that it is largely pictorial , emotional , and not informative . No question of cash here ; that will come later under separate cover . But before we have had a chance to look over Chuck 's own masterpiece , with its cuts of the ivy-grown towers of Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their queer old costumes alongside the 1934 team , Mike the popular janitor of the Physics Lab , and Tom the Campus cop , Chuck has called our attention to five girls sitting at a long table who are busy slitting envelopes . They are extracting the booty . All money received must be counted , receipted for , and acknowledged within twenty-four hours , because if you ask for cash you ought to run the show on a businesslike basis . Well , here we are downstairs again in Chuck 's own sanctum . He left it only fifteen minutes ago , but in that short time his secretaries have piled his desk high with matters demanding immediate attention . He picks up one item just to show us how the system works . This is a cutting from a small daily in Wisconsin stating that Elmer J. Hoskins has been made president of the Outagamie County Bank and Trust Co . In red ink on the margin is the figure 22 . This means that Mr. Hoskins is a Mammoth graduate , class of 1922 . Chuck presses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devise in fee simple to Mammoth University , " the Hoskins folder is on his desk . Fingering the material therein , Chuck turns to a dictaphone and dictates a release for the Alumni Weekly about Mr. Hoskins , ending up with the statement that he is a " graduate of Mammoth , class of ' 22 , and one of her most loyal alumni . " He does not explain that big cross in blue pencil he makes on the cutting . This indicates that it is to be sent along to President Jackson , who next week will write a personal letter of congratulation ( form 8d , Miss Monroe ) to the lucky Mr. Hoskins . Dictaphones and addressograph machines , secretaries and offices : all this costs money . Where does it come from ? Partly from the funds of the University , which is why neither Chuck nor any other alumni office is ever independent of university con-trol . Partly also from the money of the graduates . Naturally the recent alumni are easy meat . " Nab ' em when they 're young " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June he personally interviews every senior with the assistance of the class officers , presenting the claims of the Alumni Association and securing the signatures of ninety-five per cent of those unfortunate and unworldly rascallions to notes for one hundred dollars , payable in ten installments to the maintenance fund of the University . In Chuck 's eyes the undergraduate is an unfledged alumnus who must be trained and directed to take his part as a dependable member of the great alumni body . This is not difficult . His chief worry comes from the older men . To win and keep their support needs clever handling . They have often been away from the campus for twenty years ; since their time the whole aspect of the University has changed , new faces have come , many of the old ones have vanished ; they no longer recognize their Mammoth . They can not understand the educational changes in the University they knew ; they are inclined to consider that the old place has gone to the dogs generally . Chuck 's job is to explain what has been happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things really have changed for the better . He does this partly by mail , partly by semi-annual visits to the various alumni clubs throughout the country , and by an innovation of which he is proud , Midwinter Day . Midwinter Day is one of his best promotional stunts . He asks all graduates back for twenty-four hours in the middle of the winter term when the University is functioning normally . They attend classes , are introduced to the faculty , given lunch and dinner , taken to a big Conference basketball game , and sent home the next day rejoicing . Chuck realizes that this not only keeps the graduates in touch with the University , but that many a man who must be blackjacked into returning for Commencement or Midwinter Day experiences an awakening of interest in the college and becomes a valuable ( financially speaking ) alumnus . VI If pan of Chuck 's job is keeping in touch with alumni , not the least important part these days when every educational institution in the country ? either secretly or openly  --  goes out for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-annual cross-country trip , Chuck drops into , say , San Francisco . There is no Mammoth Club in San Francisco , but there are a few scattered graduates : several Ph.D . ' s of education , a couple of men who spent a few years in the Engineering School , and one or two plain A.B . ' s . Chuck has invited them to lunch at the St. Francis ; they respond . After the meal he rises , greets them officially , and turns on a spigot of slushy reminiscences calculated to make the hearts of old Mammothians exceeding happy . He explains the changes , physical and educational , about the campus , mentions vaguely the intangible obligation of the older graduates to Mammoth and their responsibility to the coming generation , and then turns out the lights and shows them his new three-reel film , " Modern Mammoth , The College That Educated YOU . " Naturally a new Mammoth Club is organized , with officers , a Board of Governors , and a regular monthly meeting scheduled . To the first president , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functions of the club , and intimates that Mammoth wishes to be cosmopolitan , not parochial . He suggests that any likely young men should be induced to compete for the Mammoth Club of San Francisco Scholarship . " Yes , but where 's the money coming from for this-here scholarship ? " asks the president anxiously . " Do n't worry , the Dean will take care of that . " So the next fall Mammoth has two husky Californian halfbacks on the freshman football team . Within five years , as a result of their exploits at Mammoth and the publicity attached thereto , a regular stream of stalwart Californians will be going eastward to Mammoth for what they call an education . Chuck has the whole thing systematized ; he can turn a tap at any moment and get a flood of students from any part of the country . He knows the best towns in the United States for establishing Mammoth Clubs ; he knows that Topeka , Kansas , is the most fertile city in America for this purpose , and that no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also appreciates that these activities work both ways . By making thealumni act as scouts for students , he forces them to ask questions and become acquainted with the University as it exists to-day . Thus they become interested in its problems and keep abreast of changes in plant and curriculum , and Mammoth gets the boys while Chuck gets the money . It is hardly necessary to point out that he never leaves a Mammoth Club luncheon or dinner without a few strong hints about the University 's need for funds . " It is generally recognized , " he will say at the end of his speech , with a smile , " that the stimulation of  --  shall we call them alumni benefactions  --  is a legitimate function of my office . " The smile fades away , he looks sternly about the assembled lunchers as though daring them to prove otherwise . No one attempts to do so . Stimulate : to prick , to incite , to goad on , says the dictionary . This is precisely what Chuck does ; he pricks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , folders , booklets , appeals , and telephone calls , until in despair they pull out their check hooks and write in the name of Mammoth University . What 's it all about , this whole business ? Has Chuck ever paused in his frantic dashes from town to town , from one office job to another , to ask himself just why the graduates of Mammoth should give money ? Has he ever questioned whether all the money on earth can give the institution a more devoted attention to the needs and aims of the scholar ? Probably not . For Chuck , in common with the majority of Mammoth men , is totally lacking in standards of value , unable in his dizzy rush through life to realize the importance of the subjective . With most of his colleagues he can see the importance of a new dormitory or a bigger Administration Building , but patient and unselfish devotion to /earning by a few members of the faculty , FELLOW-ALUMNI literary achievement or intellectual honesty , these he considers unimportant , if he ever thinks about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feet , or kilometers . " As I pointed out in my last letter , " says the President in a form letter to every one of the four hundred Mammoth Alumni Fund representatives throughout the country , " if every holder of a degree or diploma would make a relatively small contribution annually , the relief of the Trustees would be enormous . Surely the spirit of Mammoth will manifest itself for Progress in these difficult times . " Quite so . But what is Progress ? In his Annual Report that old fox President Jackson failed to mention the fact that a course in Chaucer  --  just an ancient scribbler buried a few centuries ago  --  and several in Greek  --  a completely dead language , Greek , who ever uses it now ? ? have been dropped for lack of funds ; while at the same time a dormitory , a new Field House , and the new two-million-dollar plant of the modern Institute of Human Relations have been added . This sort of Progress which Chuck 's valiant efforts have helped to finance is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen , felt , touched , that makes Mammoth visibly better and bigger . It 's easy to blame the President , but after all he has the Board of Trustees on his neck to whom he must show Progress in tangible terms . Yes , and it 's easy to blame Chuck , but after all he has never once stopped to think just what the real purpose of a university should be . He has no time , he takes for granted Mammoth 's advances , never asking himself whether the University is really advancing or not . " During this year " ? it is Chuck addressing the graduates in his letter at the end of the college year ? " we have made great Progress . A new 300 room Dormitory called Jeremiah H. Mac-Fadden Hall after Jeremiah H. Mac-Fadden ' 98 , the donor , has been erected , the student body has grown by 645 . . . . " Progress , as you may have observed , is a favorite word at Mammoth . Would this sort of thing be called progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come to think of it , there is no such thing as an Alumni Secretary abroad . European universities are unprogressive . They only deal in education .
