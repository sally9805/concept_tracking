txt The full impact of Britain 's $7 , - 500,000,000 five year armament program was reflected in London markets yesterday . " Metals , led by copper , surged upward to new high levels in feverish , boom-like trading . But industrial stocks  --  apparently affected by tax and borrowing implications of national rearmament on the huge scale contemplated by the Baldwin ' government ? continued recent sharp declines . The industrial average fell another full point Friday , having lost an even Mx points since the beginning of the current drop on February 9 . British Funds Off At the same time , British government securities continued their recent downward trend . Consols closed at 76% , off VI , for a new low since 1934 . All base metals moved into new high ground , paced by copper which closed up ? 3 11s 3d at 163 Us 3d . Copper trading was so frantic that throughout most of the day the market was unable to gauge turnover with any degree of accuracy . Heavy speculative - interest buttressed an al ; ready extensive consumer demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge British government purchases in addition to demand from other re-arming European nations . Government ' Buying The most stimulating factor of the day was evidence that British authorities have actually begun purchasing metals , principally copper . It is believed this-'buying Is intended to provide materials for government munitions factories and not for stocks . Trade circles are discussing the possibility . of copper at ? 70 to 180 a ton , with proportionate lesser raises in zinc and lead . At the present time , however , the speculative position is becoming slightly unwieldy , but there is some in and out trading . ? Tin Situation= Attention is now : being directed toward tin . It is reported that China , normally an exporter , is now in the market as a purchaser , presumably for armament purposes . This metal , which has recently lagged behind in the general advance , staged a sharp upward movement , spot closing at ? 242 15s , up ? 8 5s . Sales of spot were 100 tons , and futures 1,150 tons . Reflecting conditions in the metal markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregularity developed on profit-flring . Rholianas , -a leading copper share , touched 118%. up 12 , but closed at ? 17% . Stock Market Among industrial shares , breweries , tobaccos and motors were marked down as the result of fears of increased taxation to pay the rearmament bill . There also has been a general decline in fixed interest securities and industrials in order to make adjustments to the new yields on depreciated government securities . The continuing fall in British funds appears to be hardly checked , as yet , but it is not anticipated that , at the present juncture , they will fall below a point Where the yield on long-term obligations will exceed 3% c/o . However , taking a long-range viewpoint there is some probability that government obligations will break the 3%% yield point . . Domestic Metal Market As a result of the boom on the London metal market producers here were again forced to advance domestic lead and zinc prices to new highs since 1929 . Lead yesterday rose 25 points further to 6.50 - cents a. pound New York and 6.35 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a pound East St. Louis . In two days these prices have risen 50 and 40 points respectively . The hectic demand for copper in London yesterday lifted electrolytic copper prices there more than 1/2-cent a pound to the equivalent of 15.18 cents a pound . a level more than one full cent above the domestic quotation . Reflecting this advance , export copper prices climbed to a new high of 15.175 cents a pound c. i. f . European base - ports . The tonnage involved at this level , however , was small and the greater trading was done at 14.425 to 15 cents . Thrusday 's high level was 14.425 cents . Despite the advance in foreign copper prices . domestic copper held unchanged at 14 cents a pound Friday . Considerable excitement in the trade arose from reported sales of domestic copper at 15 centst . These reports were officially denied , but clearly revealed the tension surrounding the domestic price . The situation was further intensified by the advance of 1/2 cent a pound in copper and brass scrap prices , resulting from increased foreign demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a cent above the domestic , scrap prices higher and the door wide open to exports of domestic metal to the higher-priced foreign markets , ability of producers to maintain the domestic price at 14 cents is little short of amazing . The more so when it is realized that supplies of copper in this country are so low that producers are forced to dole metal out to only their steadiest customers . While producers reported no pressure from consumers there was little doubt that daily sales would be much larger if producers were able to sell more freely . Domestic copper sales for Thursday came to 6,310,000 pounds as compared with 8,136.000 pounds on Wednesday . For the month , transactions approximate 111,458,000 pounds . Although sellers here maintain that the basis for the tremendous advance in foreign copper prices is still speculation , the feeling is gaining ground that armament programs have given a sounder aspect to the foreign market , at least for the immediate future . A major factor in the desire of producers to hold domestic copper at 14 cents is the belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into July and perhaps August , and by then a marked increase in domestic copper production is expected . Such a situation opens the possibility of slackening demand meeting increasing supplies with the resultant easiness in price .
