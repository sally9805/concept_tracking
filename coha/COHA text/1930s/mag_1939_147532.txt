Most Britishers think of art as a way to have their pictures taken . Portraitists have flourished in England ever since the Ger man Holbein , the Flemish Van Dyck came to make their everlasting fame &; fortune at the British court . For 200 years Eng land has painted most of its own portraits , in good times even manages to export a surplus crop . Such British painters as Augustus John , Simon Elwes , Frank O. Salisbury , the late Anglicized Philip de Laszl have reaped a golden harvest from U. S. tycoons and socialites anxious to show a good face to posterity . <P> Last week perhaps the most talented and highly priced of present-day British portraitists drew U. S. attention to himself . <P> In Pittsburgh short , suave , russet-haired Gerald L. ( for Leslie ) Brockhurst served on the jury for the 1939 Carnegie Inter national Exhibition . And in Manhattan two exhibitions of his work were opened which showed him equally proficient with brush , crayon , etcher 's needle . At the Knoedler Galleries was a loan exhibition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first complete exhibition of his etchings . With his projected English commissions canceled or postponed " for the duration , " Artist Brockhurst , whose deafness kept him out of World War I , planned to paint portraits in the U. S. for at least the first part of World War II . <P> Artist Brockhurst 's portraits have the bloom and precise brushwork of the Umbrian school of Italian painters . The figures are serene , meticulously painted against quiet-colored Tuscan landscapes of rolling hills , flowing water , umbrella pines . But posterity is in no danger of mistaking the nationality of his subjects . Brock-hurst 's Americans are American , his English sitters unmistakably English . Suavest of his U. S. portraits is that of Mrs. Paul Mellon , the Vassar graduate and divorcee whom Banker Andrew 's only son married in 1935. * His drawings and etchings show the same care for line and texture , have the finish of his commissioned work but more freedom . <P> Son of a Birmingham coal dealer , Artist Brockhurst was born in 1890 . At twelve he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a young Botticelli , " won prize after prize there and at the Royal Academy Schools in London . A smooth success from his first one-man show in 1915 , Limner Brockhurst charges up to 2,000 for a full-length portrait , limits his commissions to 20,000 a year . His person is as meticulous as his painting . He has a horror of Bohemianism , would rather stain his Bond Street suits with paint than cover them up with a smock . A famed impersonator , he is seldom asked nowadays for his best trick : looking like Adolf Hitler . <P> <P> *At Yale ( 1929 ) and Clare College , Cambridge , Paul Mellon read , wrote and rowed , decided on a literary career . Instead , his father got him into the Mellon National Bank . Last July he resigned as president and trustee of the National Gallery of Art at Washington ( founded by Father Andrew ) " because of business demands . "
