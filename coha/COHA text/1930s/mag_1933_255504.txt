Bunch of Cats <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of Aug. 7 you had a story about some difficulty that William Amos Smith , whom you said had three boys and seven cats , was having with his neighbors . You stated that William Amos Smith was a justice of the supreme court and a former attorney-general . This identified the writer of this letter pretty well as the person who was having trouble with the neighbors over a bunch of cats . Now the fact is that it was William Redwood Smith who was having trouble with his neighbors over the cats . He is a former justice of the supreme court but left that tribunal to become an attorney for The Atchison Topeka &,; Santa Fe Railway Company . He never was attorney-general . I was attorney-general and then went on the supreme court . Mrs. Smith and I do possess three boys but we never could afford any cats . <P> The only damage that has been done is that it has shaken my confidence a little in your magazine , which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newspaper men here say that the story was written correctly in this city but that some editor of the magazine changed it . As far as I am concerned I do n't care but I thought the magazine might like to know . <P> WILLIAM A. SMITH <P> The Supreme Court of Kansas <P> Topeka , Kan . <P> TIME apologizes for confusing cat-owning onetime Justice William Redwood Smith with non-cat-owning Justice William Amos Smith . The application by William Redwood Smith for a restraining order to prevent the city of Topeka from enforcing an ordinance limiting the number of cats per citizen to two is on the docket of the Shawnee County District Court , has not yet been acted upon. - ED . <P> Honest Criminal Lawyers <P> Sirs : <P> After several readings , I am forced to take issue with your statements regarding lawyers who practice criminal law . <P> The statements referred to appear in your issue of Sept. 11 under Crime and subtitled " A.B.A. and Federalization . " I can not agree with your blanket charges against lawyers practicing criminal law . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor will find after due investigation that the overwhelming majority of lawyers who practice criminal law are high-classed and ethical lawyers . I am sure he will also find such eminent lawyers as Hon. Martin W. Littleton and Frank Hogan on the membership rolls of the American Bar Association . I am also taking the liberty to point out that Hon. Charles S. Whitman , a former president of the American Bar Association , as late as 1927 , has practiced criminal law quite extensively both as a District Attorney and as counsel for the defense . <P> As late as 1921 , Hon. Charles E. Hughes , also onetime president of the A.B.A. , appeared in the U. S. Supreme Court in behalf of a client convicted in the Federal courts of Michigan . Hon. Elihu Root , also a former president of the A.B.A. in his youth , did not hesitate to appear in the defense of criminal cases , when he felt it necessary to do so .
