EVENING MEAL A STORY BY EVAN COOMBES MHE gong that called the family to 1 dinner had just been rung as the son entered the front door . He heard the last slow stroke tolling through the house and saw the bell still swinging where it hung between the hall and the dining room . Beside it stood the servant ; in the severity of her black and white attire she was like the priestess of a strange temple calling them to evening rites . " Mother and father borne ? " he asked as the bell brought no response . " Yes , they 're home , " she said dryly . Alan watched the stiff white bow at her back retreating to the kitchen . They will take their time , her scornful tone had said , whether dinner is kept waiting or not . The odor of roasting meat came through the swing door , reminding him that he was hungry . He took off his raincoat before the minor , obliged to stoop as his father did , to see himself in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair was in dark wet locks on his forehead , his face streaked as though he had been crying . But then it had been with tears of laughter . He had gone to the theater from the Academy and laughed until he cried over two comedians. ' the huge variety theater had made every emotional demand upon him in amazing succession , and after Mickey Mouse an enormous orchestra played Tschaikowsky . The music of the symphony had sent him home in akind of exaltation . All the way back he had heard the violins soaring above the noise of traffic ; but now in the quiet house he could not hear them . He heard nothing as he stood before the mirror , listening , brushing back his wet hair with a handkerchief . Why did n't his parents come to dinner ? Then he was aware of his father 's dark tallness emerging from the library ; he heard a step on the stairs and turned to greet his mother . But instantly he was still . He knew by the way she was coming downstairs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew by the deliberate manner of her descent , by the way she held her proud head , by the way her glittering black gown encased her like armor , that she defied them to speak to her . She would treat them as she would treat two men in the street who accosted her . Without a word she moved past them into the dining room , and , as she had made strangers of them all , the father and son did not look at each other as they followed her . Like three strangers they went silently into the room where the bright circle of the table awaited them . The white cloth set with silver and green glassware was illuminated from above and resembled a little stage , the sort thought , with its properties set . They were the audience and there was an air of expectancy as there is on any stage where action is about to take place . When they seated themselves they were also illuminated as if the audience had become part of the play . " Candles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ciga-rettes . " Disapproval charged the room . Only after a perceptible length of time did the servant , who had been standing by the swing door , move forward to do as she was bid . With insulting slowness she brought the candles and cigarettes , lighted the candles and put out the electric lights . While this was being done , nothing was said . Alan stared at the table , its white circle enclosing the smaller circles of plates and the straight lines of knife-blades and the tines of forks . The flowers in the center were white roses and he saw how they were drooping , on the point of letting their petals fall . If he knocked the table , he thought , ever so gently , the carefully held together blossoms would fall apart and shower the cloth . With the rose odor , slightly sweet , slightly stale , he could smell the cigarette his mother had just lighted . She would smoke throughout the meal , prolonging it past endurance , knowing that his father and he disliked it as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme and no one would venture to object . He glanced in her direction and away again . The impression of magnificence she had given on the stairs was sustained . She was dressed as if she were dining out , and her appearance in the low-cut brilliant gown made them ceremonious , put a constraint upon them as if they too were dining out and must behave themselves . She always dressed thus , the son had noticed , when she considered herself most outraged . The servant placed cups of bouillon before them . He took several hasty spoonfuls , remembering that he hadbeen hungry , but now he found that he no longer cared about eating . During meals like this food sometimes became so distasteful to him that he had to excuse himself from the table . He wished he could leave now and go back to the theater where he could hear the symphony again , where the great waves of music would break over his head , flooding him with glorious sound : harmonies that might stay with him and resound in the silences that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of silence , intolerable days with his parents not speaking to each other and scarcely to him ; then his father would not come home at all , his mother would dine out with friends , and he would be left sitting alone , waited upon by a woman in black . But while Mary would not take the trouble to put on her white apron for him , she might talk if she felt in a good humor . Lad , she called him with intermittent friendliness and , leaning familiarly on the back of a chair , she would tell him about her nephews who Went in for sports . That 's what you should be doing , she told him . He explained that his heart was not strong enough and added , not expecting her to understand , that he hated contests anyway . Sure , I 'm not surprised , she said . He took a few more swallows of the bouillon and then left it . His mother was sipping idly and smoking ; his father had emptied the cup and was sitting low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . What were they thinking about , the son wondered . Each head a hotbed of thought , mouths shut and no outlet , a fermentation of thought . While silence gathered like curtains round the table , the son could think over all that had happened to him , all that would never happen . He could sit and twist the green goblet by the stem , turning cycles of thought , turning cycles of green light that played on the cloth and on his hand as he held the stem of the glass . He looked at his hand with sudden dissatisfaction : it was not only too slender and boyish , but it seemed to have no possibilities of development ? there was no future in it , no more than in his mind . When he wondered what he was going to do after college he felt completely at a loss , and that was the way his hands looked , at a loss and not knowing what to do . He compared them with the hands of the violinists in the orchestra ; for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bows in unison . Fascinated , he had observed the crook of their wrists , the powerful muscular wrists and fingers , and how the activity of the left hand upon the strings contrasted with the composed beak of the right dipping the bow to its varying contacts and pressures . Here was a form of athletics that aroused his admiration because contest was not involved , only the creation of rhythm and harmony . That was the great thing about music , was n't it ? Surely a man could devote his life to music and find it worth while . He stared at his hand on the table and wondered as he turned the stem of the glass , and cycles of green light played on the thin white stem of his wrist . A distant buzz recalled him and called Mary in to remove the cups . She brought in a platter of roast meat and put it before his father , who sat forward and took up the carving knife and fork . He tested the blade and handed it without a word to the servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpening it . Nnw as the knife sliced keenly through the lamb and a pinkish juice began running on the platter , Alan averted his eyes and noticed how all other eyes were centered on the carving : his mother watching as she lighted another cigarette , and Mary watching as she stood ready to pass the plates . The face of the servant was as inscrutable as usual , and no matter what took place at the table , Alan had never seen her show any emotion . Sometimes he would glance up at her in an agony of humiliation and , encountering her changeless countenance , receive a jolt that would be a readjustment . She saw nothing to get excited about . With her eyes lowered under raised brows , with the superior calm of a stone Buddha , she seemed to say : Let these little people fight , let them slay and be slain ; they are not worth my concern . He dreaded to have her leave the room because he derived a certain comfort from her presence , from the faint creak in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back . When she Ieft she would take with her all that was ordinary and matter of fact , leaving him caught between strange forces , the unnatural passions and relationships existing between his parents and himself . His eyes followed Mary now as she took the first serving of meat to his mother , who was leaning her elbows on the table as elegantly as she did everything . Her cigarette was drooping from one corner of her mouth and her pose would have been rowdy in anyone else ; but she was still elegant . She did not move while the servant stood holding the plate and waiting , and as he looked up at Mary 's face he was startled to see appear there an expression of such fury that he nearly cried out . He thought she was about to do some violence to his mother , but the crucial moment passed ; the arms were withdrawn and the plate put down . He dared not raise his eyes again to sec if her face had resumed its usual composure as she passed the vegetables : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face had been distorted , unrecognizable : the suppressed fury of years compressed upon it , years of hatred for servitude , hatred for the woman she served . Something had happened to her in that moment as she stood watching the handsome woman arrogantly smoking and blocking the way , and something had happened also to him . He was so unnerved that he could scarcely bring himself to take up his fork and begin to eat . The three were alone in the room now and there was no sound but the occasional clink of silver against china . He tried to forget the distorted face of the servant and the warfare between this mart on his right and this woman on his left . If his parents fought with words or without , what did it matter ? Nothing came of their battle ; no one was slaughtered . What if the meal were silent ? He should be grateful to them for keeping quiet , for not saying the things they might have been saying . Perhaps they were keeping quiet for his sake , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sake . But he was not grateful ; he asked for so much more than that . It was for his sake , they told him once , that they did not get a divorce . Still he was not grateful , knowing they might better have separated , knowing also that he had no part in their drama . It was not for him they came together after one of these hateful periods ; could it be for love ? Sometimes he thought there was love in the house . Friends would be invited and they would play cards or dance , drink a little too much , and everyone would be laughing and talking . Only then was the atmosphere natural enough for him to approach his mother , and she would put her arm round his shoulder and hold him tightly to her . She who had given him life could give him new life , and with her arm round him , he no longer felt despondent or tortured . He wished she would drink more often that he could laugh with her and be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her remoteness . She sat encased in the beauty of garment and flesh , the ivory tower of her body , the glittering black of her low-cut dress and a black velvet ruse blooming between her breasts . Repelled by her cold splendor , he turned to his father in sudden understanding , realizing how he might be repelled also and turn to other easier women ; but as he looked at his father , who was sitting forward eating with a defiant appetite , he saw one of these women , the one he had chanced to see beside his father in a taxi , and whose soft repulsive person he would never forget . At least his mother had no attachments ; she was actually insulting to that architect fellow . Then why did n't she stand by her principles and not allow a reconciliation that was somehow shameful ? As the son sat now between his parents , trying to understand and give his loyalty , he had a sense of being wrenched apart that was almost physical . To defend himself he pretended indifference ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared ; but the role of outsider was becoming unendurable . He had played it too long . What could he do to break in upon them , in this dreadful moment of silence and separation : make some savage remark , leave the room , leave the house forever ? Or with a single vigorous gesture , pull the tablecloth with all the food and china crashing to the floor ? Involuntarily , his hands gripped the edge of the cloth ; he nearly laughed aloud in excitement as he pictured the catastrophe and his astounded parents ; but the habit of control was binding . His hands dropped ; he stayed as quiet as possible , and then took his knife and fork to resume eating . How ghastly the table seemed , all white and pale green . Even the ordi-nary decorations of candles and flowers increased the unnatural atmosphere : the roses on the point of decay , the candles tossing shadows high on the wall in a fitful wainscotting of shadow . Roses and silver and cycles of green light on the damask , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lamb . The thick bone and adherent flesh roasted brown , the leg of a dead beast amputated and served on a platter . Sickened by his thought , he was unable to go on eating , but as he tried to swallow the food that was in his mouth , something unexpectedly tasted good . A melting coolness and sweetness on his tongue : the mint jelly . He ate all the jelly on his plate and wanted more , but the dish was on the other side of the table ; he could not reach it and he hesitated about asking for it . Silence , he had found , is not an easy thing to break : especially the silence that comes from people not speaking , from three people , mother , father , and son , sitting at a common board without a word , sitting near enough to touch hands . Such silence is not lightly to be broken with a request for jelly . The longer silence is left alone the deeper it gathers , closing mouths with an invisible seal , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems important . He stared at the dish , at the green walls of jelly impregnable to his desire . The green was a dark emerald , not like the thin green of the glassware , but a rich satisfying greenness , one he could still taste with all the piquancy of the mint . Why should he Jet these ill-humored people deprive him of it ? He wished to act as though nothing were wrong , as though he did not care what they did , and if he wished for something on the table , the normal thing was to ask for it . Resolutely he cleared his throat , summoning his voice : " The jelly , please , " he said . Odd , the way his voice sounded , not like his own , but strained and unnaturally loud . He had been so afraid of making no sound at all , it seemed to him he had shouted for the jelly . He kept his eyes on the dish and saw his mother passing it to him . As he took it from her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? More than he had asked for perhaps . But nothing had happened . Silence had been broken and now silence could come together again , closing like water over the dropped pebbles of his words . But his father was speaking to him , forcing him to look up : " For God 's sake , say something , will you I " " Is it for the sake of God then , " asked his mother mockingly , " that one talks at the table ? Yes , Alan , talk to your father while he is with us ; tomorrow he will be dining elsewhere . Ask him if he talks there for the sake of God . " " Am I the only one who dines elsewhere ? We might profitably inquire what for God 's sake you and that ? " His father stopped speaking . A gesture stopped him . Alan had not been looking at his mother , but he caught the motion of her hand , slight as it was . The gesture was barely noticeable but it kept the angry man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession and it meant that these two understood each other . Now all mouths were closed again , this time because too much had been said . Even the gesture had said too much . He must not think about this charge against his mother , not keep remembering things that confirmed it ; he should eat the jelly he had asked for . His father was able to go on eating , still hungry enough to carve more meat . But the son did not want to eat again . He stared rigidly before him , at the flowers because they hap-pened to be there ; he saw a petal fall and its white shell fill with green light . Reaching for it , his hand looked as insecure on the thin stem of his wrist as the flowers drooping and ready for decay . Hands , all the different hands : his own so ineffectual , the powerful hands of the musicians , the hand of his mother making its adulterous gesture , the lean nervous hands that were carving the meat . His father was cutting slice after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eaten . He seemed to forget what he was doing , severing flesh from flesh in a kind of frenzy , cutting the leg to the bone , while the blade was running with a pale fluid that was the blood of the lamb . The son gave a cry as if he had been mortally wounded . Even as he seized the knife he felt his flesh in an agony of withdrawal ; but he brought the knife down with all his strength upon his wrist . He drew the blade across the veins of his wrist like a bow across the strings of a violin and he heard a new symphony breaking over him . The life blood welled magnificently forth , flooding the cloth with crimson and , as though he were plunging in a bright sea to drown there , he fell forward over the table .
