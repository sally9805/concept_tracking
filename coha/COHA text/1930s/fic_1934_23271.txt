FINE WAGON A STORY BY PAUL GREEN T " great forest rang as if with the clamor of iron bells from the belfries of the trees . Standing on the bank of the deep inky creek , Bobo strained with all his might at his fishing-pole . Down in the depths somewhere a catfish big as a hog was hung on his hook and gradually pulling him in . Lower and lower bent the pole , and inch by inch his bare feet slid in the slick mud . He felt himself jerked headlong toward the sickish black water , when suddenly there came a voice calling and a soft breath blowing in his ear . The great forest wheeled and turned over , rushed toward him , by him . The bells were silent , and in the flash of an eye the stream was gone and so were the fishing-pole and the fish . " Wake up , Sonny , wake up  --  it 's already day , " and he felt a gentle hand diddling with his shoulder . Who . What ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep a little more . And that fish  --  that great big fish ! " Wake up , Sonny , yo ' Pa 's done fed the mules . " He grunted and squirmed about under the quilts and sat up . Rubbing his fists in his eyes , he blinked at the little brown woman who stood by the bed , holding a wiggling Lamp in her hand . " Please , Mammy ? Please 'm ? " And then his eyelids drooped shut , he gaped , and sank back slowly on the bcd . Sweet sleepiness engulfed himinstantly . Once more the edge of the great forest came moving toward him like a cool delicious shadow and once more he heard the lofty booming of the bells . " Huh , so adder all yo ' proud bragging you done forgot you 's gwine with yo ' pappy ? " the voice said . He heard the words afar off . They meant nothing to him , they were empty sounds . But only for a moment , for then remembrance flooded into his mind and he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to forget it . A quick little rush of joy tickled somewhere in his chest behind his breastbone . He hopped out of bed as if a red fire coal had been dropped in his drawers . Cramming his shirt-tail down in his trousers , he followed his mother into the kitchen . He hesitated before the basin of waiting chilly water , and then roaching up his shoulders , soused his face down in his dipping cupped hands . " Whoo  --  oo  --  oo , " he chattered . Already Mammy was at the stove taking the frying fatback out of the pan . And now heavy brogan shoes came clomp-clomping along the porch , and Pappy entered  --  a tall , grave black man . " Mawning , Bobo . " " Mawning , Pappy , " he answered , his scrubbed face coming out of the ragged bundle of towel . " You done got that sleepy ou t'n them eyes  --  unh ? " " Yessuh , I'se all loud awake . " " That 's a boy . " " When 's we gwine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big a swivel . We got to swallow a bit of grub fust . " And Pappy sat down to the table with his hat on . Mammy hurried the cornbread from the stove and put it in front of him . " Come on , Bobo , " she said , but Bobo had already dived under her arm and onto his bench . She stood still at the end of the table with the dishcloth in her hand ready to get the coffee pot while Pappy bent his head over . " Make us thankful ? " he mumbled . " Amen , " Bobo whispered to himself . Nobody in the world could cook like Mammy . How good that fatback tasted , and the molasses and the bread . And then  --  what 's that ? ? as she came and set a cup of steaming coffee by his plate . " Seeing how cold it is and you gwine off to work same lak a man , " she said . His eyes were brimming with thanks as he poured his saucer full of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he blew on it with a great oof the way Pappy did to cool it . " Warm you up inside ? " his father asked . " It do that , " he answered , gulping it down with the noise of a small horse drinking water . He gobbled his bread and meat , trying to keep up with Pappy , and in a few minutes breakfast was over . Mammy took Pappy 's extra old coat from the wall and brought it to him . " It 'll be mighty cold riding out on that wagon , " she said as she slipped it on him . " Come on , " said Pappy , and they hurried out of the house toward the barn . There in the gray morning light the wagon stood with its long tongue hanging out . It was n't new like a white folks ' wagon , but it was mighty nice just the same . He and Pappy hadworked on it hard the day before spiking up the loose spokes and driving wedges under the tires to tighten them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the new pine-board seat laid across the body , it stood waiting to ride . Pappy had bought the wagon on credit at a sale a few days before for eight dollars . It would come in handy haul ? ing stuff for the professors up in town , and in a week or two they would make enough to pay for it . After that they 'd keep on hauling . Pappy had needed a wagon . When he came home a few weeks before , bringing old blind Mary to match with the other mule Suke , he had set his mind on something to hitch both of them to . He h7 c : traded a dog and gun and two or three dollars for old Mary , and it 'd take a lot of hauling to get the money together to pay for the wagon . But shucks , Pappy was stepping on in the world , he was smart . Did n't Mammy say so yesterday at supper  --  that they were n't nobody smart like him . And she had kissed Pappy , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , " Honey , I got me a job right off the bat . ' Fessor Johnson up there at town met me on the street to-day and said he had some wood to haul down where he 's gon na build his chillun 's swimming pool and could I haul it . ' Could I do it ? ' Says , ' Ca n't nobody do it better . ' Says , ' I got me a fine wagon and a first-class team . ' That 's the way it goes in this world . You get ready for the job and the job gets ready for you . Says , ' I got a boy Bobo growing Iak a weed , and all muscling up . Me and him both 'll be back hcah , suh , to-morrow . ' " These things ran through Bobo 's mind as lie padded barefooted along toward the barn , trying to keep up with his father 's long stride . " Yessuh , put me at a stick of wood and I 'll tote my end , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pappy asked , looking down at him but never slackening his pace . " I mean  --  mean I'se gwine sho ' work hard . " And Pappy looked out toward the morning star , laughed a great laugh , and patted his shoulder . " How much that man gwine pay me , Pappy ? " he inquired as they slid open the stable door . " I bet a whole ten cents ; that 's what you 'd better charge him . " Ten cents ! And there 'd be other ten centses  --  nearly every day there would , for they would be so good at hauling that all the ' Fessors would be asking them to do jobs . Ten cents adayl His little skinny L ! ftnd slid down into his pocket as if he already expected to find a piece of hard round money there . And once more , as had happened several times during the last day and night , the bright picture of a new fishing hook and line gleamed for an instant in his mind . But he was cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew where they could be got . Up town in the hardware store  --  all with red corks and plenty of lead sinkers . " You try yo ' stuff at bridling Suke , " Pappy said ; " this here new mule kinder cantankerous . " And pridefully Bobo opened the door and went in with the bridle in his hand . Old Suke stood with her head down as if expecting him and , slick as that old Syrian peddler , he put the bridle on her and led her from the stall . Then the business of harnessing and getting the belly-band and the hamestring tight . It did n't matter if Pappy did come round and retie the hamestring when he 'd just managed to pull it together , for the hames were fitting snug in the collar , and Pappy said that was doing fine as silk . " Them 's stout hamestrings too , " said Pappy , " Joe Ed let me cut ' em from that bull hide o ' his . " " I bet they 'll hold  --  hold near ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or a ' elevint , " said Pappy . " Or a steam-engine , " Bobo chuckled . " Yell , they 'll hold  --  hold till the cows come home , and that britchin ' , that 's a real piece of scrimptious handiwork , " and Pappy surveyed the old ragged strips of bed-ticking he had sewed together to help finish off the harness . By this time the wide light of dawn had spread upward from the east across the sky , and Bobo was n't afraid at all as he went into the Ioft and threw down two bundles of fodder for the mules ' dinner . And now Mammy came out of the house , bringing lunch wrapped up in a paper for her two men-folks . So it was that everything was ready at last and not a bit too soon , for the smiling face of the sun was peeping up over the edge of the world . " You all be smart , " Mammy called out as they climbed up into the wagon and sat down on the seat side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great flourish , and off they went . " We 'll be home right around sundown , " he shouted back , " and me'n Bobo wants us a real bait of that side meat all fried and ready ! " " We 'll be home at sundown ! " Bobo shouted likewise , sticking his hand up out of his father 's old coat sleeve in a little crooked gesture , half a wave and half a salute . He had seen the white boys stick their hands up like that at the College Campus . And Mammy waved back at him , standing there by the gate with the new sun shining in her face . They drove ondown the dead-weeded lane and soon came into the highroad . To the right and to the left stretched the white frosty fields , and in the distance the church spires of the white man 's town stuck up above the wooded hill . The steel wagon tires made little gritty sounds as they drove along . " Do n't this wagon run good , Bobo ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I was up and give it a good greasing whilst you was snoozing . " " You'da woke me up I'da been there and holp you . " " Them tiahs cries a little , but they 's tight as a drum , ai n't they ? " " Tight as Dick 's hatband . We sho ' put the fixing on ' ern . " " Yeh , did n't we ? " " Git up there Suke  --  you Mary , " Bobo chirped in his manful way . They were now mounting the hill , the air was sharp and biting , and Bobo had to clamp his jaws tight , his teeth were chattering so . But he 'd never let Pappy know , They rode on in silence awhile . Bobo could see from Pappy 's thoughtful face he was thinking of something . Maybe planning out the big work ahead and he did n't want to talk . A gang of robins flew across over his head going north . He watched them till they were little jumping eye-specks low in the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It always turned warm after a heavy frost like this one . The robins knew  --  they were smart like people . Soon they were rolling along the asphalt streets of the town . Every shop was closed , every house deserted . It was too early for the white folks to be up . They were different from colored folks who had to be out to get a soon start . Already some of the women cooks were on their way to work  --  their arms in front of them , their elbows gripped in the palm of each hand . It was cold and they walked in a hurry . Their shoes made a clock-clock on the hard sidewalks . " Ai n't everything quiet  --  lak somebody asleep ? " Bobo half whispered . " Yeh , " Pappy replied , " sleep . That 's what 's the matter with people , Bobo . They all sleep too much . Now look at you and me  --  we 's up and doing . " " That 's right , " Bobo agreed soberly , and Pappy continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other folks start to work we done done half a day . That 's what gets a man ahead . He that rises ' fore the sun is the man what gets the most work done . " And now they were passing by the gray granite building that was the great bank where the white men went in and out during the day , hauling in their money and putting it away . Bushels and bushels of yellow dollars and white dollars and bales of greenbacks they kept stored away there . That was where all the money came from to buy the things that people needed . And to the left there was the hardware store where they kept all kinds of blades , and knives and hooks  --  fishhooks . Well , when spring came .. . Next down there by the drug store was the blue-and-white sign of the telegraph office shut up and asleep . In a few hours it would be open , and folks would go in there and write things on a slip of paper , and a man would tap on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out along wires and ' way to New York and maybe across the world through a pipe under the sea . Lord , Lord , were n't people smart ! ? Smart . He was smart too . Bobo had always been frightened by the big buildings and goings-on when he had come up town to buy five cents ' worth of snuff or ten cents ' worth of fatback for Mammy and Pappy . But this morning he looked at the houses and stores with unafraid eyes . He felt more at home among them to-day . He was a working man now , and nobody ever bothered a working man  --  not even big boys that liked to pick on you and throw your cap up and lodge it in a tree . He had something to do now , work for the white folks , and that made everything right . The white folks would n't allow no foolishness with any of their help . In a few minutes they had gone through the village to the outer edge and came where a little alley turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is we ' bout got there , Pappy ? " " Yeh , right down yonder is where ' Fessor lives . " And he pulled the heads of the mules into the alley . " He 's got a lot of wood cut ' way below his house and he wants it hauled up to put in his cellar . " " Looks like a sort of rough place down there , " Bobo said , straining his eyes ahead of him . " Sho ' , but we 's the men to get that wood out'n there , ai n't we , Bobo ? " " Is that , " Bobo spoke up strongly and briskly . " And he 's gwine pay us a dollar a cawd to move it . He said he had ten or twelve cawds down there . " " How much is a cawd , Pappy ? " And now they were turning off to the left down a little rock path that skirted around and away from the Professor 's house . What a house that was , all white and pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimneys did it have , and the windows with green blinds . Bobo almost caught his breath  --  there on the porch sat a big red bicycle . That must belong to one of the chillun , but he did n't mind how many bicycles the chillun had ' cause some of these days  --  that too maybe  --  not a new one  --  no  --  no  --  just an old one . " Well , a cawd of wood is a pile ' bout ten feet long and as high as yo ' head and you get a dollar for moving it , " said Pappy . " Yeh , ten or twelve of ' em . I bet we near'bout will move six or eight of them cawds to-day , and that 's six or eight dollars . " " Look out there , Pappy ! " " Sho , " his father gravely replied as he pulled on the plow-Iine reins and stopped the mules , for the wagon was going down the hill and almost pushing the collars up over their heads . " I better tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding to the lines , he climbed down and scotched the wheel with a rock . In a few minutes he had tightened the straps of bed-ticking and was ready to go . " Does you think you mought drive some ? " " Lemme , " Bobo answered eagerly . Handing over the reins , Pappy got behind the wagon and held it back as the mules moved down the hill . What a strong man Pappy was there pulling on the coupling-pole like as if it had been the wagon 's tail , and the mules had to push a little bit against the collar now that Pappy was holding back so sharp . They finally got safely down to the little wooded hollow where the firewood was piled in great heaps , and they did no damage at all more than tearing off a patch of bark from a sugar-maple tree with the wagon hub . After much backing and sliding the rear end of the wagon round , they got set . near a pile of wood and began to load it . It was a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Professor 's fireplace , and Bobo liked to work at it , it looked so nice . He heaved piece after piece up into the open body , trying to match his father . Talk about being smart  --  huh , with a few days of this stuff he 'd put a muscle on his arm like a big rat running under his skin . " All right , " Pappy called , " try the end of that thing . " And Bobo took hold of the big black log of solid hickory all ready to show his strength . Just then they heard a heavy voice calling down from the house above and , looking up , Bobo saw a man wearing some kind of a gown standing by the porch railing , his hair all rumpled . " Who 's that ? " he asked , letting go of the log and stopping still as a post . " S-sh , that 's ' Fessor , " Pappy said . " Hey , what you doing down there ! " the Professor shouted . And Pappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat quickly and bowed respectfully . " Nlawning , ' Fessor , " he answered in a low voice and smiled same as if ' Fessor was right in front of him . " Mawning , sub , " Bobo whispered pulling off his hat likewise . " For goodness sakes ! You make enough racket to wake up the neighborhood , " said the figure on the porch . " Yessuh , " Pappy began and then fumbled a bit for his words . " We thought we 'd get an early start , sub . " " Well you have that ; it 's just seven o'clock . " " Yessuh , " and Pappy bowed again . " Well , go on and be as quiet as possible . Haul the wood round to the cellar door . I 'll come out a little later . " " Yessuh , " said Pappy again , still holding his hat in his hand . The figure on the porch looked round at the world , yawned and retired into the house . Pappy and Bobo waited a moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and careful , laying each piece of wood gently in the wagon as if they were packing eggs . " Why do he do that ? " Bobo at last softly inquired . " Who you mean do what ? " his father asked in a low stern voice . " The man up there in that big house ? ' Fessor . " Something seemed to be bothering Pappy , for he laid down his piece of wood and looked at Bobo . " Why you ax that ? " " He kept looking around at the earf and up at the sky . It ai n't going to snow , is it ? " " Oh , " said Pappy , as if he had been thinking of something else . And then he turned back to loading the wood again , and Bobo turned back also . But they decided to leave the big hickory log until the next load . " Must be some kinder big man , ai n't he , " Bobo said presently , " living inthat big house with all these woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaches boys and gals ? that 's what ' fessor means . " Pappy was silent a bit and then went on as if to himself , " He a mighty big man . 1 heard some folks say he a big man . " Now Pappy looked carefully about him . " Huh ? " said Bobo . " Do what ? " and Pappy seized a piece of oak and lifted it aloft . " Yeh , do what , Pappy ? " " Do n't ax so many questions . ' Fessor wants his wood hauled , he gwine pay for it , and we gwine haul it . He a big man , he stands mighty high . I hear ' em say he writes books and makes money enough  --  enough to burn . " And surveying the pile of wood on the wagon , he added , " Looks like we ' bout got a load . " " What do he write about , Pappy ? " " Huh ? " " ' Fessor . Do he write tales lak what Mammy read from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around at him in a way he did n't understand . Then he said , " Say he writes books about the colored folks . " " Sho ' ? " " Sho ' . " " And do the colored folks read ' em ? " " Shet yo ' mouth and go ' way , " Pappy answered , and snickering again , he went on . " White folks buy ' cm and read ' em ' way off yonder . That 's how he gets so much money to build his house and this heah swimming pool . " Pappy 's hand went into his pocket , and Bobo watched it like a hawk . How long had he been waiting for that . This time it was true , he was going to do it , and sure enough Pappy pulled out a twist of homemade tobacco and bit off a big chew . Bobo edged up to him , waiting . For a moment the twist hesitated in Pappy 's hand , and then he pinched off a big crumb and handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quick as a bat catching a bug . He stuck it in his mouth , rolled it round with his tongue , and settled it over on one side making his jaw stick out . " Well I spec 's we better start up the hill with this , " and Pappy gathered up ? the reins . Suke and Mary , who had stood drooping in their tracks , suddenly woke up as if a swarm of hornets had come up out of the ground at them . Suke gave a lunge forward and old blind Mary gave a lunge backward . " Get up there , " said Pappy , whopping Mary a blow on the rump with his whip . And now she sprang forward and Suke stood still . " You Sukel " he shouted . And quicker than hailing , the little blows of the whip danced from one mule to the other . With a rattle and groaning of the wheels the heavy load began to move up the stony hill , and Pappy winked at Bobo as much as to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung round into the little road , the rear wheel hooked the sugar-maple again . " Whoa , " said Pappy , and just in time , for the coupling-pole was bent like an Indian 's bow . The mules stopped , slumped down in their tracks and began to gnaw the dead scattering brown oak leaves that hung from a branch above their heads . Suddenly the creaky twanging of an opening screen door sounded across the hollow . Bobo looked out toward the house and saw the Professor , partly dressed , standing on the porch again . " There he is again , Pappy , " he said , clutching his father 's arm . " Whoa , " said Pappy softly to the mules . " Heigh , " said the Professor , " did n't I tell you to keep quiet down there ? " Pappy 's hat was already off in his hands again as he answered gently , " Yessuh , yessuh , we 's just getting started , ' Fessor , and we " ? Pappy looked down at Bobo as if asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wheel in that maple tree ? " the Professor called , and Bobo saw him sliding his suspenders on his shoulders in a quick nervous jerk . " He coming down here , Pappy , " he whispered . " No , suh , " answered Pappy , " we just giving the mules a little breathing space , suh . " " Well , see that you do n't hurt anything . " And once more the Professor gave that look round him and turned quickly back into the house . After much prying and straining , they got the wheel loose from the tree , but not until another great gleaming gap of bark had been torn off in the process . When they had got the load farther up the hill , they scotched the wheels , and Pappy came hack . He grabbled up a handful of dirt , smeared it over the scars so that no one would notice them , and Bobo ran about picking up the pieces of bark which he hid under the fallen leaves . Then they went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove proudly round back of the house and stopped near the cellar door . " Look a-there , Pappy , " whispered Bobo horrified , pointing to one of the rear wheels . The wedges had fallen out from under the tire and the old wheel stood all crank-sided . " Oh , that wheel 'll stand up , " said Pappy lightly , eyeing it . " We 'll get unloaded and then take a rock and drive that tire back on . " And climbing down , he wrapped the reins tight round a front hub so the mules could n't get at the spirea bushes . Bobo passed the wood piece by piece to his father who took it in armfuls quietly down into the cellar . By this time the people in the house were astir , and Bobo could see into the kitchen where Miss Sally the cook , wearing some kind of fancy lace thing on her head , was preparing breakfast . The smell of coffee and bacon came out to him and he sniffed the air hungrily like a little dog . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair brushed . He came up to the wagon and looked sharply at the load . Bobo tried to keep his mind on his work handing down the wood to his father below , but he could smell the clear wincy stuff the Professor had used for shaving . It filled the air , getting into his mouth and nostrils so strong that he could taste it . " You 'll never move that wood with such a turnout as that , " said the Professor shortly . " Look at that wheel ! " " Yessuh , " answered Pappy , as he laid his hat on the ground beside him . " We 'll fix that up in a minute , suh , the wedge just fell out . " " Yes , I see it did . How are you , son ? " " Fine , thanky , suh , " Bobo choked , almost speechless at being addressed by the mighty man who lived in such a house and had cooks and bicycles and automobiles and a big furnace thing down there in the cellar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " But now Bobo had lost his tongue . " His name 's Roosevelt , suh , but we calls him Bobo , " answered Pappy gravely . " H 'm , " said the Professor . " And pile the wood straight back against the coal bin , will you ? " " Yessuh , we 's fixing it up fine and dandy . " " And you can turn round down there next to the garage . " " Yessuh . " " Good gracious , boy , are n't you frozen , barefooted the way you are ? " " Oh , he do n't mind the cold , suh , his feets is tough as whiticather . " " No suh , I do n't feel the cold in my feets , suh , " Bobo faltered . " H 'm . And what you got in your mouth , son ? " But Bobo could only stare at the Professor with wide fright . ened eyes . " Do n't you know chewing tobacco at your age will stunt you and keep you from growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And once more the Professor looked inquiringly about the world and up at the sky as he turned to re-enter the house . At last the load was stored away , and after much knocking and wedging down at the garage , the old wheel was strengthened , and they returned to the woods . But now it seemed the mules had decided not to do any more work that day . They kept twisting and turning about and sticking out their heads , trying to get at the dead leaves . And when after a lot of trouble the wagon was finally backed and skewed round to another pile , old Mary suddenly began to kick and lunge in the harness . Pappy seesawed on the reins and spanked her with the whip , and only after she had torn the britching off and burst one of his prized hamestrings did he finally get her quieted . All the while Bobo kept looking up toward the house , expecting the Professor to come charging out yelling at them . His heart was in his mouth , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hamestring re-tied , and everything ready for the loading to begin . This time Pappy pitched the wood boldlyinto the wagon . The white folks were up and having breakfast , and the chatter of children was heard in the house . It did n't make any difference about noise now . " We better not put such a heavy load on this time , had we , Pappy ? " " No , we ai n't going to load up furder'n to the brim , " he replied . And when they were ready , Pappy mounted briskly to the top of the seat and gave the word for the mules to go . Bobo started behind , but old Mary acted as if Satan was in her . She lunged forward , broke the hamestring again , and ran straight out of the harness . And before Pappy could do a thing she had turned herself completely around and stood facing them with her white , sightless eyes as if laughing at him . Pappy suddenly lost his temper and , leaning far over with his rope whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared up on her hind feet , and giving a great jump , left the harness behind her . " Look out , look out , Pappy " Bobo squealed in fright . Pappy sprang down from the wagon , and with a strong hold upon the reins kept old Mary from getting entirely loose and running away . And now from the porch Bobo heard the dreaded voice again : " What 's the matter down there ? " Bobo did n't dare look up , for he knew the Professor was coming down the hill . And in a minute there he stood beside them . Without a word Pappy dropped his whip on the ground and began straightening out the harness , and old Mary started greedily eating the dead leaves again . Suddenly the Professor broke into a Ioud laugh , and Bobo shook in his tracks . Somehow that laugh made him feel queer and trembly . " What in the name of God did you come trying to haul wood with such a mess as this ? " the Professor shouted . " Yessuh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , " said the Professor sharply , and he took a step backward and surveyed the wagon and the team . " Here , son , you hold her head and let 's see what we can do . " The Professor took off his fine coat and undid his white collar and set to work tying up the britching and rehitching the traces on old Mary . " You sho ' know yo ' stuff ' bout mules , ' Fessor , " Pappy broke in presently , standing there pinching a dead twig in pieces between his fingers . " Yes , I know enough not to starve them to death and not to try to haul wood with the harness and wagon falling to bits , " he snapped . Bobo stood looking on , every now and then spitting in noiseless excitement off to one side . He watched the deft movements of the Professor as if mesmerized , and now and then his gaze traveled to his father , who stood all shamed and humbled with his hat off . A queer lump rose up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swallowed quickly . Then he began sputtering , trying to get back the wad of tobacco that had gone down . Gritting his teeth , he blinked and shook the tears out of his eyes , making little choking noises in his throat . " What 's the matter with you , son ? " queried the Professor , staring at him . " Nothing suh , nothing , " he answered quickly . " You look sick . Have you had any breakfast ? " " Yessuh . " " Yessuh , we both et a big bait ' fore we come off , " Pappy said , coming over and timidly offering to help fasten the breast chains . " You wait ; I 'll drive out for you . " And clucking kindly to the mules , the Professor jiggled the reins gently . The wagon slowly began to move . The Professor walked along as the mules pulled on up the hill , and then blam , that old rear wheel struck a stone that was hidden by the leaves , and with a moaning groan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his queer laugh . He stood a moment looking at the reins in his hand , and then throwing them down , took out some money and handed it to Pappy , " Here 's a dollar , though you 've not earned fifty cents . " " Thanky suh , thanky sub , " said Pappy wiping his hand on his coat and humbly taking the money . Without a word the Professor turned and strode off toward the house . When he had gone a little distance he turned and shouted , " Take your bundle of trash and clear out . I 'll get somebody else to haul my wood ! " With that he was gone . Bobo stood looking at the ground . He could see the toes of his father 's ragged shoes in front of him . Finally they moved , and he heard his father say , " I reckon we just about as well quit and go home , son . " And then he heard another voice saying  --  a woman 's voice up on the porch ? " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replying , " The same old story . My God , these everlasting negroes  --  poverty ? trifling . Come on , let 's finish our breakfast . " And the door of the great house slammed shut like the jaws of a steel trap . Pappy tied a limb to the coupling-pole under the axle , and the old broken wheel was loaded into the wagon body . All the while Bobo stood by without moving . His hands and arms hung down by his sides . He made no effort to help or do anything , but just stood there . " Come on , boy , " Pappy said harshly . They climbed up into the wagon , and the mules now , as if glad to be free of work , moved quickly up the hill and back into the main highway . Through the town they rode , the old limb dragging under the wheel-less end of the axle . People looked out from the houses as they passed , and a group of white school children playing tag on the sidewalk stopped and pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking straight ahead , and Pappy was looking straight ahead too . When they neared the business section of the village Pappy turned off and went along a side street . And soon they came to the other edge of the town and descended the hill . When they rode up near the woodpile , Mammy unbent from her sweeping by the door and stared at them . " Why you back so early ? " she called . " I ai n't got a speck of dinner ready . Eyh , and look what 's happened to your wagon wheel ! " Jumping down from his seat , Bobo entered the yard . " We do n't want no dinner ! " he heard his father 's rough brutal voice shout behind him . " What 's the matter , son ? " Mammy said . " Nothing , nothing , " he gulped . And catching hold of her apron , he began to sob . " Dry up ! " Pappy yelled after him , but Bobo sobbed and sobbed . " What 's happened , son ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Nothing , nothing , " he spluttered . And then a dreadful thumping and squealing began in the edge of the yard . But Bobo did n't look up . For even with his face buried in his mother 's apron and his eyes stuck shut with tears , he could see a skinny black man there by the woodpile beating old Mary with an axe-helve , and that black man was Pappy  --  and he was ragged and weak and pitiful.
