In the extreme Southeast corner of New Hampshire , 50 mi. north of Boston , is the town of Exeter , where John Phillips in 1781 founded Phillips Exeter Academy . Twenty-five miles nearer Boston is Andover , where John 's nephew . Samuel , founded Phillips Academy one year earlier . ( His school later became " Phillips Academy at Andover " to distinguish it from his uncle 's school at Exeter . ) Exeter and Andover have flourished mightily , until today they are the twin giants of prep schools in size and in prestige . Other schools are certainly more fashionable , possibly more potent scholastically , improbably more prolific in first-string athletes . But no other schools have the glamour of Exeter and Andover , whose histories are as long as their rosters of students . <P> Last week Thomas William Lament , outstanding Morgan partner , went back to Exeter , whence he was graduated in 1888 , strolled about the elm-shaded Yard , greeted friends and classmates , some 2,000 , who like him had come back to the old school to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see the modern , red-brick Lament Infirmary , whose crack contagious ward is an echo of the time Mr. Lamont had scarlet fever at Exeter. * But he could see the modest basement offices of the school paper , the Exonian , where his sons , Corliss and Austin ( " Egg " ) , spent much of their time while at Exeter . His reminiscing over , Mr. Lamont went to the new Thompson baseball cage and presided over an alumni luncheon , where he read a letter of congratulation from President Hoover and where another Morgan man talked : Vernon Munroe , president of Exeter 's General Alumni Association . As Mr. Lamont looked around the tables , he saw such alumni as Senator George Higgins Moses ( New Hampshire ) , ' 87 , Roland William Boyden , ' 81 , Bernard Walton Trafford , ' 89 , and George Arthur Plimpton , ' 73 . <P> But , true to its New England traditions , Exeter welcomed to its 150th anniversary not primarily men of wealth or family but men of learning . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presidents of the great Eastern colleges and schools . Speech of the day was that of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell , of Harvard , who asked for less coddling and babying in modern education , declared that a child should read " fluently " at five and " certainly at six " and went on to say : " This retardation runs through the whole process . In the secondary school we study what should have been finished earlier ; in college we do what should have been done at school . . . . "
