Repeal of Prohibition in the U. S. , legalizing of horse racing in California and the sudden suppression of public gambling in Mexico have reduced the border town of Tijuana ( literally " Aunty Jane " ) from an egregious haunt for U. S. tourists to a bedraggled ghost city of boarded-up saloons and flapping signs . Some excitement occurred two months ago when 400 unemployed barricaded themselves in the big Agua Caliente ( literally " Hot Water " ) hotel and defied the garrison of 28 soldiers to oust them . Since then Aunty Jane has been tomb-quiet . <P> On Monday last week a sandaled peasant woman wandered into an abandoned garage and found the body of an 8-year-old girl , Olga Comacho , daughter of a bartender . Her throat was slashed . She had been ravished while returning from the village meat market . Through all the flyspecked rabbit warrens of Tijuana the news spread and quickly more news followed : a soldier from the garrison had been caught with the package of meat Olga Comacho was bringing home . <P> A crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adobe huts . Young men , clinging to the running boards of automobiles , raced through the street firing shots in the air . At the temporary jail , the crowd smashed windows and set it afire with wads of gasoline-soaked rags . Some of the mob kept fire engines away by lying prone in the street . Not finding the prisoner , the crowd next attacked the police station , burned it also . Next call was the stone Federal building , where Federal troops were drawn up with loaded rifles . As the mob approached . General Manuel Contreras shouted : " Justice will be meted out to this prisoner ! Justice will be meted out to this prisoner ! " but the crowd swept on . A volley crashed out over their heads , then another straight at the leaders . The crowd broke . Dead in the gutter lay Romano Maldonado , 8 ; Salvadore Vasquez , 14 ; Vidal Torres , 56 . Fourteen others lay wounded . <P> Murder is not a capital crime in Lower California , but General Contreras took no chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court martial sat . At sunrise the prisoner . Private Juan Castillo Morales , 24 , was hustled to the cemetery on a nearby hill , told to run for his life . A firing squad of his fellow soldiers finished him quickly .
