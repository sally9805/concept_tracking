For the first time in his ursine life , Senator William Edgar Borah , who refuses all invitations to go to Europe , broadcast last week to Europe . The whole Continent tuned in . Oppressed nations look to the ponderous , fearless Chairman of the U. S. Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee as their greatest champion . Oppressing Great Powers view him with logical alarm . As millions of eager , ear-straining Europeans crouched over their radio sets they heard the Senator 's sonorous words and rumbling periods punctuated and all but drowned by astounding catcalls in a dozen languages , women 's shrill screams , the roars of fistfighting men and altogether the most remarkable program ever broadcast from Paris . <P> High above a terraced garden facing the River Seine and the Eiffel Tower perches the huge , crescent-shaped Palais du Trocadro built for the Paris Exposition of 1878 . On Borah Night last week 8,000 people jammed the Trocadro Auditorium . Huge banners strung around the balconies proclaimed that 1,043 delegates from peace societies in 30 lands had been gathered by the International Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace &; Disarmament Conference , an unofficial curtain-raiser for the League 's World Disarmament Conference in Geneva next February . The trouble with last week 's well meaning " conference " ' lay not among the 1,043 " delegates , " 100% pacifists all , but in the fact that anyone willing to buy a ticket could attend , and in the further fact that several thousand angry Frenchmen came . <P> French public opinion became incensed when the pacifist delegates , at a session earlier in the week , hissed and booed the cherished French thesis of " No Disarmament Without Security " expounded to the Conference by that great French mathematician M. Paul Painlev , former Premier and War Minister . Cardinal Verdier , Archbishop of Paris , sensed what was coming , refused to send a message to the Peace &; Disarmament Conference , declared : " Catholics possess other means of making their ideas known on this delicate subject . " Finally the Journal des Dbats , often the voice of the French Government , denounced the Conference as " conceived . . . to force upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our country " ( i e. , actual Disarmament without a pact of Security for the special benefit of France ) . <P> On Borah Night the Trocadro was packed with French patriots , hottest among them being the blue-shirted Fascists of Les Jeunesses Patriotes and Paris 's stalwart , cane-swinging young Royalists , Les Camelots du Roi . When Senator Borah stood up to broadcast from quiet Washington he little suspected that wildest pandemonium was already loose beneath the Trocadro loudspeakers that were to shout his words . A message from the Archbishop of Canterbury which Viscount <P> Cecil had tried to read was drowned out by roars of " Vive la France ! " <P> When Signor Vittorio Scialoja , often Italy 's League representative , opened his mouth there were anti-Fascist yells of " Murderer ! " until French blue shirts began a gay , devastating chant of " Not so loud , Macaroni ! "
