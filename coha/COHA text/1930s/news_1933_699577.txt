txt A preponderance of national and State banks closed under Presidential and Gubernatorial proclamation since March 6 will be permitted to open , beginning Monday , under an Executive order issued today by President Roosevelt . Rulings to make the order effective were issued by the Treasury Department . The condition laid down as necessary before a bank may open is that its soundness must first have been established to the satisfaction of the government . Lack of time for examination and appraisal is likely to delay openings in many eases for a day or two it was emphasized . While there was every Indication that operations will be resumed generally on Monday , administration officials also cautioned that there was a possibility that certain modifications of present plans might be necessary . When the one-week suspension of banking activities is ended , however , the government will retain an embargo on the withdrawal for export of gold bullion , gold certificates and coin , except for licensed transfers , and will continue its restrictions against domestic withdrawals as a curb on hoarding . President Roosevelt , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury officials , was very optimistic as to the outlook in the banking situation . Emergency legislation passed by Congress and the regulations which have been issued , he believes , will restore confidence among the people and strengthen banks which withstood heavy withdrawals during the period of hysteria occasioned by the State banking holidays that preceded the national holiday . Order to Reserve Banks . As a first step In permitting the nation 's banking machinery to operate again , the Treasury Department late today authorized the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to begin advances tomorrow to corporations , individuals and to member banks for payrolls and other essential purposes as set forth in earlier regulations . This action was intended to permit borrowers to take advantage of the machinery set up in the banking legislation adopted by Congress yesterday . The executive order and rulings permitting the reopening of banks where there has been time for an appraisal of their soundness provide that Federal Reserve member banks must first obtain a license from the Treasury , while in the case of State banks not members of the Federal Reserve System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter are expected by the Federal Government to follow out . the principles laid down in respect to the reopening of the Reserve member banks permitted to function on a 100 per cent basis . The Treasury ruled that , " any =ember bank . not clearly within this category will not be opened unless or until further investigation discloses that it is a sound going institution , or unless or until a reorganization of some character will permit the bank to be classified as a sound going institution . " Some Functions Limited . In other words , only Reserve member banks which the Treasury has decided are in sound condition and ready to resume normal business will be eligible for opening . The other banks not opened 10C per cent , the ruling declared , " will be permitted to continue to perform only such specific transactions a= are now authorized or may hereafter be authorized by specific . regulation or license of the Secretary of the Treasury .

The situation involving hoarders will be handled by the Department of Justice : The Treasury has requested the member and Reserve banks to furnish a list of large gold withdrawals during the past two years which have not been redeposited by Monday . Delay for Many Sound Banks . President Roosevelt feels that the public should not interpret the rulings to mean that a bank which does not open next week is insolvent or even dangerously weakened . In some cases the Treasury has not had time to obtain a full appraisal of the condition , and some banks will not be opened until their position has been thoroughly ascertained . State Banking Superintendents are expected to follow the Federal leadership . They will keep the State banks , including those where appraisal has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of 100 per cent soundness has been met . Among government officials it was explained that necessarily a certain amount of time is required to cover the entire field of " the 100 per cent " banks , either national or State , and if an institution does not happen to open on the first day , it does not mean that it is fundamentally unsound and will not open for full operation within the next day or two . Many banks have not been examined recently , and in such cases there would have to be an examination before a decision could be reached . A high authority was anxious to emphasize that the failure of any bank to open does not by any means indicate that it is not 100 per cent solvent . Examiners Proceed Carefully . The government demands that the utmost care shall be exercised in determining the status of all banks . A triple check is in progress by the Federal Government , State authorities and clearing house associations . Where no clearing house exists and banks have not been checked recently by State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions without delay . The Federal Government has been working night and day to prepare for the opening of the banks in such a way as to prevent any demoralization when they resume their functions . In anticipation of the emergency legislation permitting broad expansion of the currency , the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has been working on a twenty-four-hour shift for several days , turninir out the new Federal Reserve banknotes . Great quantities of the new currency were shipped to all Federal Reserve Banks for distribution to member banks , and in some instances , it is understood , airplanes have been used to transport it to distant regions . According to officials , sufficient currency will be in the hands of Federal Reserve Banks to meet any needs of the member banks . At first it was indicated that some banks would be permitted to reopen in the order that their applications were received and acted upon , and that in certain instances these institutions might begin operations by tomorrow . This caused a great many complaints from State and municipal officials , who felt that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community which are ready for business to start functioning simultaneously . It is believed that the decision to delay any openings until Monday at least would meet these objections and give time for the shipment of currency to distant points , so that banks in the Eastern territory would have no advantage over banks in the Mid-West and Pacific Coast . Issuance of List Protested . At first the Controller of the Currency had prepared a list of solvent national banks which he was prepared to issue last night after the President had approved the emergency legislation . There was a difference of opinion in the Federal Reserve System as . to the advisability of publishing such a list , the fear being expressed by some that it would unduly alarm depositors of banks not included . A protest was made to the administration by surety companies . who said that such a program might seriously damage other banks not on the list because their soundness had not yet been passed upon . Accepting the arguments of the surety companies , and after a more careful study of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understood that no such list will be published , and that the Federal Reserve Banks will notify the member banks in each region when they can open under the Treasury . rulings . Statement on Reserve Banks . The Treasury statement concerning the opening of Federal Reserve Banks tomorrow to exercise the extraordinary powers under the emergency legislation as to payrolls and necessities read : " The Federal Reserve Board this morning voted to authorize the Federal Reserve Banks under the terms of Section 403 of the emergency bank act to make advances tomorrow for payroll purposes to individuals , firms or corporations on their notes secured by government securities . " The Secretary of the Treasury has issued a regulation according to the terms of the President 's proclamation , permitting the Federal Reserve ' Banks to carry on this business with the public . " Accordingly , the Federal Reserve Banks will be open tomorrow for the purpose of making loans secured by direct obligations of the government , as well as to conduct such other transactions with their member banks as may be necessary to enable member banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended . " The executive order issued today by President Roosevelt provides for a licensing system for the reopening of Federal Reserve member banks and State banks . The Reserve banks must obtain their licenses from the Treasury and State banks from local banking superintendents . Many Trips to White House . Amid great activity at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board today , Secretary Woodin made several trips to the White House to confer with President Roosevelt . Many of these questions were undecided early in the day , and at about 2 o'clock this afternoon Secretary Woodin made the following statement : " The reopening of the banking institutions of the country is not to be accomplished in a few hours . In general , the process will be that the Secretary of the Treasury will receive , through the Federal Reserve Banks , applicationr for reopening by banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System . These applications will be acted upon forthwith . In the case of the State banks it is provided that applications will be made to the proper State authorities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure that there are no mistakes made and that banks , when reopened , must be capable of remaining open . Certain physical difficulties must be overcome ; the most important of these is the necessity of getting the new currency available to the banks in order that there will be no delay when they begin to function . " Under the orders of the Secretary of the Treasury the banks have authority to disburse amounts required for such necessities as medicine and food and for taking care of payrolls and the maintenance of employment . All banks , including Federal Reserve Banks , have been authorized to cooperate in carrying out these relief disbursements . " Under the circumstances it is obviously not possible to state now just when the banking machinery will be operating ' again at full speed , but it is certain that this will be a matter of only a few days at the furthest . " The Bureau of Internal Revenue will issue any regulations pertaining to the March 15 tax payments which will take care of cases where funds are tied up in banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds are not available for the payment . Further Concessions Studied . There was an intimation in the Treasury statements today that further loosening of restrictions on operations of banks which will not be permitted immediately to open for 100 per cent business would be made soon . A study is being made to determine what further concessions could safely be made to give wider scope tooperations of banks which musWontinue to operate only under the Treasury regulations . Senator today denied printed reports that he was understood to have urged upon President Roosevelt the enactment of a law guaranteeing bank deposits . Mr. 's attitude was given in a bill which he introduced in the Senate today . It provided that to indemnify depositors in member banks of the Federal Reserve System and to make provision for the prompt payment to depositors in case of suspension or failure , a fund be created to be known as the depositors ' indemnity fund . This fund would be under the control and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and would be raised by assessments against member banks in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such time as the Federal Reserve Board shall deem advisable until the amount of such fund shall equal 1 per cent of the deposits of the member banks of the Federal Reserve System . " The bill provides that when any bank fails to meet its obligations to depositors , the Federal Reserve Board shall provide for immediate payment out of the depositors ' indemnity fund the amount due such member banks to its depositors . The bill further provides that nonmember banks may come under its provisions if they comply with the prescribed conditions . Could Remove Bank Officers . Another section authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to remove officers of member banks which " engage in unsound practices . " It reads : " In order to guard against abuses by member banks of their position as custodians of indemnified deposits , the Federal Reserve Board is hereby authorized in its discretion and after a hearing to remove officers and directors of such member banks as in its judgment engage in unsound practices , and to replace such officers and directors with others of its own choosing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and operate such member banks . " Senator Vandenberg introduced a bill setting up a public corporation to guarantee 75 per cent of the time deposits in Federal Reserve member banks and such State banks as could qualify as subscribers to a guarantee fund . The fund would be administered by a corporation , the directors of which would consist of the membership of the Federal Reserve Board . Its officers would be named by that board . The capitalization of the corporation would be indefinite , being erected around an appropriation of $125,000,000 from the United States Treasury . In addition to that appropriation , the corporation would assess Federal Reserve Banks one-fourth of their surplus as of Jury 1 , 1932 , of which one-half would be collected on July 1 , 1933 , and the remainder on call by the corporation . Federal Reserve Banks thereafter would be assessed one-fourth of their profits available for surplus , these payments to be made on July 1 of each year .                   @ @
