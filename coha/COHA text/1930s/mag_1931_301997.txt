STUFFED SHIRTS-Clare Boothe Brokaw - Liveri " ht ( $2.50 ) . <P> U. S. civilization puts a high value on specialized knowledge ; but to get full value for inside information you must take it to the right market . Authoress Brokaw knows her Manhattan society . She was born , married , divorced in it . But novel readers are not so interested in dowager- &-debutante; doings as are society editors orf social secretaries . <P> In a succession of satirical sketches Authoress Brokaw parades a long line of gilded caricatures : Social Arbitress Mrs. Townley , her chief rival Mrs. Topping , climbing Mrs. Crumb , many another socialite host &; parasite . All of them dislike one another , exert themselves to the utmost to do one another down . Though Stuffed Shirts is not a continued story , the same stuffed shirts reappear from time to time , and if you are curious about their relationship a genealogical table at the end will make all clear . If you are a constant reader of the society page you may have some fun adventuring among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locale , you will recognize familiar faces .
