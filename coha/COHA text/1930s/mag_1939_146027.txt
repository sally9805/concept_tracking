One of the by-products of the Wartime boom in the chemical industry was the development of non-inflammable plastics . Until then the plastic business 's chief claim to fame was the familiar , fire-hazardous celluloid collar . Since then the world has become accustomed to plastic toothbrushes and fountain pens , automobile steering wheels and gearshift knobs , radio cabinets and poker chips . <P> Major manufacturers of plastic materials -phenol-formaldehyde , Durez , Plaskon , many another-are Bakelite , General Plastics , American Cyanamid Co. , Plaskon Co. , Celluloid Corp. , Du Pont , Eastman Kodak , Monsanto Chemical and Union Carbide and Carbon. * These manufacturers do no molding , sell their plastics to other companies to be shaped . The molders , in turn-excepting those like Westinghouse and General Electric , which use the products in their own business-sell their finished plastic products to the toothbrush , automobile , radio manufacturers . <P> Largest and most active of the general market molders is Chicago Molded Products Corp. , operated by the four Bachner Brothers . Sons of a Chicago watchmaker , the Brothers Bachner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , organized their own plastics company in 1924 to do their own molding on their own dies . That year their net sales were $10,000 . Last year their net sales were $1,358,527 . <P> This week , indicative of the plastic industry 's continuing pleasant prospects , Chicago Molded is floating a $500,000 debenture issue , $100,000 of which will be used in bonds or in cash to retire its 7% preferred stock . Purpose of the public offering : to retire all outstanding loans , add a modest $120,000 to working capital and plant improvement . <P> <P> - Another entrant in the field is Henry Ford , who makes his own distributor housings , gearshift knobs and other accessories from soy-beans.
