txt Objection to Editorial Your editorial of Nov. 25 , censuring the Spanish Ambassador for his speech at Tampa , strikes one as unfair , although , of course , you did not so intend it . Nothing the Ambassador said justified your conclusion that he was trying to decide the policy of the American Government . When an emissary from Great Britain , such as Lord Marley , comes over here , tours the country and tells us what we must do about many matters that are our own concern , going to the insufferable length of instructing us to violate our covenant with the people of the Philippines , I do not find that THE TIMES has a word of criticism of him , although he would seem to he far more worthy of rebuke than the Spanish Ambassador . CHARLES EDWARD RUSSELL . Washington , D. C. , Nov. 30 , 1936.
