EUROPA IN LIMBO-Robert Briffault- Scribner ( $2.75 ) . <P> Robert Stephen Briffault has had a more than respectable reputation among anthropologists ever since he wrote The Mothers ( 1927 ) . When he was 59 , he published his first novel , Europa ( TIME , Sept. 9 , 1935 ) . So many more readers were titillated by its scandalous scenes of pre-War continental society than were bored by its ponderous length that the book soared into the best-selling class . Last week a sizable audience was waiting with shocking hopefulness for the sequel , Europa In Limbo . But purple passages in the latest Briffault were thin and few . An earnest , disillusioned , clumsily Voltairian novel , its lean streaks of perception were buried in thick stretches of unmuscled fat . <P> Taking up the fortunes of Julian Bern , cosmopolitan young English intellectual , where Europa dropped them . Author Briffault discovers his hero holidaying in Belgium with Zena , his current mistress . War has been declared , and the German invasion quickly comes too close for comfort . Julian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as spectators of a world gone mad . They soon find both England and their chosen role impossible . Zena goes back to her native Russia ; Julian despairingly enlists . Thereafter the narrative is governed less by probability than by convenience : coincidences pop up as required , scenes shift and actors speak as the prompter-manager too obviously dictates . <P> Few readers , prodded as they are , are likely to miss Author Briffault 's point . At the front Julian sees a coward 's drunken action win a V.C. Nurses who served with " Martyr " Edith Cavell show no sympathy for her admirers . Meeting Lenin on his way back to Russia to guide the revolution , Julian wishes him every success . Briffault 's spokesman-hero , written down as missing after a hopeless attack , recovers in a German hospital , goes to Russia rather than return to perfidious England after the Armistice . There he finds Zena again , marries her . Though he survives both the Red- &-White; civil war and Zena 's death , Julian eventually discovers no better niche for himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading for the U. S. , on the apparent principle of any port in a storm . Dubiously optimistic last line is supplied by a farewell telegram from the woman Julian has lately left , informing him that she is to bear his child , heir to the civilization Europe has squandered : " He lives who will see it . "
