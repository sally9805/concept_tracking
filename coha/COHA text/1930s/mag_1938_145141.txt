THE DOOR OF LIFE-Enid Bagnold- Morrow ( $2.50 ) . <P> In " National Velvet " Enid Bagnold won a big U. S. audience with a slight story about an English girl and a race horse . <P> In The Door of Life she has taken on a bigger theme , which she describes as " the relationship of a mother and young children and unborn children and just-born children , " adding her belief that her novel is " the first attempt to portray the very first moments of this relationship in de-tail . " Whether or not it is the first attempt , Enid Bagnold 's admirers are likely to hope that it will be her last , since The Door of Life gives such a rosy view of the joys of motherhood , contains so many lush emotional passages and so many unreal philosophical conversations about woman 's responsibilities , that it might have been written in an effort to check Britain 's declining birth rate . Mother of three sons and a daughter , Enid Bagnold in private life is Lady Roderick Jones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency . <P> The central character of The Door of Life is a middle-aged woman of the upper middle class , who is referred to throughout as " the squire . " This in itself is likely to be a little confusing to U. S. readers , who usually think of English squires as ruddy , irascible old gents , more or less akin to Kentucky Colonels . So when they read about the squire picking up her sewing , putting on her evening dress and performing other distinctly feminine duties , their surprise tends to make them miss the point of Miss Bagnold 's story . The squire , it turns out , is so called because in the absence of her husband she runs the household . Waiting for the birth of her fifth child , she watches over her three sons and her gentle , intuitive daughter , takes no nonsense from anybody : " Nonsense and a trouble , " she thinks , " but it had to go on . No other way of living if you wanted to walk to your grave cloaked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpses of the children and constant troubles with the help , these reflections make up most of The Door of Life . Although the . squire bears a healthy son without too much trouble , there is such confusion downstairs - the cook leaves because she can not stand childbirth , another turns out to be immoral , the butler hates women , his substitute is a drunk and a maid is discharged for theft-that readers are likely to forget that Author Bagnold is picturing the fortitude of English mothers , not the corruption of English domestics.
