Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever <P> ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) continues the adventures of the Hardys of Carvel , the old judge ( Lewis Stone ) , his long-suffering wife ( Fay Holden ) , moony Marian ( Cecilia Parker ) and bratty Andy ( Mickey Rooney ) . The Hardys ' wholesome , homey doings are designed to arouse in their millions of fans no emotion stronger than delighted recognition . Andy , more than ever the tail that wags the Hardy dog , reacts to spring by falling in love with his pretty new dramatics teacher ( Helen Gilbert ) . <P> Effect of the first lilacs on Judge Hardy is to make him an easy prey for a couple of swindlers . Andy and his father eventually cool off , to the accompaniment of such a wealth of domestic detail , adolescent humor and sage headshakings that hyper-domestic cinemaddicts will have a wonderful time . Those who dislike Mother 's Day will be apt to feel that they have just been through it again . <P> The Man in the Iron Mask ( United Artists-Edward Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wildest stabs ever made at history by that extravagant Romancer Alexander Dumas . Its hypothesis : that when Louis XIII 's good Queen Anne was brought to bed in 1638 , she gave birth to twins . Because dynastically two heirs would have been worse than none , the King reared one son as the future Louis XIV , palmed off the other as the son of his loyal Gascon guard , d'Artagnan ( Warren William ) . <P> What Louis XIII could not foretell was that Louis XIV ( Louis Hayward ) would grow up into an arrogant wastrel , his brother Philippe of Gascony ( Louis Hayward ) into a fine broth of a boy , next to his tutor d'Artagnan the best blade in France . Brother Louis at first finds Brother Philippe useful as a decoy for assassins and as a stand-in with his betrothed , the Spanish Infanta Maria Theresa ( Joan Bennett ) , while he is dallying with brassy little Louise de la Vallire ( Marian Martin ) . <P> But when Louis learns Philippe 's real identity , he claps him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the picture , d'Artagnan 's musketeers soon had him out again , gave Louis the mask and Philippe his name , girl and crown . The picture shows Philippe as something of a New Dealer , eager to abolish the salt tax and dress up the peasantry . But judging from the history of Louis XIV 's reactionary reign ( 1643-1715 ) , France never felt the difference , must have switched bottles without changing its Bourbon . <P> For Actor Louis Hayward , who has made several false starts in cinema , his spirited attack on what the movie industry still calls a Douglas Fairbanks role may at last mean a place above the Hollywood salt . Born 30 years ago in Johannesburg , son of an English banker , Actor Hayward made his London stage name as a juvenile smart enough for Noel Coward shows , his screen debut in the English version of Sorrell and Son . Brought to Hollywood four years ago , he swashbuckled promisingly in Anthony Adverse but soon ran into an unpredictable snag : he began losing his British accent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and supporting parts to skate in The Duke of West Point after the death of British Skater Jack Dunn , liked him well enough to entrust him with his crucial part in The Man in the Iron Mask .
