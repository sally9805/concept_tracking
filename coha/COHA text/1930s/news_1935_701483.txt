txt In a turbulent session , during which Representative Patman of Texas , author of the $2,400,000,000 " printingpress " Bonus Bill , was booed , the convention of the American Legion today again went on record for Immediate payment of the bonus . The resolution , however , called for no specific method of payment , except at face value and with cancellation of accrued interest on borrowed money . It also called for " separation " of the bonus question from any other legislative issue , and further criticized the Patman stand by approving the fight of Commander Frank N. Belgrano Jr . for the " VinsonLegion " Bonus Bill before Congress . The boos that met Mr. Patman as he discussed his measure before the delegates were mingled with a few cheers , but it appeared so probable that trouble would ensue if he continued to talk from the floor , that he himself gave up . Then , when Representative of Texas took the stage to plead for his colleague , he met the same reception . " Take this resolution and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. shouted as he left the platform . Five in Race for Commander . With the bonus problem out of the way the delegates elected Ray Murphy of Iowa national commander to succeed Mt . Belgrano . Two ballots were needed , and if Vilas Whaley of Wisconsin , who polled only 49 votes on the first roll call , had not changed his State delegation 's vote from himself to Mr. Murphy on the second ballot a deadlock appeared certain . Harry W. Colmery of Kansas was the closest rival of Mr. Murphy , having 414 votes to Mr. Murphy 's 566 on the first ballot . R required a vote of 604 to elect . Five of the original eleven candidates withdrew last night from the contest , leaving the race to Messrs . Murphy , Colmery , Cliff of Minnesota , Whaley of Wisconsin , Devine of New Hampshire and Rash of Kentucky . Mr. Devine polled 49 on the first ballot and then withdrew . On the next vote Mr. Murphy had 598 votes when Wyoming , the last State , was reached , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Mr. Whaley directed a shift to Mr. Murphy . Bedlam broke loose then and a parade of States swung about the auditorium as Mr. Colmery , his voice shaken , asked that the vote be unanimous . Besides the bonus resolution , the delegates adopted several others , including one reiterating a demand ' for universal draft . Others urged preference for veterans in all government construction and other jobs ; a ban on employment of aliens ; granting of honorable discharges to men discharged with " bad conduct " charges for overstaying leave during war service , and liberalization of treatment of emergency officers of the World War . A " surprise " resolution , adopted unanimously , called upon the Legion vigilantly to oppose executive clemency to Grover C. Bergdoll , " or any other draft evader . " Recent overtures to Washington on behalf of Bergdoll , sponsors of the resolution asserted , indicated that he might be allowed to return to this country and be liberated through executive clemency . Another resolution offered provided for a committee of three to be appointed by the incoming national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in the death of several hundred veterans in FERA camps along the keys . To Avoid " Currency Theories . " When the bonus resolution was introduced by Mr. Whaley , chairman of the legislative committee , Commander Belgrano , knowing that Mr. Patman and his supporters were in the , udience , called Vice Commander Milo J. Warner of Ohio to take the chair . The resolution read as follows : " Be it resolved that : " 1 . We request immediate cash payment of the adjusted service certificates at face value , with cancellation of accrued interest on loans and refund of interest paid , and do hereby reaffirm the Miami convention resolution on this subject . " 2 . We request the immediate favorable action of the Congress , and the approval of the President of the United States , upon this clear-cut and single issue , without having it complicated or confused by other issues of government finance or theories of currency , with which the Legion does not intend to become involved . " 3 . We hereby ratify and approve the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legion 's bill at the last session of Congress . " Tatman to Continue Fight . The wording caused Mr. Patman , sitting with the Texas delegation , to ask for recognition , and when he addressed the chair with " Patman of Texas " boos came from around and from the galleries . The gavel of the chairman pounded for order until the gavel broke and then a big bell on the stage was hammered for several minutes . " I am much in favor of the first part of the resolution , " Mr. Patman said when some order was restored . " I am in favor of full and immediate payment . But leave it to Congress to find the method . " He was interrupted by more boos . " The method is secondary , " he finally managed to say . " There has been some misunderstanding about my position and I am sorry for this I am first , last and always for our great American Legion . " I am a poor man and I have borrowed large amounts of money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for payment , 100 per cent . This time , if it 's our bill or any other bill , we want immediate payment . To that end , my comrades , I assure you I will work . " John Dwight Sullivan , Past New York State Commander , then criticized Mr. Patman . He said he did not want to see the Legion used for a political purpose , adding that " We in New York do not subscribe to the theories of the gentleman from Texas . " Mr. , also a delegate , obtained recognition then and sought to " clarify " the question . " This good man , your friend and mine , " he said before boos drowned out his voice , " spent his own money fighting for the bonus . " Murphy Aided State Bonus .

In the voting today he was opposed by the New York delegation , which cast its eighty ballots twice for Mr. Colmery . After the election Mr. Murphy was escorted to the stage , where in a brief talk he took a thrust at " closed-door politicians and kingmakers . " " It is my purpose to follow the leadership of my great predecessors , " he said . " I accept this honor with mixed feelings . I am a free man , to do what I think I ought to do .
