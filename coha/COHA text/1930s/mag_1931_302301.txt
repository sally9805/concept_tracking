Dracula ( Universal ) . Director Tod Browning , who had charge of the best Lon Chaney pictures , has a talent for creating macabre atmosphere by the use of " interiors . " He is a director who never , if he can help it , photographs a scene out of doors and then only at night or in a fog . Bram Stoker 's famous novel about a vampire who survives hundreds of years after his death by drinking human blood and who is killed at last by a professor who drives a stake through his heart as he lies in his coffin provides ideal material for Browning . He has done a good job with it , especially with the settings in a madhouse and in cellars . Bela Lugosi , who made a success in Dracula on the Manhattan stage , takes the leading role . As the scenes flash in twilight , accompanied by such noises as wolves howling , bats screeching , and women screaming , Lugosi , in the form of a huge bat , flits in and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action takes place . Dracula is an exciting melodrama , not as good as it ought to be but a cut above the ordinary **26;11683;TOOLONG type of mystery film . Silliest sound : Helen Chandler 's feeble soprano chirrup uttered repeatedly as an indication of superhuman fear . <P> Bright Lights ( First National ) . Made a year ago , Bright Lights was put on the shelf , presumably because too many other pictures just like it were being released . Unfortunately , seasoning has only helped to shelve it permanently . Its backstage plot , its industriously plugged songs , its imperfect sound-recording , its imperfect technicolor , already are relics of a dead past in picture making . Dorothy Mackaill is good looking and Frank Fay fairly funny . The plot-a show girl who is about to marry a millionaire when her past , in the person of Noah Beery , turns up and threatens her happiness-is good enough to suggest that Bright Lights would have held its own with the competition of last year . Most tedious shot : Frank McHugh as a drunken reporter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty clothes and struggles with stupid dialog , with weak direction by George Abbott , and with a story by Dana Burnet that might have been impressive , if thoroughly and patiently dealt with , but that turns out badly . A young man ( Phillips Holmes ) who has held up a radio factory meets a discouraged girl in a city street late at night . She hides him in her room and , liking each other , they make a bargain . They decide to go to Florida to spend the $20,000 he has stolen ; when it is gone , they will commit suicide . In Palm Beach , Holmes still wants to kill himself but the girl wants to live . When police come to arrest the robber she has obtained some more money from another admirer and thought of a way out of their difficulties . The picture is bearable because of its handsome settings and because it is well acted . Best sequence : <P> Nancy Carroll going to the casino for some fun on what she believes is her last night on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandalier at the
