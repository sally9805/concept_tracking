New York , " which will be published in January by Messrs . Ivison , Blakeman , Taylor &; Co . It is unfortunate that Mr. Randall 's style is not what it ought to be to attract readers , to say nothing of what we might expect from a prominent school officer . He has a seemingly incurable fondness for long sentences , which at times do not permit one to see the end from the beginning on the same page . In the two octavo pages of the Introduction to the present work he has found a pretext for using but ten full stops , though needing about nine hundred words with which to express himself ; and two consecutive sentences occupy exactly one page . ? Counting ourselves among the well-wishers of the South in all that concerns her future prosperity , material and moral , we have read with no little interest Prof. Francis S. Hohnes 's brochure on the " Phosphate Rocks of South Carolina , and the ' Great Carolina Marl Bed ' " ( Charleston : Holmes 's Book House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowment to the State , but it has been quite overshadowed by the discovery of the extent and richness of the phosphate rocks , since the conclusion of the rebellion . Mr. Holmes , who was lately professor of geology and palontology in the College of Charleston , and who first encountered these rocks as long ago as 1837 , when carbonates were alone thought worth the seeking , enters into his subject con amore , for personal as well as professional reasons . He gives several colored plates of the strata of the S'outhern Atlantic coast and of the Charleston basin , and he endeavors to establish the derivation of the phosphates from the underlying marl by the agency of the fossil remains in which the basin so wonderfully abounds . In narrating the circumstances which led , only three years ago , to a realization of the mineral wealth which lay beneath the superficial soil , Prof. Holmes shows that , but for the interruption of communication with England on account of the rebellion , the discovery might have been made in 1864 . Dr. Ansted 's book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " discovered at about that time , was procured by the author in August , 1867 , and as it confirmed him in an opinion he had expressed in 1849 , " that Charleston was located geologically on the same formation as that of the great city of London , " he was encouraged to associate himself with the enterprise of developing the neglected resources of his native State . The connection between abstract science and human progress is seldom more striking than in this relation of Dr. Ansted 's analysis of an English rock to the business of digging and treating for fertilizers the phosphate rocks of South Carolina  --  a business which has created a new commercial staple , and has already attracted six millions of Northern capital ; and which , in the case of the beds of navigable rivers , was , as our readers may remember , lately made the monopoly of a company not too careful to give a quid pro quo to the State . Prof. Holmes enumerates a dozen other considerable companies that operate upon land . ? The Minnesota Historical Society has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Collections . It contains several memoirs of distinguished citizens of the State and of friendly Indians , some historical reminiscences , a translation of Wnicault 's " Relation , " and other papers of local interest . What is of most value , and will command the attention of librarians and students of history , is Mr. J. F. Williams 's very full " Bibliography of Minnesota , " which occupies not less than sixty pages . It is , as the compiler remarks , a matter of surprise that so much has been printed relating to a State organized as a separate commonwealth only twenty-one years ago . Mr. Williams , who is the Society 's librarian , has arranged his titles by subjects , and chronologically , with cross-references and an alphabetical index of authors . Three pages are devoted to works concerning the Indian tribes of Minnesota , and six to the Dakota bibliography ( works written for the mission , educational and religious ) . A history of this mission is given by Rev. Stephen R. Riggs , who has himself been a great part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works comprehended under the heads just alluded to . The Rev. S. W. Pond , who seems to belong to the church militant  --  not only on account of the singular record he has kept , but because he relates that when a certain Dakota had been killed by the Chippewas , he " urged " the tribe of the former " to try to kill " the murdering party , who were concealed in a grove easily surrounded  --  enumerates the number of those slain on both sides in the war , fare between the Dakotas of the Mississippi and Minnesota in the course of the ten years 1835-1844 . The number is not great , and Mr. Pond explains why it is not , the principal reasons being that the Indians do not fight when they can help it on even terms , and that the taking of a single scalp makes a hostile expedition a success . In considering the influence on this tribal warfare of the presence of United States forces in the territory , he concludes that the loss of life " was not much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snelling was built than it was before . " This was especially due to the fact that the Indians " were compelled to restore all captives taken in war , and they preferred scalps around which they could dance to captives whom they could not retain . " ? President Barnard 's recently printed " Analysis of some Statistics of Collegiate Education , " written a year ago , and read last January to the trustees of Columbia College , is deservedly exciting attention , and ought to be more widely distributed than was intended . The enquiry was undertaken with a view to ascertain , if possible , the reasons for Columbia 's backwardness in growing , and what might be hoped for it if , like Harvard , it threw off the classical strait-jacket , and adopted a more liberal course of studies . The immediate conclusion reached  --  that New York City has too many colleges for its needs , and that Columbia is likely to gain in numbers only by removing the college into the country  --  is of least consequence to the general reader of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has interest for the intelligent population of every State . His remarks upon the irrational and disastrous multiplication of colleges are eminently truthful , and it is a pity they could not be laid before all those well-meaning citizens  --  there are scores of them , at this moment , we are confident  --  who have planned in their wills to establish a new academy or high-school or college , without suspecting that they are about to inflict a positive injury upon the higher education they wish to foster . The result of this imprudence in the past has been , in the language of Dr. Barnard , " either that the country voluntarily bears a bur-then , in support of collegiate education , three or four times as heavy as it need be , " since a college adequately equipped can as cheaply educate several hundred students as the eighty now educated on the average ; " or that , of the institutions which bear the title and legally exercise the privileges of colleges , a very large number are not well provided with the instrumentalities indispensable to the efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New England . ( excepting Maine ) , in New York , and New Jersey , there are twenty colleges , not counting Columbia , whose catalogues have been examined by President Barnard , with results to be mentioned . Not less than six of these , we observe , are distinctly denominational , while as many more owe a large part of their support to sectarian considerations . Nearly all draw students from this city and vicinity ? Yale most , and more than twice as many as Harvard , which stands next , but not twice as many as it drew in 1830 , when the population of New York was only a third of what it is now . This fact is one of several which induce Dr. Barnard to assert " that everywhere throughout the country , that system of general mental culture which is to so large an extent dependent on the careful study of classical literature , and which has been so long believed to be indispensable to finished scholarship , is losing ground from year to year in the favor of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberally educated among us , in city and country alike , when compared with the total population , is steadily diminishing . " For instance , in the States under consideration , the ratio in 1840 was 1 to 1,602 ; in 1860 , 1 to 1,699 in 1868 , 1 to 1,901 ; in 1809 , 1 to 1,841 ? the war having something to do with the decline between 1860 and 1808-9 . Or , regarding the college age , in 1840 , one person out of 67 who were suitable received a college education ; in 1860 , one out of 71 ; in 1868 , one out of 79 ; and in 1869 , one out of 77 . But , again , discarding all those students not belonging to New England , New York , or New Jersey , only one in 93 of the proper age is now educated in their colleges , or one in 2,200 of the inhabitants . If , further , " we exclude from this comparison the three New England States , Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts , Rhode island , Connecticut , and New York , while themselves scarcely drawing any from these latter States , we shall obtain a result still more striking " : in the old and populous States remaining after this exclusion , " only one student is sent to college for every 2,567 inhabitants , and only one young man in 107 is liberally educated . " Finally , in the twenty colleges , the students from abroad are to those from the same State as 1,684 to 1,718 ; and in six , the former greatly outnumber the latter . One of these is Yale , of whose 518 students Connecticut furnishes but 146 ? one to about 4,000 inhabitants . In 1824-5 , it furnished 178 , or more than half , and one in 1,600 ; in 1830-7 , 194 , a little less than half , but in the same ratio of population ; in 1865 , this contingent fell to 114 . ? Taking " liberal education " in the narrow sense in which Dr. Barnard employs it , there can be no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the colleges are losing ground when brought in comparisen with the increase of population . This increase , however , is mainly due to the immigration of foreigners , whose language or condition , or both , prevent them from sending their quota of recruits to our higher institutions of learning . Connecticut 's growth since 1836-7 has been , as everybody knows , of this description , and before we yield to the apparent force of the argument derived from her neglect of Yale , there are other statistics which we might exact . For instance , in the past thirty-five years , what change has taken place in the relative proportion of native and foreign-born citizens of that State ? What part of the emigration from it to the West has been from among the classes that support our colleges ? and what is the total number of students belonging to Connecticut now attending colleges , whether in the State or out of it , as compared with that in 1836-7 ? Ten years hence these queries might be answered without our being obliged to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minor causes , the higher education given to girls has , perhaps , in mixed families with limited incomes , determined against collegiate education for the boys ; and it will not , we suppose , be doubted , that knowledge is more generally diffused now than thirty years ago , and that the sources of information have so multiplied , and the means of instruction so improved , as to lessen the value of college teaching in the eyes of the public . Along with all this , the learned professions have been steadily losing in prestige ; and since they used to be the chief end of studying Greek and Latin , their decline has naturally involved that of classical instruction . ? The decline of the ministry has been illustrated in a discourse at Amherst by the Rev. Mr. Cushing . He selected the eight New England collegestwhich were founded by Congregationalists , chiefly with the view of turning out ministers , and reviewed their alumni for the fifty years , . 1815-65 . In that time he found they had furnished 16,240 graduates , of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , dividing the half-century into decades , the proportion of ministers ran thus : Thirty , thirty-five , twenty-seven , twenty , and eighteen per cent . ; , and the actual numbers , 688 , 988 , 946 , 730 , 757 . In the last decade , the total number of graduates is nearly double that of the first , while the number of ministers is but slightly increased . Amherst has been most productive of ministers  --  forty-six per cent . ; Middlebury , forty-two per cent . ; Williams , thirty-three ; Yale , Dartmouth , and the University of Vermont , twenty-four each ; Bowdoin , twenty-one ; and Harvard , eleven . ? " Orthodox Phrenology " is the suggestive title of a recent English publication , which would seem to commend itself to Mr. Beecher ; and this , too , is not opposed to his ways of thinking : " The Intelligence and Perfectibility of Animals , from a Philosophic Point of View , with a Few Letters on Man , " by Charles Georges Leroy . Dr. C. D. Ginsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a translation . Mr. J. M. Camp writes a " Baptist History , from the Foundation of the Christian Church to the Present Time ; " and the Rev. Thomas Vasey furnishes an Introduction to a " Life of John Wesley , " for children . " A History of Animal Plagues , " by G. Fleming , who has written about horse-shoes and horse-shoeing , we take to be a practical sort of work , of value to stock-raisers . Naturalists will be interested in Mr. II . C. Watson 's " Compendium of the Cybele Britannica , or British Plants in their Geographical Relations ; " and artists in Mr. William Walker 's " Lessons in Animals and Figures as applied to Landscape Painting , " When our postal cards come into vogue ( and an enterprising Yankee publisher has printed some for use , of course without any authorized reduction of postage ) , we may be glad to avail ourselves of the late Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort 's " Cryptography : A System of Secret Writing adapted for Telegrams and the New Halfpenny Postage Cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sells for sixpence . ? " The Phanix , a monthly magazine for China , Japan , and Eastern Asia , " is the title of a new literary venture in London , under the conduct of Professor James Summers , of King 's College . The necessarily restricted circle of readers to which a magazine of this class is addressed prevents the indulgence of very sanguine hopes that it will prove a commercial success to its projectors . In a literary point of view , it is neither better nor worse than the numerous predecessors of a similar nature which are to be found on the book-shelves of most Orientalists . Some inscrutable law , moreover , appears to operate against the continuance of an " Asiatic " magazine after the hand which launched it has ceased to labor for its pages . The Chinese Repository , Chinese and Japanese Repository , . Votes and Queries on China and Japan , Straits Magazine ( the first-named successfully edited for a period of twenty years by our erudite countryman , Dr. S. Wells Willolams , now I.T . S. Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , have lived and died within our own memory , untilwe have come to the conclusion that the law referred to is absolute . We mean , however , no disparagement to the pages of the Phee , nix in our remark as to its comparative value . Publications of this nature have usually received the hearty support of leading Orientalists , as being the only means of snaking public the results of their special labors , and the number before us contains several papers of interest . Mr. Hyde Clarke , foreign secretary of the English Ethnological Society , contributes a good article upon the ancient Scythians . A review of General Alexander 's dramatic adaptation of an old Chinese romance , is perhaps the most noteworthy paper of the current number , which also contains an article on the Tientsing massacre  --  which is , of course , inevitable in any publication supposed to bear , however remotely , on Chinese . topics . A translation from the Chinese entitled " The Pearl-embroidered Garment " is amusing , and a " Note on the Manchu Language " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IT is imagined that in the magazine world as well as in the vegetable it is always evident when the year declines towards its end . The preparation of the January magazine , the slumber extraordinary , which is to appear in the December holidays , at the time of the making of presents , is held to be very exhausting to editor and publisher , and the December issues  --  or rather those of mid-Novemier  --  ate usually held to be , in consequence , far feebler than common . This , however , we take to be a mistaken view , and arises , we imagine , from popular comparison of the magazine in possession with the prospective magazine with its heralded list of famous names  --  names which , as a matter of fact , very commonly cover magazine matter which is no better than the general run of periodical literature , and often is not so good . It may be the proverbial blindness of authors to the relative merits of their various works ; or it may be their easy good nature , worked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be for some reason so discreditable as carelessness of their own reputation and of the interests of literature , provided only money may be had ; but , for whatever reason , it is certainly true that both here and in England men of eminence can be got to sell to the publishers , more especially at the time of the New Year Magazines and Annuals , and to accept excessive pay for them , productions which often seem the mere sweepings and leavings of their portfolios and study-tables . Oftener , per-Imps , they sell productions not quite so bad as that , but still far below the level at which it becomes men of eminence to remain , and , too , far below the level at which it is profitable for the rest of us that they should remain . It is , of course , their names that they sell ; or , at all events , their names is what the publishers buy , and the quality of the goods purchased very frequently appears to show that the seller knew very well the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we think we have observed , that despite the great noise which ushers in the first magazines of the year , these are not in the average better than the other numbers , and thus it happens that the December numbers are popularly pronounced weak . It IS not that the preparations for January induce mental and spiritual exhaustion in the editor ; primarily , the evil has its root  --  in ourselves , that we are such persons as greedily to buy cheap stuff if it have a dear brand on it ; and , secondarily , in the publisher , who takes advantage of this weakness of ours , and in the poets and essayists and statesmen and divines , and celebrated persons generally , who are not above pocketing money in a transaction which they can hardly hold in high estimation . The December magazines are on the whole readable , though there is in them hardly any work of the first class  --  if we except Mr. Howells 's essay and Mrs. Stowe 's story in the Atlantic . The former , if only for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of the first class . It is marked by all Mr. Howells 's subtlety and delicacy of humor and fancy , and it is careful and finished in point of expression , as is sure to be the case with the work of this writer , who is not a writer to whose example any author will ever refer when the question comes before him of selling his name with some crude or trivial writing attached . A humorist of a decidedly different sort , as respects either subtlety or delicacy or finish , is Mr. Ralph Keeler , who writes " The Confessions of a Patent Medicine Man " ? a promising subject , but here treated in an unskilful way . The mixture of narrator and the subject sketched is unpleasantly obvious ; and the subjective humor of the writer adds nothing to the effect produced by such glimpses as we get of the really grotesque creature whose portrait he had an opportunity of painting . Some of the stories told are amusing , and probably there is little or nothing false in them . Very unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
