GOOD WEDNESDAY A STORY BY KATHARINE BRUSH I T WAS a Wednesday . Weekdays in Miss Annie Baxter 's life were all pretty much alike ; and it might as well have been a Tuesday , or a Thursday , or even a Saturday . But it was n't ? it was a Wednesday . I feel that I should stress this , because Miss Baxter would have . She was herself a storyteller , and the name of the day upon which a thing happened was of tremendous , of vital importance to her . Indeed , her mind sometimes mislaid the anecdote altogether , in the heat of a **38;152;TOOLONG - a-Friday debate . This , then , was a Wednesday . Miss Baxter awoke punctually at six-fiftynine , and shut off her alarm clock set for seven . She always beat the clock thus . Only once in a year or more had it roused her . It had been fast . The shock to her nerves had ruined Miss Baxter 's whole day . She got out of bed . She wore a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and puckered at the throat with blue baby ribbon . She was tall and gaunt in the nightgown , and her bare feet were long and very flat on the floor  --  they formed capital letter L 's with her thin ankles . You were surprised to see that she had slept all night , and apparently perfectly well , with ten or a dozen water-wave combs , bound round with a veil , on her head . She was not a young woman . She admitted that herself . She said , " I 'm forty-three , and I do n't make any bones about it " ? a proud boast , but inaccurate . She was fifty-one . The hair under the combs was gray and sparse , and Miss Baxter 's skin was grayish , and her forehead was deep-grooved from lifting her eyebrows about things . She had sharp , small gray-green eyes , before which she now put shell-rimmed glasses . The rims of the glasses were very light- " champagne-colored " the optician had called them . " Or pale lemon , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses she could discern her bedroom slippers  --  black leather slippers with pom-poms , although the pom-pom was off one . A client of Miss Baxter 's , one Mrs. Doctor Means , had given her the slippers a year ago Christmas . Putting them on , Miss Baxter thought of Mrs. Doctor Means . She was due to shampoo Mrs. Means to-day at three-thirty , and to cut her , and maybe to dye her . Then again , maybe not . Mrs. Means yearned to be dyed , but was seared of the Doctor . " As if he 'd notice ! " Miss Baxter scoffed to herself . " He 's so begigged with that dish-faced nurse of his , he do n't notice anything ! I could tell her that . " And , indeed , Miss Baxter had all but told Mrs. Means that on several occasions . A hint , she had felt , was the duty of a friend . This was a cool morning for June . Miss Baxter closed the window -- but in much more time than it takes to tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house next door were but a few feet away . Miss Baxter ap-proached her window sideways , along the wall  --  she sneaked up on it , and flashing out an arm , jerked down the shade . This done , she advanced , reached up underneath with both arms , and lowered the window . It was a breathless moment . She would never forget the day when the shade had suddenly rolled back up of itself , all the way to the top , and left her framed for the world to see in her nightgown . To-day she had caught an oblique glimpse of something on a window sill next door , and when her own window was shut she applied one eye to a little hole that there happened to be in the shade , just about at eye-level . She was able to discover that the thing on the opposite sill was a square white florist 's box . For some reason this appeared to anger Miss Baxter . She sniffed . It was plain that the sight of the box conveyed more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that she disapproved strongly of the whole business . While she was dressing the telephone rang . Miss Baxter , over her neat white camisole and petticoat donned a dressing-gown of blue cotton crepe , embroidered with storks  --  another Christmas present from another customer  --  and hurried downstairs . The telephone stood on a table in the hall , with an appointment book beside it , and a gayly painted flat wooden doll hiding all but the mouthpiece , which protruded from the doll 's green bodice . Miss Baxter seated herself on the chair beside the telephone . She lifted the receiver delicately and held it to her ear , but she did not say " Hello . " She did not say anything . It was not her number that had rung , but the Henry fiddles ' number  --  one long ring and two short . Miss Baxter listened attentively to a conversation between Mrs. Henry Biddle and the milk company . It seemed that the milk company had no whipping cream , but expected to have some later in the day . Mrs. Biddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , and she and Miss Baxter , inthe order named , rang off . Miss Baxter went back upstairs and finished dressing . She came down again presently , wearing a dark-blue dress with dots in it . A crepe de chine dress . It was a matter of pride with her to work in crepe de chine dresses . She was no uniformed hairdresser  --  she was a lady who took care of other ladies ' hair . She was as good as anybody in town , and better than most . She wanted this understood , and it was understood and always had been . She was the departed Deacon Baxter 's daughter Annie  --  Miss Baxter to you . She owned this house she lived in and she owned a bouncing little car , in which she drove herself from appointment to appointment . She had no " shoppe , " no professional parlor , here or anywhere . She carried her implements in a battered leather dressing-case , and did her work in her various clients ' homes . Sometimes she was asked to stay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for a meal if the man of the house was absent . Her clients ' husbands were accustomed to avoid Miss Baxter . Miss Baxter said they dare n't face her  --  she knew too much about them . Arriving for the second time that morning in her lower hall , she unlocked , unchained , and unbolted the front door and opened it . Her ropy of the Daily Herald lay on the porch , rolled tight and twisted and tossed up there from the sidewalk . She emitted a sound of impatience when she saw it . How many times , she wondered , had she told that little Mooney boy not to roll her paper , and not to twist it , and not to throw it , but to bring it up the steps and lay it down flat like a little man ? She unrolled the paper standing in her doorway , looking up and down the street meanwhile . The street was called Green Street . It was an ordinary thoroughfare lined with unpretentious houses , and with timid maple trees in wire cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , found the scenery fascinating . There were the new awnings on the house directly across ? those in particular . Miss Baxter had not known that the O'Neills contemplated new awnings , and she bad somehow failed to note them when she came home last evening . They were quite a shock . Miss Baxter 's hands on the newspaper stopped , arrested . She stared at the awnings . She counted those she could see . How many awnings were there in all , and what did awnings cost ? Whatever they cost , they cost more than Frank O'Neill ought to be spending  --  owing everybody the way he did . On behalf of Mr. O'Neill 's creditors , of whom Miss Baxter was not one , she resented the awnings bitterly . " Stripes ! " she snorted , under her breath She would have been pained to know how like profanity it sounded . She went in , and prepared her breakfast  --  an orange , some oatmeal , two soft-boiled eggs , toast , marmalade , caffeine-less coffee . She set the dining-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Annie Baxter eating in the kitchen . She had an electric percolator and an electric toaster from which at intervals the slices of tanned bread sprang forth , making a loud noise about it . Miss Baxter , though she had had this toaster for two years now , always jumped at the noise  --  though her hand no longer flew to her breast in terror . She munched , and read the Herald , beginning with the society page . This she found unusually meaty and engrossing . Sometimes there was n't so much , except of course the club meetings , and the column called " Brief Mention , " in which , in individual two-line paragraphs , were listed all the ladies who had been to Cleveland shopping . Miss Baxter herself , in the past , had twice appeared under " Brief Mention . " She had both clippings in an envelope somewhere . One of them said , " Miss Annie Baxter of Green Street was a Cleveland shopper Saturday . " The other , of a later date , said , " Among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street " ? only her name was misspelled . It was " Baxten , " through some regrettable error . To-day there was much news . There were shoppers galore , and there were travelers off on trips , and there were convalescent invalids doing well , and there were house guests . Mrs. Archie Weller had entertained a few friends yesterday in honor of her house guest Mrs. S. K. Speare of East Clinton ; auction bridge had been enjoyed . The Busy Bees had met with Mrs. Homer Matthews at the latter 's beautiful residence on Fairview Boulevard , which was tastefully decorated with daisies and asters . Miss Elsie Corelli of West End , whose marriage to William Sleeper would be celebrated on June 26 , had been surprised by her many friends with a tin shower Monday evening . This afternoon Mrs. Henry Biddle would entertain the Hearts and Spades at her pleasant home on Green Street- " Ah ! " thought Miss Baxter . That explained the whipping cream . Finally , there was a wedding announcement . It was not prominently displayed  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Miss Baxter called " tucked away off down in one corner . " She did not see it at all until she had almost finished her breakfast , and her first thought was the appalling one that she might have missed it entirely . This thought came and went . Miss Baxter , tense , was concentrating . She was sitting on the edge of her chair , her face was close to the paper , and both her hands were flattening the page . holding it smooth on the table , so that no slightest wrinlde should come between Miss Baxter and the enlightenment now dawning on her . What she read was brief . Mrs. Sarah Micou of High Street announced the marriage of her daughter , Annabelle , to James Kendall of Fairview Heights . Unbeknownst to their families or friends , the popular young couple had eloped and been married in Columbus last March- " I do n't believe it ! " Miss Baxter cried aloud excitedly . Since there was no one to hear her , she seemed to feel it unnecessary to explain exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing more aloud , for several minutes . She reread the item many times . An expression almost beatific settled over her countenance to be supplanted in turn by a crafty , a calculating expression . Miss Baxter raised her eyes from the paper and fixed them , unseeing , on the opposite wall . her fingers drummed on the table 's edge . Or perhaps they counted . Abruptly , triumphantly , Miss Baxter laughed . " December , eh , " she said . She threw the newspaper aside , took a hasty final gulp of coffee , and got up from the table , patting her mouth with her napkin as she rose . At a brisk clip , almost at a canter , she made her way to the telephone , where in the ensuing quarter of an hour she called up half a dozen ladies to ask if they had seen about Annabelle , and what they thought . Four of them had found the item , two by chance and two by direction ; and they thought just what Miss Baxter thought . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face . There was no doubt about it . One of them said , indeed , that her sister Isabel had said that Cora Frazee , who worked in the Big Store , in the hat department , had told somebody that one of the customers  --  Cora would n't say who  --  knew a man who was a clerk at the county courthouse , and that this man , who knew both of them by sight , had with his own two eyes beheld Annabelle and Young James Kendall getting a marriage license only last Friday . Miss Baxter may perhaps be pardoned for her failure to remember quite all the links in this chain of evidence . When she repeated it to Mrs. Doctor Means three minutes later ? " I had to call you up , I knew you would n't want to wait till this afternoon to hear about it " ? Miss Baxter 's version was a simplifiedone . She had the truth , she said , direct from a clerk at the county courthouse , who knew both Annabelle and the Kendall boy very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with Annabelle himself , " Miss Baxter added on a sudden inspiration . " So it looks as if there ca n't have been any mistake . " An attempt to telephone Cora Frazee was vain . Miss Baxter tried not once , but three or four times . The line was busy . " She 's just buzzing about it , " Miss Baxter thought acidly . She forgot Cora Frazee . She made a bold , a dramatic decision . She would call up Mrs. Sarah Micou , the mother of the bride . After all , why not ? What could be more natural ? Miss Baxter and Mrs. Micou were bosom friends . " I 'll just congratulate her , " Miss Baxter thought with a gleam in her eye , " and see what she says . " But there was no answer at the Micous ' . Miss Baxter waited a long time , and twice asked if the operator was surely ringing the right number . " YeahMicous ' , " the operator said knowingly , the second time . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " Thus to the things Miss Baxter could tell you about the Micou-Kendall nuptials was added the fact that Sarah Micou was crushed by the shame and disgrace . She had locked herself into her house . She did n't want to see anybody . She could n't even bring herself to answer the telephone . The day had begun well and it continued better . Mrs. Ed Bletzer of Walnut street , whose iron-gray boyish bob Miss Baxter treated with oil and washed and " set " from nine until ten-thirty , was most satisfactory . In the first place , she had not heard the news . She had n't heard a thing . Miss Baxter , still short of breath from mounting the stairs , had to sit right down and give the agog Mrs. Bletzer every last detail before Mrs. Blazer would suffer her hair to be touched . " No , no  --  wait , " this client directed , when Miss Baxter tentatively opened her implement case . " Go on . You say they were married yesterday . When ? Morning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the conviction of an eye-witness . And indeed , she was rapidly becoming one in her mind . By the time they got around to the oil treatment , Mrs. Bletzer not only possessed full knowledge of the Micou case she was able to throw new light on it . Miss Baxter was enthralled to learn that at a recent party Mrs. Blazer 's niece , Ellen , had given , Annabelle Micou had burst into tears for no reason at all . Also , according to Mrs. Bletzer , James Kendall had been trying to ' borrow money of late . In other words  --  the unanimous other words of both the ladies  --  he had been trying , manlike , to skip out of town , Armed with these colorful additional revelations , Miss Baxter started for Miss Nellie Coe 's , Miss Coe , aged fifty , lived with her invalid mother , aged seventy-nine , in half a house on Ohio Avenue . Miss Coe was awaiting Miss Baxter on the porch . " Well , I thought you 'd never come ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And from old Mrs. Coe 's open windows on the second floor issued a hopeful voice , " Is that Annie , Nellie ? Tell her to bring her things up here . " " Momma wants me to have the wave in her room , " Miss Coe explained . " She wants to hear all about it , too . " Miss Baxter was quite a tease at times . " All about what ? " she asked roguishly . Miss Coe , however , declined to be teased at a time like this . " You know perfectly well about what , " she retorted , and hustled Miss Baxter upstairs . It was at the Coes ' that Mrs. Ed Bletzer , all unwitting , was added to the day 's feature story , as a humorous touch . " I was at Mrs. Bletzer 's before I came here , " Miss Baxter related , " and , well , you would have died ! Remember her daughter Gertrude , when she was mar-tied ? That was the summer of twenty-two . No  --  no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of twenty-three it was . I remember now . It was the same summer I had my appendix . Anyway . Where was I ? Oh . Well . So here was Mrs. Bletzer asking all about Annabelle , and saying ' Tch ! Tch ! ' and carrying on , pretending to be so shocked ? when everybody knows the same thing happened to her own daughter ! Well ! Laugh ? I declare , I had all I could do to keep my face straight ! " The Coes snickered appreciatively , and Miss Nellie , who was fond of flapper phraseology , said , " Oh , I love that ! " Mrs. Coe from her pillows said that that was a good one all right . Miss Baxter , nodding modestly , stood twirling her marvelling iron . " It was a scream , " she said , to sum it up . There was a short pause , while their smiles faded . Then Miss Nellie Coe observed thoughtfully , " That was never proved  --  or proven , I should say  --  was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the baby after all . " " Oh , well , my dear ! " Miss Baxter said , scornful of this naivete . " If you want the truth of the matter ? " She lowered her voice and spoke hissingly for some moments . " I know it for a fact , " she said at last aloud . So that was settled . Miss Baxter spent so much time upon Miss Coe 's marvel , what with letting the irons get too hot while she talked and then cooling them till they were cold , that she was obliged to telephone young Mrs. Billy Lansing , and cancel her appointment for quarter of twelve . " Something important has come up , " Miss Baxter said . " I ca n't get there to-day . " She was lust as well pleased . Young Mrs. Billy Lansing was uncommunicative . Miss Baxter found this a tiresome characteristic of the young in general . They said " Yes " and " No . " They said , " Do n't ask me , Miss Barter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you knew they did . Young Mrs. Billy Lansing , moreover , was n't even attentive , and what she did listen to she did n't believe . She said , " Oh , that 's all birdseed ! " Miss Baxter always made short work of her . Miss Baxter had dinner with Miss Coe . Dinner was at noon in their town . Miss Baxter and Miss Coe dined leisurely from twelve to one-thirty con - versing meanwhile . They had by this time thoroughly covered the chief current topic , but there were sundry secondary topics , and they dealt in these . It was give and take Miss Baxter gave this morning 's box of flowers on the next-door window sill , which she declared were sent to the youngest Pettingill girl by a married man ; and Miss Coe came back with a moonlight swimming party , very scandalous , said to have taken place last Sunday night in Adele Brierly 's pool . Miss Baxter presented a rumor to the effect that Nelson Lansing , who sang in the choir , had had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of those seen petting in parked cars during a recent private dance at the Country Club . Late developments in the affairs of Doctor Means and the dish-faced nurse were traded by Miss Baxter for a baby Miss Coe predicted and a divorce she practically promised  --  a fair exchange . Miss Baxter then offered the O'Neills ' new awnings , and Miss Coe , much exercised , revealed the fact that the sum of thirty dollars was owed by Frank O'Neill to her brother , Charlie Coe , and had been ever since a poker game last January . This was more than a fair exchange . Miss Baxter had not known that Charlie Coe played poker . At Mrs. Herbert Jameson 's , whither she hastened at quarter of two , she said to Mrs. Jameson that Charlie Coe bad taken to gambling ? and carousing , " she added smoothly , for the two verbs went together . " Nellie told me herself , " Miss Baxter said , that that might be that . " Just now . I just came from there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unfortunate . Mrs. Jameson was interested , to be sure ; but she was much more . She was anxious , alarmed , upset . It occurred to Miss Baxter belatedly that Charlie Coe was a dentist . He was Mrs. Jameson 's dentist , it appeared . " ' Carousing ' ? " Mrs. Jameson repeated shrilly . " You mean he drinks ? " This was annoying . " Well , he plays poker , " said Miss Baxter . " He gambles . It was the gambling I was thinking of specially ? " But it was not the gambling Mrs. Jameson was thinking of specially . " I do n't mind that  --  that does n't affect his work , " she pointed out , and persisted heatedly , " but he ought not to drink ! He ought not to drink a drop ! A dentist ought to be sober as a judge ! " " That 's true , " said Miss Baxter , " but ? " " Of course it 's true ! Why , it 's only safe and sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning if he guzzles liquor all night ? Oh , dear , " wailed Mrs. Jameson , " now I 'm going to worry myself sick ! I 'm supposed to go to him first thing to-morrow morning  --  and what if he 's been drunk to-night ? I just know he 'll pull the wrong tooth or something ! " Miss Baxter during this outburst had twice cleared her throat . She now spoke quickly . " Oh , well , really , I do n't know as he drinks as much as all that , " she said , and laughed . " He gambles , I know . But maybe he does n't drink , exactly . Most likely he does n't drink at all to speak of . " But you said he carouses ! " Mrs. Jameson had heard Miss Baxter the first time . She had no patience with amendments and revisions . " You 're just trying to stick up for him ! " she cried accusingly . " You know it 's true . Nellie told you herself , did n't she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was exaggerating , " Miss Baxter suggested . " You know Nellie , how she imagines things . " Mrs. Jameson , however , ignored this . " His eyes are puffy , " she said darkly , " now that I think of it . They 're puffy . " She thought of another thing , and emitted a triumphant squeak . " And do you know what he did to Mrs. Ives one time ? He broke a needle right in her tooth ! He said ? " Mrs. Jameson put the emphasis w here she felt it belonged , "  - -   - -  he said it was a defective needle . Hmph ! I guess so ! A defective dentist is more like it ! " Mrs. Jameson was convinced . Her conviction , though new , was absolute , it was unshakable ; and it began to communicate itself to Miss Baxter . The more Mrs. Jameson said  --  and Mrs. Jameson was voluble  --  the more clearly Miss Baxter perceived that , after all , she had been right . Intuitively right . It often happened . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would Miss Baxter have wronged Charlie Coe , done him professional injury , if he had not deserved it . But a dentist whose dissipations were such that on the mornings-after he broke needles in people 's molars , and peered at them with puffy eyes , and tried his best to fit goodness-only-knewwhose gold inlay into Mrs. Jameson 's wisdom tooth , as Mrs. Jameson now insisted Charlie once had  --  that dentist not only deserved , but demanded , exposure . If his practice suffered , it was his own fault . Miss Baxter 's conscience troubled her no more . " Af ter all , " she said comfortably , " they all drink like fishes when they play poker . It 's part of it . " ? Mrs. Jameson exclaimed that she guessed you did n't have to tell her that ! As instance , in passing , she enjoined Miss Baxter to take her neighbor Mr. Anderson ; " He plays four and five nights a week somewhere , and comes home late  --  and T just wish you 'd hear him try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Miss Baxter tensely . " Let me get this straight . Is it Harry Anderson you 're speaking of ? Or Arthur ? " " Arthur , " grunted Mrs. Jameson . " Arthur ! " exulted Miss Baxter , and thus a new conversational vein was tapped . What Miss Baxter knew about Arthur lasted them until she left . IL was then three-thirty . En route from Mrs. Jameson 's to Mrs. Doctor Means ' , Miss Baxter thought again of the moral decline of Charlie Coe . She thought , among other things , that she would n't have believed it of him  --  he was such a quiet little man , so meek-appearing . " It just goes to show you , though , " Miss Baxter mused . " ' Murder will out ' , as I 've always- - Oh , good heavens ! " she protested abruptly aloud . " Have I got a flat tire ? " Shc had . She had the flattest possible right rear tire . She would have to telephone the garage . For a moment Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which luckily was very near . On second thought , however , she decided not to bother Emily . She climbed back into the car , and upon the flat tire drove resolutely , though slowly , for perhaps a quarter of a mile . stoppingagain finally , with an effect of complete breakdown , before a Iow white house with a green thatched roof . This was the home of a Mr. and Mrs. Warburton , from Chicago . Miss Baxter had always wondered what it was like inside Mrs. Warburton was not in , but the local maid-servant who opened the door thought it would be all right for Miss Baxter to use the telephone . Miss Baxter called the garage and asked them to come and change the tire . She was a little vague with them , being so preoccupied . Once she absent-mindedly said , " Chinese rug " for " inner tube . " " Bring a new Chinese rug with you , " said Miss Baxter . She proceeded on foot to Mrs. Means ' house . The coupe would presently follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic arrive , to show him which tire was flat , and to extort from him a promise that , when he had repaired it , he would drive 44 the car along and leave it under Mrs. Means ' porte-cochere . Miss Baxter hurried now . Her implement case banged her speeding knee  --  though it must be confessed that she did not appear to know it . Her thoughts were elsewhere . To be exact , they were still at the Warburtons ' . Miss Baxter was memorizing for future reference a list of items of interest  --  notable among them a cigarette stub with lipstick at the tip , lying in an ash-tray ; Mrs. Warburton 's bank statement for May , open on a desk ; and a black and white crayon drawing , hanging right there on the wall in a frame , of a woman without a stitch on her . " And children in the house ! " Miss Baxter thought , striding along . " Little children ! There ought to be a law . " So , in fine fettle , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been looking forward to her . Mrs. Means wore a changeable pink-and-lavender taffeta dressing-gown , quite new . She would not be shampooed in it , but she wanted Miss Baxter to see it on and to tell her frankly whether it suited her . Mrs. Means was short and squat , and had a little hair , mostly gray . She had gray brows , shaped weekly by Miss Baxter with the tweezers and blackened by Mrs. Means when she was going to a bridge party . Mrs. Means had large and very prominent front teeth , that when she smiled looked somewhat too carnivorous for your comfort . She had eager eyes , and was a spellbound listener . She was also an expert finisher of other people 's sentences  --  it did not do to pause for breath when addressing Mrs. Means . She knew , and said , what you were going to say . This irritated some people . It irritated Miss Baxter . " Look here , Harriet ! " she would exclaim , " Who 's telling this ? " They were great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to tell Mrs. Means than there was time for  --  hence her peevishness at interpolations , however helpfully meant . To-day was no exception . Miss Baxter had so much to tell Mrs. Means that , as she said herself , " I could talk on and on ? " " All night ! " Mrs. Means concluded for her automatically . She emitted an ecstatic chuckle . " Well , start ! ' ' she commanded , settling herself . " Start with Annabelle Micou . " So Miss Baxter started with Annabelle Micou . .. . This was at four o'clock . At quarter of six Miss Baxter , still speaking , and Mrs. Means , still listening raptly , emerged together from Mrs. Means ' bedroom and descended the staircase to the front door . Miss Baxter was on her way home . " And not only that ! " she was saying . " He takes laughing gas in the daytime . Every time he feels the craving coming on him , and he has n't got a drink around any place , he goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing gas , and then of course he 's drunk as a lord again . " Miss Baxter , then Mrs. Means , passed onto the porch , and there halted . It was to he seen that Mrs. Means ' eyebrows had been tweezered , for the skin around them looked raw , and that her hair had been shampooed , for obviously you could n't do a thing with it . It had not been dyed . Again Mrs. Means had lost her courage . She was still afraid of the Doctor , she had explained apologetically . She did n't know what on earth the Doctor would say . Miss Baxter had held her temper and her tongue . It was difficult , for Mrs. Means had been vacillating thus for months and months , in a manner to try the patience of a saint . Not only that : to-day was to have been The Day , and Miss Baxter accordingly had promised all previous clients that a treat was in store for them , a spectacle of spectacles ? they were to see poor old Harriet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine such a thing . " Now they 'll think I was lying , " bad been Miss Baxter 's aggrieved thought . Her integrity was very precious to her . Nevertheless , she had controlled herself , she had refrained from giving Mrs. Means the piece of her mind she longed to give her ; and no doubt she would have continued to refrain , for the nonce at least , if Mrs. Means , in parting , had not brought it all up again . Mrs. Means was now saying that maybe the next time Miss Baxter came , they would dye the hair . She was once more explaining her timidity heretofore . " You do n't know husbands , " she informed Miss Baxter . " You do n't know how they are about things . " Miss Baxter 's temper snapped quite suddenly . Mrs. Means continued , " He 'd probably kill me --  " " Nonsense ! " Miss Baxter exploded furiously . " For goodness ' sake , Harriet , stop being so simple ! He likes black hair ! " She paused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was black . Mrs. Means , however , if she remembered , made nothing of it . Her expression was meek and wondering , and even hopeful . She seemed on the point of saying , " Do you really think he does ? " Miss Baxter 's rage increased . " He would n't ' kill ' you ! " she cried scathingly . " Do n't flatter yourself ! The chances are he would n't even notice your hair was different ! " She glowered at Mrs. Means . " Listen ! " she commanded , and took a quick breath : " He 's got other things to think about  --  I 'll tell you that ! " The nod with which Miss Baxter punctuated this declaration was impressive . It was a single jerk that must have rattled the teeth in her head . She wheeled then and tramped down the four porch steps . " I may not know husbands , " she shot back over her shoulder at the blinking Mrs. Means , " but I know that ! " The coupe stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It quivered and creaked with Miss Baxter 's climbing in . She slammed the door andrattled the keys that hung on a chain from the switch . She looked through the window . Mrs. Means at the top of the steps was still staring at her . " Well , good-by , " Miss Baxter said sardonically . She started the engine . She had her hand on the brake , releasing it , when Mrs. Means abruptly called out , " Wait ! Wait just a minute ! " Miss Baxter waited . Mrs. Means hurried down the steps and confronted the window . She seized the frame with her hands . She was troubled now , Miss Baxter saw . Her eyes were uneasy , fearful , under the reddened , slightly swollen brows . " Annie , " she said . " What do you mean ? What ' other things ' ? " Miss Baxter regarded her thoughtfully . " You mean his practice , do n't you ? " Mrs. Means said , on a pleading note . " His work . That 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath had abated , evidently . She smiled , and her answering voice was gentle . " Why , of course , Harriet , " she said . " What else would I mean ? His work at the hospital , and his office hours , and his outside patients and all the time he spends with his nurse . . . . Those things keep him busy , " Miss Baxter finished blandly . " He 's a busy man . That 's all I meant . " She put her car in gear . " I 've got to run along now , dear , " she said . " It 's almost supper-time . " She left Mrs. Means to think it over . Miss Baxter was tired when she got home . It had been a busy day . All days were busy days except the Sabbath , and she was always tired at supper-time . She did not mind . This was a good , a peaceful weariness . It was contentment . " Something accomplished , something done . " She prepared a casual meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter , and ate it slowly , restfully , in the quiet dining room . She sat there long , in pleasant reverie . The clock on the dining-room mantel , striking , roused her . Seven o'clock . " Here ! " Miss Baxter said aloud . She jumped up briskly . " I 'd better get a move on . I 'll be late . " She folded her napkin and rolled it and slipped it into the silver ring marked " Annie , " that she had had since she was five . She cleared the table hurriedly and crumbed it with her hands , bearing the crumbs in one palm to the window sill . " There , little birds , " she said . She put the butter in the icebox , and the napkin and the sugar bowl on the sideboard . She did not wash the dishes . What few there were could wait . All this took but a moment . Miss Baxter rinsed her hands and dried them and left the kitchen , passing through the dining room to the parlor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's , wide as the opposite sofa , high as the windows . Miss Baxter opened the desk , revealing pigeonholes neat with papers . She pulled up a straight chair , and sat on the edge of it . There was not much time , but she had a little note to write . A note to Annabelle Micou , the bride . She addressed the envelope first . She did not write the address , but printed it , in black ink on a plain stamped envelope . " Mrs. James Kendall , care Mrs. Sarah Micou , High Street , City . " She looked at it carefully . It looked all right . Would n't it be better , though , to misspell " Micou " somehow  --  say , to put a " k " after the " c " ? She believed it would be better . She destroyed the first attempt , tearing it to atoms , and took out another plain stamped envelope and tried again . This time she was satisfied . They would never guess now . She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Miss Baxter was an experienced printer . She could make the letters straight and schooled , or crude and sprawling . These were sprawling . There were three short lines , that for all their brevity , almost covered a piece of blue-ruled composi tion paper . There were two words to the first line , two to the second , two to the third . " THE WAGES  --  OF SIN  --  IS DEATH ! " the note read , and the final word was huge and black and underscored heavily to the foot of the page . Miss Baxter added more exclamation points , and a signature . The signature gave her some trouble . " One Who Knows " would not quite do . She nibbled the end of her pen for a moment , and then printed simply " A Friend . " On the whole , she was pleased with the note . The message was one she had sent sometimes before to people who needed it , but never before to Annabelle Micou . " The wages of sin is death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her voice had gusto , but her eyebrows drew together in a frown . Why " is " ? Why not , " The wages are " ? That always worried her . She sealed the letter , and closed the desk again . It was quarter past seven now , by the clock in the hall . Miss Baxter rushed up the staircase , leaving the letter on the newel-post where she would not fail to see it and take it along with her to mail . Annabelle should have it first thing in the morning . She was upstairs but a very short time , during which her rapid footsteps could be heard circulating overhead . She reappeared wearing a ladylike lavender hat and a white silk dress , and clutching a small black book with gilt-edged leaves and a cross on the cover , and a sealed manila envelope containing a contribution . To this handful she added the letter from the newel-post as she passed . Her free hand wrenched the knob of the front door . . . . Miss Baxter was bound for prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was from her strenuous day , she could not have remained at home . Miss Baxter was very devout . She always had been . " Other people , " she often said , " can stay away from divine worship . But I do n't know how they can ! I could n't  --  and feel right with God . "
