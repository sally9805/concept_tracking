Mrs. Josie Bishop is a small , bright , sun-browned widow with four grown children . Twenty years ago she moved to California 's Mojave Desert from New Mexico , arriving with " a can of beans , a loaf of bread but no butter . " She owns a patch of mining territory 27 miles north of Mojave , near wild , scenic Red Rock Canyon . Her claim to this land was recently in litigation , was cleared a few weeks ago after the case reached the California Supreme Court . Last week it looked as though Mrs. Bishop 's troubles were over . Newsstories from Southern California made it appear that Mrs. Josie Bishop owns an extremely rich deposit of radium-bearing ore-one of the richest , in proportion of radium to the ton , ever discovered . <P> A rich radium deposit is one which yields 90 to 120 milligrams ( .00315 to .0042 oz. ) nearly pure radium bromide salt per ton of concentrated ore ( 50 tons of crude ore ) . From ore bodies of such richness in northwestern Canada the refining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radium from 550 tons of mined ore . A San Diego mining engineer and chemist named F. S. Kearney , now working in Mexico , assayed Mrs. Bishop 's ore at 130 milligrams of radium per ton . This high figure , Mrs. Bishop said , was confirmed when she sent a sample to the Institut de Radium in Paris ( once presided over by the late Marie Curie ) . Present price of radium is $25 per milligram , $25,000 per gram , $700,000 per ounce . Mrs. Bishop suspected for years that she had radium ore on her property , kept it quiet until her claim was cleared in the courts . Last week the excited little woman did not know just how extensive her deposit was , but she and her lawyers laid plans for a thorough survey and hoped to write a new chapter in the shifting course of world radium production . <P> The radium discovered in 1898 by Pierre and Marie Curie was laboriously extracted from a radioactive mineral called pitchblende , found in what is now Czechoslovakia . For years those deposits remained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore , carnotite , was discovered in Utah and Colorado . This was a low-grade ore but with the help of the U. S. Bureau of Mines and several corporations , the U. S. became the biggest radium-producing country , at one time turning out 80% of world production . Between 1912 and 1922 the U. S. produced more than 170 grams . In those early days the price ranged around $110,000 per gram . <P> Meanwhile , Belgian prospectors had discovered veins of pitchblende in the Belgian Congo no less than 20 times richer than the U. S. carnotite . After the War , Belgium 's Union Minire du Haut Katanga started mining this material , shipping it to the mother country for refining . The U. S. with its low-grade carnotite could not compete and soon dropped out of the world picture . The Belgian company enjoyed what amounted to a monopoly , producing just enough to fill the demand at its arbitrarily maintained price of $70,000 per gram . Since the medicinal uses of the element were rapidly expanding , grumblings were heard from other nations that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of processing the African ore , exclusive of actual digging costs and overhead , was estimated to be not more than $10,000 per gram .
