One night last week in Boston , Charles Roswell Donnell , a 6-ft.1-in. , 220-lb. policeman , climbed into a ring to referee a wrestling bout between onetime Heavyweight Champions Ed Don George and Jim Browning . Browning won the first fall . In the second round he got a scissors hold on George . Referee Donnell tried to step between the wrestlers to save them from going through the ropes . Browning wrapped his arms around Donnell 's neck and the next instant wrestlers and referee plunked down on the cement floor . Donnell landed at the bottom . Spectators untangled them , found Donnell unconscious with concussion of the brain . He was taken to the Haymarket Relief Station . Wrestlers Browning and George returned to the ring where a substitute referee awarded the three-man fall to George . Amid more grunting and gripping Browning , who had hurt his hip , was quickly thrown through the ropes again , counted out for good .
