txt One of the most fallacious arguments that one encounters in public discussion is the " tu quoque " argument . Tu quoque is Latin for " thou too . " It is the principle of offsetting one abuse with another by way of excusing it . An example of the fallacy is current . in connection with the uncounted subsidy contemplated in the farm bill . This is apt to be excused on the grounds that the industralist " gets his " through the protective tariff . There are e some publicists using such an argument who condemn the protective tariff exemplified by the Smoot-Bewley Act as a subsidy or bounty . But , appalled at the task of struggling against . it , he prefers to equalize the bounty principle among other producers . That is as far as a section of this type of publicist goes . Others of the same type do n't find themselves on convincing ground when they see that the implication of their argument is that one bad turn deserves another . A A A And so they trick out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular farm-factory case , for instance , they argue that the prime necessity of economic life is price equalization . If , to take a hypothetical example , wheat is kept up by subsidy to $2 a bushel , and agricultural implements are maintained at $30 a unit by the aid of a tariff , It does not matter , they say , whether both fall or rise as long as they fall or rise together . Then they would still exchange on equitable terms . This justification loses sight of the fact that somebody has to pay both bounties . Who is it ? Of course , the consumer , since the wheat subsidy would necessarily be based upon the farmer 's costs of production , which would include the price of implements Thus the consumer has to beat two injustices instead of one . A little less plausible is the argumentative trimming that seeks to excuse bounties to pat ticular producers on the mounds that the commodity in which they deal has some unique attribute . Silver is a good example . Silver pioducers enjoy a bounty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The justification is that silver used to be standard money . With just as much reason special treatment could be claimed for other metals . Indeed , soon after the silver producers obtained their subsidy , copper producers led by Senator Ashurst proposed that copper should be regarded as a monetary metal , and bought by the Tzeasury at a fixed price His proposal , however , was not plausible enough even to get a hearing . A A A One can think of many other examples of the same type of argument the fallacy of which springs to the eyes . You could have made out a case , for example , to excuse the breakdown of antidrug laws because there had been a breakdown in liquor law enforcement . One would cancel out the other . Viewed by such an example , the " tu quoque " argument loses its potency . It can be seen in its true perspective . as a justification of any proposal . as the reason for not fighting any abuse , as a way of disposing of thought on any particular problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cure one evil by acquiescing in two evils . Otherwise , you will eventually see the entire economic system saddled with evils .
