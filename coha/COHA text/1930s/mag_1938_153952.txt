In front of the Concert Hall in Stockholm , Sweden , stands a 24-ft. figure of Orpheus , demigod of Music , sinewy and poised in bronze , with his great lyre lifted and one hand just sprung from the strings . In a circle of fountains below him eight listeners , wakened from death , turn outward and upward toward the music . <P> In front of the Union Station in St. Louis , U.S.A. , is a large and undistinguished plaza cleared in 1931 and named after the late Alderman Louis P. Aloe . To St. Louis swelterers for seven summers Aloe Plaza has offered no refreshment beyond the discouraged tentage of a few trees . <P> The famed Orpheus fountain in Stockholm was finished in 1936 by Carl Emil Andersson Milles , Sweden 's greatest living sculptor . In 1931 , in his third year as resident sculptor at Detroit 's suburban Cranbrook Academy , Sculptor Milles met Alderman Aloe 's widow in St. Louis and learned her desire for a group of fountains in Aloe Plaza . In 1936 Mrs. Aloe put up $12,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sculptor Milles was commissioned to do for St. Louis what he had done for Stockholm . <P> Last year , while grey-haired Carl Milles worked serenely in his three Cranbrook studios , pictures of his first clay models for the Wedding of the Mississippi and the Missouri were published in LIFE . Francis D. Healy , elderly chairman of St. Louis 's Municipal Art Commission , saw them and snorted that the fountain would be better named " Wedding in a Nudist Colony " ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) . For Sculptor Milles ' wave-naked Tritons , Commissioner Hubert Hoeflinger , onetime tailor , suggested trousers . Finally the Star-Times took a poll of public opinion , found plenty of people who agreed with the two indignant commissioners about " art " which had no fully-dressed pioneers or Indians in it , only some foreign-looking nudes and inappropriate deep-sea fishes . <P> To all this soft-spoken Carl Milles responded : " I am certain that they will love the finished fountain . " Somewhat forgotten amid the publicity was the fact that Milles possesses not only the most invigorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for making a powerful , rhythmic composition of many sculptured figures . In his Wedding the strong male figure of the Mississippi and the aloof female Missouri , mounted on swooping fishes , will approach each other in the centre of Aloe Plaza . Behind each lollops a flowing train of antic naiads and tough river gods . To Detroit last week to see the final , full-size models of these Rivers , journeyed St. Louis ' seven-man Art Commission . <P> Not won to the point of love , Commissioners Healy and Hoeflinger were mollified enough to join in a unanimous approval , though " feeling that some modification . . . would be desirable . " Said Sculptor Milles : " A fountain should be a gay and happy thing . . . . They ask me why there are sharks in the fountain , when there are no sharks in the Mississippi and I reply that this is an important wedding and the guests have come from far off .
