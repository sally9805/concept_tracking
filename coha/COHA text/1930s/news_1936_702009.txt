txt The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System yesterday increased reserve requirements for member banks by 50t- , - , effective August 15 . The board 's action will cut excess reserves from an estimated $3,300 , - 000,000 on August 15 to about $1,900,000,000 . This $1,400,000,000 of now idle funds was declared by the board to be " superfluous for all present or prospective needs of commerce , industry . and agriculture . " Five features stood out in the board 's action , the first of its kind in history : 1 . The reduction in excess reserves is in no sense planned as the inauguration of tighter money conditions since the board specifically announced its intention to continue an easy money policy with " an adequate supply of funds at favorable rates for capital purposes . " 2 . No increase in interest rates , even temporarily , is expected since the 51.900,000,000 in excess reserves which will remain after the increase becomes effective is larger than any total ever recorded " at any time prior to the recent large gold imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they fell after the Treasury 's June borrowing . 3 . The board expects the raising of reserve requirements to bring " encouragement to sound business recovery and confidence in the longterm investment market " because the elimination of unnecessary excess reserves reduces ilia possibility of " injurious credit expansion . " thus prompting funds to go into long-term commitments rather than to seek havens from potential inflation . 4 . The board does not plan to make frequent changes in reserve requirements : the increase effective August 15 is to bring excess reserves " within the amount that could be absorbed through open market operations , should such action become desirable , - and the board specifically stated its reliance on the " traditional methods of credit control " : discount rates and open market operations . 5 . The fundamental objective of the higher reserve requirements is sterilization of the gold imports which have come to this country in large volume , thus preventing credit expansion based on the deposits and excess reserves which . this " flighty " gold has created in this country. , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected more than socalled " country banks . " Not only will their reserve requirements be raised , but their correspondents will withdraw balances from them in order to meet the higher reserve requirements . About 132 member banks or less now have excess reserves large enough so that they can , meet the increased requirements by transferring to reserve banks not more than 50% of the balances now carried with correspondents . Oniy 40 banks or less do not have sufficient funds either in excess reserves or balances with correspondents to meet the new requirements . The board was particularly emphatic in stating that it was not terminating its easy money policy . Its formal statement said : - This action elimin.tes as a basis possible injurious credit expansion a part of the excess reserves . amounting at present to approximately $3,000.000,000 and expected to increase to nearly three and a half billions by the time action takes effect . These excess reserves have resulted almost entirely from the inflow of gold from abroad and not from the system 's policy of encuraging full recovery through the creation and maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanged and will be continued . ' The part of the excess reserves thus eliminated is superfluous for all present or prospective needs of commerce , industry , and agriculture and can be absorbed at this time without affecting money rates and without restrictive influence upon member banks , practically all of which now have far more than sufficient reser  --  es and balances with other banks to meet the Increases . Two-Fold Purpose " Tbe portion of existing excess reserves . u which will be absorbed by the board 's action , if permitted to become the basis of a tenfold or even larger expansion of bank credit , would create an Injurious credit expansion . It is for this reason that the board decided to lock up this part of the present volume of member bank reserves as a measure of prevention on the one hand and of further encouragement to sound business recovery and confidence in the long-term investment market on the other hand . " In the light of recent experience and in view of the fact that after the increase in requirements goes into effect member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board is convinced that this action will not affect easy money conditions now prevailing . It does not constitute a reversal of the easy money policy which has been pursued by the system since the beginning of the depression . Rather it is an adjustment to a changed reserve situation brought about through the extraordinary inflow of gold from abroad . ' Theprevailing level of long-time interest rates , which has been en important factor in the revival of the capital market , has been due principally to the large accumulations of idle funds in the hands of Individual and institutional investors . The supply of investment funds is in excess of the demand . The increase in reserve requirements of member banks will not diminish the volume of deposits held by these banks for their customers and will , therefore . not diminish the volume of funds availab:e for investment . The maintenance of an adequate supply of funds at favorable rates for capital purposes , including mortgages , is an important factor in bringing about and sustaining a lasting recovery . . - The reduction of excess-reserves to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control through the system 's open-market portfolio which consists of ** of United States Government securities . Frequent changes in reserve requirements of member banks should be avoided because they affect all banks regardless of their reserve position . At this time an increase can be made equitably because reserves are widely distributed . Unless large additional increases in reserves occur through gold imports or otherwise , no occasion for further adjustments in reserve requirements is likely to arise in the near future . " For current adjustments of the reserve position of member banks to changes in the credit situation the reserve system should continue to rely on the traditional methods of credit control through discount policy and particularly through open-market operations . By the present action excess reserves will be reduced to within the amount that could be absorbed through openmarket operations . should such action become desirable . Conversely , should conditions develop requiring expansion of reserves , they could be increased through open-market operations . " The Board of Governors believes that the action taken at this time will give assurance for the continued encouragement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
