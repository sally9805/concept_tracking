At the siege of Pampeluna in 1521 , a French cannon ball whizzed between the legs of a Basque knight named Iigo de Oez y Loyola , breaking his right shin and tearing his left calf . For the Roman Catholic Church , beleaguered by the Protestant Reformation , that shot was providential . Iigo , laid up in his castle ( and ever after afflicted with a limp ) , began thinking pious thoughts which led him , in 1534 , to form a " flying squadron , " the Society of Jesus , in the front ranks of the Church 's Counter Reformation against Protestantism . <P> By that time , the Basque was known by the Latinized name of Ignatius . Of this austere , astute , self-styled " captain " in Christ 's army , many pious biographies have been written . Published this week is Soldier of the Church , * first attempt to bring Ignatius Loyola to life for ordinary readers . Its author , Ludwig Marcuse , is a German-Jewish exile , biographer of Heine and Strindberg . His viewpoint : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Catholics looked on the Society of Jesus with much suspicion before Pope Paul III formally approved it in 1540 . In Spain , where Ignatius and his handful of followers begged and taught , he was twice jailed , often investigated , once haled before the Inquisition . In Paris , Ignatius cut an odd figure as a University student of 37 . Author Marcuse places greater emphasis on Jesuit Loyola 's physical activities than on the early turmoil of soul which produced the Spiritual Exercises , the extraordinary manual by which Jesuits are formed and live . But he does not slight the other distinctive aspect of Jesuitism : its military discipline as the first Catholic order vowed specifically to the defense of the papacy . <P> Loyola , elected General of the Society after thrice declining , perfected such methods of discipline as encouraging Jesuits ( with the highest motives ) to inform on one another ; to travel always in pairs ; to drink beer with beer drinkers . He forbade Jesuits to accept ecclesiastical honors-a rule broken only when the Pope commands one to accept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or appoints one to a difficult bishopric or archbishopric . Ignatius dismissed a father who dared praise him publicly and forbade those living with him to look him straight in the face. + Of women he said : " Conduct religious conversations only with aristocratic women and never with the door shut ! " <P> <P> *Simon &; Schuster ( $2.50 ) . <P> + Ex-Jesuit Edward Boyd Barrett , in The Jesuit Enigma , declared that Jesuits are urged to look people straight in the nose , presumably to disconcert them . Good Jesuits consider this romancing-a distortion of the truth that sight , like other senses , may cause sinning.
