One of the most potent men in China , one of the most trusted advisers of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , is " Organizer Chen Li-fu " as he likes to be called . In organizing the " New Life Movement , " the " Culture Control Movement " and other causes dear to the Generalissimo &; Mme Chiang right down to the " Read-a-Book Movement , " no Chinese has won more kudos than Organizer Chen . Last week Hankow correspondents asked the Great Organizer to confirm or deny persistent rumors in high Chinese quarters that he has been advising the Generalissimo to make peace with Japan . Replied Chen Li-fu : " Our fundamental policy is unchanged and we will not be intimidated by the threats to Hankow and Canton . If the Japanese finally come to realization of the folly of their course and are prepared to offer us a formula for an honorable peace let them do so . It is not for us to do the proposing , for that would be a gesture of submission . <P> " We are the victims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Scorched Canton . The famed " Scorched Earth Policy " of Generalissimo Chiang , to destroy everything of value in Chinese cities likely to be taken by the Japanese , reached its spectacular climax last week at Canton . Dynamite charges carefully laid a few days before under the principal public buildings , factories and utility plants of South China 's No. 1 city and No. 1 port , were touched off as the Japanese approached . Great fires sprang up , blazed over an area of several square miles . With Canton spurting smoke and flame , Chinese dynamiters wrecked the $8,000,000 Pearl River Bridge . The foreign quarter on Chameen Island was saved from catching fire only by a sudden shift in the wind . <P> Up to the last moment , 100,000 Chinese troops were reported resolved to defend Canton and solidly entrenched . Actually 1,500 Japanese soldiers , the advance guard of the Japanese invading force of 60,000 , almost raced into Canton last week , having advanced 125 miles in ten days flat , without having been obliged to fight a single major battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make " heroic efforts to take Canton at any cost by November 3 , " Birthday Anniversary of the great Emperor Meiji , thus found themselves 13 days ahead of schedule . <P> 1,500 &; 50,000 . Some 50,000 Chinese remained in Canton , from which hundreds of thousands fled in recent weeks , pitiful refugees . The 1,500 Japanese at latest reports had not run amok as Japanese did after the fall of Nanking , but were described by Associated Press as busy trying to check civilian looters and Chinese who were setting fresh fires . The Canton waterworks were wrecked by Chinese to cripple fire fighting efforts .
