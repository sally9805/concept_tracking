txt Capone the generous , Capone the spendthrift , lord of a great estate on Palm Island , Fla. , with a cupboard bank holding " rolls that would choke an ox , " with a telephone bill for three short Winters totaling 0,000 ; spending $7,000 for meat to feed his he-men guards , thousands for linens , drapes , cakes and macaroni , was sketched on the Federal court canvas today by a dozen witnesses imported from Florida to testify against him in his trial for income tax evasion . It was a glum Capone that started from the court chamber when the session ended at noon . He had been hit hard by the testimony . Outside the streets were wet with a depressing downpour . It had been an interesting session , but the outside murkiness had worked into the halls of justice , as it will on rainy days , making the white marble walls seem gray as parchment , adding an air of deeper tarnish to the gold scroll column tops , driving the figures in the gloomy wall paintings into gloomier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in powder blue , with hat to match , quick in stride for a man who tips it at 220 pounds or better . Close behind him , as always , pressed Philip D'Andrea , clad in gray , his alert eyes taking in every thing as a good bodyguard 's should . " Just a minute . " Secret Service Men Busy . Capone halted in his stride , his well-scraped , heavy-jowled face showing astonishment . Two Secret Service men had worked in between him and his guard . One of them slapped at D'Andrea 's right hip . His hand went under the coat . It came out with a glistening .38 calibre revolver , fully loaded . There was a murmur from the bluecoated cops in the corridors , from the men and women leaning over the balconies looking down r the rotunda . The Secret Service men said something in low tones to Capone and his white-faced guard . They turned back to the court room . Capone was talking earnestly to his lawyers , with excited gestures of his bloated , hairy fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who covers his back when they are on the walk , who sits behind him at every session of the court , was like the removal of a aoriendly shadow . Capone without a guard seemed a flustered Capone . D'Andrea produced a star-shaped shield with the inscription , " Deputy Bailiff of the Municipal Court . " He showed it to the Secret Service men . " No good , " he was told . " That 's expired . You ca n't carry a gun on that and certainly not in a court room . " Capone seemed undecided for a moment , but there was nothing he could do about it . He left the building , ran down the corridor steps through the usual lane of policemen and gangster-worshipers , forced his bulk into a cab and was driven away through the downpour . D'Andrea was ordered locked up in the custody of the United States Marshal until Monday morning , and there was no appeal from that . Miami Carpenter Is Talkative . The most damaging witness against Capone during the day was H. F. Ryder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow seemed furrowed with uneasiness , he smiled as if in apology for everything he said , but he said plenty . No witness in all the five days of the trial caused Mr. Capone the annoyance or so aroused the anger and disgust of the defendant as the quick-voiced , talkative carpenter . He had been hired , he testified , to build a dock and boathouse off the Capone estate at 93 Palm Island . It took him a long time to tell that , because he had to /work in homely details about how he got the job and what a mess it was . Jacob I. Grossman , bespectacled , bald-headed Assistant United States District Attorney , became impatient at his witness 's loose-tongued way of doing things . " Just tell me , " be interrupted , " did you get any money for doing the work there ? " The government merely wanted to get Mr. Ryder to tell about the money Capone spent , but apparently he did n't know that . He wanted to tell it , but with all the fixin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Keller another carpenter drew $500 to start the work , and the government permit was so long in comin ' , was delayed so long , d'ye see , that Mr. Keller got hungry and spent the money . So after the permit came , why , of course , Mr. Keller was without funds , and he asked me if I would go ahead and help him out . " So I agreed to drive the piling , building the dock for $350 , that is , furnish the labor and completing the dock . But , of course , there was some extras , the extra piling and the boathouse and the painting . Well , that " Who paid you , " asked the prosecutor . " Mr. Al . " " Who ? " " Mr. Capone , the gentleman there , " indicating the heavy-set gang chief , who was leaning forward in his swivel chair between his counsel and D'Andrea . Witness Adds Many Details . It was like pulling teeth to get the garrulous carpenter to get down to simple facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the work by Capone . Paid in cash . " Yes , sir , the total was $1,011 . And then there was the use ' of my car for five weeks . " He added this detail with great eagerness . " Did he pay you for the use of your car ? " - *Yes. sir : $50 a week . " " Did he have any other cars around there ? " " Sure . I would say three other cars ; but whether they were rented or not , I could n't say . " The witness smiled uneasily at Capone , but the gang chief 's lips seemed pursed in anger and his eyes ' indicated a rising temper . Ryder did a little nervous lip work on his own account and faced the prosecutor again . " Did Capone pay you anything fort materials ? " " AU . but . ** a **understanding , I imagine , and subsequently I had to pay the $125 out of my own pocket . said this as though he really did n't mind iseying out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put a lien on Mr. Capone 's property , and I guess it was in his wife 's name ( not the lien , the property ) and I guess they could n't do that . So it fell to me , and I thought to myself : Well , now , there is no use in writing to Mr. Al because I will see him before long and I know he will pay it . " " Yes , " prompted Mr. Grossman . Gangster Scowls Warning . " But I have n't ? " , The witness hesitated , glanced fleetingly at the defendant , where the storm signals , as indicated on the facial barometer , were becoming stronger . " But you haven'tgot it yet , " encouraged the prosecutor , nodding his head so that ? the light reflections danced on the gold rimmed spectacles . " I have n't got it yet , " said the carpenter . Capone shook his bead , as if to say , " What a lie . " " Are you trying to collect it ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness paused a second and launched into another monologue : " Well , there was one time I went ever there and tried to collect it and Mr. Al was n't there ; but his wife was there . And there were several employes . I 'd say they were employes because they treated me rough , a little rough , so I though it was best for me to get out . And " ? The prosecutor headed him off with : " Did you see any cars there later that Mr. Capone had ? " " Yes , sir . I should say it was a Packard , a yellow , special-built Packard , an open car . A day or so before I left J saw a new Lincoln . Mr. Al and one of his employes was washing it . " More storm warnings . And Capone leaned over , whispering rapidly into the ear of Michael Ahern , one of his lawyers . He seemed like a man incensed . You could tell from his lips , from his whole attitude . His bulky frame did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you see any Western Union boys around there ? " Witnesses yesterday testified that Capone at his Miami home got about $80,000 in Western Union money orders from Chicago . " Yes , sir . I should say it seemed like almost every hour . I 'm ashamed to say it . " But he did n't look as though he was ashamed . " See any money wrappers around there ? " " I saw them by the handful , " said Ryder . " What were the labels on the backs of the money wrappers ? " " One thousand dollars . " Received One Payment of $250 . " Were you ever paid a bill of $250 on the premises ? " " Yes , sir . That was wign Mr. Capone was sick ; that is , the boys the employes , you know  --  the ones down stairs says , ' Be quiet , the boss is sick . ' And , of course , he wanted ? he was anxious for me to get started with this here boathouse . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by Mr. Capone  --  that is , Mr. Capone ' r ; wife got the , key and opened this cupboard to get the money to pay me and gave me $250 to go ahead , and part of that was for rental of the car and the other part applied to the boathouse . " " See any other money there at the time ? " " Plenty of it . " Capone 's face was a study , a study of a man doing his best to keep from popping wide open with denials and bitterness . The jury was wide awake , each and every one , fat , thin , faded and young , to hear more from Mr.1 Ryder , Only Judge Wilkerson seemed , perfectly at ease and indifferent . He may not have been . " Plenty of it ? Where ? " " In a closet . I would say it was a roll to choke an ox . " Capone looked as though he 'd like to choke something , not an ox . " What were the denominations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifty dollar bills . " Mr. Grossman turned to Albert Fink of counsel for Capone . Mr. Fink is sort of old-school type , but quick and alert and blessed with a sense of humor . He 's heavy , red faced and keeps beaming behind gold-rimmed glasses . He cross-examined the carpenter . ' suppose , " he'said , " that the size of the roll of bills that would choke an ox would depend somewhat upon the size of the ox that was to be choked ? What ? Well , tell me , now , how big an ox would be choked with this particular ? 7 " Judge Simplifies Description . Laughter rippled through the highvaulted court room as Judge Wilker ? son interrupted with : " Perhaps we can simplify that ; just how large was it ? " He leaned toward the witness . " Oh , about , I would say , as large as your wrist , " " It might have been , for all you know , " said Mr. Fink , " what some of the boys call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outside and all the balance one-dollar bills ? " " That 's all I know . They may have been one-dollar bills or may have been a bunch of paper . " " All your dealings with Al were pleasant ? " " Very pleasant . " " From your knowledge of him and your business transactions , did you form an idea of what kind of a man he was ? " " Oh , yes ; I 'd say he 's a mighty fine man . " Capone gave no sign that he liked the compliment . " Would you say he was the kind of a man that would repudiate any obligation that he owed ? " " No , sir . " " That 's all . " Ryder started to climb down when Grossman asked him : " But you did n't get the $125 ? " " I have n't got it yet , but I think he will give it to me eventually . " He smiled at Capone , without luck . He was ignored , cut dead . Again Ryder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Ahern took him in hand : " The defendant owes you $125 ? " Ryder nodded . " Well , you left your tools and your scow on his place , didn't. - you , because you did n't complete the contract ? " " Everything was completed . " " Why did n't you go back and get your tools ? " " Because , as a rule , those things are left there until we get another contract , moving about , you see . " " How much is the scow worth ? " " It is n't worth but very little now , about $300 . " " But you 've never come after it to take it away ? " " No , sir . " " Keller walked away with $1,560 of this defendant on that job , did n't he ? " Capone Whispers , Suggestions . Capone kept whispering suggestions for questions . " If Keller did , I do n't know . " " Did n't you get any part of it ? " " I never got any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever ask for the $125 . " " No , sir , I have n't been able to get hold of him . Mr. Capone at the time I went to get it was down in Nassau . " Capone did n't like that crack . " Why did n't you write him a letter ? " " Well , from what I have been told , he does all his communication by phone and his phone is n't listed , " . " You did n't know the phone ? And while you were building the dock you learned all about the telegraph boys , bank rolls , people who came there and how much was in the closet and all that sort of thing , but not the telephone number ? " " Well ? no , sir . " Mr. Grossman had another whack at direct-examination of the witness . " Did you try to get back there to see him Capone after you met the employes outside of his place ? " " I tried several times . I got in , as I say , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would pay that $125 if I had to and I would save my neck . " Up from the seat he started at a signal of dismissal from the prosecutor , but Mr. Ahern held him with a gesture . " You knew all those employes , did n't you ? " " Yes . " " And they were friendly with you ? " . " Very friendly . " " So you were n't afraid of them ? You sat at the same table and ate with these men on a number of occasions ? " " Never did . They gave me a sandwich sometimes . " Capone shook his big head in lifter disgust , as if he had a , clear and distinct recollection of the thin-faced carpenter gorging himself at the Capone table . Ryder stepped down . Others Tell of Dealings . There were all sorts of witnesses from Miami , and when they had finished their parade to the stand the government had in the records , from their testimony , the facts the Capone spent , in three brief Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone calls to Chicago and other business centres of the Capone outfit ; $1,176 for bread , cake and macaroni ; a hotel bill ( one of many ) of - $2,885 ; $1,700 for draperies , $800 for more draperies and fine linens , $11,000 for garage and swimming pool , $490 for iron gates and $2,100 for trees and shrubs to beautify the Palm Island house . Several of the Miami tradesmen , some with blurry Southern accents , some with foreign dialects thick as butter , got broad smiles from the defendant . Several showed by their attitude that they were sorry to have to testify against him . H. J. Etherridge , a handsome young department store manager who sold the linens to Capone , had a wide , friendly smile for the gang chief , which was warmly returned . Louis Karlebach , a heavy-set butcher who cashed money orders for Capone and sold him his meat , said his bills ran from $200 to $250 a week . " You do n't think Al ate all this meat himself , do you ? " Mr. Fink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that , " 1 the witness answered gravely . ? I did n't say that Al did " eat it all . " Court will reconvene Monday I morning , despite the fact that it is Columbus Day .
