William Henry Cardinal O'Connell , Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston , never goes to the movies , rarely has films exhibited in his Commonwealth Avenue home , and on those infrequent occasions seldom applauds or sees a picture to its end . Last fortnight , however , Cardinal O'Connell beat palm on palm while sitting through a film brought to his house by George Kraska , manager of Boston 's highbrow Fine Arts Theatre , and Rev. Michael Joseph Ahern , S. J. , one of New England 's ablest Jesuits . The picture was Monastery , a European religious documentary film , the better part of which was made by Robert Alexandre of Pathe Cinema de France , who directed Cloistered , first picture ever made in a convent ( TIME , June 1 , 1936 ) . Dedicated to Cardinal O'Connell , with his express permission , Monas tery had its U. S. premiere at the Fine Arts Theatre last week , the $10-a-seat proceeds of $5,850 going towards a Father Ahern Fellowship in Seismology at Weston College outside Boston . <P> Part of Monastery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the life of St. Bernard monks in Switzerland . Most striking shot : the St. <P> Bernard mortuary , full during the winter of victims of accidents , to be identified and claimed by their relatives in the spring . The remainder of the solemn , slow-moving picture was filmed in the French monastery of La Trappe , to enter which Director Alexandre needed to employ as much wire-pulling and salesman ship as he did in making Cloistered . The Trappist monks , one of the strictest of Catholic orders , speak to one another only by signs , and permitted Director Alexandre no special staging , no retakes . A much better job of photography , the Trappist sequence of Monastery is more sombre than the St. Bernard , shows such Trappist activities as the monks washing one another 's feet , burying a black-robed brother without a coffin . One shot is of a Trappist motto : The bliss of dying without regret is well worth the pain of living without contentment . Fade-out of the film is a monk 's head superimposed upon a painting of Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained the U. S. rights to Monastery , he invited his good friend Father Ahern to help him cut , revise and edit it , as well as deliver a dubbed-in commentary . For the jovial , baldish Jesuit , this was a congenial assignment . Father " Mike " Ahern , 60 , is an accomplished Catholic publicist . Head of the departments of chemistry and geology at Weston College , New England Jesuit training college , he is also a teacher of philosophy , science and theology at Boston College , and , since 1929 , speaker on Boston station WNAC 's " Catholic Truth Period .
