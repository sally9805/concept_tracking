A DEATH IN THE COUNTRY A STORY BY STEPHEN VINCENT BEAT AP TER the years , Tom Carroll was going back to Waynesville  --  to stand by a kinswoman 's grave , in the country of his youth . The names of the small , familiar stations were knots on a thread that led back into the darkness of childhood . He was glad Claire had not come . She bated death and memories . She hated cramped , local trains that smelled of green plush and cinders . Most of all she would hate Waynesville , even in mid-September and the grave light of afternoon . Well , he was n't looking forward to a pleasant time . He felt fagged and on the edge already . There was work for the active partner of Norman , Buck-stone , and Carroll in his brief-case , but he could not get down to the work . Instead he remembered , from childhood , the smell of dyed cloth and poignant , oppressive flowers , the black wisp tied on the knocker , the people coming to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a secret  --  there were incomprehensible phrases , said in a murmur , and a man in black gloves who came , and a strangeness behind a shut door . Run out and play , run out and play ; but there was no right way to play any more  --  even out in the yard you could smell the sweet , overpowering flowers even out in the street you could see the people coming and coming , making that little pause as they saw the black wisp . Beautiful , they said , she looks beautiful ; but the glimpse of the face was not mother , only somebody coldly asleep . Our sister has gone to dear Jesus . . . we shall meet on that beautiful shore .. . but the man spoke words , and the harsh box sank into the hole , and from it nothing arose , not even a white thing , not even silver vapor ; the clay at the sides of the hole was too yellow and thick and cold . He 's too young to realize , said a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world had stopped being solid , and people 's smiles were different , and mother was Jesus 's sister , and they gave her clothes away . Then , after a long time , the place was green again and looked just like the other graves , and the knife in your pocket was a comfort , going out there Sundays in the street car . Barbarous . And to-morrow would be barbarous , as well . The family met only at funerals and weddings , now ; and there had been more funerals than weddings for the past ten years . The big Christmas tree was gone from the house on Hessian Street  --  the majestic tree whose five-pointed , sparkling star had scratched against the ceiling of heaven in the back parlor , spreading wide its green boughs to shelter all generations and tribes of the Pyes and Merritts and Chipmans , their wives and their children , their menservants and their maidservants , their Noah 's arks and cigar-cases and bottles of eau-de-cologne . The huge tablecloth of Thanksgiving lay folded away at the bottom of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never be another turkey , with a breast like a mountainside , to fall into endless slices under the shining magic of Uncle Mel-rose 's knife . Aunt Louise and Aunt Emmy had been the last of Hessian Street and , after to-morrow , there would only be Aunt Emmy and the ghosts . The faces around the table had been masterful and full of life . They had been grown-up and permanent  --  one could not imagine them young or growing old . Together , they made a nation ; they were the earth . If one took the trains of the morning , even as far as Bradensburg , lo , Uncle Melrose was there , at his desk with the little brass postage-scale on top of it , as it had been from the first . If one walked out to Mount Pleasant through the buckeye fall , at the end there was the white gate of Cousin Edna and the iron nigger boy with the rainstreaked face , holding out his black hand stiffly for the buckboards that drove no more . There were princes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Aunt Emmy and Cousin Millie , beside the everlasting forms of Mrs. Bache and Mr. Beaver , of the ladies at the Women 's Exchange and the man who lighted the gas street-lamps with a long brass spike ? Then , suddenly , the earth had begun to crumble . A wind blew , a bell sounded , and they were dispersed . There were shrunken old people , timorous and pettish , and a small , heart-stifling town . These and the grown-up children , more strange than strangers . But Hessian Street was over  --  the great tree was down . " And Uncle Melrose was a pompous old windbag " thought Tom Carroll . " And yet , if he were alive , I 'd be calling him ' Sir . ' Oh , Claire 's right  --  thejungle 's the jungIe  --  she 's saner than I am , always . " It was one of the many maxims Claire found in books . The family was the jungle that you grew up in and , if you did not , somehow , break through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you died , quickly or slowly but surely , stifled out , choked down by the overpowering closeness of your own kin . Tom Carroll knew this much - that New York , after Waynesville , had been like passing from the large , squabbling , overheated room of Christmas afternoon into the anonymous peace of a bare and windy street . He had been lonely , often  --  he had missed Hessian Street and them all . But , oh the endless , intricate , unimportant diplomacy ? the feuds and the makings-up  --  the inflexible machine of the Family , crushing all independence . Not again , not ever again ! And yet , here he was , on the train . Well , nobody could say that he shirked it . He would have to take charge when he got there , like it or not . It would n't be easy , straightening everything out  --  he 'd rather handle the Corliss case any day  --  but he 'd done it in other emergencies and he supposed he could do it again . After all , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking of Jerry . The conductor bawled the names of familiar stations , the long , autumnal twilight began beyond the window . If only things could go smoothly just this once ! But something always cropped up  --  something always had to be smoothed over and explained . Morton Center , Morton Center ! If Aunt Louise had left no will  --  and she very probably had n't  --  there 'd be the dickens of a time , securing the estate to Aunt Emmy . But it must be done  --  he 'd ride roughshod over Jerry Pye if necessary . Brandy Hill ! Brandy Hill ! . . . If only nobody would tell him to be sure and notice Mrs. Bache ! He could easily fix a pension for Aunt Emmy , but how to do it best ? She 'd have to leave Hessian Street , of course . Even cutting the old house into apartments had n't really solved the problem . She could get a small , comfortable , modern flat over in the new section . The silver candlesticks were the only things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry because Jerry had always failed . Waynesville , next stop ! The flowers had been wired from New York . Waynesville ! We 're coming in . There 's an A. &; P. on Main Street , and Ellerman 's Bazaar is gone . Waynesville ! . . . And God bless Uncle Melrose and Aunt Louise and Aunt Emmy and all my dear relations and friends and Spot and make me a good boy and not afraid of the dark . Waynesville ! Right down the middle of Main Street the train clanged till it stopped in front of the bald , new station . Tom Carroll sighed . It was as he had prophesied . Jerry Pye was there to meet him . He got off the train , and the cousins shook hands . " Have a good trip , Tom ? " " Not bad . Real fall weather , is n't it ? " " Yes , it 's a real fall . You took the limited as far as Bradensburg , I sup-pose ? " " Yes , that seemed the quickest thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a train , " said Jerry Pye . " I was on her once  --  three years ago , you know . Well , I thought , here 's where the old man blows himself for once . Minnie would hardly believe me when I told her . Jerry Pye ! ' she said , ' I do n't know what 's come over you . You never take me on any limiteds ! ' Well , ' I said , ' maybe it is extra-fare , but I just decided the old man could blow himself for once ! ' Well , you should have seen her expression ! Though I guess it wouldn'tmean much to you , at that . I guess extra-fare trains do n't mean much in people 's lives when they come from New York , " " I could have taken a slower train , " said Tom Carroll , carefully , " but it would n't have saved any time . " This remark seemed to amuse Jerry Pye intensely . His thin , sallow face  --  the face of a dyspeptic fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobered himself , abruptly and pointedly . " You always were a ease , Torn , " he said , " always . But this is a sad occasion . " " I did n't mean to be funny , " said Tom Carroll . " Had I better get a taxi or is that your car ? " " Oh , we 've got the family mistake  --  a dollar down and a dollar whenever they catch you ! " Jerry Pye grinned and sobered himself again with the automatism of a mechanical figure . " I drove up in her night before last , " he said , pointedly , as they got in . " Evans is a good man and all that , but he 's apt to figure a little close on the cars ; and as long as ours is dark blue , it 'll look perfectly dignified . " " I telegraphed Aunt Emmy , " said Tom Carroll and stopped . There was no possible use in trying to explain oneself to Jerry Pye . " Yes , indeed , " said Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very much indeed . ' Tom 's always very busy , ' I told her . ' But do n't you worry , Aunt Emmy . Tom may be a big man now , but his heart 's in the right place . He 'll be here . ' " " I told her , " said Tom Carroll , distinctly and in spite of himself , " that in case anything of the sort came up , she had only to ? " " Oh , " said Jerry , brightly , " we all knew that . We all knew you could n't be expected to send one of your big cars all the way from New York to Waynesville . How 's Claire ? " " Claire was very sorry indeed not to be able to come , " said Tom , his hands gripping his knees . " We have one car , " he said . " That 's just what I said , " said Jerry Pye triumphantly . " I told Aunt Emmy ? you could n't expect Tom to take the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's away , shopping and seeing her friends  --  and naturally she hardly knew Aunt Louise . You wait and see . She 'll send handsome flowers , ' 1 said . " " Oh , God , make me a good boy ! " prayed Tom Carroll , internally . " It ca n't last more than Len minutes . Ten minutes is n't really long . " He braced himself . " How is Aunt Emmy ? " he said . Their speed instantly dropped to a respectful twenty miles an hour . " She 's wonderful , " said Jerry Pye . " Simply wonderful . Of course , Minnie 's been a great help to her and then , the end was very peaceful . Just seemed to breathe away . " His voice had an obvious relish . " One minute she was there  --  as bright as a button , considering everything  --  and the next minute " He shook his head . " I 'm glad , " said Torn Carroll . " I mean --  " " Oh , we would n't have wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked voice , as if he were denying some uncouth suggestion of Tom 's . " No , sir , we would n't have wanted that . Now when Minnie 's mother passed over  --  I do n't know whether I ever told you the whole story , Tom  --  but from the Friday before ? " He continued , but had only come to the personal idiosyncrasies of the first night nurse when they turned into Hessian Street . They got out of the car . Jerry Pye was mopping his forehead , though the day was chill . Yes , there was the black wisp on the knocker . But there was a row of bell-pushes where the old name-plate had been . The bricks inthe sidewalk were rose-red and old and worn  --  the long block of quiet houses kept its faded dignity , in spite of a sign , " Pappas ' Smoke Shop , " a sign , " The Hessian Sergeant  --  Tea and Antiques . " The linden trees had not perished , though their shade was thin . " If this were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found out by now that it was quaint and painted the doors green and had studio-parties . Well , anyhow , that has n't happened . " " Everyone 's been very respectful , " said Jerry Pye , nodding at the black wisp . " I mean , some people might be touchy when everybody has to use the same front-door . But Mr. Rodman came to me himself  --  they 're the second-floor back . Just leave your bag in the car , Tom . It wo n't be in the way . I think Minnie 's seen us  --  we figured out if you came to-day this ought to be the train . " Tom Carroll did not repeat that he had telegraphed or that there was only one afternoon train to Waynesville .. He kissed his cousin-in-law 's flustered cheek and was kissed by her in return . Minnie was always flustered ; she had been a plump , flustered robin of a girl at her wedding ; she was unaltered now save for the dust of gray in her abundant , unbecoming hair ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet , they always kissed . He wondered if Minnie , too , ever found this circumstance strange . He should not wonder , of course , especially now . " How 's Aunt Emmy ? " said Jerry Pye , in the anxious tones of one just returned from a long absence . " There is n't any change ? " " No , dear , " said Minnie , solemnly , " she 's just the same . She 's wonderful . Mrs. Robinson and Mrs. Bache are with her , now . Remember  --  we must all be very nice to Mrs. Bache , Cousin Tom . " " I did put a tick-tack on her window , once , " said Tom Carroll , reflectively . " But I have n't done that for a long time . Not for thirty years . " Minnie , the robin , was shocked for a moment , but brightened . " That 's right , " she said . " We must all keep up for Aunt Emmy . Now , if you 'll just go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hawk-nosed figure rose from the stiff-backed chair as Tom Carroll entered . " Good evening , Thomas . I am glad you are here , " said the unfaltering voice . " I think you know my good neighbors , Mrs. Bache and Mrs. Robinson . " Tom Carroll took the thin , dry , forceful hands . By God , she is wonderful , be thought , in spite of their saying it  --  it 's taken me years to unlearn what she taught me , but she 's remarkable . Why do n't they let her alone ? Aunt Emmy , Aunt Emmy , you have groom so small ! You rapped on my chapped knuckles with a steel thimble when I was cold ; you ran me through and through like the emery-bag in your workbox with your sharp and piercing eyes ; you let me sec that you thought my father a rascal ; you made me lie and cheat because of the terror of your name  --  and now you have grown small and fragile and an old woman . and there is not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Carroll found himself mechanically answering Mrs. Bache 's questions while his eyes roved about the room . The conch-shell was still on the mantelpiece , but one of the blue vases was gone . This was the front-parlor  --  the room of reward and punishment , of visitors and chill , the grandest room in the world  --  this room with the shabby carpet and the huge forbidding pieces of black walnut that never could have come in through a mortal door . What could you do with it all , what could you do ? What could be done with a conch-shell and an iron oak-leaf and a set of yellowed pictures for a brokenstereopticon ? It was incredible that civilized people should ever have cherished such things . It was incredible that he had ever put the conch-shell to his ear and held his breath with wonder , bearing the sea . " It was just like another home to the Major and myself . Always , " said Mrs. Bache . " I can hear your dear grandmother now , before the Major was taken , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you-re young , ' she said . ' But , young or old , we all have to bear our cross . The Major is a good man  --  he 'll always be welcome in Hessian Street . ' The Major never forgot it . He was very badly treated but he never forgot a kindness . And now , Emmy and I are the last  --  Emmy and I are the last . " She fumbled for her handkerchief in her vast lap . " There , there , Mrs. Bache , " said Tom Carroll , inadequately , " Grandmother must have been a wonderful woman . " " You never even saw her , " said Mrs. Bache , viciously , " Tom Carroll saw to that . Oh , why could n't it have been me , instead of Louise ? " she said . " I 've been ready to go so long ! " Tom Carroll 's face felt stiff , but he found the handkerchief . After a moment Mrs. Bache arose , enormously yet with a curious dignity . " Come , Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was Mrs. Robinson , " It 's time for us to go . I 've been making a fool of myself . Good-by , Emma . Frank will take us to the church to-morrow . Try to get some rest . " Minnie was whispering to him that Mrs. Bache was very much broken and that Cousin Tom must not mind . Tom Carroll whispered back at appropriate intervals . He did not mind Mrs. Bache . But there was always so much whispering , and it hurt one 's head . Now they were all standing in the narrow hall , and the others were looking at him . " We can just slip in for a minute before anyone else comes , " whispered " I know Cousin Tom would rather ? " " Of course , " said Tom Carroll . " Thank you , Cousin Minnie . " He must have been working too hard , he thought  --  perhaps he and Claire could go off for a trip together when he got back . Because , after all , it was Aunt Louise who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until Minnie had spoken , he had n't been thinking about her at all . The statue lay on the walnut bed in the partitioned room that had once been part of the back parlor . Over the head of the bed was a cross of dry , brittle palm-leaves tied with a purple ribbon , and a church-calendar . Against the opposite wall was the highboy that he remembered , with the small china slipper upon it , and above it the ageless engraving of the great Newfoundland dog , head lifted , lying upon the stone blocks of an English quay . " A Member of the Royal Humane Society . " There were brown spots on the margin of the engraving now , Tom Carroll noticed . The window was a little open , but everywhere were the massed , triumphant flowers . A white , transparent veil lay on the face of the statue . The features showed dimly through it , as if Aunt Louise lay in a block of ice . Tom Carroll felt cold . Now Aunt Emmy , putting Minnie aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking at three o'clock in the morning in his room at the Penniquit House , knew instantly what was in store for him . He might lie on the hillocks of his bed as long as he liked but he would not be allowed to sleep any more . " You 're acting like somebody on the edge of a first-class nervous breakdown , " he told himself sternly . " And yet , you have n't been working so hard . " The last year had n't been easy , but no year was . When times were good , you worked hard to take advantage of them . And when they were bad , you naturally had to work . That was how you got to be somebody , in a city . It was something Waynesville could never understand . He thought of their life in the city  --  his and Claire 's  --  for solace .. It was cool and glittering and civilized as a cube of bright steel and glass . He thought of the light , pleasant furniture in the apartment , the clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bright , clean , modern , expensive school where a doctor looked down the boys ' throats every morning and they had special blocks of wood to hammer nails in , since apartments were hardly the place to hammer nails . He thought of his office and the things on his desk and the crowded elevators of morning and night . He thought of the crammed red moving vans of October and the spring that bloomed before April in the flower-shops and the clever men , putting in the new telephones . He thought of night beside Claire , hearing the dim roar of the city till at last the uneasy lights of the sky were quieted in the breathing-space before dawn . It was she who had really held their life to its pattern . She had not let them be trapped ; she had kept them free as air from the first day . There had been times when he had weakened ? he admitted it  --  but she had kept her level head and never given in . It had been that way about the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had wanted to buy them both , at different times . It was the Waynesville coming out in him , he supposed . But she had demurred . " Oh , Tom , let 's not tie ourselves up yet ! " she had said . " Yes , I know it does seem silly just going on paying rent and having nothing to show for it but a leak in the washstand . But the minute you buy places to live in they start to own you . You are n't free . You are n't young . You 're always worrying . Do n't talk to me about just playing with a few acres , not really farming . That was the way Grandfather started . Oh , Tom , do n't you see  --  we 're so right the way we are ! Now , let 's go over it sensibly , figures and all . " And she had been right . The old farmhouse , with its lilac hedge , now stood twenty feet away from a four-lane road ; the co-operative apartment had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She almost always was . She had been entirely and unsentimentally right about her mother 's coming to live with them for six months out of the year , when that had seemed unescapable . " It 's darling of you , Tom , but , dear old man , it never would work in the world . We 've got to be modern and intelligent about the important things . Mother had me , and I 'm devoted to her ; but , when we 're together for more than a week we get on each other 's nerves like the very devil . It 'll actually be a help to Hattie to have her for the winters  --  Hattie 's always having a fearful time with the children . And we can have her for a long visit in the summer , and in between she can take the trips she 's always wanted to take with that terrible Mrs. Tweed . Of course , I do n't mean we ought to leave the whole financial end to Hattie and Joe . I 'll insist on our doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some independence even when they are old and not just be shipped aroundfrom one relative to another like parcels , the way they did with Aunt Vi ! It 's more than sweet of you , Tom , darling . But you see how it is . " Tom Carroll had seen , with some relief , that they were not likely to have Mrs. Fanshawe as a permanent addition to their household , and he had acquiesced . Not that he disliked Mrs. Fanshawe . He got on very well with the rather nervous little lady  --  which was strange , considering how unlike she was to Claire . It struck him at times that Mrs. Fanshawe , from what he knew of her , had never been a remarkably independent person , and that to begin one 's complete independence at the age of sixty-seven might be something of a task . But Claire must know her mother better than he did . She did get on Claire 's nerves and she did spoil the children  --  he could see that plainly enough . But , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to decline three or four invitations because mother was with them for a quiet little time before something would happen to call Mrs. Fanshawe away . And yet she seemed to like his calling her Mother May and pretending he was jealous of Hattie and Joe for stealing away his best girl . She 'd laugh her brisk , nervous laugh and say he 'd better look out or sometime she 'd take him at his word and stay forever . And Claire would be saying , patiently , " Now , mother , are you sure that you have your ticket ? And Tom will get you some magazines to read on the train . " Afterwards Claire would say , " Oh , Tom , how can you ? But she adores it ! " and he would mumble something and feel rather pleased . Then Claire would kiss him and go to the telephone . Only one of the visits had been in the least unfortunate . Claire had been tired that evening , and it was a pity that the conversation had happened to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , you and Tom are planning to make a real home for them sometime ? " Mrs. Fanshawe had said . Well , naturally , she could hardly be expected to understand the way he and Claire happened to feel about " homes " in the Waynesville sense . And it had all come right the following morning  --  had not Mrs. Fanshawe nervously stayed an extra two days in proof ? But the evening had carried him back to the hurt feelings of Hessian Street . Tom Carroll was glad there had been another visit before Mrs. Fanshawe died . She had died in the waiting room of the Auburndale Station , on her way back to Hattie 's , after a pleasant month with her old friend , Mrs. Tweed . Even so , she had been considerate ; for the station agent knew her and got hold of the Morrises at once  --  there had been some mix-up about her telegram . Later , they had found out that she had known about her heart trouble for some time . He had expected to take Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will not have you do it , Tom . It 'll be bad enough by myself . But I will not have you mixed up in it  --  it is n't fair . We can have bad memories separately , but I wo n't have us have them together . " She had grown almost hysterical about it  --  Claire ! And so she had gone alone . He had been very much worried till she returned , with a white changed face that refused to give any details of those three days . " Do n't ask me , Tom . I 've told you everything I can ? oh , yes , everybody was kind and they had her hymns . .. but , oh Tom , it 's so terrible . Terrible . ? The most barbarous , the most humiliating custom I know ! I 'll tell you this right now , I 'm not going to wear mourning . I do n't believe in it and I wo n't submit to it . All the black dresses  --  mother did n't really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die do n't dare wear mourning for me ! " He had got her to bed and quieted at last . But she had not been herself  --  the true Claire  --  for months afterward , though , as soon as she could , she had taken up the strands of their life again and woven the pattern even more deftly and swiftly , as if each new thread were precious and each second not to be recalled . Naturally , then , it was only right for him to come to this death in his own country alone . Any other course would have been a monstrous selfishness . And yet he wished that he could go to sleep . Perhaps , if he thought once more of that shining cube of steel and glass that was their planned security , sleep would come . Even death in New York was different and impersonal . Except for the very mighty , it was an anonymous affair . The man in 10B died and , the next fall , they redecorated the apartment for other tenants . In a month or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another name on the morning papers . A name dropped out of the ' phone hook . . . you had moved again , withOctober . . . moved to another city  --  the city at the sprawling edge of town where lie the streets and avenues of the numberless , quickly buried dead . There , too , you would be part of the crowd , and your neighbors would be strangers , as it had been in life . Your dwelling would be well kept-up , for that was written in the contract . No ghosts could ever arise from that suburban earth . For this , John Merritt and Samuel Pye had built a house in the wilderness to be a shelter and a refuge for them and their seed to the generations of generations . It was just . Something cracked in the shining cube of glass and steel . The girders crunched on one another , wrenching apart ; the glass tumbled into nothing-ness , falling a long way . There was nothing left but the perplexed , forgotten spirit , roused out of long sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary . Claire was all right , but she was afraid of death . He was all right , but he was afraid of death . The clever people they knew were entirely right , but most of them were deadly afraid of death . If the life they led was rich  --  if it was the good life  --  why were they so afraid ? It was not because they so joyed in all things under the sun that it was bitter to leave them . That was mortal and understandable , that had always been . But this was a blinder fear . It had not been in sorrow or remorse that Claire had grieved for her mother ? she had grieved the most because she had been afraid . And that made Claire a monster , which she was not . But there was something in it , all the same . He could admit it in her because he could admit it in himself . He lay sleepless , dreading the morrow . And yet he was not a coward so far as he knew . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had escaped from Waynesville and Hessian Street , from Fanshawe and Pye and Merritt , but where was the escape ? If they were afraid in these years , how were they to deal with the years to come ? Tom Carroll heard the clock in the courthouse strike five strokes . And then , when it seemed to him he could never sleep again , he fell asleep . They drove at the slow pace down Hessian Street into Main , through the bright , morning sunlight . Tom Carroll felt ashamed of the dreams and waking of the night . He had never felt more solid and confident and assured than he did now , sitting beside Aunt Emmy , his tact and his shoulder ready for her the moment the inevitablebreakdown came . Thank God ! Jerry Pye was driving his own car . Jerry muddled things so . As for what was to come , that would merely be pathetic ? the few old people painfully come together to mourn not only one of their own but a glory that had departed , the Waynesville of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few they were . But she , too , was old ; and the old lived in the past . She could people the empty pews with the faces that once had been there . It was better so . The lords of Hessian and Bounty Streets had ruled the town with a high hand , even as they sank into poverty , but that was ended . You had only to look along Main to see the new names on the shop-fronts . They knew not Hessian Street , these Caprellos and Szukalskis , but they thrived and inherited the land . Even Waynesville was growing up  --  there was little charm left in it , but it was alive . And here was the old brick church of the memories . He helped Aunt Emmy expertly from the car , but she would not take his arm . Well , he respected her courage . He stood tactfully to shield her from the sight of the coffin , just being lifted down from that other , windowless car . But before he knew it Jerry Pye was beside them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " did Aunt Louise really want old Zenas to be one of the coffin-bearers ? Because he 's there now , and it 'll be too late unless somebody tells him . . . " He actually made a gesture with his hand . Tom Carroll would have been glad to strangle his cousin . But miraculously Aunt Emmy did not break . She even walked past Tom Carroll to look deliberately at the six black-suited negroes who now had their burden ready to carry into the church . Tom Carroll looked as well . They were none of them under forty , and their faces were grave and sober , but there was something ceremonial in their attitude that struck Tom Carroll strangely . They were sad but they were not constrained  --  they were doing something they felt to be right and they did it naturally and with ceremony . They would remember the ceremony always when the sadness bad passed . " Zenas , Joram , Joseph , William , Henry , Devout , " said Aunt Emmy , in a half-whisper . " Yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Louise would have missed Zenas . No , Tommy , we will let them pass , please . " When the coffin had passed , to the sway of the easy shoulders , they followed it in . It was the beginning of Tom Carroll 's astonishment . The astonishment did not lessen when he found the church half full , and not only with the old . He had always thought of Aunt Louise as Aunt Emmy 's shadow  --  in his boyhood as someone always hurried but vaguely sweet whose peppermint-drops took away the taste of Aunt Emmy 's wrath ; in his manhood as a responsibility at the back of his mind . But the minister was a young man , and neither Pye nor Merritt , and he spoke of the Louise Pye , whose singlehanded effort had turned the ramshackle old School For The Instruction Of Freed Negroes into an institution model for its time , in terms that assumed his hearers knew and appreciated the difficulties of that task . Phrases came to Tom Carroll 's ears . They were the conventional phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsparing of time or labor . " " The rare gift of personality . " " The quiet achievement of many years . " " We can say to-day , in all truth , a light has gone from among us . . . " But this was Aunt Louise ! And after the service , and on the way to the grave , and after the service there , the astonishment continued . He was by Aunt Emmy 's side , and the people spoke to him . Nearly everyone who spoke to him knew his name . They did not find it odd or kind or a favor that he should be there  --  he was Julia Merritt 's son , who was working in New York . You did n't hear as much about him as you did about Jerry Pye , but it was natural that he should return . Not only Mrs. Bache was under the impression that he had come principally to hear the reading of Aunt Louise 's will . They did not think ill of him for it , merely prudent . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing to explain . He could not count the number of times he was told that the cross of yellow roses was beautiful  --  did they know by telepathy that it was from him and Claire ? He had thought it garish and out of place beside the other flowers , the late asters and first chrysanthemums , the zinnias and snapdragons , the bronzes and reds and golds of the country fall . But that he could not say . The negroes who had borne the coffin knew him . They spoke to him gravely in their rich voices when all was done . Aunt Emmy had a curious phrase for each of them , " Thank you , Devout . Thank you , Joram . Miss Louise will be pleased . " It would seem macabre , telling it to Claire . It was not ; it was only simple . But that she would not believe . He remembered , as if in a dream , his plans for succor and comfort when Aunt Emmy should collapse . But it was he who felt physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was the moment that he had dreaded the most . Last night he had been able to have dinner at the hotel , but this time there was no escaping the cold meal laid in the basement dining room , the haunted and undue fragrance of flowers that had filled the house for a while . But , when the food was in front of him he was hungry and ate . They all ate , even Aunt Emmy . Minnie did what waiting was necessary and did it , for once , without fluster . Jerry Pye seemed tired and subdued . Once Tom Carroll caught himself feeling sorry for him , once he tried to help him out in a story that was meant to be cheerful and fell flat . " You know , " said Minnie , in a flat voice , pouring coffee , " it seems as if Aunt Louise had n't gone away so far as before it happened . " Tom Carroll knew what she meant . He felt it too  --  that presence of the dead , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real as the October sky , and as removed from flesh . It did not have to mean that all tired souls were immortal  --  it had its own peace . After the meal was over , Tom Carroll walked in the back yard and smoked with Jerry Pye . Now and then he remembered from childhood the fear that had walked there with him , with the scent of the overpowering flowers . But , search as he would , he could not find that fear . The few flowers left in the beds were bronze and scentless ; there was no fear where they bloomed . It was time to go in for the reading of Aunt Louise 's will . Tom Carroll listened obediently . He did not even mention the names of Norman , Buck-stone , and Carroll . Once , when Mr. Dabney , the lawyer , looked at him and said , " You are a member of the New York Bar , I believe , Mr. Carroll ? " he felt surprised at being able to say yes . " It was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could see Aunt Louise going through her innumerable boxes , trying hard to be fair . " To my nephew , Thomas Carroll , and his wife , Claire Fanshawe Carroll , the pair of silver candlesticks belonging to my dear Father . " Tom Carroll felt the slow red creeping into his face . They shook hands with Mr. Dabney . They spoke of what was to he done . Tom Carroll did not proffer assistance . There was no need . Jerry Pye was offering him a lift as far as Bradensburg  --  Minnie would be staying with Aunt Emmy for the next week or so , but he must get back to work . But Tom Carroll thought he had better wait till the morning . " Well , I guess you 'll be more comfortable here at that , " said Jerry Pye . " I 'll have to hit her up if I want to get home before 3 G.M. So long , Tom . You see Minnie does n't step out with a handsomer fellow now the old man 's away . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess they 'll look better in your place than they would in ours . Our kids might use ' em for baseball bats . Say , give my best to Claire . " He was gone . " Now , Tommy , " said Aunt Emmy in her tired , indomitable voice , " you go back to the hotel and get a rest  --  you look tuckered out . Nelly Jervis is coming in here to get the supper . Half-past six . " They were sitting in the front parlor again that evening , he and she . It was n't late , but Minnie had been sent to bed , unwilling . She would n't close an eye , she said ; but they knew she was already asleep . " It 's queer what a good nurse Minnie is , " said Aunt Emmy reflectively . " Seems as if it was the only thing that ever got her shut of her fussiness  --  taking care of sick people . You 'd think she 'd drop crumbs in the bed , but she never does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Well , she 's a right to be tired . " " How about you , Aunt Emmy ? " " Oh , " said Aunt Emmy , " they used to say there 'd be some people the Fool Killer would still be looking for on Judgment Day . I guess I 'm one of them . Of course I 'm tired , Tommy . When I 'm tired enough , I 'll tell you and go to bed . " " Look here , Aunt Emmy , " said Tom Carroll , " if there 's anything I can do ? " " And what could you do , Tommy ? " " Well , would n't you like a car ? " he said , awkwardly , " or somebody to stay with you  --  or another place . They say those apartments over by the ? " " I was born here , " said Aunt Emmy , with a snap of her lips , " and now Louise has gone , I 've " got just enough money to die here . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all the horrors of age , deliver me from a paid companion . If I need anything like that I 'll get Susan Bache to move in here . She 's a fool and she 's a tattler , " said Aunt Emmy , clearly , " but I 'm used to her . And Minnie 'll come up , every now and then . Do n't worry about me , Tom Carroll . We 've all of us been on your back long enough . " " On my back ? " said Tom Carroll , astounded . " Well , I 'd like to know where else it was , " said Aunt Emmy . " You got Louise 's money back from that rascal that bamboozled her , and I know of twice you pulled Jerry Pye out of the mudhole , and then there was Cousin Edna all those years . Not to speak of what you did for Melrose . Melrose was my own brother , but he ought to have been ashamed of himself , the way he hindered you . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no call . You did right to get out when you did and as you did , and Waynesville knows it , too . Not that Waynesville would ever admit George Washington was any great shakes , once he 'd moved away . But you wait till you die , Tom Carroll " ? and sheactually chuckled ? " and you see what the Waynesville Blade says about her distinguished son . They told Louise for twenty years she was crazy , teaching negroes to read and write . But they 've got two columns about her this evening and an editorial . I 've cut it out and I 'm going to paste it under her picture . Louise was always the loving one , and I never grudged her that . But I did grudge her forgiving where I did n't see cause to forgive . But that 's all done . " She rustled the paper in her lap . " How are your boys , Tommy ? " she said . " They look smart enough in their pictures . " " We think they arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right . " " They ought to be , " said Aunt Emmy . " The Fanshawes never lacked smartness , whatever else they lacked , and your father was a bright man . Well , I 've seen Jeremiah 's and Min nie 's . Boy and girl . Do n't laugh at me , because it does n't seem possible , but Jeremiah makes a good father . I never could get on with children  --  you ought to know that if anyone does ? but I think they 'll amount to some- thing . Well , it 's time the family was getting some sense again . " " Aunt Emmy ! " said Tom Carroll , protestingly . " Was this a happy house ? " said Aunt Emmy , fiercely . " For me it was yes because I grew up in it . And I always had Louise and I do n't regret anything . But was it happy for your mother and you ? You know it was n't , and a good thing your father took her out of it , adventurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back . Well , we did our duty according to our lights . But that was n't enough . There 's no real reason , you know , why families have to get that way , except they seem to . But they will get to thinking they 're God Almighty , and , after a while , that gets taken notice of . I 'll say this  --  it was n't the money with us . We held up our heads with it or without it . But maybe we held them too stiff . " She sank into a brooding silence . Behind her in the curlier the vague shadows of innumerable Pyes and Merritts seemed to gather and mingle and wait . After a while she roused herself . " Where are you going to live , Tommy ? " she said . " I 've been thinking about a place in the country sometime , " said Tom Carroll . " If Waynesville were a little different ? " Aunt Emmy shook her head . " You could n't come back here , Tommy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's just as well . But , if you 're going to build your own house , you 'd better do it soon . You wo n't be happy without it  --  you 've got too much Merritt in you . The Merritts made their own places . It was the Pyes that sat on the eggs till finally they tried to hatch chickens out of a doorknob , because it was easier than looking for a new roost . But you have n't much Pye . All the same , you wo n't be contented till you 've got some roots put down . The Fanshawes , they could live in a wagon and like it , but the Bouverins were like the Merritts  --  when they 'd rambled enough , they cleared ground . And Claire looks a lot more Bouverin than Fanshawe to me , whether she likes it or not . " " I did n't know you knew Claire 's family , " said Tom Carroll . " She probably would n't tell you , " said Aunt Emmy . " Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanshawe , a peaked little slip of a child , at Anna Bouverin 's funeral , just before they left Bradensburg . The coffin was still open , and some ignoramus or other thought it would be fitting for all the grandchildren to come and kiss their grandmagood-by . Mind you , after they 'd said good-by to her once already , before she died . I could have told them better , little as I know children . Well , it did n't make much difference to Hattie ; she always had the nerves of an ox . But Claire was just over typhoid and after they made her do it she had what I 'd call a shaking chill , in a grown person . And yet , they made her get up and recite the Twenty-Third Psalm in front of everybody  --  just because she was smart for her age , and a little child shall lead them . Her mother did n't stop them  --  too proud of her knowing it , I guess . But that was the Fanshawe of it  --  they had to playact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " She never told me , " he said . " She never told me at all . " " No ? " said Aunt Emmy , looking at him sharply . " Well , she was young and maybe she forgot it . I imagine Hattie did . " " Claire never has , " said Tom Carroll . " Well , " said Aunt Emmy , " I 'll tell you something , Tommy . When you get to my age you 've seen life and death . And there 's just one thing about death , once you start running away from the thought of it , it runs after you . Till finally you 're scared even to talk about it and , even if your best friend dies , you 'll forget him as quick as you can because the thought 's always waiting . But once you can make yourself turn around and look at it  --  it 's different . Oh , you ca n't help the grief . But you can get a child so it is n't afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take a longer while . " " Tell me , " said Tom Carroll in a low voice , " were there  --  very sweet flowers ? when my mother died ? " " It was just before Easter , " said Aunt Emmy softly . " You could smell the flowers all through the house . But we did n't have any play-acting , " she added , quickly . " Not with you . Melrose had that bee in his bonnet , but Louise put her foot down . But it 's hard to explain to a child . " " It 's hard to explain anyway , " said Tom Carroll . " That 's true , " said Aunt Emmy . " It 's a queer thing , " she said . " I never smell lilac without thinking of Lucy Marshall . She was a friend of mine , and then we fell out , and when we were young we used to play by a lilac bush in her yard . It used to trouble me for a long time before I put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then . " " Yes . The pain goes out when you know , " said Tom Carroll . " It 's not knowing that makes you afraid . " " If Hattie was closer to her , she could do it , " said Aunt Emmy . " But the way things are ? " " It 'll have to be me , " said Tom Carroll . " And I do n't know how . " " Well , you 're fond of her , " said Aunt Emmy . " They say that helps . " She rose . " I 'll give you the candlesticks in the morning , Tom . " " Ca n't I leave them with you , Aunt Emmy ? " " What 's the use ? " said Aunt Emmy practically . " To tell you the truth , Tommy , I 'd got right tired of shining them . Besides , they 'll look well in your house , when you get your house .

Over the field and over the water he went And wept for the sorrow of the world : The magic has left the rocks and left the trees . Nothing is left to the weary heart .

And he walked to the shore and leaned upon the water , But the stars in the sea were torn by the winds of the world . Beautiless and curled Rose the weeds in the water .
