There were so many " ayes " that observers were surprised when the strength of the opposition was announced . Representative Byrns , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , stated that , including the $5,000,000 cut by the Senate from the Interior Department bill , a total - of slightly more than $27,000,000 had been cut from the President 's budget estimates .

" It is foolish and silly , " one member said , " for there is no possible way to attain that saving and expect those departments to function . If the cut is approved , however , and a similar adjustment made on the other appropriation bills sent to the Senate , there will be no necessity for the Economy Committee to carry on . More than enough to balance the budget will have been secured . " The Jones resolution , to create the larger economy committee of nine members proposed by President Hoover , met with derision in the House .
