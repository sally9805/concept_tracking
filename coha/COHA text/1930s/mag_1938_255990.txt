( See color page following ' ) <P> A country has to be lived in and died in for a long time before evidences of its culture accumulate , gain currency and become distinguished . The arts are among those evidences , and for 150 years U. S. citizens have been asking themselves if and when the arts of the U. S. , as such , would add another noble tradition to the world 's stock . This week in Paris , at the long , two-story Jeu de Paume Museum in the Tuileries Gardens , some earnest people from Manhattan are putting the finishing touches on the most elaborate demonstration ever made in Europe that that tradition is now available . <P> Meditated for six years by the directors of Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , this exhibition differs significantly from the great exhibition of British art now on view at the Louvre ( TIME , March 14 ) . It is neither blessed nor ornamented by any authority of the U. S. Government beyond the routine sponsorship of Ambassador William C. Bullitt . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures and 80 prints , the exhibition includes probably the biggest historical show of native and derivative U. S. architecture ever displayed , an important collection of photographs , and an exhibition of stills and reels illustrating the development of the cinema , a U. S. art if there ever was one . Frenchmen , who first discovered esthetic importance in U. S. films , will find the Keystone Cops the most familiar part of the show . <P> For French followers of painting , the exhibition of U. S. oils and watercolors is designed to be an enlightenment . It may well prove to be one in several respects . From the body of U. S. folk art , which nobody even in the U. S. paid much attention to until a generation ago , there are 17 paintings . Also largely unfamiliar or forgotten in Europe are many of the choice 18th and 19th Century paintings . It is in the 20th Century section of the show , however , that Parisians will find an interest which the British Exhibition at the Louvre conspicuously lacks . <P> Man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhibition called " Paintings for Paris . " The eminent artists invited had been allowed to send their own choices . The show as a whole was a dud , unrepresentative , swank and dull . Nothing better indicates the quality of the Paris exhibition than the fact that of 46 paintings shown last autumn only five are among the 120 contemporary pictures now in Paris . And nothing shows better the character of the man chiefly responsible for the exhibition . <P> A.
