txt In reading the memorandum of the French Government on disarmament , just sent to the League of Nations , one has to distinguish between the facts set forth and the inferences drawn . In general , the position taken is very like that laid down by M. DOUMERGUE , just before he retired from the Presidency of the Republic . It is that France is perfectly willing to reduce  - -  Ermaments  --  in fact , has since the war made a great cut in her own  --  but that she can not neglect the question of national security . This is the ghost which has haunted France for more than a hundred years , and her people can not be blamed for still fearing it . In the official statement just delivered at Geneva by the French Government , there is a full and apparently frank and accurate report of the present strength of the French Army and Navy , along with the auxiliary air forces . The French record the fact that they have welcomed every agency and movement ' for the peaceful settlement of disputes between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the provisions of the Covenant of the League and of the Locarno Treaties to shorten the term of military service and in. other ways decrease their expenses in Treparation for a possible war of national defense . But they feel that , unless some further and more binding guarantee is given them , there is a limit beyond which they can not go with safety . What more do they ask ? It is set forth in their memorandum to the League . If there is to be a complete renunciation of war , with armed forces necessary only as a sort of police power , there must be international assurances which will warrant even weak and exposed nations in disarming . Nothing less will do than a universal treaty carrying the obligation to come instantly to the help of any nation attacked . This would mean , of course , a sharpening of the Briand-Kellogg treaty renouncing war as an instrument of national policy and putting into it precise and solemn pledges of the kind which the French request . It is an idea which has been stirring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address last year , referred to the demand for such an extension of the BriandKellogg treaty , and remarked , " I do " not say that some further step may " not some day come about . " The French now declare that it must come about quickly if there is to be success for the disarmament conference next year . They assert with much force , " Nothing but the cooperation of " each and every State in the organi " zation of peace can bring about any " real progress toward the limitation " and general reduction of arma " ments . " To this there is a corollary , to which the nations must more and more turn their thoughts . It is that " the notion of neutrality is inconsis " tent with the real interdependence " which binds States more and more " closely together . " If it is known that in any future war there will be no neutrals , it would make assurance doubly sure that there will be no future war .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
