ADVENTURES OF A YOUNG MAN-John Dos Passos-Harcourf , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> Critics generally have praised John Dos Passos ' trilogy , 1919 , The 42nd Parallel , The Big Money ( now published in one volume as U. S. A. ) . Leftist critics have pointed to it with pride as a dramatization of Marxist theory . " It is Dos Passos , " said Communist Critic Granville Hicks , " that has shown the Marxist way . . . . There is no apparent obstacle to his continued growth . . . . " <P> Two years ago the American Writers ' Congress overwhelmingly voted The Big Money best novel of the year . That was on June 6 . Three weeks later , Dos Passos ' name was mud with the Marxists . His heresy : an article called Farewell to Europe , damning " the intricate and bloody machinery of Kremlin policy " in Spain , thanking heaven that " the Atlantic is a good wide ocean . " <P> This week Dos Passos published a book that bids fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists are concerned . Adventures of a Young Man , first of an intended series of contemporary portraits , traces the evolution , in the ' 203 and ' 305 , of a middle-class radical . Sandy-haired , grey-eyed , idealistic Glenn Spotswood was brought up to be a Christian Gentleman . But his father was liberal enough to get fired from Columbia University for opposing U. S. entry into the War . Other radicalizers in Glenn 's young manhood were a good-humored rebel chum ; a freshman roommate hipped on the Law of Moses and Henry George 's single tax ; a picturesque Wobbly pal in the Northwest wheatfields one summer ; a sociology instructor who took him along when he moved to a professorship at Columbia . <P> At college , what Glenn learns in extracurricular sex and socialism is not the stock stuff of left-wing propaganda novels . Seduced by a friend 's Communist wife , who says he represents " the confused ignorant masses of America , " he is brought into the Party only indirectly-the Revolution offers an alternative to being driven crazy by her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn 's shattering experiences as a Red trade-union organizer in a Southern coal strike ( resembling that of Harlan County in 1931 ) . When two deputies are shot , mass arrests hit both the Red union and its rival . Glenn , who is nearly killed by vigilantes , urges a united-front defense . But Comrade Silverstone , of Manhattan , sneers : " There 's too much of the artist in you , Sandy . " Silverstone says they will take care of their own comrades , let the others , who are " politically undeveloped , " take care of themselves . Their own comrades get 20 years , are shot trying to escape . Few days later the Party changes its line , decides on a united-front policy , and too late woos the rival union . <P> Besides getting Glenn expelled from the Party for questioning decisions , Comrade Silverstone steals Glenn 's mistress . Glenn 's final disillusionment comes in Spain , where he goes to fight with the Loyalists . Again Comrade ( now Commissar ) Silverstone pops up , this time contrives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
