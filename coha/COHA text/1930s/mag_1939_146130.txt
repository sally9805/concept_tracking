Couple of months ago , after 14 years ' absence from the stage , John Barrymore , 57 , four times married , took to the road in a play burlesquing his matrimonial life , My Dear Children . One of the " children " was Elaine Barrie , 24 , Barrymore 's latest wife . <P> Soon the Barrymores ' acting gave strong hints of their home life . With gusto John shouted at Elaine such stage lines as " You damned selfish brat . " In the play he spanked her harder , she fanged his wrist more savagely , than was necessary . <P> Fortnight ago their quarrel burst like a boil : Elaine quit the show in a spuming huff . A few days later , performing before Omaha 's highbusted Drama League , John was royally pickled . Up &; down traveled his voice , to a bull-like bellow , to a bird-like whisper . Scandalized were Omaha 's great ladies when he ad-libbed such lines as " Albert , you look like a pregnant string bean . " Afterwards Barrymore 's press-agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Concurred the Drama League 's lady president : " He must have been very , very , VERY tired . " <P> Two days later Barrymore filed suit in New York 's Supreme Court for a separation from his wife . He also demanded from his wife , her mother , Mrs. Edna Jacobs , and their " confidential adviser " an accounting of $300,000 of his funds which he alleges they secured from him in money and property over a course of time . At week 's end the defendants had not filed an answer to either suit .
