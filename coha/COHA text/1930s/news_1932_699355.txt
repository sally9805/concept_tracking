txt Members of the banking group that has been lending the city money assured Acting Mayor yesterday that the city 's obligations through January would be met through new loans to be made available today and at subsequent dates as the need arises . With those assurances the city will clear the first hurdle in financing its obligations for the next six weeks . The financial crisis faced by the city eight days ago was dissolved when the bankers agreed on Dec. 7 to lend enough money for the city to meet all its obligations up to today . Under the terms of the $151,000,000 revolving credit agreement if the city met those obligations and kept up its sinking funds the bankers were to advance $74,000,000 additional on Dec. 15 . Although the Board of Estimate is still powerless to carry out its $40 , - 000,000 budget-reduction program until the Legislature gives it power to reduce salaries , the bankers are going ahead with their loans in the expectation that this pledge will be kept . Mr. was in touch with the bankers several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that the loans would continue . Against Temporary Cut . Corporation Counsel Arthur J. W. Hilly apprised the Acting Mayor during the day that a plan for a fouryear moratorium on teachers ' mandatory salary increases was under consideration at the special session of the Legislature in Albany . He asked Mr. to ascertain how the bankers felt about that plan . After conversing with Charles E. Mitchell , chairman of the National City Bank , Mr. reported that the bankers were opposed to any such moratorium . Explaining their attitude , he said : " Bankers feel that any such moratorium would be a distinct detriment to their goal of restoring the confidence of the investing public in city securities . Investors buy city bonds not for two or four years , but for ten , twenty and forty years . The moratorium plan indicates that teachers ' salaries will return to their present status rather than becoming the objects of a permanent economy . No one knows the duration of the depression , and the bankers feel that it would be in the best interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Board of Estimate committed itself in two resolutions to save $20 , - 000,000 in salaries next year and $20 , - oomoo additional in other sources of expense . Until the Legislature gives the city power over ; mandatory salaries , however , the board 's hands are tied . The Acting Mayor said he did not yet know how the remaining $20,000,000 would be saved , adding that the Beard of Estimate would make that decision . Banks Keep Close Check . Mr. made it clear that the bankers would not be satisfied with resolutions alone . Through advancing loans from time to time the bankers are keeping close check on the good faith of the city administration , and the same practice will continue after Mayor-elect John P. O'Brien takes office , on Jan. 1 . The agreement made by the bankers a week ago covers the city 's needs through the close of business tonight . Today 's operations will wind ' up the first portion of the credit transactions agreed to on Dec. 7 . ' All the $151,000,000 of borrowings made during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up last January by a syndicate of banks headed by J. P. Morgan &; Co. having been repaid out of the proceeds of loans extended by the Chase National Bank and the National City Bank , a fresh credit of $74,000,000 will become available today from the Morgan group . Members of this group were notified yesterday that the city would draw against the full amount of this credit today on 5si per cent revenue bills maturing April 26 . The proceeds of the $74,000,000 credit will at once be used to repay a part of last week 's borrowings from the Chase and the National City Banks . leaving a balance of about $36,000,000 unpaid . This balance will be prorated among a new banking group , including the City , . the Chase , Morgan , New York Trust , Bankers Trust , Bank of the Manhattan Company and the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company , which will advance the funds on paper also maturing April 26 . According to the plan agreed to by the bankers last week , if the city carries out its promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements during this month , amounting to $34,000,000 , will also be covered by the bankers by loans maturing on April 26 . This will make total maturities of $144,000,000 on that date . The city 's January needs , which , if the city obtains the funds from the State that it expects to get , will amount to only $16,000,000 net , will be covered under the plan by loans maturing on May 15 . " Ultimatum " Is Denied . Representatives of the city 's bankers protested yesterday against the charge that they had " demanded " any specific action of the Legislature . They said that the bankers had been asked to express their views on the proposed " pay Minatorium " and had responded that in their opinion any arrangement which limited the proposed salary cuts ' to a definite period , whether two years , four years or ten years , would fail of the desired effect upon the market for city bonds . ? In the last analysis , the- bankers said , the problem of the city 's finances is dependent upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bankers can not go on indefinitely tying up the funds entrusted to them in shortterm loans which can not be refunded . An arrangement whereby salary cuts were to be automatically restored after a specific length of time would scarcely be reassuring the investors in bonds who consider the long-term prospects , not merely the immediate ones . No one can say positively , they remarked , that two years from now the real estate situation in New York City will be sufficiently cleared up so that the city can be assured of sufficient returns from its real estate taxes to make the economies now needed no longer necessary . In taking this stand , the bankers emphasized , they had no intention of laying down an " ultimatum . " They were asked for their opinion as financiers and they gave it . Reports that the bankers had given the Legislature notice that if it did not act within a specified time they would withdraw their support from the city were denied . Teachers Explain Position . While the fight over teachers ' salaries centred in Albany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explained their attitude toward pay-cuts in a radio address last night over WOR . Pointing out that education had expanded because of the depression , he said those who wished to cut teachers ' salaries were proceeding upon an incorrect economic principle . Instead of cutting teachers ' any , he said , the city administration should economize in other ways . including the elimination of waste in city departments . Emphasizing the importance of retaining State protection of school salaries , he said : " If then ; teachers are assured of the continuance of the mandatory statute wnieh the bankers and the Board of li.:stimate want repealed , we can give consideration to the question of a reduction in pay by the Legislature without affecting the purpose of the mandatory statute . It is important that the public understand that the teachers are not assuming a dog-in-the-manger attitude . We claim to be good citizens , and perhaps a lot better than the common garden variety of politician that carries on a parasitic existence on the body politic " Cutting money from education would mean increased overcrowding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and pupils . he said . He suggested that the money required by the city could be obtained through income tax legislation and other means . Repeal of mandatory salary legis , lation would spell disaster to the public schools and lead to political interference in education , Dr. Nickolaus L. Engelhardt of Teachers College , Columbia University declared last night in an address before a faculty-student conference group in Teachers College Hall . " The present salary schedule , " he said , " was formulated after careful study and was designed to serve both as a stimulus and a reward to New York City teachers , for a relatively long period of time . It has served , and is still serving , as a big incentive to professional improvement in service , and accounts in no small measure for the high professional standards of New York City teachers . " Legally and constitutionally education is a State function . Moreover , it is one of the few functions of government wgich has been kept relatively free from graft and corruption . The recent revelations of the inefficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more imperative that education be safeguarded from such gross mismanagement . " The financial saving which would be possible through repeal should be effected through a reorganization and improvement in municipal government . To penalize children instead of attacking waste and corruption in government is not only shortsighted but vicious . " The board of directors of the Fifth Avenue Association voted approval yesterday of Governor Roosevelt 's action in calling upon the special legislative session to initiate charter revision for the city . The directors held that permanent tax relief depended upon speedy reorganization of the framework of city government .
