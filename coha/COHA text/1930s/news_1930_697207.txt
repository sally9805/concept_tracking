txt The recent violent fall in prices on the Stock Exchange , carrying even the " selected averages " down about 15 per cent from the high point of April , caused the usual outburst of dismay in speculative circles . But it was noticeable that nobody interpreted the break as necessarily foreshadowing an equivalent decline of business activities . Wall Street itself merely pointed out , by way of explanation , that prices as measured by the " averages " had been advanced 21 per cent in the year 's earlier weeks , although the course of business activities had been disappointing during all that period , and although a great part of the Autumn break in stock market prices had been recovered before the present year began . It is impossible , however , that such incidents should not somewhat impair the public 's faith in the old tradition that the stock market 's variations indicate accurately the future course of trade and industry . There were good reasons for that tradition .

It is true that , even then , the stock market was surrounded by a host of haphazard speculators and tipsters , who concerned themselves little with the larger economic currents but bought only because the market " seemed likely to go up , " and sold on the opposite idea . But it used to be only occasionally , and at reasonably long intervals , that this sort of random speculation would so far overtop the genuine investment operations as to drive Stock Exchange prices in a direction opposite to what visible trade conditions indicated . That certainly happened in 1902 . It happened even in the early months of 1920 ; but it resulted almost invariably , as it apparently resulted in the early part of the present year , from the fact that money rates were very low and that facilities for promoting speculation could be obtained on easy terms .

But that kind of " discounting " has always been recognized as hazardous . Applied in the longer past , it would have put up the price of railway shares in 1885 to measure the railway situation of 1900 and 1901 , though the long list of railway insolvencies of 1893 and 1894 lay between . As for the present business outlook , it is likely for the present to be judged by other indices than a season 's violent alternations of rising and falling prices on the Stock Exchange .
