Since the middle of this waning football season , Californians have suspected that Coach Leonard ( " Stub " ) Allison had a great football team at the University of California . Gauge of the fact was that California used only 14 plays , most of them power plays , yet so well executed and so well mixed by pot-bellied Quarterback John Meek that they remained effective . Key man of the California team is six-foot four-inch All-America Centre Bob Herwig , who snaps the ball unerringly , runs fast interference , and backs up the line on defense . Most likely California All-America this year is Halfback Sam Chapman . He is the best punter in the Pacific Coast Conference , a good passer and runner , a fearless ankle-tackler . On the defense Centre Herwig receives sterling support from Guard Claude Evans , one of the most dangerous tacklers in the nation . A possible team weakness is on pass defense , where the backfield is occasionally fooled . California came last week to its annual game with Stanford , having decisively won all its games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most erratic team on the Pacific Coast , still had a chance to win the right to play on New Year 's day in the Rose Bowl by suddenly emerging in one of its " hot " spells . During the first period 85,000 fans shivered in the rain as the teams tentatively tired each other out . In the second period California 's " Thunder Team " started rumbling . On two sustained drives , it carried over two successive touchdowns . They were enough . California won 13-to-0 and assured itself of the New Year 's Day game-probably with Alabama . <P> By reason of its star , Clint Frank , and a season without defeat , Yale was top-heavy favorite to whip Harvard , which had been beaten by Dartmouth and Army . The equalizing factor was that Harvard had beaten Princeton , and the only thing Harvard would rather do than beat Yale or Princeton is beat them both . It had not done so since 1915 . Harvard drew first blood in the second quarter when Ray Daughters caught a forward pass and shook off two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got moving , and the great Frank bounced off the Yale line to tie the score . But with seven minutes to play , Harvard 's Francis Foley faked a smash at tackle and scuttled ten yards around end for a touchdown . Harvard 's season was successful , 13-to-6 . <P> If not the most important of traditional football rivalries , certainly the longest geographically is that formed seven years ago between St. Mary 's of California &; Fordham of New York . This year St. Mary 's football season was spoiled by money troubles , and Fordham had been tied only by Pittsburgh . As expected , Fordham bruised and bumped St. Mary 's all over the field , three times scored touchdowns that were called back . In the third period Joe Woitkoski finally scored the one that beat St. Mary 's , 6-to-0 . <P> Pop Warner 's Temple team took its worst thumping since he became coach five years ago . Unbeaten Villanova trampled them , 33-to-0 . <P> Minnesota , twice defeated in non-con-ference play ( by Nebraska and Notre Dame ) , again clinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
