txt Non-cumulative preferred stocks generally , and utility stocks in particular , stand to benefit marketwise if Congress adopts a stiff tax on undistributed earnings in lieu of present corporate income and capital stock levies . Somewhat paradoxically , the proposed legislation would seem to put a further premium on switching from long-term federal government bonds , generally not exempt from surtaxes. into municipal bonds , which are exempt from all federal taxes A further prospect is that the investment ; position of all senior securities would be weakened . Thus tan New Deal , which has already struck one heavy blow at savings by devaluing the dollar , would strike another by preventing accumulation of " rainy day " reserves such as have enabled many corporatlnn. to maintain tend interest and pretcrred dil-tleptts - Ihrough previous depressions . Common Holders Generally Control Heretofore , non-cumulative preferred stocks have been regarded in Wall Street as unlikely to pay dividends very far in advance of declaraLions on the common . That is because control of most companies lies in the common stocks , 1 and it is to the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up the company until such time as it is able to pay dividends on all issues of stock . Of course . if the preferred stock dividends are cumulative at a rate far in excess of prevailing money rates , or the rate the company is earning on its undistributed cash . that is a different matter . It explains why , generally speaking , dividends on cumulative preferred stocks are resumed more promptly after a depression than hose on non : cumulative issues . I Under the plan to tax undistributed corporate earnings , the stockholders of a corporation having a non-cumulative preferred stock issue would face the alternative of paying whatever earnings were available to the holdera of that issue , up to the amount of their preference , or of paying somewhere between 27 , - . and 40 see of those earnings to Uncle Sam for the privilege of retaining the balance in the company 's treasury . In the case of United States Rubber Co for example . if the proposed tax had been in effect last year and the company had earned the 52,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either have to pay an amount which might run as high as $800.000 as tax on that undistributed amount . or else pay the $2,000 000 to holders of its SO , noncumulative preferred stock . In no case could the common stockholders get a penny until the year 's dividend payments of $8 a share on the 690.000 shares of non-cumulatiev preferred had been made . Status of Utility Common Stocks Utility common stocks , particularly those of holding companies , would seem to be the beneficiaries of the new tax program , due to the fact that the President 's proposal is to repeal the present corporation income tax at the same time the new tax on undistributed corporation earnings is imposed . It is estimated that the electric power and light industry will have to pay the government , undet present rates of income taxes . more than $60.000.000 on last year 's earnings . Under the new program that entire amount would be saved to them . As for the tax on undistributed earnings . most utilities have been paying nearly all , or a very substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate increase in their dividend disbursements would be necessary to make them practically exempt from the tax on undistributed earnings . Thus stockholders would stand to bentfit immediately both from the increased amounts available for dividends as a result of repeal of present corporation income taxes , and from distribution of the small fraction heretofore held back by the companies . The calculations are theoretical , of course , and it would not be at all impossible for state regulatory bodies to decide that any such savings in federal income tax payment . ' must be passed on to consumers in the form of rate reductions . Might Switch Into Municipals Suppositious adverse effect of the program on the government bond market is based on two or three considerations . First is that insofar as the levies on undistributed earnings tended to boost wealthy individual 's income into higher and higher surtax brackets it would make them more interested in the savings re-seerbaities , which already exist in some cases , in Nu-aching from U. S Government bonds , v.-hich are generally speaking exempt only from normal taxes . into municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt if held in the state which issued them In other words , a man with a surtax net income of $100.000 a year from government bonds and $100.000 a year from dividends might not think it worth while , comparative interest rates and quality of investment considered , to switch from those government bonds into municipals. but if the proposed law resulted in doubling his dividend income , giving him a total surtax net income of $300,000 , the fact that he would have to pay a 4 ? , h.elier rate of surtax on the income between $200,000 and $300 000 than on the income between 5100.000 and 5200.000 might be just enough to tip the scale in favor of substituting municipal bonds for S Governments . If he sold his governments . which were yielding him $100,000 a year . and replaced them , with municipals costing and yielding exactly the same as the governments they displaced , the top $100,000 of his total surtax net income would then be subject to the rate applicable in the $100,000 to $200,000 range . rather than that for the $200.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year in taxes A much simpler reason for switching from U S. government bonds to municipals. in event of adoption of some such tax program as advocated by the President Tuesday . probably has already been discussed by a good many corporation executives . If a corporation purchased ' municipal bonds out of net income earned after enactment of such a law as has been proposed , ? it would , of course , have to pay a tax averaging 33 1-3 ' , on the profits thus held back from , stockholders . But if a corporation with , say , $10,000 000 cash in the banks . should now purchase that amount of municipal bonds , or should ' already have them in its treasury , there seems : little doubt that it could allow the interest on them accumulate indefinitely without incurring any federal tax . Effect on Common Holders The proposed tax . as thus far revealed , probably would not drive any common stockholders ' - into municipal bonds . for the reason that in the great majority of cases the effect of re- , peal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be far out- weighed by probable increases in dividends. : Obviously the fact that the increased dive- I dends might incur a higher surtax rate than present dividend income would not cause any ? selling of common stocks either , because even , if Uncle Sam took 75'U ? of additional dividends. ; the stockholder would still be the gainer , in so far as current income is concerned , by the 25'e that was left Preferred stocks of investment merit , how-I ever , and bonds generally would be adversely affected by any legislation that might hate a tendency to prevent accumulation of surpluses which might be drawn on in bad times to continue preferred dividends and interest while earnings were too small to do it . Since bondholders have nothing to gain and everything to lose as a result of such legislation , life insurance companies and banks , which are the big holders of bonds . probably will have a good deal to say about the proposal before Congress is through with it . That is quite apart from the possible adverse effect of a tax on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely . in their case . The holder of preferred stocks of investment merit is even worse off than the bondholder because he not only appears likely to have his investment position weakened , and he is not only precluded from sharing in the increased dividend disbursements which are indicated for common stocks generally , but he faces the same additional 4ee tax as common stockholders if the normal tax exemption of corporate dividends is repealed . Non-Cumulative Preferred Stocks The one type of security which seems likely not only to share in the increased disbursements to common stockholders , but to benefit ahead of some of them , is the ugly duckling non-cumulative preferred stock . To be sure , the proposed law should speed up liquidation of arrearages on cumulative preferreds , but their holders have always had some assurance that if their company ever did come back they would get all that was coming to them for their years of waiting . Holders of non-cumulative preferredes the other hand , have had to be content with the knowledge that if the company ever got around to paying anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the same time , for the same year only . Some state courts have tried to give holders of non-cumulative preferreds a better break , and so have some companies . but in general their position has been that they could expect nothing in bail ernes , and little in good times unless their company was so prosperous as to make the common stockholders favor paying non-cumulative preferred dividends in order to permit simultaneous payment of common dividends to themselves . Selling prices of non-cumulative preferreds have long reflected this . Whereas cumulative preferred stocks customarily recover in price ahead of the junior shares after a severe depression , just as bonds recover ahead of the preferred stocks Junior to them , non-cumulative preferreds often command comparatively little premium over the common stocks junior to them , even though they are entitled to dtvdends of $4 a yea , or more before the common stock can be paid anything .
