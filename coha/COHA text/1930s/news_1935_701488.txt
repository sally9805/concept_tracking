txt The Schools and the Moral Code . Your report of the address of Archbishop of Cincinnati , delivered at the Cleveland Eucharistic Congress , carries an attack on American public education which includes the following : " The schools by excluding a fixed code of morality have done more to break it down than any other agency in the country . Logically the exclusion of the moral code from the schools has meant either its complete or partial rejection in the home , in the nation and in the churches . " This will be resented by all members Of the teaching profession in which adherents of all creeds are giving honorable and indispensable service ; and it will be at once contrasted with the declaration of ex-Governor Smith In 1927 , " I believe in the support of the public school as one of the cornerstones of American liberty . " TALCOTT MINER BANKS . Williamstown , Mass. , Sept. 24 , 1935.
