Defenders of the Alands <P> Sweden 's aged King Gustaf , who mortally fears Soviet Russia , was having the Communist jitters again last week . Last month the League of Nations took U. S. S. R. into its fold of respectability ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) . Straightway King Gustaf , by no complicated chain of associations , thought of the Aland Islands . The Aland Archipelago in the elbow of the Baltic Sea separating Sweden and Finland is the ticklish spot in Sweden 's naval strategy . Overlooking the harbor of Stockholm , the Alands are some 300 sandy , stony little islands and one big one . They are full of Swedes but , after 600 years of being passed around among Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Russia , they now belong to Finland .

Then , worse than now , King Gustaf had Communist nightmares . He feared that Finland might turn Red any day . The best he could do was to force young Finland to destroy all the great Russian forts on the Aland Islands . Thus , the Alands were no help to him but neither were they a menace . Since then , however , agrarian Finland has proved its right to Gustaf 's confidence by showing itself thoroughly antiCommunist . Finland was no threat last week but what of emboldened Soviet Russia ? The form Gustaf 's fear took was that Russia may some day seize the unfortified Aland Islands , thus irreparably separating Sweden and Finland . Swedish generals agreed last week that it had indeed been a bad blunder to destroy the Aland forts in 1922 . It would be wise , they thought , to pay Finland to rebuild them .

After the last Tsar abdicated and Kerensky took over , Mannerheim went home to Finland in disgust , just in time to pull together a White Army and beat off the Bolsheviks . In May 1918 , he rode into Helsingfors at the head of his victorious troops . Inevitably he was made Regent of the new Government , for then Finland had an idea it would turn to a monarchy . When it switched to a republic , he quit . When King Gustaf forced Finland to destroy the Aland forts , General Mannerheim was pained as a strategist , as a true monarchist and as a loyal Finn .
