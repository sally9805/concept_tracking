THE DISCOVERIES and achievements of a legion of great scientists , inventors , and engineers are the basis of the power industry . Upon this foundation there has been built up by natural growth , to meet demands upon the industry , a complex organism of engineering , law , finance , construction , operation , ratemaking , merchandising , accountancy , and public relations . A full-rounded organization in a large electric light and power business requires specialists in all these various fields , directed by the necessary executive departments , so that their individual work may be welded into one successful whole . It is indeed unfortunate that the industry should at any time become a matter of political consideration any more than any other industry , notwithstanding that it is " affected with a public interest . " This " public interest , " which is one of mutual interdependence , is usually taken care of by the cooperation of the industry and the public , except when agitation of one kind or another disturbs the relationship . The industry as a whole favors regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its outstanding leaders recommended to the National Electric Light Association that " Public control of charge for service , based on cost plus a reasonable profit , and eliminating the factor of competition , is the proper safeguard for the interests of users , taxpayers , and investors . " * Recognizing that competition in public service is an economic waste , and therefore that monopoly of service is best for the user in the long run , the industry is more than satisfied to have its rates criticized and approved by a regulatory body representing the public ? a regulatory body which appreciates its responsibilities both to consumers and to investors in the industry . The industry also recognizes the protection this regulation gives to these investors . It is always satisfied , therefore , with rates which provide for the necessary operating charges , depreciation , and a rate of return on the money  | invested in the property that will continue to attract investors . It is important to remember that only through its ability to attract investors can the industry continue to provide adequate facilities to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While it is true that the industry enjoys a monopoly in rendering service , it certainly does not have a monopoly in securing money in the markets of the world . If it does not have a good credit standing , it can not secure money except at excessive rates , which must necessarily be reflected both in its ability to provide service and in the rates the consumer must pay for it . The only way the industry can have a good credit standing is by showing earnings proportionate to the investment in it , and these earnings can come only through the rates it charges . If these are fair , the interests of both consumer and investor are protected . The consumer receives the best service in ample quantity to meet his every demand , and the investor is assured of a reasonable return upon his investment and the safety of his principal . Since most discussions of the industry are directed toward rates , it is inevitable that the public 's regulatory commissions should come in for their share of consideration . In the early days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predisposition for rate cutting . Many of them had no knowledge of the industry , and few had ever before been in a position to know what it means to try to safeguard the savings of thousands of thrifty people . Responsibility , however , made them more thoughtful . Their prejudices became tempered with knowledge and reason . On the question of rates they discovered that commissioners , no less than the industry 's executives , must be governed by general economic conditions , and that these are in no way affected by prejudices . To their credit , they had the courage , in the dark days of the Great War , to increase rates in spite of the always present and universal desire to get something for less money . Their growing knowledge of the industry showed them that this was the only way , in such times , to protect the user so that he would be assured of all the service he might need , and to convince the investor that his investment in the public service business was a good one and would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , including manufacturers and holding companies , marshaled its engineering financial , operating , and merchandising talent against economic conditions . This coalition of the regulatory bodies and the industry has brought remarkable results . While general commodity prices are now forty per cent higher than in 1913 , the average price of electric service has decreased twenty-five per cent . This is a saving that certainly went to the customers of the industry and not to its investors . The yearly production and distribution of electric units have increased from seventeen and one-half billions in 1913 to over eighty-seven and three-quarters billions . These latter figures would indicate that the question of rates is not an issue in the minds of the American public . It has been suggested that the original intent of the various regulatory laws has been changed by appeals to the courts , and that in this the electric power industry has its share of responsibility . Such appeals have been relatively few when compared with the number of decisions rendered by regulatory commissions . In the Middle West Utilities System ? now serving four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service ? I remember no case in its seventeen and onehalf years of life where it has appealed to the courts against a decision of any regulatory commission . It is sometimes charged that the accounting of the industry is so complicated as to befog the commissioners ? notwithstanding the fact that the classification of accounts under which the industry 's records are kept is one that was worked out between the Association of Commissioners and the National Electric Light Association . Reflections upon the industry are often supported by such unfair charges and by references to the intricacies of valuations , corporate structures , financial set-ups , and operating policies , and by impossible comparisons of rates under the most favorable conditions for capital expenditure and operating costs with those less favorable . Rate-making is not as simple a process as putting a price on a particular article . Rates are not comparable without a complete knowledge of all the factors which determine the rates to be compared . For example , comparisons are often drawn between the rates , and  | particularly household rates , of the Ontario Hydro-electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking ? and those of various privately owned and operated systems in the United States . The energy for the Ontario System is practically all generated by water power , and this is one reason why its rates can not be compared with a system whose energy has to be generated by steam from high-priced coal . Most hydro-electric plants have to make considerable capital outlays for water storage and reserve steam plants , on which interest has to be earned . Nature supplied reservoirs for the Ontario Hydro-electric Commission when , in the ice age , glaciers scooped out the Great Lakes in " which to store water for its largest plants . That capital cost nature amortized long ago . The public is not interested in academic discussions of valuation theories . What it is interested in is a fair valuation that takes into account all the necessary elements of value , giving to users reasonable rates for service , and to investors a fair return on their investment with assurance of the safety of their principal . Suppose that through any valuation of its property a power company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would the doubling of those rates be possible and thereby bring more income to the stockholders ? Certainly not . The power industry can not charge more than the service is worth , valuation or no valuation . Its largest and most valuable business comes from industrial plants , which pay the lowest rate . Furthermore , in supplying power to industrial plants , it is in competition with every other type of prime mover . If it raised its rates so that these industrial customers could generate their own power at lower costs , the power industry would lose the business . The interest charge in the power industry , which on the average investment is five to six dollars for every dollar of annual gross income , is one of its largest charges . If the cost of the money is figured on the basis of a net return of eight per cent , out of every dollar of income received forty to forty-eight cents goes for interest alone . Interest goes on all the time ? every hour out of the twenty-four . Industrial plants use large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while homes , in comparison , use little electricity and for only a few hours during the day . Those that use the facilities for the longest hours a day provide the most interest and are entitled to the lower rates . This does not mean that household rates for electric service are high in the United States . On the contrary , they are low when compared with other countries on comparable operating bases . During the past ten years our average household rate has decreased 13.8 per cent , and the average household use of electricity has increased 56.7 per cent . This latter figure certainly indicates that users as a whole are satisfied with present rates , for in order to use more energy they have had to make a considerable investment in labor-saving electric appliances for the home . The ambition of every far-sighted utility operator is not to get the highest possible rate for the service ; it is to sell the service at the lowest rate consistent with a good credit standing of the property in his charge . The literature and record of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been its policy . Under private operation the power business is run , and its rates are based , upon economic principles ; under political operation political expediency governs . In Ontario , under political operation , household rates are low ; industrial rates are high . In Quebec , under private operation , household rates are high ; industrial rates are low . Quebec outstrips Ontario in industrial development . That is the answer . The Toronto Street Railways , an industry , pays a higher rate for power to the Ontario Hydro Commission than the Montreal Street Railway pays to a privately operated company . Which system of charging is of the greatest ultimate benefit to all the people ? Rates based on economics , or rates based on politics ? One brings industrial development ; the other stifles it . One charges the householder a fair rate ; the other tries to make industry carry the householder . Householders vote ; factories do n't . But factories bring householders ; householders do n't bring factories . To be fair to the public in every way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of service should , as far as practicable , pay its particular cost for the service received . If it were not for the industrial business of the power industry , the rates to householders would be such that electricity would still be a  | great luxury to them . They would have to pay all the interest charges on facilities which they use very few hours a day . The operating companies of the power industry can not in most states issue securities without the authority of the regulating commission . It is fair to assume , therefore , that the securities of such companies fairly represent the cost of the company property . Notwithstanding this , rates under regulatory laws are not based upon the securities outstanding , but upon the value of the property used and useful for the public service . Therefore any discussion which connects rates with the security issues of the industry is not in accordance with the facts . A conservative method of financing an operating company would be with fifty per cent of bonds , twenty-five per cent of preferred stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the money by common stock seems a very easy task if that is all that is said . However , realizing that the total investment in the industry to-day is in the neighborhood of ten billion dollars , it means the raising of two and a half billions of equity money ? the money that takes the major risk in any industry and which is therefore entitled to the greatest return . In a regulated industry it not only takes the major business risk , but also the political risk . At all times , and particularly in the early days of a business or in times of a public investment consciousness as opposed to a speculative consciousness , the equity money is the hardest money to raise . It is the first money that has to be raised . It corresponds to the down payment on a home when it is mortgaged for the balance , or the first payment on an automobile , or any other installment payment transaction where the property is mortgaged in some form or other for the payment of the balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property . That is the position of the common stockholder , since all debts and obligations of the corporation come ahead of him in the final distribution of earnings or assets . In the early days of the power industry , the only plants that were reasonably well financed were those of the larger cities , and many of these none too well . The small town plants were dismal failures . Many of them gave service only from dusk to dawn , and practically none of them could take care of industrial business . They were usually financed locally . Little enough was subscribed to build the power station and distribution system , and if any enlargements or extensions were required , as a rule there was no way in which to finance them . In 1910 an experiment was conducted in Lake County , Illinois , of tying together electrically practically all the towns in the county . The inefficient small town plants were shut down , and the interconnected system was fed from an up-to-date , economical generating station capable of furnishing all the electric energy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time , day or night . The experiment was successful and epochal . It demonstrated that while capital investment ( and therefore interest and dividend charges ) were increased , operating expenses were so much less that the rates for service could be reduced . This , and twenty-four-hour operation , increased the use of the service so that the income per customer materially increased . It was the forerunner of the present network of transmission lines over the greater part of the country , bringing power to nearly every town and hamlet and to a rapidly increasing number of farms , until to-day there are few places where electric power is not available . This development , all brought about in the last twenty years , has required in that period over eighty per cent of the ten billion dollars invested in the industry , or eight billion dollars . The great problem was to provide the equity money , which on the formula for financing operating companies would be over two billion dollars . An operating company serving three or four hundred interconnected towns in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . The approximate total capital required would be sixty million dollars , of which fifteen millions should be in the equity , or common stock . The balance would be represented by preferred stock and bonds . The bonds could be sold to bankers , but the sale of the preferred stock might not be possible till the company had demonstrated its earning power . In such an event , even after the most liberal use of bonds , the organizers might find it necessary to supply twenty to twenty-five million dollars , and therefore have to take both preferred and common stock . To provide this they might form a second  | corporation to hold the stocks of the operating company , investing what money they themselves could furnish in the equity or common stock of this new corporation . For their further requirements they would sell to the public securities senior to theirs . In forming the second corporation they would have created a holding company , which might better have been named an " investment and supervising company . " Its money would be invested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect this investment , the holding company would supervise that company 's expenditures for construction and operation and lay down its business and financial policies . Let us follow this financing through , and assume that the operating company raised its sixty million dollars by issuing ( and receiving the prices mentioned ) $34,000,000 of six per cent fifty-year bonds to be sold at ninety-five ; $15,000,000 of seven per cent preferred stock at ninety-four ; and $14,250,000 of common stock just under ninety-five . It would have issued $63,25o,000 of securities . The bonds were sold to bankers , but the organizers had to purchase all the preferred and common stock . This purchase was financed through the newly formed holding company , requiring it to provide in cash $27,600,000 . Of this $27,600,000 , the original organizers provided $7,600,000 by buying 300,000 shares of the holding company 's non par common stock . Then $ro , 000,000 was raised by selling zo6,000 shares of $7 dividend non par preferred stock , and the other $ro , 000 , - 000 by selling $1o,600,000 of six per cent twenty-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all of the operating company 's preferred and common stock , both securities being sold at about ninety-four . The preferred and common stocks of the operating company , aggregating $29,250,000 , are now in the treasury of the holding company , and in their place it has issued $28,200 , - oco of its own securities . This is a substitution of securities , not an additional issue . Therefore , of the aggregated $9o,8go,000 securities issued , there are in the hands of the public , including the organizers , $34,000,000 of bonds of the operating company , and $10,600,000 collateral notes , $io , 000,000 preferred stock , and $7,600 , - oco of common stock of the holding company ? a total of $62,200,000 of securities . This is less than those issued by the operating company , due to the preferred and common stock of the holding company being non par and therefore figured in at the price the company received for them . The operating company is allowed an eight per cent return , or $4,800,000 on the $6o,000,000 value of its property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount ( which is not always the case ) . This pays its $2,040,000 of bond interest and $1 , o5o,000 of preferred dividends , leaving $I , 71o,000 which is used for reserves , amortization of security discounts , federal tax , common stock dividend , and surplus . Assume eight per cent is paid on the common stock . This takes $1,14o,000 , leaving $570,000 , of which assume $200,000 can be left in surplus . How have the security holders of the holding company fared ? Their company has received the preferred and common stock dividend from the operating company , aggregating $2,190 , - 000 , with which they have paid $636,000 inter- est on their collateral notes and $742,000 on their preferred stock , a total of $I , 378,000 , leaving $812,000 for expenses of the holding company , amortization of security discounts , federal tax , and to pay dividends on their $7,600,000 of common stock and provide a surplus . The total amount paid out in interest or dividends or used in the two corporations is $6,990,000 . Of this amount the $2,190,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operating company to the holding company , and in turn used to pay its security holders and for other purposes , is a substitution . The actual amount then paid out to the public or used in the companies is the original $4,800 , - 000 , representing the eight per cent return on the $6o,000,000 value of the physical property used and useful for the public service of the operating company . Of this amount $200,000 is left in the surplus account of the operating company . There surely is nothing mysterious about this whole typical case , and in no way has it been detrimental to the interests of the user public . In fact otherwise , for without the use of the holding company it might have been impossible to finance the operating company . A step further . A speculative public assumes that the market value of utility holding companies common stock is worth twenty-five times their earnings , and notes that this holding company 's 300,000 shares of common stock , including the $200,000 left in the surplus account of its subsidiary , are earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amortization , and so forth ? or about $2.70 a share ; and therefore bids $65.00 a share for the stock . The stock is on the holding company 's books at $25.33 a share , or $7,600,000 , so its market price is now over two and one-half times its book price , or an appreciation of $11,900,000 . In the meantime the holding company 's preferred stock has advanced on the market to $98.0o a share ? an appreciation of $388,000 . So the market value of the securities now in the hands of the public , instead of being $62,200 , - 000 , as issued , is $76,488,000 . The customers of the operating company , however , are , as they should be , still paying rates on the $6o,000,000 value of the property used and useful for their service . And yet there are those who discuss the laws under which the industry is regulated , and talk about rates being made to pay dividends on increased capitalization through holding companies and appreciated values of securities , which they should know is contrary to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the word ; it is a purely financial situation of a speculative character . The electric light and power holding company has been of immense public benefit . There is a very definite connection between it and the fact that an electric power supply of a metropolitan character in quality , quantity , and cost is now available practically anywhere .  | There has been a great deal written and said about a " Power Trust . " What is a " trust " : The Century Dictionary defines it as " a combination for controlling the production , price , etc. , of some commodity or the management , profits , etc. , of some business . " Regulation of the power industry provides for the quantity and quality of service , the rate for service , and the rate of return upon the money invested to provide the service . Therefore , if all the operating companies of the power industry were controlled by one immense holding company , there could still be no power trust as long as the operating companies were under regulation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interconnection , large and more economical generating stations , improved service , and lower rates is being applied to the country as a whole as was applied in a much smaller way in the Lake County experiment of nearly twenty years ago . It is not now the interconnection of small towns , but of large operating systems , fed from large superpower stations advantageously located and owned by one or more operating companies . It is also the interconnection of power stations of different operating companies so as to take advantage of the diversity in time of their respective loads , and thereby carry their combined loads on a lower investment . This all tends toward better service , less investment in plants , more efficient operating , and , in the finality , lower rates . It is advances of this kind which , in the minds of the uninformed , may have led them to the idea of a " Power Trust . " The results , however , are the antithesis of those usually to be attained by the public 's idea of a " trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity , quality , and cost of service .  |
