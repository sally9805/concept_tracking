Matt Mann , son of an English saloon keeper , learned to swim in the dirty streams below the woolen mills at Leeds , where the water dyed him blue one day , red the next . At 8 he was junior swimming champion of England , at 22 he went to the U. S. on a professional barnstorming tour . Robert Kiphuth was born &; bred in upstate New York , took all his exercise on land . At 22 he was a punctilious instructor in physical education at Yale . <P> Swimmer Mann could swim so well that he was hired to coach at Yale , Harvard , Syracuse , Navy and almost every athletic club that had a pool , finally took over swimming at the University of Michigan in 1926 . Instructor Kiphuth , in the meantime , had been expounding his theories on body-building with such success that he was appointed swimming coach at Yale . When the 1936 Olympic Games came around , Yale 's Kiphuth was named coach of a U. S. swimming team for the third time and his feat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proclaimed all over the land . <P> This did not please Michigan 's Mann . Nor did it please Michigan rooters , because while Yale had been piling up a notable record in the East , Michigan had won eight out of ten Big Ten championships , seven National Collegiate championships . <P> Yale , indeed , had defeated Michigan twice ( 1928 and 1930 ) during its long winning streak , but Michigan had more recently defeated Yale in intercollegiate meets . <P> Coach Mann , disgruntled over the nationwide ballyhoo given Yale 's invincibility , demanded a showdown . But Yale year after year had no open date on its schedule . This rebuff , although probably unintentional , precipitated one of the most publicized coaching feuds in collegiate history . Coach Kiphuth frankly disliked his aggressive Midwestern rival , saw no use for his mechanical rabbits and other training gadgets used to develop stamina and pace . Coach Mann looked with disdain on his Eastern rival who had taught himself to teach swimmers by watching others swim . <P> What annoyed Matt Mann most was the Kiphuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunt of sitting on the bottom of the Yale pool in a diving helmet to observe his pupils from underneath . <P> At long last , last week , Yale met Michigan at New Haven . In its magnificent Payne Whitney natatorium , Yale lined up a green but well-rounded team , which had chalked up nine victories and no defeats this season . Michigan 's team , also undefeated , was rated better . It included Tom Haynie , generally considered the best all-round college swimmer in the U. S. , and Ed Kirar , intercollegiate sprint champion . As might have been expected , Michigan won , but only after the score had been tied three times and finally clinched ( 41-to-34 ) in the very last event on the program when Michigan 's Haynie beat Yale 's Captain John Macionis by a touch in the anchor leg of the 400-yd. relay . <P> Matt Mann and Robert Kiphuth put on sports-photograph smiles and shook hands see cut . <P> * Yale was finally defeated by Harvard last March after 163 straight victories .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
