THE WHITE MONK OF TIMBUCTOO- William Seabrook-Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> Three years ago Traveler Seabrook told the U. S. something about Timbuctoo 's No. 1 Citizen . Pre Yakouba ; last week he published the old man 's informal but official biography . Written in Author Seabrook 's usual man-to-mannish style , The White Monk of Timbuctoo is a racily sympathetic account of an unusual career . Devout Catholics will read it , if at all , as a warning ; plain readers , as vicarious adventure . <P> Auguste Dupuis , known in his adopted city of Timbuctoo as Pre Yakouba , is an old ( 69 ) and somewhat remorseful man now . He was never pious . When he first went to Africa ( 1890 ) as a strapping young missionary he had already a quiet reputation as a priest who did not take his vows of celibacy very seriously . <P> But his genius for languages and for mixing with native Africans made him useful . He took to medieval Timbuctoo like a duck to water , sturdily resisted all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer to Palestine , he announced that the only Jew he had ever loved was Jesus . Biographer Seabrook plays down the spiritual Pre Yakouba 's spiritual labors in Timbuctoo but gives him high marks as a popular character . <P> But it was not long before his womanizing tendencies got him into trouble . The French officers stationed at the fort complained that he stole their women . When his superior died and Yakouba was next in line for a bishopric his unpriestly ways made the appointment impossible . He was recalled to Algiers . <P> Instead of obeying , Yakouba renounced the Church , dressed himself like a native and turned fisherman . Said he to Biographer Seabrook : " I quit the Church because I did n't want to leave Timbuctoo and did n't want to give up women . " A strapping Negress , Salama , gave him shelter , persuaded him not to be so melodramatic in his renunciation . <P> She made him settle down again , accept a civil job as interpreter . Salama got his first week 's pay , has managed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As head of the Arabic university , commandant of Goundam , interpreter in many a trial and on expeditions against the Tuaregs , Pere Yakouba added more laurels to his grizzling crown . Now most famed but no longer most respected citizen in Timbuctoo , he himself is not sure he has come the right way after all . Rich by native standards , he has a large mud palace , a large black wife , a large dusky family , all he wants to eat , drink , smoke , a good library , a reputation that brings every foreign visitor to his door . But he is not happy . Said he to Seabrook , as the upshot of his life 's experience : " In the end it is not well . "
