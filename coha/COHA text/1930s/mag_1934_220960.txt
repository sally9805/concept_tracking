In the sunny public square of Marino , a medieval town high in the Roman Hills , good-natured carabinieri in soaking wet uniforms last week kept a riotous crowd back from the public fountain . One by one they let villagers and visitors approach . One spout flowed rich red wine , the other white , and it was free for all but those hoggish enough to try to use buckets . It was the annual vintage festival , celebrated in Marino for over a thousand years . <P> On the dusty plains of Hungary white ox teams came in from the vineyards with colored ribbons around their horns , while peasants danced under rafters decorated with heavy bunches of ripe grapes . Switzerland , Germany and Spain prepared for a whole series of harvest festivals with bands , floats , dancing girls and red fire . <P> In France the peasants stacked up their heavy baskets , shook the powdery blue-green Bordeaux mixture from their smocks and thanked le bon Dieu that what showed every prospect of being the greatest vintage since unforgettable 1893 had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All over France , in the Champagne , Bordeaux and Burgundy districts , weather has been ideal for the vine this summer . There was little hail , and the drought that burned up wheat crops only made deep-rooted grapes the sweeter . Analyses of the green wine have already sent prices soaring , but production all over Europe will be huge . Bordeaux expects to produce 500,000,000 litres of 1934 compared with 337,000,000 litres of 1933 . Champagne of 1934 will be not only infinitely better than that of 1933 but there will be millions more gallons of it . French authorities are encouraged by the fact that after years of propaganda , domestic consumption of wine is definitely increasing . <P> Superstitious peasants expected all this good fortune before the first buds broke on the carefully pruned canes last spring . It is ancient legend that wines will be great in any year in which there are two full moons in a given calendar month . Nineteen-Thirty-Four was doubly blessed . Full moons shone Jan. 1 and 30 , again March 1 and 31.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
