Six years ago had President Alexander ( " Sandy " ) Calder of Union Bag &; Paper Corp . asked his stockholders to split their stock four-for-one , they probably would have balked . The price of their shares was down to $5 and such a split would have reduced their stock certificates to shinplasters . But last week his stockholders had only applause for Sandy Calder . They gladly voted to split their stock four-for-one and their new stock was traded at prices upwards of $18 , for in five years Recovery and Sandy Calder-but mostly Mr. Calder-had boosted the value of their shares around 1,500% . <P> Sandy Calder is spectacularly lucky . At golf for example , he has five times made holes in one , once with his opening shot in a tournament at Great Barrington , Mass , before a gallery of 300 . Sandy Calder 's luck is not limited to golf-he has made a huge success out of everything he has touched . Fourth of six brothers , he was born in New York City 51 years ago . At 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulp &; paper firm of Perkins-Goodwin Co. where his older brother Lou already had a job . Three years later Union Bag &; Paper , biggest U. S. bagmaker , offered him $40 a week to come to them . After a month he was fired in an economy drive . But the Calder luck came through on schedule-an older salesman retired before Sandy 's notice was up and he regained his job . He has justified it ever since , in the beginning by bagging Union 's biggest bag account , F. W. Woolworth Co. , and lately by lifting the company out of the worst jam in its 68-year history . <P> The paper bag was still a not very efficient novelty in 1869 when Union was started by a group of bagmakers solely to monopolize early bag-machine patents for leasing . By 1900 Union had expanded into a $27,000,000 manufacturing trust , sold 4,000,000,000 bags , 80% of the U , S , total , But Union 's profits dwindled steadily from $1,500,000 in 1899 to $43,000 in 1912 , In 1913 a new president was installed-John S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr , Riegel jerked Union 's profits to $365,000 in 1914 , In 1916 Union and Riegel Bag merged , and in 1920 , the company netted $3,300,000 on sales of 6,000,000,000 bags ( U. S. total : 20,000,000,000 ) . <P> Meanwhile Union had missed two industrial revolutions in its business : 1 ) from easily-torn sulphite bags to sulphate bags ( made of tough tan papers called " Kraft " by the trade ) ; 2 ) from expensive northern spruce to cheap southern pine for paper pulp . After the War when every competitor was moving south to use cheap slash pine , Union still sat in a sleepy , War-fattened lethargy . In 1928 it was so grossly out of line that it actually built a sulphate mill in the spruce forests of Tacoma . Next year this white elephant was shut down at a loss of $2,060,000 . Meanwhile Union lost money steadily in all the boom years . In 1929 it lost $750,000 . In 1930 , it sold less than a sixth of the 33,000,000,000 U. S. bags .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
