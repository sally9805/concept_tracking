Build-Up <P> Sirs : <P> Through the murk of screaming headlines last week TIME readers thought they could see the facts of the German crisis a little more clearly than could most of their bewildered neighbors .

I presume terrorism will now be the explanation . . . . <P> WALTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your obituary on Ernst Roehm exhibits the sophisticated intelligence of a Sunday-school teacher addressing a Revival meeting . <P> AMOS McCoy <P> New York Citv <P> Arizona 's Ashurst <P> Sirs : <P> We , the undersigned residents of Arizona . . . respectfully request that you . . . publish the political record of Henry F.
