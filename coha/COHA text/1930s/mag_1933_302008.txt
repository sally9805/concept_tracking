Justicia , a prize game cock of Puerto Rico , lost a handsome tail feather last week . Senator Rafael Martinez Nadal , the bird 's proud owner , plucked it out , fashioned it into a quill , presented it to Governor Robert Hayes Gore as the instrument wherewith he might sign a bill legalizing cockfighting throughout the island . The first insular legislature in 1900 drove this popular Latin sport underground . There , as in the U.S. , it continued to thrive . Governor Gore , who has enjoyed many a main as a boy in Louisville , Kentucky , brought it back to light as legitimate entertainment , even recommended an annual cockfighting carnival to attract tourists to Puerto Rico . <P> Governor Gore made more news last week when he announced that no one would be appointed to his insular Cabinet who refused to give him an undated resignation . He declared that his action was in line with President Roosevelt 's , thus suggesting that his own resignation in blank was on file at the White House . With an eyebrow raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upshot of the Gore order was the angry withdrawal by the preponderant Liberal Party of all its candidates for the territorial Cabinet . Second was the appointment of Dr. Garrido Morales to be Health Commissioner , without signing himself out of office in advance .
