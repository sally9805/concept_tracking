For nearly two decades the Roman Catholic Bishop of Detroit has been Most Rev. Michael James Gallagher . Born in Auburn , Mich , of Irish parents , " Mike " Gallagher was educated for the priesthood in Limerick , Ireland and Innsbruck , Austria . In the years following the War , Detroit 's shepherd organized no new parishes , gave the University of Detroit a new 96-acre campus and plant , raised $9,000,000 for Sacred Heart Seminary , invited a dozen new religious communities to live and work among Detroit 's 600,000 Catholics . Yet the total of all these worthy deeds has brought the white-thatched old churchman less fame outside his diocese than the fact that he happens to be the ecclesiastical superior of Rev. Charles Edward Coughlin . <P> Last month Bishop Gallagher sailed from Manhattan on the Rex , for Rome , Vatican City and Castel Gandolfo to make the visit " to the threshold " of Mother Church required of all bishops every three to ten years . With him was his friend and close colleague , Bishop Joseph Schrembs of Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit 's what he thought of Father Coughlin 's calling President Roosevelt a liar ( TIME , July 27 ) . Bishop Gallagher , whose countenance , as that of the Archangel Michael , adorns the political priest 's Charity Crucifixion Tower near Detroit , replied : <P> " Father Coughlin is entitled to his own opinion , but I do not approve of the language he used . ... I approve of his general activities and his radio talks . . . . " <P> Few days later , while in the U. S. Father Coughlin was offering a weaseling apology to President Roosevelt , U. S. newshawks in Rome began to hear what sounded to them like " high prelates close to the Vatican , " talking anonymously like unseen antiphonal voices in a church choir . <P> A Vatican Voice : The radio priest 's action caused a painful impression here . We have received thousands of letters on the subject . But the Holy Father does not desire to take action on the matter unless in conjunction with the Bishop of the diocese . Bishop Gallagher is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to Father-how do you say Coshlin ? Cooglin ? * <P> Arriving at Rome , Bishop Gallagher told newshawks : " I have no complaint against Father Coughlin . . . . The head of all priests in the diocese of Detroit is myself . It must therefore be for myself to make observations about Father Coughlin , not the Vatican . ... " <P> Another Vatican Voice : A transatlantic telephone call took place between Father Coughlin and a Vatican official . If , after a private warning to Father Coughlin , it becomes necessary to transfer him to another diocese , the Holy Father would prefer to make the transfer himself rather than take any action which might reflect upon Bishop Gallagher . <P> Bishop Gallagher , in Vatican City : " Rome holds me responsible for Father Coughlin 's activities . I explained to Monsignor Pizzardo political adviser to the Pope and Secretary of the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and we agreed , that the misunderstanding arises from the fact that many are not acquainted with canon law . Actually , Monsignor Pizzardo thinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely for political purposes . "
