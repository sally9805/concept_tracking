Chicago 's Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly is not up for re-election until February . But last week his campaign got under way with a handsomely printed 42-page booklet entitled Out of the Red Into the Black , The Truth About Chicago 's Municipal Government . Embellished with photographs of Chicago 's wonders ( including five of Ed Kelly ) , tables purporting to show that Chicago 's per-capita government cost was $53.57 compared to New York 's $91.78 , Boston 's $88.26 , it concluded that Chicago " stands in the front rank for economic administration of governmental affairs and for high calibre of public service . " Most effective thing about The Truth was its sponsor , a high-sounding something called the Citizens ' Committee on Public Information . <P> The pro-Kelly Tribune , permitted to scoop its competitors on the Committee 's findings , identified it as consisting of " 100 representative Chicagoans . " The anti-Kelly News , remembering that the mayor invited local bigwigs to join such a committee last June , produced a better scoop . Only 30 had joined and of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't attend any meetings , " said puzzled President Frank Cunningham of Butler Bros . <P> " I received a copy . . . and that was the first I heard about it , " said Architect John A. Holabird . Only committee member who admitted working on The Truth was Chairman John T. Pirie , president of State Street 's Carson Pirie Scott &; Co . Starchy Mr. Pirie could not explain why his fellow members had not seen the report , snapped : " Simply an oversight-somebody bungled . " Next day The Truth was withdrawn from circulation as mysteriously as it had been issued . <P> As hard to embarrass as a wart hog , Ed Kelly had The Truth formally received and approved by the City Council . Then he departed for New York City to enjoy the World Series ( see p. 49 ) .
