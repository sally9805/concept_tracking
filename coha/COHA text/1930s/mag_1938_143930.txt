In Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden one night last week 18,000 fight fans witnessed one of the most exciting stretch finishes they could remember . Onetime World Heavyweight Champion Jim Braddock had entered the ring an 8-to-5 underdog in a ten-round bout with Welshman Tommy Farr , British heavyweight champion .

" And , " added Braddock , " it 's been lucky ever since . "
