GEORGE . BLACKMAN tried to present an impressiveappearance . He combed his hair well back from his high forehead , cultivated a deep , boomingvoice , and wore nose glasses from which dangled a wide , black ribbon . He might have been a congressmanor a banker , but was , in fact , a criminal lawyer . Only a slight uneasiness of the eyes belied the picture of stolid , intellectual respectability which he tried to present to the public . He stared across the desk at Perry Mason . " I understand that you 're the attorney for the family , " he said . Perry Mason 's eyes were hard , and patient . " I 'm representing Miss Celane in the termination of her trust matter , " he said , " and I 'm representing ArthurCrinston , who is the surviving partner of the partnership . There 's some talk about having me represent the executor under the will , but I ca n't very well representboth the surviving partner and the executor . " Blackman grinned , and there was a trace of envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " with all of those fees coming in . " " Was that what you came to talk about ? " asked Mason , coldly . Blackman 's expression changed . " I came to tell you , " he said , " that I 'm representingp101Peter Devoe , the chauffeur , who is charged with the murder . " " Got a good case ? " asked Mason casually . The other man winced . " You know all about the case , " he said . " To tell you the truth , " said Mason , speaking with elaborate carelessness , " I do n't . I 've been so busy with other angles of the matter that I have n't had time to look into the murder case at all . " Blackman said , " Baloney ! " explosively . Mason looked dignified and resentful . Blackman leaned forward and tapped the desk impressively . " Look here , Mason , " he said . " You 're playing things pretty foxy . But I just want you to know that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as foxy . " " Meaning ? " asked Perry Mason . " I mean that you ca n't sit back and rake in all the money , and keep all your people out of it , while you railroad Devoe to the gallows . " " I 'm not railroading anybody to the gallows . " Blackman squirmed under the cold glare of the man across the desk . " Look here , " he said , " I 'm talking facts now . There 's nobody here to hear us . It 's just a conference between us two . You know the game as well as I do . You defend persons accused of crime whenever there 's a good fee in it , and so do I. When you defend a person , you 're representing him and nobody else on earth.  | You 'd fight the whole world to protect the rights of your clients . " " Sure , " said Mason , patiently , tonelessly , " that 's the duty of an attorney . " " All right , " Blackman said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be faithful to my duties . " " Go on , " said Mason . " You 've said too much or not enough . I ca n't tell which yet . " " All right , " Blackman told him . " I mean just this . You 're keeping this Celane woman pretty much in the background . You 've managed to do it rather adroitly . After all , the only case against Pete Devoe is one of circumstantial evidence , and it 's pretty weak circumstantial evidence , at that . He was lying there in bed , drunk , and anybody could have planted that club in his room and the two thousand dollars in his clothes . " " You overlook , " said Mason , " the testimony of Don Graves , who actually saw the murder being committed . You overlook the fact that , according to Crinston'stestimony , Edward Norton was sending for his chauffeur as Crinston left the place . " " I overlook nothing , " said Blackman impressively , his eyes boring belligerently into Mason 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a woman mixed up in the thing somewhere . " " Yes ' ? " asked Mason in a tone of polite but surprisedinterest . " Yes , " said Blackman , " and do n't be so damned surprisedat it . You know it , as well as I do . " " Know what ' ? " asked Mason.  | " Know that Don Graves saw a woman in that room at the time the murder was being committed . " " Don Graves does n't say so in the statement that he made to the police , as I understand it , " Mason remarked . " The statement he made to the police has n't got anything to do with it , " said Blackman . " It 's the statementhe is going to make on the witness stand that counts . " Mason looked at the ceiling and said , impersonally : " In the event , however , that the statement he makes on the witness stand does n't coincide with the first statement he made to the police , it might have a tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned . " " Yes , it might , " said Blackman . There was silence for a moment , then Blackman lowered his voice and said emphatically , " All right . You know where I stand now . You 're controlling all the money in this case , and I 'm representing the man who has been picked for the fall guy . I want the family to cooperate in this thing , and I want some money . Otherwise , I 'm going to tear the lid off . " " What do you mean by cooperation ? " asked Mason . " I mean that I want the family to convey the impressionto the police that they 're not at all vindictive ; that if Devoe did anything , he was drunk when he did it , and that if the District Attorney will take a plea of manslaughter they 'll be just as well satisfied . And then I 'm going to want some of the gravy . " " You mean , " said Mason , " that you want Frances Celane to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manslaughter so as to hush up any scandal ' ? Is that what you 're trying to convey to me ? " Blackman got to his feet with ponderous dignity . " I think , counselor , " he said , " that you understand my errand perfectly . I think that I have stated my positionfairly and frankly , and I do not care to commit myself by replying to the rather crude summary which you have attempted to make . " Perry Mason pushed back the chair from his desk , stood with his feet planted well apart , his eyes staring at Blackman . " Do n't think you can pull anything like that , Blackman , " he said . " We 're here alone . You 're going to tell me what you want , and tell it in so many words . " " Do n't be silly , " Blackman told him . " You know what I want . " " What do you want ? " " I want money . " " What are you going to give in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping Miss Celane in the background . " " To the extent that you 'll have Pete Devoe plead guilty to manslaughter ? " " Yes . If I can get a plea . " " Is he guilty of manslaughter ? " asked Perry Mason . " Why the hell bother about that ? " said Blackman irritably . " I told you that he 'd plead guilty to man-slaughter . " " How much money do you want ? " " I want fifty thousand dollars . "  | " That 's too much money for a fee , " Mason remarked , in a voice that was almost casual . " Not for the work I 'm going to do it is n't . " " The work for Devoe ? " asked Mason . " The work for Frances Celane , if you want to put it that way , " Blackman told him . " All right , " Mason went on , " as you , yourself , expressedit , we 're here alone . There 's no reason why we ca n't talk frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to know , " said Blackman . " Why should I know ? " " Because you should . " " I do n't know . I 'm asking you if he did . " " Why worry about that ? I 'll get him to plead guilty to manslaughter . " " For fifty thousand dollars ? " " For fifty thousand dollars . " " You 're crazy . The District Attorney would n't acceptany such plea . This is a murder case . Second degreemurder would be the best you could get . " " I could get manslaughter , " Blackman said , " if the family would cooperate , and if Graves would change his story a little bit . " " Why should Graves change his story ? " Mason inquired . " Why should anybody do anything ? " Blackman asked in a sarcastic tone of voice . " Why should I do anything ? Why should you do anything ? We 're not mixed in it . We 're doing things for money . Don Graves would do things for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked around the big desk toward Blackman . Blackman watched him with greedy eyes . " Just say it 's all right , " said Blackman , " and you wo n't hear anything more about it . " Perry Mason came to a stop in front of Blackman . He looked at him with eyes that were cold and sneering . " You dirty scum , " he said , his voice vibrant with feeling . Blackman recoiled slightly . " What the hell are you talking about ? " " You , " said Mason . " You 've got no right to talk to me like that . " Perry Mason took a swift step forward . " A dirty shyster , " he said , " who would sell out his client for a fifty thousand dollar fee . Get out of this office , and do it right now ! " Blackman 's face twisted in surprise . " Why , " he said , " I thought you were going to listen to my proposition . " " I listened to it , " Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blackman suddenly bolstered up his courage , and brandished a rigid forefinger in front of Mason 's face . " You 're mixed in this thing pretty deep yourself , " he said . " You 're either going to accept this proposition , or you 're going to hear a lot more about it . " Perry Mason reached up and grasped the extended forefinger in his left hand . He twisted the other 's hand down and around , until the lawyer exclaimed withp107pain . Mason abruptly released the forefinger , spun the other lawyer halfway around , grasped the back of the lawyer 's coat with his big , capable hand , and propelled the lawyer to the door . He jerked open the door of the private office , gave Blackman a shove that sent him sprawling off balance , into the outer office . " Get out , and stay out ! " he said . Blackman almost ran for half the distance across the outer office , then turned , with his face livid with rage , his glasses dangling at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret that , " he said , " more than anything you ever did in your life ! " " Get out ! " said Perry Mason , in a slow , even tone of voice , " or I 'm going to do some more . " Blackman groped for the knob of the outer door , pulled it open , and stepped into the corridor . Perry Mason stood in the doorway of his private office , shoulders squared , feet planted widely apart , staring belligerently at the slowly closing door . " What happened ? " asked Della Street , in sudden concern . " I told the cheap heel where to get off , " Mason remarked , without looking at her , his cold eyes still fastenedon the door from the outer office . He turned and walked back to his private office , leaving Della Street staring at him with wide , apprehensiveeyes . The telephone was ringing as he reached his desk . He scooped the receiver to his ear , and heard the voice of Frances Celane. 108 " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " he told her , " I 'm in my office . Can you come in ? " " Yes , unless you can come out here . " " Where are you ? " " Out at the house . " " All right , " he told her , " you 'd better get in that Buick and come in here . " " I ca n't come in the Buick , " she said . " Why not ? " he asked . " The police have sealed it up . They 've locked the transmission and padlocked the wheels . " Perry Mason gave a low whistle over the telephone . " In that event , " he said , " you 'd better get in the Packard and come here just as fast as you can . You 'd better grab a suitcase and put some clothes in it , but do it without attracting too much attention . " " I 'll be in in twenty minutes , " she said , and hung up . Perry Mason put on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street as he went out . " I 'm expecting Miss Celane in here , " he said , " in about twenty or twenty-five minutes , and I think I 'll be back by the time she arrives . But if I 'm not , I want you to put her in my private office and lock the door . Do n't let anyone in . Do you understand ? " She looked up at him , swiftly apprehensive , and nodded her head in a gesture of affirmation . " Has anythinggone wrong ? " she asked . He nodded curtly , then smiled and patted her shoulder.  |p109He  walked out of the door , took the elevator down , and walked a block and a half to the Seaboard Second National Trust Company . B. W. Rayburn , vice president of the bank , regarded Perry Mason with hard , watchful eyes , and said : " Yes , Mr. Mason ? " " I 'm representing Miss Frances Celane , the beneficiaryunder a trust fund which was administered by Edward Norton , " said Mason . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the surviving partner of Crinston &; Norton . " " Yes , " said Mr. Rayburn . " So I understand from a conversation I had this morning with Mr. Crinston . " " On the day of his death , " said Mason , " Mr. Nortonmade a trip from his home to a bank and back again . I am wondering if the trip was to this bank , or to the Farmers and Merchants National , where I understandhe also had an account . " " No , " said Rayburn slowly , " he came here . Why do you ask ? " " I understand , " said Mason , " he came here to secure a large sum of money in one thousand dollar bills . I am anxious to know if there was anything peculiar about his request for that money , or anything peculiar about the bills . " " Perhaps , " said Rayburn significantly , " if you could be a little more explicit , I could give you the information you wanted . " " Did Mr. Norton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted those bills ? " " Not specifically , " said Rayburn , with the secretivep110manner of one who is determined only to answer direct questions . Mason took a deep breath . " Did he ask you in advance , " he said , " to get for him a certain number of thousand dollar bills bearing consecutive serial numbers ? " " He did , " said the vice president of the bank . " And did he further state to you that , through your banking affiliations , he would like very much to have you make note of the numbers of those bills and ascertainwhen the bills were presented for deposit at any bank in the city ? " " Not exactly in those words , " said Rayburn cautiously . " Did he state that he intended to use that money to make a payment to a blackmailer , and would like to find out the identity of the person who deposited the currency ? " " Not in exactly those words , " said the banker again . " I think , " said Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information I can ask you to give me , and sufficient for my purpose . Thank you , Mr. Rayburn . " FIe turned and walked from the bank , leaving behind him a cold-eyed individual who surveyed his back in a gaze of shrewd speculation . Mason returned to his office and beckoned Della Street to his inner office . " Get Drake 's Detective Bureau for me , " he said , " and say that I want Paul Drake , himself , to handle a matter of the utmost importance . Say that I want Drake to come to my office posing as a client , and thatp111I want him to wait in the reception room until I give him a line on what he 's to do . During the time he 's waiting , he is to appear merely as a client . " She looked at him with eyes that showed grave apprehension . " Is that all ? " she asked . " That 's all , " he told her . " And you do n't want that Celane woman to know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , " Perry Mason told her . " I do n't want anyone to know who Drake is . As far as anyone who comes into the office is concerned , Drake is a client who is waiting to see me . " " Okay , " she said . She paused for a few moments , watching him with eyes that made no effort to conceal their concern . He grinned reassuringly . " Do n't worry , " he said , " it 's okay . " " You 're not getting in trouble ? " she asked . " I do n't think so . " " Is Miss Celane ? " " She 's in already  --  up to her neck . " " Does she know it ? " " I think so . " " You wo n't let her drag you into it ? " He shook his head slowly . " No , " he said , " I do n't think so . I ca n't tell just yet . " " When can you tell ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When will that be ? "  | " Not until she gets worse frightened than she is now . " Della Street frowned , then said , quickly : " Suppose we frighten her ? " Perry Mason shook his head and smiled . " No , " he said , slowly , " I do n't think we 'll have to . "  | PERRY MASON , thumbs hooked in the armholes of his vest , paced back and forth across the floor of his private office . Frances Celane , perched in the big black leather chair which she had occupied on her first visit to the office , regarded him with eyes that moved steadily back and forth , following the pacing of the lawyer . " Well , " she said at length , " you have n't asked me anything about why I wanted to see you . " " I do n't have to , " he said , " I know what 's happeningbetter than you do . What I 'm trying to do is to think far enough ahead so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm in an awful mess , " she said . " Of course you are , " he snapped , and resumed his steady pacing of the floor . There was a period of silence , then he paused in his walk to plant his feet far apart and stare down at her . " Where did you get that money you gave me ? " he asked . " Just as I told you before , I got the money from my uncle , " she said , in a thin , weak voice . " Before he was murdered or afterwards ? " pressed Perry Mason . " Before . " " How much before ? "  | " Not very much before . That is , just before Mr. Crinston came to the house . " " What happened ? " " There was forty-eight thousand dollars , " she said . " He gave it to me , and told me he was sorry he 'd been holding out my regular allowance . He said he 'd decided to change his mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . " " And he gave you this money in cash ? " " Yes . " " You came to him and told him that you needed cash ? " " I told him that I simply had to have some money and have it right away . " " And he did n't say anything about you being black-mailed ? " " No . " " Were you being blackmailed ? " She bit her lip and looked down at the floor . " Is that any of your business ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , " she said , " I was being blackmailed . " " All right , " he said . " Was it by the housekeeper ? " She started , and raised her eyes to his with a look ofalarm . " How did you know ? " " I suspected , " he said . " How much did you give her ' ? "  | " I gave her all of it , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does that mean , " he said , " that you have n't any of those thousand dollar bills in your possession ? " " That 's right . " " Now listen . Let 's not have any misunderstanding about this , and let 's get it straight . You 're in a jam , and I 'm going to get you out , but it 's important I know exactly what happened with that money . You have n't any of it in your possession ? " " Not a bit , " she said . Perry Mason took the ten thousand dollars which she had given him from his wallet and fingered the bills . " You knew , " he asked , " that all of these bills were numbered consecutively , and that various banking institutionsin this city had been given a list of those numbers ? " " No , " she said in a wan , frightened voice . " Well , " he told her , " that 's a fact . Thousand dollar bills are n't so numerous but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost necessary to take them to a bank to change them . Merchants do n't ordinarily carry change for a thousand dollars in their tills . " Perry Mason went to the desk , picked up a long envelopeof heavy manila paper , sealed the ten thousand dollars in currency in the envelope , unscrewed the cap from a fountain pen , and addressed the envelope to Carl S. Belknap , 3298 15th Street , Denver , Colorado ,  | and jabbed his forefinger on the button on the side of his desk , which summoned his secretary . When Della Street opened the door , Perry Mason tossed her the envelope with a careless gesture . " Stamp and mail this , " he said . " First Class . " She looked at the address . " I did n't know we had any correspondence with a Mr. Belknap , " she said . " We have now , " he told her . " Send it registered mail . " She nodded , flashed one swiftly appraising glance at Frances Celane , then slipped back through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances Celane . " All right , " he said . " That envelope will be in the mail for the next few days . Eventually it will come back to me . In the meantime , nobody is going to find that money on me . Now why did n't you tell the police about that in the first place ? " Her eyes suddenly snapped black fire . " That 's my business ! " she said . " I hired you as an attorney to represent my interests . Do n't think that you can stand there and tell me what I 'm going to do , and what I 'm not going to do .... " He took a stride toward her and said : " You 're either going to control that temper , or you 're going to march up the gallows and have a black bag put around your neck . Did you ever think of how you would like to be hung ? " She got to her feet and drew back her hand as though she intended to slap him.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perry Mason told her . " Now you 're facing a situation you ca n't handle by yourself . Just as sure as you 're standing there , you 're going to be arrested within the next forty-eight hours , and the case that 's going to be built up against you is going to be so black that I do n't know whether I can get you out of it or not . " Sheer surprise pushed her rage to one side , and showed in her dark eyes . " Arrested ? Me , arrested ? " " Arrested , " he told her , " for murder . " " Devoe was arrested for murder , " she said . " He 's the one that did it . " " Devoe did n't do it , " said Perry Mason , " any more than I did . That is , if he did do it , no one is ever going to prove it . He 's got an attorney that knows the ropes , and he 's going to drag you into this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because he was here in this office less than an hour ago and told me so . " She sank back in the chair and stared at him , all of the temper gone from her eyes , which were now dark and pathetic . " What did he want ? " she asked . " Money , " he said . Her face showed a trace of relief . " All right , " she said . " We 'll give it to him . " " We will not , " he said . " Why ? " " Because , " he said , " he 'd blackmail you to death . Ile does n't know for sure that you are in a bad jam ,  |p118but  he suspects it . He wanted to make sure . If I 'd talked terms with him , he 'd have been sure . He 's heard whispers somewhere . He wanted to verify them . If I 'd given in to him on the money end of it , he 'd have been sure . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " His voice was grim . " I threw him out of the office , " he said . " How much does he know ? " she asked . " Not much , but he suspects a lot . " " I 'm afraid of him , " she said , in a voice that was almost a wail . " You 've got a right to be , " he said . " Now I want to get at the bottom of this thing . Tell me exactly what happened when your uncle was murdered . " She took a deep breath and said in a low monotone , " I was in the house . I had had a quarrel with him . He had been very bitter , and I lost my temper and said things that hurt . " " You would , " said the lawyer drily . " I did , " she said , without expression . There was a moment of silence . " Go on , " said the lawyer . " He took some money from his wallet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money that was in there . There were some bills left . I do n't know exactly how many , but he pushed the currency toward me and told me to take it . He said that he had intended to cut down on my allowance to bring me to my senses , but that he 'd come to the conclusion I would never come to myp119senses . He said it was really my money and if I wanted to throw it away , that was my business . " " So you took the money , " he told her . " Yes , of course . " " Then what ? " " Then , " she said , " I gave all of it except ten thousand dollars to Mrs. Mayfield . " " Why did you do that ? " he asked . " Because she knew I had been married , and was threatening to tell my uncle about it . " " Was that before Crinston came to the house , or afterwards ? " " You mean when I gave her the money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who saw you give the money to her . . . anyone ? " " Rob Gleason . " Perry Mason whistled . " So Gleason was there , eh ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said slowly , " Gleason was there . That 's why I said I was n't there . " " All right , " he said grimly , " tell me about that . " " You know that we are married , " she said . " Rob drove up in his car , a Chevrolet . There 's a porch which opens out from my room , and he came to that porch and I let him in . He was worried about Mrs. Mayfield and about what my uncle was going to do . I told him that I 'd seen my uncle and I thought things were all might . " While we were talking , Mrs. Mayfield came in and demanded money . She had been listening , and knew that my uncle had given me some money . She did n't know how much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . I opened my purse and let her take it out . But , before I did that , I had ditched ten of the one thousand dollar bills , because I knew you were going to need some money , and I was saving it for you . That was all I needed money for  --  just you and her . I thought then that things would be all right , with you representing me , and Mrs. Mayfield keeping quiet . I thought we could work the thing out some way . " " And Crinston had arrived by that time ? " asked Mason . " Yes , " she said , " he had come before that . I heard him drive up . In fact , I was leaving my uncle 's office when Crinston came up . " " And Graves , the secretary , was in the outer office all the time ? " asked the lawyer . " Yes , he was there all the time , and knows pretty much what happened . He knows a lot more than he lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , and I have an idea he knows something about what Mrs. Mayfield is doing . " " All right , " said Mason , " then what happened ? " " Well , " she said , " Mrs. Mayfield went out , and I went out and sat on the porch with Rob . Then there was a commotion , and I heard running steps from the front of the house , and shouts , and heard something about my uncle having been murdered . I knew that itp121would never do for Rob to be there , so I told Rob to get in his car and drive away . " " And you went with him ? " " Yes , I went with him . " " Why did you do that ? " " Because I did n't want to be there . " " Why ? " " I thought that I could fix up an alibi for Rob . " " How did you get out of the grounds ? " " There 's a way out through an alley in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nobody heard us , I guess . " " All right , then what happened ? " " Then I came back home ; that is , I had Rob drive me to a place about two blocks from the house , and got out there . I sneaked into my bedroom and talked with Don Graves . I found out from him that my uncle had reported the Buick as having been stolen , and they thought that I was driving it . I figured that was a good alibi for me , and would let Rob out of it , so I said that I had been driving the Buick , and nobody questioned my word . " " All right . Then what happened ? " " You know the rest . Everybody took it for granted that I had been driving the Buick , and I thought everything was all right until you came and told me about the speedometer records not checking up . I went out to put some mileage on the Buick , and found an officer there , who grinned at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evidence . " " They 'd sealed it up ? " asked Perry Mason.  | " Yes . They put a padlocked chain around the front 1 axle and through the spokes of the wheel , and they 'd also locked up the transmission . " " That , " said Mason drily , " makes it nice . " She said nothing . After a moment Mason resumed his regular pacing of the floor , and the girl watched him with dark , anxiouseyes , her head never moving , but the eyes followinghim back and forth as he paced rhythmically . " You , " he said , at length , " are going to have a nervousbreakdown . I know a doctor I can count on . He 's going to examine you and order you to a sanitarium . " " What good will that do ' ? " she asked . " It 's going to give me a little time , " he said . " But wo n't that make them more suspicious when I run away ? " " They ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The minute they sealed up that Buick , it showed they were working on this other angle of the case . I tried to slip that notebook containing the mileages into my pocket , and make it appear I was doing it casually ; but the officer was n't so dumb . He called me on it , and I had to put the notebook back . " " Did you know about the mileage then ? " she asked . " I suspected it . " " How did it happen you suspected it ? " " Because I knew you 'd been lying to me . " Her eyes blazed . " Do n't talk to me like that ! " she said . He simply grinned at her . After a moment the angry light left her eyes.  | " You 've got to figure you 're trapped on that car business , " he told her . " You 've got to switch around on that . " " But , " she said , " that 's going to bring Rob into it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an awful mess , because there was bad blood between Rob and my uncle . " " Did Rob see your uncle the night he was murdered ? " asked Mason . She shook her head , hesitated a moment , then noddedit . " Yes , " she said , " he did . " " And the reason you changed your story just now and admitted it , " he said , " is that you suddenly rememberedthere is someone who knows Rob saw your uncle . Who is that someone  --  Don Graves ? " She nodded her head again . Perry Mason stepped to the door of the outer office . " Dell , " he said , " get me Doctor Pray-ton on the telephoneright away . Tell his nurse that it 's vitally important  --  amatter of life and death . Get him on the telephonepersonally , and do it now . " " Yes , " she said . " There 's a Mr. Paul Drake in the office who wants to see you about a personal matter . He wo n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " snapped Perry Mason . " Tell him to wait , " and he stepped back into the office , slamming the door . " Now , " he told the girl , " you 're going to have a nervous breakdown . You 'll be sent to a sanitarium underanother name . The police will find you sooner or later . But I want it to be later . Do n't let anyone know who you are , do n't show any undue interest in the newspaper reports of the case , and , no matter what happens , do n't get stampeded . " She stared at him searchingly . " How do I know I can trust you ? " she asked . He met her gaze with a steady stare . " That 's one of the things you can use your own judgment about , " he said , " and it 's going to make a hell of a lot of difference what you do . " " All right , " she told him , " I 'm going to trust you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'll order the ambulance right now before Doc Prayton gets here . "  | PAUL DRAKE , the detective , bore no resemblance whatever to the popular conception of a private detective , which was , perhaps , why he was so successful . He was a tall man , with a long neck that was thrust forward inquiringly . His eyes were protruding , and glassy , and held a perpetual expression of droll humor . Nothing ever fazed him . In his life , murders were everyday occurrences ; love nests as common as automobiles , and hysterical clients merely part of an everydayroutine . He sat in the big high-backed leather chair in Perry Mason 's office , and turned sideways , so that his long legs were crossed over the right hand arm of the chair . A cigarette was in his mouth , hanging pendulously at an angle from his lower lip . Perry Mason , seated back of the big desk , stared at the detective with patient eyes that were calmly watchful . His manner was that of a veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gong . He looked like a man who would presently lose his relaxed watchfulness , spring from the chair , and engage in swift conflict , with the ferocity of a tiger . " Well , " said Drake , " what 's eating you ' ? " " Awhile back , " said Perry Mason , " you were telling me something about a rough shadow . "  |p126Paul  Drake inhaled placidly on his cigarette . His glassy , protruding eyes watched Perry Mason with an expression of quizzical humor . " You must have a good memory , " he said . " That was a long time ago . " " Never mind when it was , " Mason told him . " I want to get the lowdown on it . " " Somebody trying it on you ? " asked the detective . " No , " said Mason . " But I have an idea I can use it . Give me the sketch . " Paul Drake removed the cigarette from his mouth , pinched it out , and dropped it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , " he said . " We do n't ordinarily talk about it  --  not to outsiders , anyway . It 's a psychological third degree . It 's predicated on the idea that a man who has something on his mind that he 's trying to conceal , is likely to be nervous . " " How does it work ? " Mason asked tonelessly . " Well , let 's figure that you 're working on a case , and you figure somebody has got some knowledge  --  not just ordinary knowledge , but a sort of guilty knowledge that he 's trying to conceal . You 've got two or three ways of approaching him in order to get him to spill the beans . One of them is to use the routine stunt of getting an attractive woman to get acquainted with him , and start him boasting . Another one is to plant some man who becomes friendly with him , and gets his confidence . " Usually one of those ways works out . But sometimes they do n't work . Sometimes a man wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , wo n't start boasting , and he'llp127get suspicious if one of your operatives starts getting friendly with him . That 's when we use the rough shadow . It takes two men to work a rough shadow job . First , you have your contact man who makes a contact with the suspect , but ca n't seem to get under his hide , ca n't get him to talk . " Well , you pick the time and a suitable place , and have your rough shadow trailing along behind . The contact man starts the fireworks by giving a signal . " Of course , you understand , shadowing is a job in itself . The public gets goofy ideas about the work of a shadow , and how he operates . The public gets the idea that a shadow puts on disguises and ducks into doorwaysor hides behind telephone poles , and all that sort of stuff . They get that way from looking at the movies and reading a lot of detective stories written by guys that do n't know anything about the detective business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow is a smooth guy who almost never uses a disguise . He 's just a casual , innocent-looking bystander . No matter what happens , he never gets rattled and never does any of this business of ducking in a doorway . He looks so matterof-factthat the suspect always takes him as part of the general scenery , and never thinks of him as an individual . " " I know all that , in a general way , " Perry Mason told him . " What I want to get straight is just how this rough shadow game is worked . " " Well , that 's simple , " said the detective . " It 's like all of the good things  --  they 're simple when you come right down to analyze them . The rough shadow simply acts the way the suspect figures a shadow should act In other words , he quits being a regular shadow , and becomes crude . He does all the things that the suspect naturally expects a detective would do . He hides behindtelephone poles and ducks in doorways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suspect knows he 's being shadowed ? " asked Perry Mason . " That 's the idea , " said Drake , taking another cigarette from a case in his pocket , and tapping it gently on his thumb nail . " You see , the contact man has established a certain amount of friendly relations with the suspect . The suspect , however , is a guy who wo n't talk about the thing that the contact man wants him to talk about , so the contact man gets a shadow to tail along behind . The suspect never knows that he 's being tailed , because the shadow is a smooth worker . But , when the circumstancesare right , the contact man gives a signal , and then the shadow gets crude about his methods . He starts ducking around behind telephone poles , putting on disguises , and doing the hundred and one amateurishthings which defeat the very purpose of a skilled shadow . Naturally , the suspect takes a tumble that he 's being tailed . " Now , it 's a funny thing about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who ai n't used to it . As soon as he finds that somebody 's tailing him around , he starts getting nervous . Usually the firstp129thing he does is to start walking faster , and looking back over his shoulder . Naturally , the contact man has the rough shadow game sprung when he 's walking with the suspect , and the contact man always slows down and saunters along . " So the suspect wants to hurry things up a little bit , and he 's nervous and jumpy all over . After a while , ninety-nine chances out of a hundred , he 'll turn to the contact man and say that there 's a detective following him and he wants to ditch the shadow . The contact man helps him to do it , and that makes the suspect loosen up and take the contact man into his confi-dence . " " Suppose the suspect does n't say anything to the contact man ? " asked the lawyer . " Then , " said Drake , " the contact man says something to the suspect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , old man , I do n't want to get personal , but do you know there 's somebody shadowing you ? ' Or else , he may say : Say , look at that fellow behind us . I believe he 's shadowing me . ' If it 's a crime he 's working on , the contact man usually pretends that the rough shadow is tailing him , and opens up and confesses to the suspect that he 's been guilty of a crime somewhere , and that he 's afraid the dicks are on his trail . He asks the suspect to help him ditch the rough shadow . They rush into buildings , go up and down elevators , mingle with crowds , and all that sort of stuff , and when theontact man gives a signal , the rough shadow steps out of the picture , and the suspect thinks he 's been ditched.  | " It 's just an angle of the game that sometimes brings results . You can nearly always get a man talking when you pull a rough shadow on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I want to work a rough shadow game . " " Maybe you wo n't need a rough shadow , " Drake pointed out . " It 's something we use only as a last resort . Usually we can build up a friendship and get people to talk . A slick operative has a knack of making people spill facts . " " No , " said Mason , " this is an unusual case , and I want a contact operative who is of a certain type . " " What 's the type ? " asked the detective . " A middle-aged woman who can pretend she has had to work hard all her life . Get somebody who has n't any particular beauty or figure ; who has wrinkled hands and a heavy figure . " " Okay , " said Drake . " I 've got just the woman . She 's clever , and she 's hard-boiled . Who do you want to have her contact ? " " Mrs. Edna Mayfield , the housekeeper for Edward Norton . " " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered . " Drake whistled . " Think she 's mixed up in the murder ? " he asked . " I do n't know just what she 's mixed up in , " PerryMason said slowly , " but she 's got information . I wantthat information . " " They 've got the fellow that did the murder , have n't they ? " asked the detective , his glassy eyes suddenly ,  |p131losing  their expression of droll humor , and containing a glint of quick appraisal . " Was n't it the chauffeur or somebody that pulled the job ? " " So I understand , " said Mason noncommittally . " You 're representing Frances Celane , the young woman who 's the beneficiary under the trust fund and the will ? " " Yes . " " Okay , now just what do you want me to get out of her ? " " Anything that she knows , " said Perry Mason slowly . " You mean about the murder ? " " About anything . " Paul Drake let his glassy eyes study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . " Look here , " he said , " let 's be frank with each other . I know you well enough to know that if you 're getting me to start work on this murder case , that there 's an angle to it that the police have n't got . " " I did n't say I wanted you to work on the murder case , " Perry Mason said slowly . " No , " said Drake significantly , " you did n't say that . " There was a moment or two of silence , then Perry Mason said , slowly and impressively : " I want you to find out everything that that housekeeper knows . I do n't care what it 's about . " Paul Drake made a gesture with his shoulders . " Do n't get me wrong , " he said . " I 'm not curious , and I do n't want you to misunderstand me . But just suppose that some of the information this woman spills would n't look so well for your client ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry Mason . " Sure , I know , " said Drake . " But suppose that we get it through a couple of operatives that I 'll put on the case . And suppose the information should be something you would want to keep under cover ? I try to get dependable people to work for me , but things have a habit of leaking out in time . " " Yes , " said Perry Mason slowly , " in time . " Once more there was an interval of silence . " Well ? " asked the detective . " I think , " said Mason , " that this is another case where I 'm going to be working against time . I do n't think there 's any information that your operatives will get that the police wo n't get sooner or later . I want to have it sooner , and want the police to get it later . " Drake nodded . " All right , " he said , " I get the sketch . I just wanted to be certain there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfied clients , and I want to keep my clients sat-isfied . " " All right , " Mason told him . " We understand each other on that . " Now , there 's one other thing . A fellow by the name of Don Graves , secretary to Edward Norton , was a witness to the murder , itself . He 's told the police one story , and me another . He may be dangerous . I want to find out confidentially whether he really did see ap133woman in the room at the time the murder blow was struck , or whether he 's going to say he did , which amounts to the same thing . " Now , do you suppose that you could get someone to contact him without creating too much suspicion , and find out just what he 's really going to testify to ? If there 's any way of doing it , I 'd like to get a written statement out of him . " " Any money for expenses ? " asked the detective . " Plenty of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get somebody to go to him and tell him he 's representing a tabloid newspaper , or a true detective story magazine , and wants the account of an eye-witness , get him to submit the manuscript signed and sworn to , and offer to pay him by the word ? " " Okay , " said Mason , " provided there are n't too many words . " The detective grinned . " You mean , provided the words are of the right kind . " " Well , " said the lawyer , " I guess that amounts to about the same thing . " Drake got up and flipped his cigarette into a brass cuspidor . " Okay , " he said , " I 'll get started . " " You 'll let me know progress ? " " I 'll let you know progress . " " Concentrate heavy on that housekeeper . She 's a tartar and you 'll have to watch her . " " Mail reports ? " asked the detective.  | " No . Make them orally or not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Della Street glanced significantly at Perry Mason . " That 's okay , " he said , " tell me what it is , Della . " " Mr. Crinston is out here . He says his business is important and he ca n't wait . " " Very well , " said Mason , " I 'll see him . " He flashed a meaning glance to Drake and said to the detective in a tone of voice sufficiently loud to carry into the outer office , " That 's quite all right , Mr. Drake . I 'm busy on an important matter right now , and I ca n't give it my immediate attention , but you 've got ten days within which to make an appearance , and I 'll draw up a demurrer and file it in court . That 'll carry the thing along and keep you from being in defaultuntil we can go into greater details . " He shook hands with Drake in the doorway , and beckoned to Mr. Crinston . " Come in , " he said . Crinston pushed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming authority which characterized him . He gave the impression of sweeping away all obstacles from his path by the very blast of his forceful personality . " Hello , Mason , " he said , shaking hands . " Glad to see you . Guess you 've been pretty busy , have n't you ? " Mason watched him with speculative eyes . " Yes , " he said . " I 've been busy . " Crinston sat down in the big chair , and filled it completely . He took a cigar from his pocket , clipped off the end , scraped a match on the sole of his shoe.  | " Well , " he said , " it 's been a mess all around . " " Yes , " the lawyer told him , " it 's still a mess . " " Oh , I think it 's going to come out all right , " said Crinston , " but why did n't you follow my instruc-tions ? " " What instructions ? " " About keeping Frances out of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . The poor girl is hysterical . She came to the office and had a completebreakdown . I called a physician , and he prescribedcomplete rest . He 's taken her to a sanitarium somewhere , and wo n't tell even me where it is , for fear that I might call her . " Crinston puffed out the first whiffs of blue smoke from the cigar , and stared at the lawyer thoughtfully . " Not bad , that , " he said . " Her nerves were really on the ragged edge , " said Mason with dignity . " Yes , yes , I know , " Crinston said impatiently . " No need to waste your time and my time with that stuff . I understand . What I dropped in to find out was whether you know a man by the name of George Blackman , an attorney here ? " " Yes , I know him , " said Mason . " He got in touch with me on the telephone and told me I should see you right away on a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressionless in an even monotone . " Blackman came to see me earlier in the day , " he said , " and suggested that it might make matters better for the family all around if Devoe should plead guilty to manslaughter . " " Why , damn it ! " stormed Crinston . " He 's a murderer ! That was a dastardly cold-blooded murder ! " " That attitude on the part of the family was the thing that Blackman wanted to speak to me about , " said Mason , still speaking in the same even cautious monotone . " He said that if the family were going to adopt a vindictive attitude toward his client , it would be necessary for him to adopt a vindictive attitude toward the family and try to show that the case was a frame-up against his client . " " How could he do that ? " asked Crinston . " Oh , there are various ways , " said Mason , in his steady monotone . " It 's an axiom of criminal law that a man should try everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the prosecuting attorney . Very frequently you can try the prosecuting witness . You can start digging around , cross-examining on extraneousmatters , trying to show some sort of a motive for murder . Then , if you can get a motive before the jury , you start showing opportunity , and if you can get motive and opportunity , you suddenly switch the accusation and claim there 's just as much ground to suspect the prosecuting witness as there is the defend-ant . " " You mean to switch the guilt to Fran Celane ? " asked Crinston . " I did n't mention any names , " said Mason . " I simplytold you how criminal lawyers play the game . "  | " Look here , " said Crinston . " Did you find out exactly what he wanted ' ? " " He said that he wanted a fee , " said Mason , " and the assurance that a request would go to the District Attorney to look at the matter as leniently as possible and accept a plea of manslaughter . " Crinston studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he wanted ' ? " he commented . " Yes . " " You act as though you did n't think it was what he really wanted . " " I do n't . " " Why ? " " Because I do n't think the district attorney would consider a plea of manslaughter . I think he 'd prosecute either for first degree murder , or not at all . " " Then what did Blackman want ' ? " Crinston demanded . " I think he wanted to find out what our reactions would be to a proposition of that kind . If we 'd been willing to go ahead , he 'd have taken as much money as he could get , and then blackmailed us for as much more as possible , and then double-crossed us at the time of trial . " Crinston studied his cigar thoughtfully . " He did n't impress me as being that kind of a man , " he said slowly . " Not from the impression he made over the telephone , anyway . " " If you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mason told him.  |p138Crinston  put the cigar back in his mouth and chewed on it thoughtfully . " Look here , " he said suddenly , placing his parted fingers to his mouth , and jerking out the chewed cigar , " I do n't like the way you 're handling this case . " " No ? " asked Perry Mason coldly . " No ! " said Crinston explosively . " And what do n't you like about it ? " asked the lawyer . " I think you 're letting a golden opportunity slip through your fingers . I think there 's a good chance to get this thing all cleaned up by playing ball with Blackman . " Mason 's answer was curt and without explanation . " I do n't , " he said . " Well I do , and I 'm giving you orders right now to get in touch with Blackman and give him what he wants . Anything within reason . " " He does n't want things within reason , " Mason said . " His type never does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then raise his sights . " " All right . Let him raise them . There 's a hell of a lot of money involved in this thing , and we ca n't afford to bungle it . " " Are you afraid , " asked Perry Mason , " that Frances Celane ca n't stand too much pressure ? " " That 's a great question to ask me ! " Crinston almostshouted . " When you 've had to let her have a nervous breakdown in order to keep her out of the hands of the police . "  | " I did n't say that I did it to keep her from the police , " Mason reminded him . " Well , I said it , " said Crinston . " Yes , " Mason told him , " I heard you , and furthermore , you do n't need to shout . " Crinston got to his feet , flung the half smoked cigar into the cuspidor , and glowered at Mason . " All right , " he said , " you 're finished . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just what I say . You 're not representing me anymore , and you 're not going to represent Frances Celane anymore . " " I think , " Mason told him slowly , " that Miss Celanewill be the best judge of that . I 'll wait until she tells me that I 'm not to represent her anymore . " " She 'll tell you fast enough , as soon as I get in touch with her . " " Where , " asked Mason , smiling thoughtfully , " are you going to get in touch with her ? " " Do n't worry , " Crinston told him , " I 'll get in touch with her all right , and then you 're going to be finished . You 're a bungler . You 've been smart enough on some things , but you 've let the case get into a hell of a mess . I 'm going to get some attorney , and ... " Abruptly , Perry Mason got to his feet . He strode purposefully around the desk . Crinston watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold just a trace of panic . Mason planted himself firmly in front of the other man , his eyes cold , hard , and ominous.  | " All right , " he said , " let 's not have any misunderstandingabout this . From now on I 'm not representing you , is that right ? " " You bet that 's right ! " " And do n't think , " said Mason , " that your business is so damned important . Miss Celane would have let me handle the estate if it had n't been for the fact that I could n't place myself in the position of acting as attorneyboth for the estate , and for the surviving part-ner . " " Well , " Crinston told him , " you do n't need to worry about that anymore . On the other hand , do n't think you 're going to represent the estate . You are n't going to represent anything or anybody . I 'm going to get another attorney to represent me , and he 's going to represent Frances Celane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ominously : " Just to show you what a fool you are , and how you 've walked into a trap , the man that you 're going to get to represent you is one that was suggested to you by Blackman . " " What if he is ? " Crinston demanded . Mason 's smile was frosty . " Nothing , " he said . " Go right ahead . Walk into the trap just as deeply as you want to . " Crinston 's eyes softened somewhat . " Look here , Mason , " he said , " I 've got nothing against you personally , but this is a business matter . I think you 're bungling things , and I think you 're too damned ethical . I do n't want you to misunderstand me . Frances Celane means a lot to me . I 'm just like an uncle to her . She 's a kid that I 've taken a lot of interestp141in , and I 'm going to see that she gets a square deal . I think that this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't deal with you any , more if you were the last man left on earth . " Perry Mason laughed a bitter , mirthless laugh . Crinston went on doggedly . " No matter what happens , I 'm for Frances Celane . I do n't know what the evidence may disclose before it gets done , but I 'm going to stick by the kid no matter what happens . Get that , and get it straight . I 'm a business man , and she does n't know a thing about business . I 'm going to see that she gets a square deal , beginning immediately . " He turned and walked with ponderous dignity toward the door . Perry Mason watched him with thoughtful concentration . " What a sucker you are , " as Crinston jerked the door open . Crinston whirled on him . " I hate that word ! " he said . " I do n't let anybody call me a sucker . " " You 'll hate it a lot worse before you 're done , " said Mason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk . Crinston hesitated a moment , then turned and walked back into the room . " All right , wise guy , " he said , " now I 'm going to tell you something . " You 've bungled this case from the time you started in on it . I know that I ca n't fire you as Miss Celane 's lawyer . That 's something that 's entirely up to her . I 'm going to advise her to let you go . In the event she does n't , however , I 'm going to give you one tip , and that 's watch Purkett , the butler . " " Now , " said Perry Mason , " you interest me . Go ahead and tell me what you 're driving at . " " Oh , " said Crinston sarcastically , " you do want to take a little advice , eh ? " " I want you to tell me why you made that remark about Purkett , " said Perry Mason , his eyes cold . Crinston 's eyes surveyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he asked , " would you have sense enough to use the information ? " Perry Mason said nothing , but held his head slightly on one side , after the manner of a person anxious to hear that which is about to be said . " The evidence in this case , " said Crinston , " pointed unmistakably to Devoe . A good lawyer would have seen that the police never had a chance to consider the possibility that such evidence was n't conclusive . However , you sat back and did nothing while the police began to doubt that evidence and make other investigations . " Then , when that investigation was under way , you did nothing to keep them from involving your client . Now , if Devoe is guilty , that 's the end of it . If he is n't guilty , someone else is . There 's a stronger probability that that someone else is Purkett than anyone else . Yet you 're letting him keep entirely in the background . " Crinston stopped speaking and stood in an attitude . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " asked Perry Mason.  | " That 's all . " Perry Mason smiled . " Blackman 's address , " he said , " is in the Mutual Building . I thought I would save you looking it up in the telephone book . " Crinston 's face showed a slight flicker of surprise , then set in grim lines . " Very well , " he said , jerked the office door open , and slammed it behind him . Perry Mason sat for a few minutes , then clamped his hat down firmly on his head . He walked through the outer office , saying to his secretary as he went past , " I do n't know just when I 'll be back , Della . Close up the office at five o'clock . "  | PERRY MASON walked into the garage where he stored his automobile and asked for the mechanic . " How much of a job would it be , " he said , " to turn a speedometer back a few miles ? That is , suppose you had a speedometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it back to 15,304.7 miles . How much of a job would it be ? " " Not much of a job , " said the mechanic grinning , " only , if you were going to turn it back that far , you should make a good job of it and turn it back to 3000 miles and sell the car as a demonstrator . " " No , " said the lawyer , " I did n't mean to slip one over on the car dealer or on a customer . I was trying to find out about evidence . How long would it take to set the speedometer back ? " " Not so very long , " said the mechanic . " It 's a simplejob . " Perry Mason gave him half a dollar and walked from the garage , his head bowed in thought . He stepped into a drug store and telephoned the number of Edward Norton 's residence . The voice that answered the telephone , apparently that of the butler , was filled with that type of formalitywhich comes when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has attracted much public interest . " I want to talk with Mr. John Mayfield , the gardener , " said Mason . " I beg your pardon , sir , " said the voice , " but it 's rather unusual for calls to come through for Mr. Mayfield . I do n't know whether he 's supposed to take calls on this telephone or not , sir . " " That 's all right , " said Mason , without disclosing his identity . " This is in connection with some police business . Get him on the phone , and do n't waste time . " There was a moment of hesitant silence at the other end of the line , and then the butler 's voice said : " Very good , sir . Just a moment , sir . " After a delay of several minutes a heavy , stolid voice said : " Hello , " and Perry Mason spoke rapidly . " Do n't tell anybody who this is , " he said , " but this is Mason , the lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting some money for her , and I ca n't locate her . Do you know where she is ? " " I think , " said the man , " she went to the District Attorney 's office . They called for her in a car and took her there . " " All right , " said Mason . " It 's important that I get in touch with you and talk with you about this business matter which your wife took up with me . Now , the question is , can you take one of the cars and come in to meet me ? " " Maybe I could , sir , but I 'm not certain . I 'd much rather walk up and meet you at the corner of the boulevardif you could drive out here , sir . "  | " All right , " said Mason , " I 'll do that . You meet me at the boulevard , and do n't tell anybody that you 're meeting me there . " Mason returned to the garage , got his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curving roadway which led to the Norton residence intersected the boulevard . A man who was stooped of shoulder , heavily framed and big-boned , stepped out from the gathering dusk as Mason parked the car . " You 're Mr. Mason ? " he asked . " Yes , " said the lawyer . " I 'm John Mayfield . What was it you wanted ? " Mason got partially out of the car and stood with one foot on the running board , and surveyed the man with keen scrutiny . He saw a stolid , unemotional face , with sullen eyes and heavy , unsmiling lips . " Did you know what your wife spoke to me about ? " he asked . " My wife told me she had had a talk with you , " said the man , cautiously . " Did she tell you what she talked about ? " " She told me that maybe we were going to get some money . " " All right , " said Mason . " Now , in order to know where I stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that speedometer . " " About what speedometer ? " said the man . " About the speedometer on that Buick car . You set it back , did n't you ? " " No , sir , " said the gardener.  | " Would you say that you set it back if I completed the business arrangements with your wife ? " asked Mason . " What do you mean ? " " Never mind what I mean , " said the lawyer . " You simply tell your wife that if business arrangements are going to be completed between us , I would want to know first whether there would be testimony that the speedometer of that Buick automobile had been set back . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " asked the gardener . " Just this , " said Mason , making little jabbing motionswith his forefinger to emphasize his statements . " We know that Edward Norton telephoned in to the police that his Buick had been stolen . " Now that means that the Buick most certainly was n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buick out . It does n't make any differencewhether Miss Celane was home or not . Somebody had the Buick out . That Buick was missing at the time Norton telephoned . Now , when the police got there , the Buick was in the garage , and the speedometer on the Buick was set back to the same mileage that it showed when it was taken out . So somebody set that speedometer back . Now , the question is , who did it ? " " I did n't , sir , " said the gardener . " How about Devoe , the chauffeur ? " " I do n't know about him , sir . " " How about the butler ? " " I do n't know about him . " " All right , " said Mason . " You do n't know veryp148much about anything , but your wife has a pretty good idea about what 's going on . I want you to tell her that if we are going to do business she has got to find out who set the speedometer back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had it out , sir ? " " No , " said Mason , " I do n't care a damn about the person who had it out . I 'd just as soon the police figuredit was Miss Celane who had the car out . What I want to do is to prove that the speedometer was set back , and I want to find out who set it back . Do you understand ? " " Yes , I think I do now . Yes , sir . " " When is your wife coming back ? " " I do n't know . Some men from the District Attorney'soffice came and talked with her . Then they told her they wanted her to go to the office and make a statement . " " All right , " said Mason . " Do you think you can give her my message ? " " Yes , sir , I know I can . " " All right . See that you do , " Mason told him . " Now there 's one other thing that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were at the time the murder was committed . " " Me ? " said the man . " I was asleep . " " You 're certain about that ? " " Of course I 'm certain . I woke up with all of the commotion going on . " " Your wife was n't asleep , " said Mason . " Who says she was n't ? " demanded Mayfield , his sullen eyes showing some trace of emotion.  | " I do , " said Mason . " Your wife was around the house . She had n't gone to bed when the murder was committed . You know that . " " Well , what of it ? " said Mayfield . " Just this , " Mason remarked , lowering his voice impressively , " there was a woman in the room with the man who struck that blow . Now your wife had intimatedthat woman was Miss Celane , or may have been Miss Celane . I want you to tell your wife that I now have evidence which leads me to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " " You mean , " said the man , bristling , " that you 're accusing my wife of murder ? " " I mean , " said Mason , standing his ground and staring at the belligerent gardener , " that I 'm telling you I have evidence that indicates your wife was the woman who was in the room at the time the blow was struck . That does n't mean that she struck the blow . It does n't mean she knows anything at all about the fact that a blow was going to be struck . But it does mean that she was in the room at the time . " " You want me to tell her that ? " asked Mayfield . " I want you to tell her that , " said Mason . " All right , " said Mayfield , " I 'll tell her that , but she wo n't like it . " " I do n't care whether she likes it or not , " said Mason . " I told you to tell her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there anything else ? " " No , " Mason told him , " except that you want to besure and tell her about this interview when no one islistening . In other words , I do n't want the representa/tives of the District Attorney 's office to know about it . " " Oh , sure , " said Mayfield , " I know enough for that . " " All right , " said Mason , and got in his car and drove down the boulevard . He drove in to a cafe , where he dined leisurely and thoughtfully . By the time he had finished dinner , the newsboys were crying papers on the street , and Perry Mason bought one , took it to his automobile , lounged back against the cushions , turned on the domelight and read the headlines which spread across the top of the page . " NEW MYSTERY IN MILLIONAIRE MURDER . . . . WOMAN IN ROOM AT TIME OF CRIME IS CLAIMED .... POLICE TRACING MARKED MONEY TAKEN FROM BODY OF MILLIONAIRE . . . . HEIRESSSECRETLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARS FOLLOWING VISIT TO PROMINENT LAWYER . " Perry Mason read through each word of the sensationalstory which followed ; a story in which the reporterstold as much as they dared in between the lines ; a story which stopped short of actual accusation , yet which left the public to infer that the police were far from satisfied with the case against Pete Devoe , thep151chauffeur , and were considering a sudden change of front which would involve persons of wealth and prominence . Perry Mason carefully folded the paper , thrust it into the door pocket of the car , and drove , not to his bachelor apartment , but to a downtown hotel where he registered under an assumed name and spent the night.  | PERRY MASON walked into his office , said good morning to Della Street , then went into his privateoffice where the morning newspapers were spread on his desk . Della Street opened the door and followed him into the private office . " Somebody broke in and searched . . . " He whirled on her , placing his finger to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a round of the office . He moved pictures , peering behind them , swung out the revolving bookcase and inspected the wall space , then crawled under the desk . He straightened , smiled , and said : " Looking for a dictograph . There 's just a chance that they 'd have one planted . " She nodded . " Somebody broke into the office last night , " she said , " and went through everything . The safe was opened . " " Did they smash it ? " " No , he must have been some clever crook who knew how to work the combination . The safe was opened , all right . I could tell , because the papers were disturbed . " " That 's all right , " he told her . " What else is new ? " " Nothing , " she said , " except three police detectives watching the office , and I have an idea they 're waiting for someone to come in. "  |p153He  smiled wisely and said : " Let them wait . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers ? " she asked . " Not the morning papers , " he told her . " The late editions say that they 've identified the club that killed Norton , " she told him . " Yes ? " " Yes . It was a heavy walking stick , and they 've found out that it belonged to Rob Gleason , the husbandof our client . " " That 'll mean , " said Perry Mason , " that they 'll charge him with first degree murder , and let the charge against Devoe go . " " They 're also going to charge the woman , " she said , " unless they have already . " " So ? " he asked . " Yes . This secretary , Don Graves , has given some additional information which has changed the entire complexion of the case , according to the STAR . Graves was shielding some one . The police broke him down and he gave additional evidence . " " Well , " he said , " that makes it interesting . If anybodycomes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , staring at him apprehensively . " You 're not going to get mixed into this thing , are you ? " she asked . " Why should I get mixed into it ? " he inquired . " You know what I mean , " she said . " You do too much for your clients . " " What do you mean by that ? " " You know what I mean . You had Miss Celane have a nervous breakdown , and leave here in an ambulance . " He smiled at her . " Well ' ? " he asked . " Is n't it a crime , " she said , " to conceal someone who is wanted by the police ' ? " " Was she wanted by the police then ? " he inquired . " No , " she said , dubiously , " not then , I guess . " " Furthermore , " said Mason , " I am not a physician . I might make an incorrect diagnosis . I thought she was having a nervous breakdown , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She frowned at him and shook her head . " I do n't like it , " she said . " Do n't like what ? " " Do n't like the way you mix into these cases . Why ca n't you sit back and just do your stuff in a court room ? " " I do n't know , I 'm sure , " he told her , smiling . " Maybe it 's a disease . " " Do n't be silly , " she told him . " Other lawyers walk into court and examine the witnesses and then put the case up before a jury . You go out and mix yourself into the cases . " " Other lawyers , " he told her , " have clients who get hung . " " Sometimes they deserve it , " she pointed out . " Perhaps . I have n't had one hung so far , and I have n't had one who deserved it . " She stood staring at him for a moment , then smiled , and there was something almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent ? " she asked  | " That 's what the juries say , " he told her . " And after all , they 're the ones to judge . " She sighed and shrugged her shoulders . " You win , " she said , and went back into the outer office . As the catch clicked , Perry Mason sat down at his desk and spread out the newspapers . He read for fifteen minutes without interruption , and then the door opened . " There 's a Mrs. Mayfield out here , " Della Street told him , " and I have an idea you 'd better see her while the seeing is good . " Perry Mason nodded . " Send her in , " he said , " and make it snappy . There 'll probably be a police detective following on her trail . Stall him off just as long as you can . " The girl nodded , opened the door , and beckoned to the woman who sat in the outer office . As the broad form of Mrs. Mayfield hulked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the passage as possible . Then , as the door was closing behind the housekeeper , he heard Della Street 's voice saying : " I 'm very sorry , but Mr. Mason is in an important conference right now and ca n't be dis-turbed . " Perry Mason nodded to Mrs. Mayfield , got up , crossed the office and turned the lock on the door . " Good morning , Mrs. Mayfield , " he said . She stared at him in black-eyed belligerency . " Good morning ! " she snapped.  | Perry Mason indicated the black leather chair , and Mrs. Mayfield sat down in it , her back very stiff and her chin thrust forward . " What 's this about the speedometer being set back on the Buick automobile ? " she asked . There was the sound of scuffling motion from the outer office , then the noise of bodies pushing against the door , and the knob of the door twisted . The lock held it shut , and Perry Mason kept his eyes fastened on Mrs. Mayfield , holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Norton , " said the lawyer , " reported the Buick automobile as having been stolen . At the time , we thought that Miss Celane was driving it . Now it appearsthat she was not . Therefore , the Buick must have been gone at the time Norton reported its theft to the police . However , we have the mileage record of the car , and it shows that he returned it to his house at 15,304.7 miles . " That means the person who was using it the night of the murder must have either set the speedometer back or disconnected the speedometer when he took it out . " Mrs. Mayfield shook her head . " The car was n't out , " she said . " Are you certain ? " he asked . " Purkett , the butler , " she said , " sleeps right over the garage . He was lying awake in bed , reading , and he 'd have heard anyone take a car out . He says that the garage doors were closed , and that no car went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pressed Mason.  | " No , " she snapped . " The doors make a noise when they 're opened . It sounds very loud up in the room over the garage . Purkett would have heard it , and I want an explanation of this crack that you made to my husband about me being in the room when the murder . . . " " Forget that for a minute , " Mason interrupted . " We 're talking about the car , and our time 's short . I ca n't do any business with you unless I can prove that speedometer was set back . " She shook her head emphatically . " You ca n't do any business with me anyway , " she said . " You 've got things in a fine mess . " " How do you mean ? " " You 've handled things in such a way that the police have dragged Frances Celane into it . " The black eyes snapped at him in beady indignation , and then suddenly filmed with moisture . " You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mason , getting to his feet and facing her accusingly . " You started it by blackmailing her about her marriage , and then you wanted more blackmail to keep her out of this murder business . " The glittering black eyes now showed globules of moisture . " I wanted money , " said Mrs. Mayfield , losing her air of belligerency . " I knew it was an easy way to get it . I knew that Frances Celane was going to have plenty . I did n't see any reason why I should n't have some of it . When she hired you , I knew you were going , to get plenty of money , and I did n't see any reason why I should n't have some.  | " All my life I 've been a working woman . I 've married a husband who is a clod , and has n't ambition or sense enough to come in out of the rain . All my life I 've had to take responsibilities . When I was a girl I had to support my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ambition to keep the family going . For years I 've waited on Frances Celane . I 've seen her live the life of a spoiled lady of leisure . I 've had to slave my fingers to the bone doing housework and seeingthat she had her breakfast in bed , and I 'm tired of it . I did n't see any reason why I should n't have some money too . I wanted lots of money . I wanted people to wait on me . I was willing to do anything to get the money , except to get Frances into real trouble . " Now I ca n't do anything about it . The police corneredme and made me talk , and they 're going to arrest Frances Celane for murder . For murder ! Do you un-derstand ' ? " Her voice rose almost to a shriek . There was an imperative pounding on the door of the office . " Open up in there ! " gruffed a voice from the outside . Perry Mason paid no attention to the commotion at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it would help clear up this mystery , " he said , " do you think you could find someone who would testifythat the car was taken out and that the speedometerwas either disconnected or set back ? " " No , " she said , " that car did n't go out . " ip159Mason started pacing the floor . The knocking at the outer door was redoubled in intensity . Someone shouted : " This is a police detective . Open up that door ! " Suddenly Mason laughed aloud . " What a fool I 've been ! " he said . The housekeeper blinked back the tears and stared at him with wide eyes . " Of course , " said Mason , " that car did n't leave the garage . No car left the garage . " And he smacked his fist down upon his palm . He whirled to the housekeeper . " If you want to do something for Frances Celane , he said , " talk with Purkett again , and in detail . Go over the case with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , he ca n't be shaken in his testimony . " " You want him to say that the car did n't leave the garage ? " asked the housekeeper . " I want him to tell the truth , " said Perry Mason . " But I want him to tell it with sufficient firmness so that he wo n't be rattled on the witness stand by a lot of lawyers . That 's all I want him to testify to  --  just the fact that the car did not leave the garage at any time on that night ; that the garage doors were closed , and that they remained closed , and that no person could have taken a car from the garage without his hearing it . " " Well , " she said , " that 's the truth . That 's what he says . "  | " All right , " he told her , " if you want to do Frances Celane a favor , you get to him and see that no pressure on earth can change that testimony of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He asked hastily : " What did you tell the police about getting money from Frances Celane ? " " Nothing , " she said . " I told them that she gave you money but I did n't know how much , or whether it was in large bills or small bills . " The door creaked under the weight of a body which had been thrown against it . Perry Mason walked to it , snapped back the lock , and opened the door . " What the hell do you mean , " he demanded , " by trying to bust into my private office ? " A burly man with square shoulders , thick neck and scowling forehead , pushed his way into the room . " I told you who I was , " he said . " I 'm a police detec-tive . " " I do n't care if you 're Mussolini , " said Perry Mason . " You ca n't break into my office . " " The hell I ca n't , " said the detective . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little scream . " On what charge ? " asked Perry Mason . " As a material witness in a murder case , " said the detective . Mason remarked : " Well , you did n't get the urge to take her into custody as a material witness until after she came to this office . " " What do you mean ? " asked the detective.  |p16I  " Exactly what I say , " said Mason . " You sat outside and watched this office until you saw Mrs. Mayfield come in . Then you telephoned your superior for instructions , and he told you to pick her up as a material witness before she had a chance to talk with me . " " Pretty smooth , ai n't you ' ? " sneered the detective . Mrs. Mayfield stared from one to the other and said : " But I have n't done anything . " " That ai n't the question , ma'am , " said the detective . " It 's a question of keeping you as a material witnesswhere you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered Perry Mason , " where you wo n't have a chance to talk with anybody except representatives of the District Attorney 's office . " The detective glowered at Perry Mason . " And we understand , " he said , " that you received ten one thousand dollar bills that were stolen from the body of Edward Norton . " " Is that so ' ? " said Mason . " That 's so , " snapped the detective . " Just where do you think those bills are ? " asked the lawyer . " We do n't know , but we intend to find out , " the detective told him . " Well , " said Mason , " it is a free country , or it used to be once . Go ahead and find out . " " When we do , " said the detective , " you 're likely to find yourself facing a charge of receiving stolen prop-erty . " " Well , you 've only got three things to do , " said Mason.  | " What three things ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen , prove that I receivedit , and prove that I knew it was stolen when I received it . " " You know it 's stolen now . " " How do I know it 's stolen ? " " Because I 've told you it was . You 're on notice . " " In the first place , " said Mason , " I 'm not admittingthat I have any ten thousand dollars . In the secondplace , I would n't take your word for anything . " The detective turned to Mrs. Mayfield . " Come along , ma'am , " he said , " we 'll handle this lawyer later . " " But I do n't want to go , " she said . " It 's orders , ma'am , " he told her . " You wo n't be annoyed . We 're simply going to keep you where you 'll be safe until after we can get your testimony . " Perry Mason watched the pair depart from his privateoffice . His rugged face was expressionless , but there was a glint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the outer office had closed , Perry Mason walked to his secretary 's desk and said : " Della , I want you to ring up the STAR . Tell them who you are . They 've got a reporter there named Harry Nevers . He knows who I am . Tell the city editor to have Neverscome and see me . I 'll see that he gets some sensationalnews . " She reached for the telephone . " You want me to tell that to the city editor ? " she asked  | " Yes , " he told her . " I want Nevers sent here right away . " " You do n't want to talk with the editor ? " " No , he 'd plug a rewrite man in on the line , listen to what I had to say , call it an interview , and let it go - at that . I want you to tell them who you are , tell them to send Nevers over here for a hot yarn . They 'll try to pump you about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I 'm not available . " She nodded and lifted the receiver from the hook . Perry Mason walked back to his private office and closed the door.  | HARRY NEVERS was tall and thin , with eyes that looked at the world with a bored expression . His hair was in need of trimming , and his face had that oily appearance which comes to one who has gone long without sleep . He looked as though he had been up all night , and had , as a matter of fact , been up for two . He walked into Perry Mason 's office and perched himself on the arm of the big black leather chair . " I 'm going to give you a break , " said Perry Mason , " and I want a favor . " Nevers spoke in a dull monotone of low-voiced comment . " Sure , " he said . " I had that all figured out a long time ago . Where is she ? " " Where 's who ? " asked Mason . " Frances Celane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " What 's the big idea ? " Nevers yawned and slid back over the arm of the chair , so that he was seated cross-wise in the chair . " Hell , " he said , " do n't try to surprise me . That 's been tried by experts . I doped out the play as soon as I got the call . There was nothing to it . Frances Celane had a nervous breakdown and was rushed to a sanita-=p165rium . Last night the District Attorney uncovered evidencewhich made him decide to put a first degree murder rap on her . She was secretly married to a chap named Gleason . They 've picked up Gleason , and they 're getting ready to go after Frances Celane . " You 're Frances Celane 's attorney . You 've got her tinder cover somewhere . It 's a cover that 's deep enough to keep her from walking into a trap until you 're ready to have her surrender . But you ca n't keep her under cover when the newspapers broadcast that she 's wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , and a hospital . They would n't stand for it , even if you wanted them to . So it 's a cinch you 've got to turn her tip , and you just picked on me to get the news , because you wanted something . Now tell me what you want , and I 'll tell you whether we 'll make a trade . " Perry Mason frowned thoughtfully , and made little drumming noises with his fingertips on the edge of the desk . " I do n't know what I want , Harry , " he said . Larry Nevers shook his head lugubriously . With the hardboiled bunch I 'm working for , brother , if you do n't know what you want , you 're never going to get it . If you 're going to make a trade you 've got to make a trade right now . " " Well , " said Perry Mason slowly , " I can tell you generally what I want . Somewhere along the line I 'm going to try to get two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were similar to those which existed at the time of the murder . I do n't know just how I 'm going to do it . Somewhere along the line I 'm going to make a point about the fact that the Buick automobile , which was reported stolen , was n't taken . out of the garage . All I want you to do is to see that I get a reasonable amount of publicity on those two points . " " Wait a minute , " said Nevers , speaking in that same dull monotone , " you said you were going to make a point that the Buick car had n't been taken out of the garage . You mean that you 're going to claim that it was taken out , but the speedometer was either disconnectedor set back , ai n't that right ? " " No , " Mason told him . " I 'm going to make a point that it was n't taken out of the garage . " For the first time since he had entered the office , the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of tone . " That 's going to be a funny angle for you to play , " he said . " All right , " said Mason , " we 'll talk about that when the time comes . I 'm just telling you now what I want . The question is , do we make a trade ? " " I think so , " said Nevers . " Have you got a photographer lined up ? " " Sure . He 's down in the car waiting , and I 've got a space held on the front page for a picture . " Perry Mason reached for the telephone on his desk , took down the receiver , and said to Della Street , in a low voice : " Get Doctor Prayton on the line . Find out what sanitarium he put Frances Celane in . Get him to makep167out a discharge from the sanitarium , and telephone it over .

You 're getting exclusive photographsand all that . " " Do n't be so cagy , " Nevers told him . " I was just asking an ordinary favor . " " What is it ? " Nevers straightened up slightly in the chair , and said in his low monotone : " Get that jane to show a littleleg . This is a picture that 's going to make the front page , and I want to have a lot of snap about it . Maybe we 'll take a close-up of her face for the front page , with a leg picture on the inside page . But I want to take back some photographs that have got a little leg in them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her so ? You can be frank with her . " " I 'm going to be frank with her all right , " said Nevers , " but you 're her lawyer , and she 'll have confidence in you . Sometimes we have a little trouble getting these janes to pose right when they 're excited . I want you to 1 see that I get a break . "  | " Okay , " Mason told him , " I 'll do the best I can . " Harry Nevers took a cigarette from his pocket , lit it , and looked appraisingly at the attorney . " If we could get her to come down to the STAR office and surrender herself to our custody , " he said , " we 'd see that she got a better break . " Mason 's tone was firm . " No , " he said , " you 're going to get the exclusive story and photographs . That 's the best I can give you . She 's going to surrender to the District Attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding about that . In other words , I want the newspaper accountto tell the public the truth . " Nevers yawned and looked at the telephone . " Okay , " he said . " I wonder if your secretary 's got the calls through yet . . . . " The telephone rang , and Mason took down the receiver . He heard Frances Celane 's voice , eager and excited , at the other end of the line . " What is it ? " she asked . " They wo n't let me have newspapers here . " " All right , " said Mason . " The show 's starting . " " What do you mean ? " she asked . " They 've arrested Rob Gleason for murder . " He heard her gasp , and went on , " They 've identified the club that killed Edward Norton . It was a walking stick that belonged to Rob Gleason . " " Rob Gleason never did it , " she replied swiftly . " He called on my uncle , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle 's study , and ... "  | " Never mind that , " interrupted Perry Mason . ' There 's a chance this line is tapped . They may have detectives listening in on us . You can tell me when you art here .

" I 'm going to surrender you into stody . " " But they have n't charged me with murder yet , ve they ? " " " They 're going to , " he said . " I 'm going to force cir hand . " " Must I do it ? " she asked . " You said you were going to have confidence in me , " told her . " I say you must do it . " " I 'll be in there , " she said , " in just about half an tor . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a moment he jiggled the receiver and said to x secretary : " Get me the office of the District Attorv . I want to talk with Claude Drumm if he 's in . " I It hung up the telephone and faced the reporter . " Listen , " Nevers told him , " you 're going to step our tonsil there . If you tell the D.A . you 're going to surrender the broad , they 'll cover your office and pick r up when she comes in . They 'd rather have her iced up than have her surrender . " Mason nodded . " That 's why you 're going to listen to my talk with the D.A . ' s office , " he said . " It 'll avoid misunderstand-ings . " The telephone rang , and he picked up the receiver . " Hello , " he said . " Hello , Drumm ? This is Mason talking . Yes , Perry Mason . I understand that Rol ) Gleason has been charged with the murder of Edward Norton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is charged as one of the principals . " " There 's another one then ? " asked Mason . " Yes , probably . " " Have charges been filed ? " " Not yet . " " A little birdie , " said Mason , " tells me that you want to charge Frances Celane as being the other prin-cipal . " " Well ? " asked Drumm , his voice still cold and cautious . " What did you call me up for ? " " I called you up to tell you that Frances Celane is on her way to surrender herself into custody at your office . " There was a moment of silence , then Drumm said : " Where is she now ? " " Somewhere between where she is and your office . That is , she 's on the road . " Drumm asked cautiously : " Is she going to make any stops in between times ? " " I 'm sure I could n't tell you , " said Mason . " All right , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to see her . "   " Will there be bail ? " asked Mason . " We 'll have to talk that matter over after she makes u statement to us . " Mason smiled into the telephone . " Do n't misunderstand me , Drumm , " he said . " I told you that she was going to surrender into custody . There wo n't be any statement . " We want to ask her some questions , " said Drumm . " That 's fine , " said Mason . " You can ask her all the uestions you want . She 'll be only too glad to have you do so . " " Will she answer them ? " asked Drumm . " She will not , " said Mason . " If there 's any talking to be done , I 'll do it . " I le heard Drumm 's exclamation of exasperation , peel hung up the receiver . Nevers looked over at him with bored eyes . " They 'll double-cross you , " he said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and they 'll send rn to arrest her here . They 'll make it appear she was crested , rather than giving herself up . " " No , " Mason said , " they think she 's going directly from the sanitarium to the D.A 's office . And , anyway , ou 've heard the conversation . That 'll eliminate misu-nderstandings . " Mason opened a desk drawer , took out a flask ofTye , and set out a glass . The reporter slid the glass backto him along the desk and tilted the bottle to his lips . When he lowered the bottle , he grinned at the lawyer . " My first wife hated to wash dishes , " he said , " so got out of the habit of dirtying them . You know ,   Mason , this may be a hard morning , and I have n't had any sleep for a couple of nights . If I put this bottle in my pocket , it might keep me awake . " Mason reached out and took the bottle . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll know that you do n't get an over-dose . " " Well , " Nevers told him , " under those circumstances , there 's nothing to keep me from going down and getting the photographer , " and he slid down from the arm of the chair and walked through the door which led to the outer office . He was back in five minutes with a photographer who carried a camera in a canvas case in one hand , and tripod in the other . The photographer wasted no time in greetings , but scrutinized the office with an eye that soaked in the lighting arrangements . " What sort of complexion has she got ? " he asked . " Spun silk hair , " said Mason . " Dark eyes , high cheeks , and a good figure . You wo n't have any trouble with her when it comes to posing . She 's expert at placingherself where she looks well . " " I want her in that leather chair , " said the photographer . " That 's where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the shades on the windows , set up the tripod , adjusted and focused the big camera , poured some flashlight powder into a flashgun . " Why do n't you use electric bulbs ? " asked Perry Mason , eyeing the photographer with interest . " IP173understand they do better work , and they do n't get a room all filled with smoke . " " Try telling that to the eagle-eyed bird that audits the expense account , " said the photographer , " and it 's your office . I do n't care about the smoke . " Nevers grinned at Mason . " That 's the sweet spirit of cooperation that we have over at the STAR , " he said . Mason looked at the ceiling of the room and muttered : " I presume I can move out of here for a half an hour just because you fellows want to save the cost of a flashlight globe . " " Give him a shot out of that bottle , " said Nevers , " and maybe he wo n't load the flash quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographer . " Listen , " Nevers said , almost moodily , " something seems to tell me you 've got a trick up your sleeve , Mason . " " I have , " Mason told him . Nevers nodded to the photographer . " All right , Bill , " he said , " better get a photograph of the lawyer at his desk . Drag out some law books . Get that bottle out of the way , and get a couple of shots . " " Do n't waste your film , " Mason told him . " They wo n't publish my picture unless it 's in connection with a courtroom scene , or walking down the street with Frances Celane , or something like that . " Harry Nevers looked at him moodily , and said , in that bored monotone : " I 'm not so certain . It depends on what you 've got up your sleeve . You 've pulled a couple of fast ones lately , and I 'll have these pictures for the morgue in case we need ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . " Perry Mason looked at him shrewdly . " In other words , " he said , " you 've heard that there 's some talk of arresting me as an accessory after the fact . " Nevers chuckled , a dry , rasping chuckle . " You 've got a good mind , Mason , " he said . " But you 've got funny ways of trying lawsuits and representingclients . Now that you mention it , it seems to me I did hear something about some stolen money that you 'd received on a fee and had n't surrendered . " Mason 's laugh was scornful . " If I had received any money , what a sweet spot it would put my client in if I walked into the D.A . ' s office , and laid the money down on the table and said , virtuously : Here it is . ' " " Did you receive any one thousand dollar bills from your client ? " asked Harry Nevers , in the tone of one who asks a question without expecting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I did , " he said , " I 'd either have the bills on me , or some place in the office . The office has been searched from top to bottom . " " This morning ? " asked Nevers . " Some time last night , " Mason told him . Nevers jerked his head toward the photograph . " Better take three pictures , Bill , " he said . " Get him at the desk , get him standing up , and get a close-up . "  | FRAN CELANE sat in the big , black leatherchair , stared at the camera on the tripod , looked at the face of Perry Mason , and smiled , a wan , pathetic smile . " Hold that smile , " said the photographer . " Wait a minute , " said Nevers , " there 's going to be a sex angle to this , and I want a little more leg . " Fran Celane continued to smile wanly . She reached down with her left hand and moved her skirt up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the photographer . Harry Nevers said : " Wait a minute . It still ai n't right . I want a little more leg . " The smile left her face , her black eyes blazed furiously . She reached down and pulled the skirt far up over the knee with an angry gesture . " That 's too much , Miss Celane , " the photographer said . " All right , " she blazed at Nevers , " damn you , you wanted leg ! There it is ! " Mason explained patiently . " You understand , Miss Celane , that these men are friendly to our side of the case . They 're going to see that you get some favorable publicity , but , in order to do that , they 've got to have a picture that will attract the interest of the public . Now , it 's going to help your case a lot if you can get just the right kind of a smile on your face , and at the same time , show just enough of a sex angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter faded from her eyes . She adjusted her skirt down over her knee , and once more the wan , pathetic smile came on her face . " That 's oke , " said Nevers . " Hold it , " said the photographer , and , " do n't blink your eyes . " A puff of white light mushroomed up from the flashgunand a little cloud of smoke twisted and turned as it writhed toward the ceiling . " All right , " said the photographer , " let 's try one with a slightly different pose . Handkerchief in the left hand as though you 'd been weeping , face mournful . Let the mouth droop a little bit . Not quite so much leg . " Frances Celane flared : " What do you think I am , an actress or a mannequin ' ? " " That 's all right , " soothed Perry Mason . " You 'll have a lot of this to go through with , Miss Celane . And I want to caution you to keep your temper . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start playing you up as a tiger-woman , it 's going to be a bad thing for your case . What I 'm trying to do is to get the case brought on for trial , and get a quick acquittal . You 've got to cooperate or you may have some unpleasant surprises . " She stared at Perry Mason , sighed , and took the pose they had suggested . " Chin a little lower and to the left , " said the photog/rapher . " Eyes downcast , but not so far that they give the impression of being closed . Get the point of that shoulder a little bit away from the camera , so I can get the sweep of your throat . All right , that 's fine . Hold it ! " Once more the shutter clicked , and once more the flashlight gave forth a puff of white smoke . " Okay , " said the photographer . " That 's fine for those two . " Perry Mason crossed to the telephone . " Get me Claude Drumm at the District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drumm on the line , he said : " I 'm awfullysorry , Drumm , but Miss Celane is very much indisposed . She 's had a nervous breakdown and was ordered to a sanitarium by her physician . She left the sanitarium to come in and surrender herself into custodywhen she knew that the police were looking for her . She 's at my office now , and she 's suffering from nervousness . I think you 'd better arrange to pick her up here . " " I thought you said she had left your office when you telephoned before , " said Drumm , with a trace of annoyance in his voice . " No , " said Mason , " you misunderstood me . I said that she had started for your office . I told you I did n't know what stops she intended to make on the way . She was nervous , and stopped in here because she wanted nu  --  to go with her . " Drumm said : " All right , the police will be there , " and slammed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I 'd let them know she was coming here to surrenderherself , they 'd have had men parked around to grab her before she got here , " he said . " Oh , well , " said Nevers . " It 's all in the game . I could stand another drink of that whisky if you 've got it handy . " " I could stand a drink myself , " said Fran Celane . Mason shook his head at her . " No , we 're going to be in the middle of action pretty quick , and I do n't want you to have liquor on your breath , Miss Celane . You 've got to remember that every little thing you do , and everything you say , will be snapped up and dished out to the public . " Now remember that under no circumstances are you to talk about the case or to lose your temper . Those are two things you 've got to remember . Talk about anything else , give the reporters plenty of material . Tell them about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how you admire him and what a wonderful man he is . Tell them all about the childhood you had , the fact that your parents died and that your uncle was the same as a father and a mother to you . Try to get the note of the poor little rich girl who has neither father nor mother , but is rolling in coin . " Give them all the material that they want to write sob sister articles and character sketches , and that stuff . But the minute they start talking about the case , or what happened on that night , simply dry up like a clam . Tell them that you 're awfully sorry , that you'dp179like to talk about it , and you do n't see any reason why you could n't , but that your lawyer has given you specificinstructions that he 's to do all the talking . Tell them you think it 's silly , and that you ca n't understand why your lawyer feels that way , because you 've got nothing to conceal , and you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember them , but you 've promised your lawyer , and you 're not going to break your promise to anybody . " They 'll try all sorts of tricks on you , and probably tell you Rob Gleason has made a full confession , or that he has told the officers he has reason to believe that you committed the murder , or that you made certainincriminating statements to him , or they 'll tell you that he has come to the conclusion that you are guilty and has made a confession in order to take the jolt so that you 'll be spared . They 'll try all sorts of stuff . Simply look at them with a dumb expression on your face , and say nothing . And for God 's sake , do n't lose your temper . They 'll probably do things that will make you want to kill them , but if you lose your temper and fly into one of your rages , they 'll spread it all over the front pages of the newspaper , that you 've got an ungovernable temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand , " she said . There was the sound of a siren drifting up through the windows of the office . Frances Celane shuddered . " Well , " said Nevers to the photographer , " get your camera all loaded up , boy , because some of these copsp180will want to get their picture in the paper , taking the suspect into custody . Probably Carl Seaward will show up from the Homicide Squad . He 's one of those birds that likes to stick his stomach in front of a camera and put his hand on the shoulder of the prisoner , with a photograph for the front page labeled : Carl Seaward , intrepid investigator of the Homicide Squad , taking the suspect into custody , marking the termination of a case which has baffled the entire police force for the past forty-eight hours . ' " Maybe I 'd better get in this picture too . I wonder if my hair is on straight . I can pose as the STAR reporterwho assisted the police in locating the suspect . " And Nevers struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances Celane surveyed him in scornful appraisal . " Show a little leg , " she said.  | PAUL DRAKE perched on the edge of Perry Mason'sdesk and shook tobacco from a cloth sack into a brown paper which he held expertly between cigarette-stainedfingers . " Well , " he said , " we 've got our contact with Mrs. Mayfield . But it is n't getting us anything . We had one devil of a time . The police had her in custody as a materialwitness for a while . " " Have you worked the rough shadow business on her yet ' ? " inquired Mason . Not yet . We 're building up to it . We 've got a worninoperative who 's posing as a woman who 's been abroad as a governess , and is now out of work . We 've checked back on Mrs. Mayfield and found all about her early associates . We managed to run one of them down and got all the dope from her about the names of the people she knew , and all that sort of stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Mason . " I 'll I 'll say she 's getting across . She 's got Mrs. Mayfieldconfiding in her , all of her troubles with her husband , and all that sort of stuff . " But she has n't said anything about the murder ' ? " Mason . Not a peep so far . That is , of course , she mentions that she was taken to the District Attorney 's office and held for awhile as a material witness until they got a signed statement out of her , and a lot of that stuff . But she is n't going into details . All that she 's telling is simply a rehash of what she 's told the newspapers . " " How about Don Graves ? " inquired the attorney . " How are you getting along with him ? " Paul Drake put the finishing touches on the cigarette . " We 're making some real progress there , " he said , " We 've got a young lady operative who has contacted him , and Graves is falling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her everything he knows . " " About the case ? " asked Mason . " About the case , about everything . He 's turning himself inside out . " " This woman must be good , " said Mason . " I 'll say she 's good , " explained Drake enthusiastically . " She 'd knock your eye out . She 's got one of those confiding techniques that snuggles up and looks at yon with big eyes , and seems to listen all over . You just naturally ache to tell her things . My God , every time I go out with that broad , I sit down and start telling her all of my troubles ; about the girl that jilted me in my childhood , so that I never got married , and all that stuff . " You 've seen a guy when he 's about nine-tenths drunk , going around and weeping on the necks of total strangers and telling all of his private affairs ? Well , that 's just the way this jane works . She affects the fellows just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her and spill everything . "  | " ' That 's fine , " said Mason . " What have you found " So far , just stuff you do n't want to hear , " said the detective . " It do n't help your client a damn bit . " " All right , " said Mason , " give me the lowdown , and n't try to put a sugar coating on it . Give me the facts . " " The facts are , " said Drake , " that this Celane girld on a pink negligee the night the murder was cornmed . Graves was sent by Edward Norton to ride up with Judge Purley and Arthur Crinston to get somedocuments . He kept looking back toward the house as cy went around the curves in the road and when theyto the point in the road where he could look up atthe window in Edward Norton 's study , he saw some-y standing back of Norton , who was seated at his desk . More than that , he says that he saw the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norton ! lapsed across the desk . He says that he saw the arm , ulder and head of a woman , and that he thinks he is itive of the identity of both the man and the woman . The woman had on a pink negligee . " " He made that statement to the District Attorney 's office ' ? " asked Mason . " Yes , he 's made it , and subscribed and sworn to it . " " That is n't the statement he made the first time , " Mason pointed out . " When they were making their lint investigation , Graves said that he saw the man in the room , who struck the blow , and did n't see anyone Ire except Norton . "  | " That wo n't help you any , " said Drake casually . " You ca n't prove that . " " They took the statement down in shorthand , " said Mason . Drake laughed . " Those notes have been lost . I 'm just telling you in the event you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point to ask one of the newspaper reporters to inquire of the shorthand stenographer who took down the statements there that night . Strange as it may seem , something happened , and the notebook had been misplaced . It 's disappeared . " He grinned at the lawyer . Perry Mason stared down at the surface of his desk , his brows in straight lines of frowning concentration . " The dirty crooks , " he said . " The D.A . always ; howls to high heaven about the crooked criminal law . yers who manipulate the facts . But whenever the D.A . uncovers any evidence that gives the defendant a break , you can bet something happens to it . " The detective shrugged his shoulders . " The D.A . ' s want convictions , " he said . " Can your operative get into Mrs. Mayfield 's room in Norton 's residence , Paul ? " Mason asked . " Sure . That 's a cinch . " " All right , I want her to make a report on every dress that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if there 's a pink dress or a pink negligee in there . " Paul Drake squinted at the lawyer significantly . " It would n't be such a hard job to put one in there , " he said .   " No , " said Mason , " I 'm going to play fair . " " What 's the use of playing fair ? " asked Drake . " They did n't play fair with you . " " I ca n't help that , " said Mason . " I think I 've got an out in this case , and I 'm going to play it fair and square . I think I can beat the rap if I can get a decent break . " " Listen , " said Paul Drake , drawing his feet up to the desk , and sitting cross-legged on the corner of it , " you have n't got an out in this case . They 've got your client as good as convicted right now . Look what they 've got on her . She 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , with that marriagehanging over her head , she either had to kill him , or lose an estate that 's worth a big bunch of money . " ' Phis fellow , Gleason , may have married the womanbecause he loved her , or he may have married her because he wanted her money . Nobody knows which , but he gets all the credit for marrying her for money. c theory of the prosecution is that when he found out about the trust provision , he and the girl tried to reason with Norton . When Norton would n't listen to reason , Gleason made up his mind he 'd bump him off . They had a big squabble . He 'd have killed Norton right then if it had n't been for Crinston coming to keep an : appointment . So Gleason waited around until Crinstonleft , then jimmied a window to make it look as though burglars had broken in from the outside . Then hr cracked down on Norton 's head . " He probably had n't figured on any robbery at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he turned the pockets inside-out . He found so much money in the wallet , he decided to keep it . Then he heard Crinston coming back , and had to do something quick . He knew the chauffeur was drunk , so he dashed down and planted as much of the evidence on him as he could , and then beat it . " Frances Celane was with Gleason when the murder was committed . She 's got the devil of a temper when she gets aroused . Probably she was in a rage , but Gleasonmarried her for her dough . It was a deliberate crime on his part . He 'd probably worked out the burglarplant while Crinston was talking with Norton . When he heard the car coming back , he realized he must have been seen , or that something had gone wrong , so then he framed the chauffeur , just as a secondstring to his bow . " Perry Mason stared at the detective with his eyes cold and hard . " Paul , " he said , " if they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust it wide open . " " You 're not going to bust anything wide open , " Drake told him . " They 've got all kinds of circumstantial evidence . They 've caught the girl in half a dozen lies . Why did she say that she was out in the Buick sedan when she was n't ? They can prove that the car never left the garage . Mrs. Mayfield has worked up that end of the case for them , and the butler will swear positively that the car was there all the time . They can prove the ownership of the club that killed Norton , and they can prove that the girl had some of the money that came from Norton . . . .  |p187Perry  Mason jerked to rigid attention . " They can prove the girl had the money ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Drake . " How ? " asked the lawyer . " I do n't know exactly how , but I do know that it 's part of their case . They 've got it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " " Well , " said Mason wearily , " we 're going to have a chance to find out . I 'm going to force them to bring that case to an immediate trial . " " Force them to an immediate trial ? " exclaimed Drake . " Why I thought you were stalling for delay . The newspapers say that you are . " Perry Mason grinned at him . " That , " he said , " is the way I 'm forcing them to a trial . I 'm yelling for continuances , and asking for additionaltime , as though my clients would be stuck if I did n't get them . Naturally , they 're opposing my continuances . After I 've got the D.A . ' s office to make that opposition sufficiently vigorous , I 'm going to admit that I 'm licked , and let them bring the case on for trial . " Drake shook his head . " They wo n't fall for that one , " he said , " it 's too old . " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , " said Mason . " What I want you to do is to play this rough shadow business on Mrs. Mayfield , and also on Don Graves . I want to see if we ca n't frighten some facts out of them . Neither one of them is telling the truth  --  not yet . And I want to find out more about that money , whether the District Attorney had proof or just suspicions . " " You going to try and saddle the murder off on Mrs. Mayfield and her husband ? " asked Drake . " I 'm going to represent my client to the best of my ability , " Mason insisted . " Yeah , I know that line , " the detective told him , " but what does it mean ? " Mason tapped a cigarette end on the polished surface of the desk . " The way to get to the bottom of a murder , " he said , " is to pick out any pertinent fact which has n't been explained , and find the real explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that 's another generality . Get down to earth . What are you talking about ? " " I 'm talking about the reason Norton had for claimingthe Buick sedan was stolen , " said the lawyer . " What 's that got to do with it ? " Drake wanted to know . " Everything , " insisted Perry Mason . " That 's an unexplainedfact in that case , and until we get the explanation of that fact , we have n't got a solution of the murder . " " That 's a good line of hooey for the jury , " commentedthe detective , " but it does n't really mean anything . You ca n't explain everything in any case . You know that . " " Until you can explain it , " doggedly insisted Mason , " you have n't got a complete case . Now remember that the prosecution is going to rest its case on circum/stantial evidence . In order to get a conviction on circumstantial evidence , you 've got to exclude every reaunablehypothesis other than that of guilt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer talk , " he said . " That does n't mean ything to the newspapers , and the newspapers are ing to be the ones who will determine whether or not r client gets convicted . " " Well , before I get done with this case , " Mason rermarked , " the newspapers are going to figure that Buick r is the most important fact in the entire case . " " But the automobile was n't stolen . It did n't leave garage . " " ' That 's what the butler says . " Drake 's face suddenly became hard with concentratedattention . " You mean that the butler is lying ? " he asked . " I 'm not making any statements right now , " said Mason .. Drake spoke in a monotone , as though thinking out id . " Of course if the butler had taken the car and disconnected the speedometer , and maybe gone for a little vr , and Norton had telephoned the police that the was stolen , and he wanted the driver picked up , matter who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out about that telephone 11 ... " Ills voice trailed off into silence . He sat motionless for a few minutes , then shook his head sadly . " No , Perry , " he said , " that wo n't work . "  | " All right , " said Mason , smiling , " I 'm not asking you what 'll work and what wo n't work . I want facts out of you . Get the hell off of my desk , and let me go to work . Put your rough shadows to work just as soon as you can . I 'm anxious to find out what they uncover . " " You 're representing both Gleason and the woman , eh ? " asked Drake . " Yes , I am now . Frances Celane is going to stand by her husband . She 's told me to represent him . " " All right , I 'm going to ask you something that 's been asked me by a dozen different people , I hope you wo n't take any offense , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talking about it .

" " I could n't get separate trials for them , " said Mgtson . " The court would n't allow it . " " Well , you could at least make the attempt , " said the detective . " No , " said Mason with a smile , " I rather think Fin satisfied the way things are now . I think we 'll try them together . " " Okay , " said Drake , " you 're the doctor . I 'll get the rough shadows at work just as soon as I can . "  | PERRY MASON appeared at the entrance to the visitors ' room in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the officer in charge . " You 're Gleason 's attorney ? " asked the officer . " Yes . " " You did n't appear for him as his attorney when he first came in . " Perry Mason frowned . " I 'm his attorney now , " he said . " Do you want to bring him out , or do you want me to go into court and show that the officers have refused to permit me to talk with my client ? " The officer stared at Mason , shrugged his shoulders , turned on his heel without a word , and vanished . Five minutes later he opened a door and escorted Mason into the long room . A table ran the length of this room . Along the middle  --  of the table , stretching to a height of some five feet above it , was a long screen of heavy iron mesh . The prisoners sat on one side of this screen . The attorneysat on the other . Robert Gleason was seated about half way down the table . He got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason approaching . Perry Mason waited until the officer had moved out of earshot , then dropped into the chair , and looked searchinglyacross at the man accused of murder . " Keep your voice low when you answer questions ,  | Gleason , " said Mason , " and tell me the truth . No matter what it is , do n't be afraid to tell me the exact truth . " " Yes sir , " said Gleason . Mason frowned at him . " Did you make a statement to the District Attorney ? " he asked . Gleason nodded his head . " A written statement ? " " It was taken down in shorthand by a court reporter , and then written up and given to me to sign . " " Did you sign it ? " " I have n't yet . " " Where is it ? " " It 's in my cell . They gave it to me to read . That is , they gave me a copy . " " That 's funny , " said Mason . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't let you have a copy . " " I know , " said Gleason , " but I did n't fall for that . They tried to rush me into signing it , and I told them I was going to think it over . " " It wo n't do you much good , " the lawyer told him , wearily , " if you talked in front of a court reporter , he took down everything you said , and he can testify to the conversation from his notes . " " That 's what the District Attorney 's office told me , " said Gleason . " But I 'm not signing , just the same . " " Why not ? " " Because , " said Gleason , in a low voice , " I think that I 'll repudiate what I said . "  | " You ca n't do it , " the lawyer told him . " Why thedevil did you have to shoot off your mouth ? " " I can do it the way I intend to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Repudiate the confession . " " All right , show me , " said the lawyer . " I intend to take the entire responsibility for the murder , " Gleason told him . Perry Mason stared at the man through the coarse screen of the partition . " Did you commit the murder ? " he asked . Gleason bit his lips , turned his head so that his eyes were averted from those of the attorney . " Come on , " said Perry Mason . " Come through , and ) me clean . Look up at me and answer that question . 1 ) ) d you commit the murder ? " Rob Gleason shifted uncomfortably in the chair . " I 'd rather not answer that question just yet , " he said . " You 've got to answer it , " Perry Mason told him . Gleason wet his lips with the tip of a nervoustongue , then leaned forward so that his face was almostagainst the coarse iron screen . " Can I ask you some questions before I answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " you can ask me all the questionsyou want , but you 've got to come clean on that before I leave here . If I 'm going to act as your attorney , I 've got to know what happened . " " The District Attorney 's office told me that Frances had been caught with some of the money that Mr. Nortonhad in his possession when he was killed . " " Do n't believe everything the District Attorney 's office tells you , " Mason answered . " Yes I know . But the point is , did she have that money ? " " I 'll answer that question by asking you another , " said Perry Mason . " Did Mrs. Mayfield make any statementto the District Attorney about having money in her possession , that she had received from Frances Ce-lane ? " " I do n't know , " said Gleason . Perry Mason chose his words carefully . " If , " he said , " the District Attorney 's office has any proof of Frances Celane having any of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , they found Mrs. Mayfield with the money , and she passed the buck to Frances Celane . Now , if that happened , there 's just as much reason to believe that Mrs. Mayfield was in the room at the time of the murder , and took the money from the body of the dead man , as to believe that Frances Celane gave it to her . " " Are they sure that there was a woman in the room at the time of the murder ? " Gleason inquired . " Don Graves says there was . " " He did n't say that the first night . " " We ca n't prove what he said the first night because the police have torn up the notes of the statement he made . "  | " He says now that there was a woman there ' ? " " Yes , he says there was a woman . I think he 's going to say it was a woman who wore a pink negligee . " " Did he see her plainly enough to identify her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and part of her head  - -  probably the back of her head . " " Then Mrs. Mayfield is trying to pin this crime on Fran ? " asked Rob Gleason . " I 'm not saying that , " said Mason . " I 'm simply givyouthe facts as I know them . If the District Attorney'soffice has proof of any money , that 's where they got it . " " How much chance do you stand of getting Fran off ' ? " asked Gleason . " One never knows what a jury is going to do . She 's y oung and attractive . If she keeps her temper and does n't make any damaging admissions , I stand a pretty good chance . " Gleason stared through the screen at the lawyer for a few moments , and then said : " All right , I 'm not attractive . I have n't got any of the things in my favor that Frances has . How much chance do you stand of getting me off ? " " It depends on the kind of a break I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Attorney , " said Mason . Now , I 'm going to tell you what I want you to do . You go back to your cell and get some paper . Say that you want to write out what happened , in your own handwriting . Take that paper and scribble a lot of meaningless stuff on a few pages of it , and then tear it up . Let them believe that you used up all the paper , but take the rest of the paper and write out a copy of the statement that the District Attorney has given you to sign . In that way , I 'll know exactly what you said , and what you did n't say . " Rob Gleason swallowed twice painfully . " If , " he said , " you do n't get the breaks , they may convict Fran ? " " Of course , she 's charged with first degree murder , and there 's some circumstances in the case that do n't look so good . " " Would they hang her ? " " Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hang women , as a rule . " " Do you know what it would mean to a girl of her fire and temperament to be shut up in a penitentiary for the rest of her life ? " asked Gleason . Perry Mason shook his head impatiently . " Of course I know , " he said . " Let 's not start worryingabout that now . Let 's get down to facts . Tell me , did you , or did you not , murder Edward Norton ? " Gleason took a deep breath . " If , " he said , " the case commences to look hopeless for Fran , I 'm going to confess . " " Confess to what ? " asked Mason . " Confess to the murder of Edward Norton ; confess that I married Frances Celane for her money ; that I did n't care very much about her . I liked her well enough , but I was n't crazy about her . She had a great big bunch of money , and was a good catch . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married her.  |p197Then  I found out that because she had married , her uncle had the right to cut her off with almost nothing . Her uncle did n't know about the marriage until the night he was killed . He found it out then . He was going to exercise the discretion given to him under the trust , and turn everything over to the charitable institutions , leaving Fran with just a lousy thousand or wo . I went in and argued with him . He would n't listen to reason . Fran went in and argued with him , and hat did n't do any good . Then Crinston came , and he ad an appointment with Crinston , so we had to let ouratter go . Fran and I went back down to her room. e sat and talked things over . Mrs. Mayfield came in , ml was furious . She 'd been blackmailing Fran , threatening to tell Mr. Norton about the marriage , unlessr got a bunch of jack . Edward Norton had found out bout the marriage , and that had killed the goose thatid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crinston drive away . He took Don Graves with him . I went out to have a last word with Mr. Norton . I went up to his study , and on the stairs I ran into Mrs. Mayfield . She wore a pink negligee , and she was still weeping about the money that she 'd lost . I told her if she 'd keep her head , we could have lots of money . She wanted to know what I meant , and I told hrr I was going to give Norton one more chance to come through . If he did n't take it , I was going to smash his head for him before he had a chance to give Frances Celane 's money to charity . She went with me tip the stairs and into his study . I gave Edward Norton his ultimatum . I told him that if he did n't give Fran- ces her money , he was going to be sorry . He told me that he was not going to give her a cent ; that he was going to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the head . I went through his pockets , and he had a big bunch of dough in his pockets . I took some , and Mrs. Mayfield took some . We were talking about how we were going to make the murder look as though burglars had done it . Mrs. Mayfield said we could pry up a window and leave some footprints outside in the soft loam . I wanted to plant it on the chauffeur because I knew he was drunk . While we were talking it over , we saw the lights of an automobile coming down the hill , and I figured it must be Crinston coming back . Mrs. Mayfield ran down and fixed the window so it looked as though burglars had come in , and I ran down and planted a stick and a couple of the thousand dollar bills in Devoe 's room . Then I jumped in my car and beat it . " Perry Mason looked at the young man thoughtfully . " What did you do with the money that you had ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where it will never be found . " Perry Mason drummed with the tips of his fingers on the table . " So help you God , " he asked , " is that what happened ? " Gleason nodded his head . " That 's in confidence , " he said . " I 'm going to beat the rap if I can . If I ca n't , I 'm going to come clean so that Frances Celane wo n't have to take the jolt. " pI99 " Did you , " asked Perry Mason , " take out the Buick automobile on the night of the murder ? Did you use it at all ? " " No . " Perry Mason pushed back the chair . " All right , " he said . " Now I 'm going to tell you something . If you ever spill that story , you 're going to get Frances Celane sent up for life , if you do n't get her hung . Probably you 'll get her hung . " Rob Gleason 's eyes grew wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " Simply , " said Perry Mason , " that nobody will believethe story the way you tell it . They 'll believe just half of it . They 'll believe that you committed the murderall right , but they 'll figure that it was n't Mrs. Mayfield that was with you . They 'll figure that it was Fran Celane , and that you 're trying to protect her by , dragging Mrs. Mayfield into it . " Gleason was on his feet , his face white , his eyes wide . " Good God ! " he said . " Ca n't I save Frances by telling the truth ? " " Not that kind of truth , " said Perry Mason . " Now go back to your cell and get me a copy of that statementthe District Attorney wants you to sign . In the meantime , keep your head and do n't tell anybody any-thing . " " Not even the truth , the way I told it to you ? " asked Gleason . " The truth is the last thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the way you 're situated . Because nobody 's going to believe you if you do tell the truth , and you 're a rotten liar . " He turned on his heel and walked away from the screen meshed table , without a single backward glance . The officer opened the locked door , and let him out of the visiting room.  |p201IT  WAS the first time Frank Everly had ever been in I court with Perry Mason ; the first time he had ever been behind the scenes in a big murder case . He sat at the side of Perry Mason and stared surreptitiouslyat the crowded courtroom , at the nine men and three women who were in the jury box , being examined as to their qualifications as jurors . He strove to give the impression of being thoroughly at home , but his manner betrayed his nervousness . Perry Mason sat at the counsel table , leaning back in the swivel chair , his left thumb hooked in the armholeof his vest , his right hand toying with a watch chain . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man gave any indication of the terrificstrain under which he labored . Behind him sat the two defendants : Frances Celane in a close fitting costume of black , with a dash of white and a touch of red , her head held very erect , her eyes calm and a trifle defiant . Robert Gleason was nervous , with the nervousness of an athletic man who finds himself fighting for his life under circumstances that necessitate physical passivity . His eyes smouldered with the sullen fires of suppressedemotions . His head jerked from time to time as he turned to face the various speakers in the drama which so intimately concerned him.  | The courtroom was filled with that peculiar atmospherewhich permeates a crowded room where spectatorsare in a state of emotional unrest . Claude Drumm was acting as the trial deputy for the state , but there was a rumor that the District Attorneyhimself would come into the case as soon as the jury had been selected , and the routine evidence disposed of . Drumm had been on his feet much of the time in his examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet forcefully aggressive , without displaying too much force . His manner held the easy assurance of a professional who is fully at home and who is driving steadily toward a predetermined goal which he is assured of reaching . Judge Markham , beneath the cloak of his austere judicial dignity , held himself with wary watchfulness . Perry Mason had the reputation of being able to " stampede , " every case he tried , and Judge Markham was determined , that while the trial would be conductedwith impartiality , it would be conducted with a proper regard for the dignity of law and order ; that there would be no errors in the record , no opportunities for the dramatic manipulation of emotions which so frequently turned trials in which Perry Mason participatedinto spectacular debacles for the prosecution , crashing across the front pages of newspapers in glaringheadlines . " The peremptory , " said Judge Markham sternly , " is with the people . "  |p203Claude  Drumm dropped back to his chair and engaged in a whispered consultation with his assistant . I le interrupted , to glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's indulgence , Your Honor . " " Very well , " said the judge . Everly looked at Perry Mason inquiringly , and caught a glint in the lawyer 's eyes . Mason leaned forward and whispered : " Drumm wants to get number three off of the jury , but he thinks we have got to get off jurors nine and eleven . We 've got twice as many peremptory challengesas he has , so he 's wondering if he dares to pass his peremptory and hold it in reserve until he sees what the jury looks like later on . " " Does he dare to do it ? " asked Everly . " That , " said Perry Mason , " remains to be seen . " There was a moment of tense silence , then Drumm got to his feet and bowed to the court . " The people , " he said , " pass their peremptory . " Judge Markham looked down at Perry Mason , and his lips moved to form the words : " The peremptory is with the defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry Mason , turning toward the jury with a casual glance of appraisal , as though the entire matter had just claimed his attention , said , in a clear voice : " Your Honor , this jury seems entirely satisfactory to the defendants . We waive our peremptory challenge . " Claude Drumm was caught by surprise . Eyes of those who were wise in courtroom technique , saw thep2o4 quick intake of his breath as he started unconscious y to register a protest which his consciousness knew would be futile . Judge Markham 's voice rang out through the crowded courtroom : " Let the jurors stand and be sworn to try the case . " Claude Drumm made an opening statement to the jury which was remarkable for its brevity . " Gentlemen , " he said , " we expect to show that , at the exact minute of eleven thirty-two on the twenty. , third day of October of this year , Edward Norton methis death ; that he was murdered by a blow on the head , struck with a club held in the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the murder , there was present as an active accomplice , the defendant , Frances Celane ; that at the time of the murder , Ed  --  ward Norton had a large sum of money on his person in the form of one thousand dollar bills . " We expect to show that at the hour of eleven four teen on that date , Edward Norton telephoned to the police station , reporting the theft of one of his auto  --  mobiles , a Buick sedan ; that Frances Celane was , in fact , present in the study of Edward Norton at the hour of eleven thirty-two P.M. , on the date of the murder , but that , for the purpose of trying to establish an alibi , and knowing that Edward Norton had reported this Buick sedan as having been stolen at the hour of eleven fourteen , the said defendant , Frances Celane , then and there stated falsely and wilfully that she had been distant from the scene of the crime , in the saidp2O5Buick automobile , from the hour of approximately ten forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that immediately following the commission of the crime , the defendants left the bloody club with which the crime had been committed , and two of the one thousand dollar bills which had been stolen from the body of the deceased , in the bedroom of one Pete Devoe , who was then and there asleep and in an intoxicated condition ; that this was done for the purpose of directing suspicion to the said Pete Devoe . " We will also show that the defendants forced open a window and made footprints in the soil beneath the window , in an attempt to lead the police to believe burglars had entered the house . " We also expect to show that immediately thereafterthe defendant Robert Gleason fled from the scene of the crime ; that both defendants gave false and contradictoryaccounts as to their whereabouts ; that the club with which Edward Norton was struck down was n walking stick belonging to the defendant , Robert Gleason . " We expect to show that an eye-witness actually saw the murder committed , and will identify Robert Glea bon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celane as the young woman who , attired in a pink dress or negligee , aided and abetted the commision of the crime . " Claude Drumm stood staring at the jurors for a moment , then sat down . Judge Markham looked inquiringlyat Perry Mason.  | " If the court please , " said Perry Mason , " we will withold our opening statement until the time we start to present our case . " " Very well , " said Judge Markham . " You may proceed , Mr. Drumm . " Claude Drumm started building up the case with that calm , deadly efficiency for which he was noted . No detail was too small to claim his attention ; no link in the chain of evidence was to be overlooked . The first witness was a surveyor who had mapped and photographed the premises . He introduced diagramsdrawn to scale , showing the room in which the body had been found , the furniture in the room , the location of the windows . Then he produced a photograph of the room , other photographs of various cornersof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the diagram of the room . Then followed photographs of the house , and finally , a map showing the house with reference to the winding road which climbed up to the boulevard . Following that came a contour map showing the various elevations of the windows in the house , with reference to the road along which the automobile had traveled . " So that , " said Drumm , suavely , indicating a place on the diagram where a curve in the road was shown , " it would be perfectly possible for a person traveling along this section of the road which I am indicating , in an automobile , to glance back and see into the room marked number one on the map , People 's Exhibit A ? " Before the surveyor could answer the question , Perryp207Mason got to his feet and raised his voice in protest : " Just a moment , Your Honor , " he said . " That question is leading . It also calls for a conclusion of the witness . It calls for a conclusion which the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the points upon which we intend to convince this jury of the improbability of the People 's case . Whether or not ... " The gavel of the judge banged down upon his desk . " The objection , " he said , " is sustained . The argument , Mr. Mason , is unnecessary . " Mason dropped back to his chair . With the manner of one who has scored a victory even in defeat , Drumm bowed smilingly to Mason . " Counsellor , " he said , " you may inquire on cross-examination . " With the eyes of everyone in the courtroom riveted upon him , Perry Mason , fully aware of the dramatic advantage of the moment , and the interest which would attend upon his first question , strode to the map which had been fastened to the blackboard with thumb tacks , placed the index finger of his right hand upon the curve in the line which indicated the roadway from the house to the boulevard , placed the index finger of his left hand upon the location of the study in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with challenge : " Exactly how far is it from the point which I am indicating with my right forefinger , and which is the curve in this roadway , to the point which I am indicating with my left finger , and which is the point where the body was found ? "  | " If , " said the witness in level tones , " your right forefinger is exactly at the point where the curve swings farthest south , and your left forefinger is at a point representing the exact point where the body was found , the distance is exactly two hundred and seventy-two feet , three and one-half inches . " Perry Mason turned , his face showing surprise . " Two hundred and seventy-two feet , three and onehalfinches ? " he exclaimed incredulously . " Yes , " said the witness . Mason dropped his hands to his sides with a gesture of finality . " That , " he said , " is all . I have no further questions to ask of this witness . " Judge Markham looked at the clock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves on a tree are stirred by the first current of an advancing breeze . " It has , " said the judge , " approached the hour of adjournment . The court will adjourn until ten o'clock to-morrow morning , and during that time , the jury will remember the admonition of the court not to converse amongst themselves about this case , nor permit others to converse with them or in their presence about it . " The gavel banged on the desk . Perry Mason smiled craftily , and remarked to his assistant : " Drumm should have carried on the examinationuntil the hour for adjournment . Giving me the opportunity to ask that one question , will make the newspapers feature it to-morrow morning . "  |p209Everly  had his eyes puckered in concentration . " Two hundred and seventy-two feet is a long distance , " he said . " It wo n't , " Mason assured him grimly , " get any shorter as the case goes on . "  | THE newspapers predicted that the first major witnessfor the prosecution would be either Arthur Crinston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Graves , who had been the only eye-witness of the murder . In this , the newspapers showed that they underestimatedthe dramatic trial tactics of the chief trial deputy . Drumm would no more have plunged into the drama of that murder without preparing the minds of the jurors for the gruesome tidbit , than would a playwrighthave opened his presentation with a crisis lifted from the third act . He called to the stand , instead , Judge B. C. Purley . Necks craned as the Municipal Judge , coming in from the back of the courtroom , strode down the aisle with the stately bearing of one who realizes to the full the dignity of his appearance , and the importance of his position . White-haired , ponderous , deep-chested and heavywaisted , he held up his right hand while the oath was administered to him , and then took the witness chair , his manner indicating a respect for the tribunal and what it stood for , a dignified tolerance of the attorneys and jurors , a calm disregard of the restless spectators . " Your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes sir . " " You are now a duly elected , qualified and acting Judge of the Municipal Court of this city ? " " I am . " " And , on the night of October twenty-third of this year you had occasion to be in the vicinity of the residenceof Edward Norton ? " " I did . " " At what time did you arrive at the residence of Edward Norton , Judge Purley ? " " At precisely six minutes after eleven . " " And what time did you leave that vicinity ? " " At precisely thirty minutes past eleven . " " Will you explain to the jury , Judge Purley , why it is that you are able to testify with such exactness as to the time of arrival and departure ? " Perry Mason recognized the trap , yet had no alternativebut to walk into it . " Objected to , Your Honor , " he said . " The witness has given his testimony . The mental processes which led up to it are incompetent , irrelevant , immaterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sustained , " said Judge Markham . Claude Drumm 's smile was ironically sarcastic . " I will withdraw the question , Your Honor , " he said . " It was an error upon my part . After all , if CounsellorMason desires to go into the matter , he is at libertyto do so upon cross-examination . " " Proceed , " said Judge Markham , pounding his desk with the gavel.  | " Who was with you on the occasion of your visit ? " asked the deputy district attorney . " Mr. Arthur Crinston was with me when I went to the vicinity of the house , and both Mr. Arthur Crinston , and Mr. Don Graves were with me at the time I departed . " " What happened while you were there , Judge Pur-ley ? " " I arrived at the grounds in the vicinity of the house , stopped my car to allow Mr. Crinston to get out , turned my car , shut off the motor , and waited . " " During the time that you were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first ten or fifteen minutes , and looked at my watch rather impatiently several times during the last part of the period I was waiting , " said Judge Purley . And he glanced , with just a trace of subdued triumph , at Perry Mason , his manner indicating that , being fully familiar with court procedure , he was going to get the damaging parts of his testimony in , whether the defense wanted them in or not . The inference to be drawn from the fact that he had glanced several times at his watch was that he was aware of the exact minuteof his departure , and he was sufficiently adroit to get that inference across to the jury without violating the ruling of the court . Perry Mason eyed the witness with placid indifference . " Then what happened ? " asked Claude Drumm . " Then Mr. Crinston came out of the house to joinp213me . I started the motor of my car , and at that moment the window of the house in the southeast corner of the building was opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " " Just a moment , " said Claude Drumm . " Do you know of your own knowledge that that was Mr. Norton'sstudy ? " " No sir , " said Judge Purley . " I only know it from the fact that it was the room in the southeast corner on the second story of the house , and is the room marked on the map and diagram as room number one , Mr. Norton 's study . " " Oh , " said Drumm , " then the room is that which is indicated on Plaintiff 's Exhibit A by the figure one marked in a circle ? " " Yes sir . " " Very well , " said Drumm , " what did Mr. NortonEay2 " " Mr. Norton called down to Mr. Crinston , and said , as nearly as I can remember : Arthur , would it be all right for you to take Don Graves in to your house in your car and let him get the documents ? Then I will vend the chauffeur to pick him up . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened next ? " " Mr. Crinston said , as nearly as I can remember : I am not in my own car , but with a friend . I will have to ask my friend if it will be all right . ' " " Then what happened ? " " Mr. Norton said : Very well , do so , and let me know , ' and withdrew his head from the window . " " Then what happened ? "  | " Then Mr. Crinston came to me and said that Mr. Graves was to get some documents . . . " " Objected to , " said Perry Mason in a casual tone of voice . " Anything which took place without the hearing of this defendant is admissible only as a part of the res gestae . By no stretch of the imagination can this be considered as a part of the res gestae . " " The objection is sustained , " said Judge Markham . " Very well . Then what happened ? " asked Drumm suavely , smiling over at the jury as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense is in this case , ladies and gentlemen ? " " Then , " said Judge Purley , " Mr. Crinston went back to a position under the study window , and called up , as nearly as I can remember his words : It 's all right , Edward . He can go with us . ' And at about that moment , the front door opened and the figure of Mr. Graves ran down the steps , Mr. Graves saying I am ready , ' or words to that effect . " " And then what happened ? " " Then the three of us got in my automobile , Mr. Crinston sitting in the front seat with me , Mr. Graves sitting in the rear seat . I started the machine and started to drive up along the road , lettered on the map People 's Exhibit B ' as Winding Roadway . ' We traveledup that road until we were in a position on the curve ... " " Just a moment , " said Claude Drumm . " Can you take a pencil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached when the event took place , concerning which you were about to testify ? "  |p215Judge  Purley nodded , got to his feet , and walked with ponderous dignity to the blackboard , turned up the map and marked a small oblong on the curve in the roadway . " This represents the approximate position of the car . " " And what happened when the car was in that position ? " asked Claude Drumm . " Mr. Graves looked back through the back window and exclaimed ... " " Objected to , " snapped Perry Mason . " Hearsay , incompetent , irrelevant , and immaterial , not part of the res gestae , not binding upon the defendant . " " Sustained , " said Judge Markham . Claude Drumm made a helpless gesture . " But surely , Your Honor , in view of what is to take place . . . " " The objection , " said Judge Markham coldly , " is sustained . You may call Mr. Don Graves at the proper moment , counsellor , and let him testify as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or done outside of the presence of this defendant , and which is not a part of the res gestae , the objection is well taken . " " Very well , " said Drumm , turning to the jury , and . all but bowing , " at the proper time I will call Mr. DonGraves , and Mr. Don Graves will testify as to exactly what he saw at that place . " Go on , Judge Purley , and tell the jury exactly what was done at that time and place , with reference to what you , yourself , did in relation to the operation of the automobile . "  | " I did nothing at exactly that place , but proceeded along the winding road , as indicated there on the map , for a distance of several rods , until I came to a place in the road which was wide enough to turn . There 1 turned the car by backing and twisting , and went back down the winding roadway , stopping once more in front of the house of Edward Norton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then Mr. Graves and Mr. Crinston entered thehouse , and at their request I accompanied them . The three of us went up the stairs and into the room markedby the numeral one ' in a circle on People 's Exhibit A , and saw there a body , which was subsequently identifiedto me as that of Edward Norton , lying sprawled across the desk , with its head badly crushed . The body was lifeless at the time of my arrival . There was a telephone near one hand , and several papers , including a policy of automobile insurance , on the desk . " " Did you notice , Judge Purley , what automobile was covered in that policy of insurance ? " " Objected to as incompetent , irrelevant and immaterial , " said Perry Mason . " Your Honor , " said Drumm , " this is vital , and I propose to connect it up . It is a part of the theory of the prosecution that the defendant , Frances Celane , made a statement to the effect that she was out driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been advised that police had been notified that the Buick automobile had been stolen . In other words , she knew that Edward Norton had telephonedp217t hat the Buick automobile had been stolen . Frances Celane , knowing that . . . " " Very well , " said Judge Markham , " there is no ne --  ssity for further argument , counsellor , as to the relevancyof the testimony . Upon the assurance of the prosecution that the matter will be connected , I will overrule the objections as to its relevancy , and permit the question to be answered , subject to a motion on the p:irt of the defense to strike out if the evidence is not uhsequently connected . " This ruling , however , goes only to the relevancy of the testimony . It is , of course , apparent that the evidencecalled for by the question is not the best evidence . The automobile insurance policy , itself , is the lx  --  st evidence of its contents , but there seems to be no objection made upon that ground . " Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on his face . Perry Mason seemed to smile , the faintest trace of a , leiiver at the corners of his lips . " No , Your Honor , " he said , " there is no objection upon that ground . " " Very well , " snapped Judge Markham , " the objection , as made , is overruled . Answer the question . " " The policy , " said Judge Purley , " as I noticed at the time , or a few minutes later , covered a Buick sedan number 6754093 , with a license number 12M1834 . " Claude Drumm made a gesture with his hand . Ii " You may cross-examine the witness , Mr. Mason , " ii lie announced.  | Perry Mason regarded Judge Purley with a placid smile . " Judge Purley , " he said , " did I understand you to say that when you went into the study you saw the body of Edward Norton lying across the desk ? " " You did not , " snapped Judge Purley . " I stated that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me as being that of Edward Norton . " Perry Mason looked crestfallen . " My mistake , " he said . There was a moment of silence , during which Judge Purley gazed at the courtroom with an air of **27;1789;TOOLONG , the air of one who has given testimonyin a very credible manner , and the manner of one who has confidence in his ability to avoid any trap which can be set for him by cross-examining counsel . " You see , " explained Judge Purley , " I had never personally met Mr. Norton , despite the fact that I was quite friendly with Mr. Crinston and had , upon at least one prior occasion , driven Mr. Crinston to Mr. Norton 's house . " Perry Mason seemed to be smiling . " On how many occasions had you discussed any business matters with Mr. Norton on the telephone ? " he asked . Judge Purley showed his surprise . " Why , I never talked with the man on the telephone in my life , " he said . " Then you 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with him ? " Judge Purley 's eyes bulged with surprise.  | " Good heavens , no ! Of course not ! " " Had you , " asked Perry Mason , " ever discussed this trust fund with anyone else ? " Drumm was on his feet . " Your Honor , that is objected to , not proper crossexamination , hearsay , incompetent , irrelevant , immaterial . Counsel has simply started upon a round-about way of calling for conversations which could not possibly . . . " " Sustained ! " snapped Judge Markham . Drumm sat down . There was silence in the courtroom . Perry Mason 's face was expressionless . " Any further questions ? " asked Judge Markham . " No , Your Honor , " announced Perry Mason , to the surprise of the courtroom . " There is no further cross-examination. "  | " CALL Sergeant Mahoney , " said Claude Drumm . Sergeant Mahoney , attired in a uniform , stepped to the front of the clerk 's desk , held up his right hand to be sworn , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. L.

" Perry Mason started to his feet , but Claude Drumm was the one who interrupted the witness . " Just a moment , Sergeant , " he said . " Let me cam tion you that you are under oath , and are to testify only to the things which you know of your own knowledge . You did n't know that that call came from EdwardNorton .

" There is no objection to it , in any event , Your I lonor , " said Perry Mason . " Very well , " said Judge Markham . " Proceed , Ser-geant . " " This call came in , and I noticed the time of it , " said Sergeant Mahoney . " It was fourteen minutes past eleven . The man said that he was Edward Norton , and that he wanted to report a stolen automobile , that a Buick sedan , belonging to him , No. 6754093 , with a license number of 12M1834 had been stolen , and that he wanted the car picked up and the driver arrested , no matter who the driver might be .

" Of course it came in all at once , " said the sergeant Perry Mason reached in his brief case and took out . a newspaper . " You made a statement to the newspaper reporters when this matter was more fresh in your mind , Ser-geant ? " " Well , I believe I said something to them the next morning , yes . " " And did n't you state at that time that the call was interrupted ' ? " " Just a moment , " said the Deputy District Attorney . " That is not the proper way to lay a foundation for an impeaching question . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Court please , " said Perry Mason . Sergeant Mahoney made frantic gestures . Judge Markham smiled and said : " I think from the demeanor of the witness that his recollection has been refreshed . Proceed , Sergeant . " " That 's right , " said Sergeant Mahoney , " I remembernow . The call came in , and he was cut off right in the middle of the conversation  --  right at the first part of it , I think it was . He gave his name and address and wanted to know if he was talking with the police department , and said he had a crime to report . Then the line went dead . I looked up his telephone number in the book , to call him back , when the call came in again , and he went right along talking . He said he 'd been cut off . " " That , " said Perry Mason , with emphasis , " is all . " Claude Drumm looked puzzled . " What 's that got to do with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . " Order ! " he snapped . " Is there any redirect examination , counsellor ? " " None , " said Claude Drumm , but his eyes were thoughtful as he stared at Perry Mason . " The next witness , " said Judge Markham . " Arthur Crinston , " snapped Claude Drumm . Arthur Crinston arose from a seat within the bar , walked to the clerk , was sworn , and took the witness stand . " Your name is Arthur Crinston , and you are the survivingpartner of the firm of Crinston &; Norton , the said firm being composed of yourself and Edward Nor-ton ? " " That is correct , sir . " " Edward Norton is dead ? " " He is , sir . " " Did you see the body of Edward Norton , Mr. Crins-ton ? " " Yes sir . On the twenty-third day of October of this year . " " At about what time ? " " I saw his body at approximately eleven thirty-five or eleven thirty-six . " " Where was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , with the top of the head crushed in . " " What did you do then ? " " I notified the police . " " Did you see the defendant , Frances Celane , on that night ? "  | " I did . " " At about what time ? " " At approximately midnight or a little before . " " Did you tell her anything about the death of her uncle ? " " I did . " " Did you mention anything about the reported the r of a Buick automobile ? " " I did . " " Did she make any statement to you at that time as to the said Buick automobile ? " " That can be answered yes or no , " said Judge Markham , in a cautioning tone of voice . " It is preliminary merely . " " Yes , she did , " said Arthur Crinston . " At what time was this ? " " At about midnight . " " Who was present ? " " Miss Celane , Mr. Don Graves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present ? " " No sir . " " What did she say ? " " She said that she had taken the Buick automobile at about ten forty-five o'clock and gone for a ride , returningat approximately fifteen minutes past twelve , midnight . " " What was Mr. Norton doing the last time you saw him alive , Mr. Crinston ? " " Standing in the window of his study calling down to me . " " What did he say ? "  | " He asked me if Don Graves could accompany me to the city ; that is , to my residence . " " And what did you tell him ? " " I told him that I would have to ask Judge Purley , in whose car I was riding . " " Then what happened ? " " I stepped across to ask Judge Purley , and received an affirmative answer from him to my request . Then I returned to notify Mr. Norton . He was standing in his study  --  a few feet back from the window at that time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Graves , who had anticipated Judge Purley 's consent , was then coming down the steps from the front doorway to join mc . " Then what happened ? " " Then I got in the front seat of the automobile with Judge Purley , Mr. Don Graves got in the rear seat , we started up the winding road shown on the map , untilwe came to a certain point , where we turned around and went back to the house . I take it that I can not state any conversation that took place in the automobile ? " " That is the ruling of the court , Mr. Crinston . " " Very well . I returned in the automobile , re-entered the house , and found Mr. Norton 's body as described , whereupon I notified the police . " " Cross-examine , " snapped Claude Drumm unexpectedly , turning to Perry Mason . Perry Mason surveyed Arthur Crinston with an expressionlessface for a few seconds , then said abruptly : " You had been in conversation with Mr. Norton duringthe evening ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes late for that appointment . I arrived there at six minutespast eleven , I think . " " What , " asked Perry Mason , " did you talk with Mr. Norton about ? " Arthur Crinston made a swift grimace and shook his head at Perry Mason . The gesture seemed to be one of warning . Claude Drumm , who had jumped to his feet to object , caught that gesture of warning , and suddenly smiled . He sat down . Arthur Crinston looked at Judge Markham . " Answer the question , " said Perry Mason . Arthur Crinston blurted : " You do n't want to have me answer that question . " Judge Markham banged with his gavel on the desk . " Is there any objection , Mr. Drumm ? " he asked . The Deputy District Attorney shook his head smilingly . " None whatever , " he said . " Let the witness answer the question . " " Answer the question , " said Judge Markham . Crinston fidgeted . " Your Honor , " he blurted , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I should testify to what was said , and Perry Mason has reason to know that . I do n't know what his idea is in asking any such question ... " The gavel of Judge Markham banged upon the desk . " The witness , " he said , in tones of icy frigidity , " will confine his comments to the answers o ; suchp227questions as may be asked of him . The witness certainlyshould know that any such statement coming in court , particularly in a trial of this nature , is a contempt of court . The jury are admonished to disregard that statement , and are admonished to disregard any - statements of the witnesses except those which are elicited as a part of the testimony . Mr. Crinston , you will answer that question or be held in contempt of court . " " We talked , " said Crinston in a low voice , " about un attempt that had been made to blackmail Miss Ce-lane . " A grin of triumph suffused Claude Drumm 's face . " An attempt at blackmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Perry Mason . The grin faded from Claude Drumm 's face . He jumped to his feet . " Your Honor , " he said , " that is objected to as incompetent , irrelevant , and immaterial , leading and suggestive . Counsel well knows that Mrs. Mayfield is an important witness for the prosecution in this case , and this is an attempt to discredit her ... " " Leading questions are permitted upon cross-examination , " said Judge Markham . " You did not object when Counsel asked the witness as to what the conversationconsisted of , and since this is cross-examination , I am going to permit the question . " Claude Drumm slowly sat down . Crinston squirmed uncomfortably in the chair . " Mrs. Mayfield 's name was not mentioned , " he said at length , in a low voice.  | " You 're certain of that ? " asked Perry Mason . " Well , " said Crinston , " it might have been mentionedas a possibility . " " Oh , " said Perry Mason , " so it was mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might have been , " said Crinston . Perry Mason abruptly shifted his attack . " Edward Norton had secured rather a large sum ofmoney during the day of October twenty-third in onethousand dollar bills , had he not , Mr. Crinston ? " " So I understand , " said Crinston , surlily . " You did n't secure that money for him ? " " No , sir . " " Did you go to any of the banks during that day in which the firm of Crinston &; Norton had an account ? " Arthur Crinston scowled thoughtfully . " Yes , " he said , " I did . " " Which bank ? " " The Wheeler 's Trust and Savings Bank . " " Whom did you talk with there ? " Suddenly Crinston 's face changed color . " I would prefer , " he said , " not to answer that ques-tion . " Claude Drumm jumped to his feet . " The question is objected to , " he said , " as incompetent , irrelevant and immaterial , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawling smile . " Your Honor , " he drawled , " if I may present a brief argument ? " " Very well , " said Judge Markham.  | " This witness has testified on direct examination that he was a surviving partner of Crinston &; Norton . I let that question go in , although it probably calls for a conclusion of the witness . But I have the right to cross-examine him as to his activities as a co-partner , and the reasons upon which that conclusion was founded . " " Not at a remote time , " said Judge Markham . " No , sir , " said Perry Mason . " That is why I am confining the question to the date of October twentythird  --  theday of the death . " Judge Markham stared at Perry Mason with eyes that were suddenly hard and wary . Mason returned the gaze , his eyes wide with candor . Claude Drumm was on his feet . " The partnership affairs have nothing whatever to do with it , " he said . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifiedhim as a member of a partnership . " " But only for the purpose of showing the intimacy of his acquaintance , Your Honor . " Judge Markham shook his head . " I am not convinced , " he said , " that the question is proper cross-examination , but in a case of this nature I am going to err , if at all , on the side of the defendants . The witness will answer the question . " " Answer the question , Mr. Crinston , " said Perry Mason . " Whom did you talk with ? " " With Mr. Sherman , the president . " " And what did you talk with him about ? " " About the partnership business . "  | " You talked with him about meeting the indebtednessof approximately nine hundred thousand dollars which the partnership had with that bank , did you not ; an indebtedness which , as I understand the facts , was evidenced by notes which had been signed by you as an individual alone , is n't that right ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnershipnotes , signed by Crinston &; Norton . " " That is , signed by the partnership name of Crinston &; Norton , per Arthur Crinston . Is n't that right ? " " I think that is right , " said Arthur Crinston . " Tim main business of the partnership as far as banking activitieswere concerned , was transacted by me ; that is , I signed the partnership name to notes , although in a majority of instances the checks were signed by both of us . No , I 'll amend that statement . I guess that the Wheeler 's Trust and Savings Bank notes were signed with the partnership name per myself , and that checks were drawn out in the same way . " " You went out to Mr. Norton 's house to see him about the maturity of those notes , did you not ? " " That is correct . " " Then , " said Perry Mason , " how did it happen that you talked about the blackmailing of Frances Celanc by the housekeeper ? " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crinston . " I said that her name was mentioned as a possibility . " " I see , " said Perry Mason . " My mistake . Go ahead and answer the question . " " Because , " said Crinston , " the business matter re/bring to those notes occupied but a few minutes of our discussion . The question of his niece 's being blackmailedweighed very heavily on Mr. Norton 's mind , and he insisted upon postponing all further business discussion in order to ask my advice about that . " " And why did he say she was being blackmailed ? " asked Perry Mason . " He thought that she was being blackmailed over something she had done . " " Naturally , " said Perry Mason . " Did he mention what it was ? " " No , I do n't think he did . " " Did he mention what it might have been 2 " " He mentioned that she had an ungovernable temper , " said Crinston suddenly , and then bit his lip and said : " Wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he said that . That was my mistake . " " Your mistake , " asked Mason , " or are you trying to protect the defendant , Frances Celane ? " Crinston 's face purpled . " I 'm trying to protect her a lot better than you are ! " he roared . Judge Markham 's gavel banged upon his desk . " Mr. Crinston , " he said , " the court cautioned you once before . The court now pronounces you in contempt of court , and assesses a fine of one hundred dollars for contempt of court . " Crinston , his face purple , bowed his head . " Proceed with the case , " said Judge Markham . " Was anything else discussed by you and Mr. Norton , save the matter of indebtedness to the bank , the partnership affairs , and the possibility that his niece was being blackmailed ? " " No , sir , " said Arthur Crinston , evidently with reliefthat the question was no more searching as to the possibilities of the blackmail . Perry Mason smiled urbanely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-examination later on , Your Honor , " he said , " but I have no more questions at the present time . " Judge Markham nodded . " Any redirect ' ? " he asked . " Not at this time , " said Claude Drumm , " but it counsel reserves the right to recall the witness for furthercross-examination , I would like to reserve the right to recall the witness for further redirect examination . " " Granted , " snapped Judge Markham . " Proceed . " Claude Drumm raised his voice dramatically . " Call Mr. Don Graves , " he said . Don Graves arose and pushed his way forward , while the spectators turned to exchange swiftly whisperedcomments . The murder trial was proceeding with a dispatch which was unusual , and the attorney for the defense seemed to be overlooking many opportunities in his cross-examination . Yet those who knew Perry Mason knew him as one whose trial technique was ; t by-word among attorneys . And it was equally apparent that Judge Markham was mystified , as well as the spectators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placid face of Perry Masonwith thoughtful speculation . SULKY GIRL 2331 ) on Graves cleared his throat and looked expectantlyat Claude Drumm . " Your name is Don Graves , and you were employed on the twenty-third of October of this year , and had ken employed for some time prior thereto , as the condcntialsecretary of Mr. Edward Norton ? " " Yes , sir . " " You were with Mr. Norton on the evening of Octobertwenty-third ? " " Yes , sir . " " When did you last see him on that evening ? " " At approximately eleven thirty in the evening . " " You had seen him before that ? " " Oh , yes . Mr. Crinston left about eleven twenty -- seven or eleven twenty-eight , and Mr. Norton came out of his private office when Mr. Crinston left . They talked for a minute or two and Mr. Norton asked me to get some papers which Mr. Crinston had at his house . " " Then what happened ? " asked Claude Drumm . " Then Mr. Crinston went downstairs , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeur , and get him to drive me to Crinston 's residence . Then , just as I was starting for the stairs , he said : Wait a minute . I have another idea , ' or words to that effect , and went to the window and called down to Mr. Crinstonto ask if I could accompany him . " Mr. Crinston said that he was with Judge Purley and would have to get Judge Purley 's permission , and I , knowing that Judge Purley would give his permis-P234sion and that time was valuable , ran down the stair* and was just coming out of the front door when Mr. Crinston called up that Judge Purley said he would lw glad to accommodate me . " I ran across and got in Judge Purley 's automobile , getting in the rear seat , and then Judge Purley started the automobile and we drove up the winding road until we came to a spot , the approximate location of which Judge Purley has marked on the map . " And then what happened ? " " At that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and saw through the rear window of the automobile into the study window of EdwardNorton . " " And what did you see ? " purred Claude Drumm . " I saw a figure raise a club and strike Mr. Norton on the head . " " Could you recognize who that person was ? " " I thought I could , " he said . " Who did you think it was ? " asked Drumm . " Just a minute , " said Perry Mason , " that , is objected to as calling for a conclusion of the witness , and as leading and suggestive . The witness has stated that he thought he could make the identification . " Judge Markham looked at Perry Mason as though expecting to hear an extended argument upon this crucialpoint . There was no argument . He looked at Claude Drumm . Claude Drumm shrugged his shoulders . " He has stated that in his opinion he could make anP235identification , " he said . " The word thought ' is merely a colloquial expression . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markham . " Very well , " said Claude Drumm . " Mr. Graves , " he said , " you say that you thought you could identify the witness . Just what do you mean by that ? " " I believe , " said Don Graves , " that I know who that man was . I think that I recognized him . I did not see his face clearly , but I think that I could recognize him by the manner in which he held his head , from his shoulders and the general outline of his body . " " That is sufficient , if the court please , " said Claude Drumm . " A man does n't need to see the facial characteristics of another in order to make an identification . The objection goes to the weight , rather than the admissibilityof the evidence . " Judge Markham looked expectantly at Perry Mason . Perry Mason said nothing . " I will overrule the objection , " said Judge Markham . " Answer the question , young man . " " That man was Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was there anyone else in the room ? " asked Claude I ) rumm . " Yes , sir . " " Who was that other person ? " " A woman , sir , who was attired in a pink garment of some sort . "   " Could you see that woman ' ? " " I saw part of her shoulder , just a bit of her hair , and her arm . " " Could you recognize that woman from what you saw of her 2 " Judge Markham interrupted . " I think , counsellor , " he said , " that while I permittedthe first identification upon the ground that the objection went to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence , that where a witness can see only a relatively small portion of a woman 's figure at the distance which was shown upon this map , the objection really should go to the weight as well as the admissibility of the evidence , and I will sustain the objection as to the identity of the woman . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no objection made as to the identity of the woman . " " No objection ? " said Judge Markham . " None , Your Honor , " said Perry Mason . " Very well , " said Judge Markham , " I shall sustain an objection if one is made . " " There will be none made , " said Perry Mason . A rustle sounded throughout the courtroom . " Very well , " snapped Judge Markham , his face purpling , " answer the question . " " Yes , sir , " said Don Graves . " I think that that woman was Frances Celane . I am not as certain in her case as I was in the case of the man , but I think it was Frances Celane . She was dressed like Frances Celane , and the color of her hair , and the contour of her shouldermade me think it was Frances Celane . "   " How long have you known Frances Celane ? " asked Claude Drumm . For more than three years . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . " " Did she , at that time , to your knowledge , have a dress or some garment of the color which you saw upon the woman who was standing in that room ? " " Yes , sir . " " Very well , " said Claude Drumm . " What did you do , if anything ? " " I told the other gentlemen what I had seen , and asked them to turn the car around . " " I will strike that out on my own motion , " said Judge Markham . " It is incompetent , irrelevant , and immaterial . The question is what the witness did next , with reference to what had taken place in this room . Conversations between parties outside of the presence of the defendant which are not part of the res gestae will not be permitted . " " Very well , " said Claude Drumm . " Then what happened ? What did you do with reference to Mr. EdwardNorton ? " " I returned to the house , climbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the desk , with the top of his head beaten in , " said Don Graves . " Cross-examine , " snapped Claude Drumm . Perry Mason got to his feet and stared slowly and fixedly at Don Graves . An electric tension ran around the courtroom . The spectators sensed that this was to be the crucial part of the trial.  | " Your eyes are in good condition ? " asked Perry Mason . " Yes . " " You think that you were able to sit in a speeding automobile at this point on the road , and , in the momentaryglance which you had through the rear of the automobile , recognize the occupants of the room in that study ? " " Yes , sir . I know I could . " " How do you know it ' ? " " Because I saw them at that time , and because in order to test my own ability , I have made subsequent tests . " " The last part of that answer may go out , " snapped Judge Markham . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry Mason . " If the court please , I would like to follow that point up . " " Very well , " said Judge Markham . " You say you have made subsequent tests ? " " Yes , sir . " " In an automobile ? " " Yes , sir . " " With occupants in the room ? " " Yes , sir . " " Who were the occupants in the room ? " " Mr. Drumm , the Deputy District Attorney , and two people from his office . " " You were able to recognize those people ? " " Yes , sir . You see , sir , the windows are very wide , end the lighting in that study or office is very good . "   " The automobile in which those tests were made was n't driven very rapidly , was it ? " asked Perry Marion . " Just about the same rate as the automobile in which I was riding on the night of the murder . " " That was Judge Purley 's automobile ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't made a test in Judge Purley 's automobile , have you ? " " No , sir , in other automobiles . " " Then the tests were n't made under the same conditions ; that is , the machine was n't the same , the window in the rear was n't the same . " " They were similar , " said Don Graves . Perry Mason stared accusingly at the witness . " But the tests were n't made under exactly the same conditions . " " No , sir . " " Would you , " thundered Perry Mason , " dare to make a test under the same conditions ? " " Objected to as argumentative , " snapped Claude Drumm . " I think , " said Judge Markham , " that it may be argumentative , but it has a tendency to show the inter , est or bias of the witness . The question was , whether or not he would be willing to make a test under certain conditions . " " But such a test would n't prove anything more than has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " said Judge Markham , " is , whether or not he would be willing to make such a test . I think I will permit the witness to answer . " " Answer the question , " said Perry Mason . " Yes , I would be willing to make such a test . " " If Judge Purley will furnish his automobile , will you make a test while you are riding in such automobile ? " Claude Drumm was on his feet . " The question is now different , Your Honor . It is not question now of whether he is willing to make such a test , but if he will make such a test . " " Yes , " said Judge Markham , " if you desire to object to that question , I think that I shall sustain an objection to it . " Perry Mason turned to face the jury . " In that event , " he said , " there is no further cross-examination . " " No further cross-examination ? " asked Claude Drumm . " No . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are afraid to have a test made under identicalconditions . " The gavel of Judge Markham banged sharply on the desk . " Counsellor , " he said , " you will please refrain from personalities and address your remarks to the court , rather than to opposing counsel . " " Your pardon , Your Honor , " said Perry Mason , but his voice held no trace of humility , and his eyes twinkled with amusement . P241Claude Drumm stared at Perry Mason , and his foreheadcreased in thought . " Your Honor , " he said , " might I ask at this time for an adjournment until to-morrow morning at ten o'clock ? I have been rather surprised at the unexpected progress which this case has made . " " You are no more surprised than the court , " said Judge Markham . " Agreeably surprised , I may say . It is customary for murder cases to be drawn out to such prolonged length that it comes as rather a startling innovation to have a case move with such rapidity as this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjourn until ten o'clock to-morrow morning , ( luring which time the jury will remember the usual : admonition of the court against discussing the case or allowing it to be discussed in their presence . " The gavel banged . Perry Mason swung about in his chair and turned to face the dark eyes of Frances Celane . He smiled at her reassuringly . Rob Gleason , sitting at her side , was haggard and drawn , showing the effects of the ordeal ; his posture tense and strained , his eyes filled with a lurking fear . The girl was calm and collected , her eyes gave no hint of her feelings . Her chin was up , and her head back . Perry Mason leaned toward her . " Have confidence in me , please , " he said . Only when she smiled at him was there evident the changes which had taken place in her during the ordealP242preliminary to the trial . There was a touch of sadness in the smile ; a hint of patience that had not been in her face before . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gleason whispered : " A word with you , sir ? And in private , please . " A deputy sheriff moved forward , touched Frances Celane on the shoulder . Perry Mason said to him : " Just a moment , please , " and led Rob Gleason to one side . Gleason spoke in hoarse whispers . " Looks pretty black , does n't it ? " Perry Mason shrugged his shoulders . " If , " whispered Gleason , " it 's going against us , I want to take it all . " " Meaning ? " asked the lawyer . " Meaning , " husked Gleason , " that I want to confessand take the sole blame . I want to free Fran of any responsibility . " Steadily , purposefully , remorselessly , Mason 's eyes studied Gleason 's features . " It has n't come to that yet , Gleason , " he said . " And it wo n't . Keep your mouth shut . " He turned and signaled the waiting deputy that the conference was over .   PERRY MASON sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevers . Nevers , with his hair trimmed , his face clean-shaven , wearing a newly pressed suit , twisted his legs up over the arm of the leather chair , and let his eyes study ferry Mason in bored appraisal . " Sure I 'll do you a favor , " he said , " if it 's anything I can do . The office is friendly toward you . You gave us a nice break on Frances Celane 's surrender . " " All right , " said Perry Mason , his eyes hard and watchful . " I want you to bear down heavy on the fact that the District Attorney has conducted secret tests to determine whether Don Graves could be telling the truth . " Nevers nodded and yawned . " I suppose you mean that you want to have an intimationbetween the lines , that the D. A. would n't have had those tests made unless he 'd had a little doubt in his own mind about the testimony . " Perry Mason nodded . " Well , " said Harry Nevers , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's already been done . I gave you that much of a break in advance . " " All right , " said Mason . " Now here 's something else . I want you to emphasize the events that happened   just before court adjourned ; the fact that the District Attorney refused to make a test under identical cir-cumstances . " Nevers inclined his head in a gesture of assent . " All right , " he said , " what 's back of it ? " " Back of what ? " asked the attorney . " Back of this test business . " " You can see for yourself , " said Mason . " The DistrictAttorney conducted tests . That shows he had some doubt of the ability of the witness to see the occupants of that room , as he claims he did . Furthermore , he has now refused to conduct a test , or permit a test to be conducted under exactly identical circumstances . " " Baloney , " said the reporter . " That 's a good line to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowdown . " " There is n't any lowdown , " Mason told him . " The hell there ai n't , " said Nevers . " Do n't think I 'm going to pull chestnuts out of the fire for you . You 've given me a break in this case , and I 'm willing to give you a break . But do n't think I 'm going to run around playing cat 's paw for you , and get my fingers burnt unless I know whether the chestnut is worthwhilereaching for . " Mason shook his head . " You 've got me wrong , Harry , " he said . " I simply want to have a test arranged under exactly identical circumstances . " " Well , " said Nevers , " we 'll talk that over for a while . What do you mean by exactly identical circum-stances ? " " Well , " said Perry Mason , " here 's the way I wantp245the test arranged . I want it so that I 'm riding in the front seat of the automobile with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Crinston occupied . I 'm perfectly willing to allow Drumm , the Deputy District Attorney , to sit in the back seat with Don Graves . " I Iarry Nevers stared at him with eyes that showed ; a glint of surprise . " Have you gone crazy ? " he asked . " No , " said Perry Mason shortly . " Why you poor damned innocent babe in the woods ! " said Nevers . " Do n't let Claude Drumm fool you with any of that bushwa about being fair . He 's one of the crookedest campaigners in the game . He 's the one that ditched the notes that contained the first statementDon Graves made to the police  --  the one in which he said he recognized Devoe as the murderer , and did n't say anything about there being some other personin the room .

" " There are times , " said Perry Mason , " when a personhas to use a little strategy  --  for instance when one is stalking a flock of geese it 's always advisable to get behind a horse to walk up on the geese . "  | " What does that mean ? " Nevers inquired . " It means that geese are wild things , and they take flight whenever they see something they ca n't understand , or something that looks like a hunter , " said Perry Mason . " But they 're accustomed to the sight of a horse and when they see a horse walking around them , they do n't pay any attention to it . " " So you 're walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason nodded his head . Nevers slid his feet off the arm of the chair , stood up , and looked steadily at Perry Mason . " Look here , " he said , " you 've got a reputation among lawyers of being a fast worker , and a twofistedcampaigner . You 've got the reputation of jockeyinga case around so that you get in a position to give one knock-out punch and then concentrate on that one punch . You do n't go around wasting your energy in a lot of little taps that do n't mean anything . Now I want to know what the knock-out punch is in this case . " " I 'm not certain yet , " Perry Mason told him . " There may not be any . " " The hell there ai n't , " said Nevers . " Look at the way you 've tried this case . You have sat.back and let the prosecution put in every damned bit of evidence they wanted . You have n't cross-examined the witnesses so as to bring out anything that 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean by that ? " inquired Perry Masonin low , ominous tones.  | " Keep your shirt on , " Nevers drawled tonelessly . " You are n't fooling me any with that stuff . You know as well as I do that Don Graves made a statement to thr police the night of the murder , in which he either *aid , or at least intimated , that the person who struck thr blow was Devoe , the chauffeur . He said there was n't a woman in the room at the time the blow was struck , or at least he failed to say he saw a woman in the room . You 've gone ahead and let him testify in this case , and have n't brought that out , or even intimated that he ever made a contradictory statement . " " It would n't do any good if I did , " Perry Mason said . " The notes of that statement have been destroyed , and Graves would swear , either that he never made tech a statement , or that Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to leave her out of it . " " Baloney , " said Nevers . Perry Mason slid open a drawer in his desk and took out a flask of whiskey . " I 'll tell you this much , Harry , " he said . " If you 'll play ball with me , you wo n't be sorry . " " Meaning by that ? " asked Nevers . " Meaning by that you can stick around on this test that 's made and save a big slice of the front page for a blow-off . " Harry Nevers pushed back the glass which Mason had handed him with the bottle , and tilted the bottle to his lips . He took half a dozen swallows , then handed the bottle back to the attorney . " When 's this blow-off going to comer " he asked . " Hight after the test ? "  | " I do n't think so , " said Perry Mason . " I think I 'll have to do a little manipulation . " The reporter spoke as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force the D. A. into making that test , " he said . " It 's a test that is bound to come out all right . But you 've got something up your sleeve . You 're trying this murder case with no more apparent fight about you than as though you were covering a coroner 's inquest . You 're going through it with a hop , skip and jump , and letting the prosecution get in all the damagingevidence they want . Everybody in town is talking about what a poor defense you 're putting up . " " Yes ? " asked Mason , raising his eyebrows . " Oh forget it ! " said Nevers , with a trace of feeling in his voice . " You know damned well they are . A kid out of law school would have tried this case better than you 're trying it . Everybody is commenting on it . The town is divided into two camps  --  those that think you 're shrewd as the devil , and have something up your sleeve , and those that think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't got anything on thr ball . Naturally , it 's an important case . A woman who 's got as many millions as Frances Celane at stake ; a secret marriage ; a sex angle , and all that sort of stuff makes front page news . It 's the opportunity of your life to drag this case along , fighting every inch of the way , keeping your name on the front page of the newspaperfor two or three weeks . In place of that you 're acting like a dub . For a murder case , this thing isp249streaking through the court like a greased pig going between a farmer 's legs . " Perry Mason corked the whiskey bottle , and slid it back in the drawer of his desk . Nevers looked at him searchingly . " Going to say anything ? " he asked . " No , " said Perry Mason . Nevers grinned and wiped the back of his hand across his lips . " Okay , " said Nevers . " I 've done my duty . I 'll tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nit of you . Maybe I 'll fake some piece of inside informationthat the readers can pick out between the lines . " Perry Mason took the reporter 's arm and escorted him to the door of the outer office . " Listen , Harry , " he said , " if you fake anything , be sure you fake it right . " Perry Mason paused in the doorway , suddenly turned and faced the reporter . " All right , " he said , " I 'll give you a bit of inside information . Rob Gleason is intending to make a completeconfession and take the blame for the crime , exoneratingFrances Celane . " Nevers stared at him . " You ca n't give me that for publication , " he said . " Why not ? " asked Perry Mason . " It would be violating every professional confi-dence . " " That 's all right , " said Mason easily , " you 're not using my name , that 's all . Simply put it down as corningfrom a source that is close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevers . " That would be the worst kind of libel if we could n't back it up ! " " You can back it up , " said Mason . " If anybody calls you on it , you can disclose the source of your in-formation . " " Meaning that it came from you ? " " Meaning that it came from me , " Mason told him . Nevers took a deep breath . " Listen , Perry , " he said , " I 've seen ' em come , and I 've seen ' em go . I 've been in on all kinds of cases , interviewedall kinds of people . I 've seen those that were foxy , and those that just thought they were foxy . I 've seen those that were dumb , and did n't know it , and those that were dumb , and thought they were smart , but you 've got the whole world cheated . This is the damnedest interview with a lawyer I ever had ! " Mason placed his right hand between the reporter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , " he said , " I 've given you a break . Give me one . " Frank Everly was standing in the outer office , his manner filled with impatience . " Did you want to see me ? " asked Perry Mason . Everly nodded . " Come in , " Mason told him . Everly walked into the inner office . Perry Mason stood in the door until Harry Nevers had gone out through the outer door , then Mason closed the door of the inner office , and turned to face Everly . Everly coughed and averted his eyes .   " Did n't the case move rather expeditiously , Mr. Mason ? " he asked . Mason smiled at him with patient , tired eyes . " In other words , " he said , " you 've been hearing some comments that I 've stubbed my toe on the defense , and the prosecution is walking all over me , is that it ? " Everly turned red and said in a choked voice : " I did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever hear the story , " asked Perry Mason , in a kindly tone of voice , " of the man who brought suit against his neighbor , claiming to have been bitten by the neighbor 's dog ? The neighbor filed an answer in which he denied that his dog was vicious , denied that the dog had bitten the man , and denied that he ever had a dog . " " Yes , " said Frank Everly , " I 've heard that yarn . It 's a classic around law school . " " All right , " said Perry Mason . " The defense in that case became humorous because it took in too much territory . Now , when you 've got a doubtful case , it 's all right to try and have two strings to your bow . But remember that when you have two strings on a bow , while increasing the factor of safety , you lose the efficiencyof the weapon . A bow that has two strings wo n't break a string , but it wo n't shoot an arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had one string to it . " " You mean you 're sacrificing everything in this case to concentrate on some one point ? " asked the law clerk.  | " Yes , " said Perry Mason , " the innocence of FrancesCelane and Rob Gleason is virtually shown by the evidence as it exists at the present time . The guilt of the defendants simply can not be proved beyond a reasonabledoubt . But I want to do more than raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors . I want to make a complete solution of the case . " Frank Everly stared at Perry Mason with wide , incredulouseyes . " My heavens ! " he said . " I thought that everything that went in to-day clinched the guilt of Frances Celane and Rob Gleason . I thought that unless we could break down the stories of some of those witnesses , we could just as well figure on a verdict of first degree murder . " Mason shook his head wearily . " No , " he said , " the big point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I 'm trying to do now is to crash that point home to the jury in such a dramatic manner they 'll never forget it . And remember this -- I 've got Claude Drumm so badly rattled the way that case is going that he 's on the verge of panic right now . He figures I must have an ace up my sleeve somewhere , or I would n't be giving him all the breaks . " " The jury , " suggested Frank Everly , " looked rather unsympathetic . " " Of course they looked unsympathetic , " said Perry Mason . " And they 'll probably look more unsympathetic . You notice what Claude Drumm is doing . He 's putting in the corpus delicti with just a smattering of testimony . Just before he gets ready to rest his case , P253he 'll start introducing photographs of the dead body slumped over the desk , of the bloody blotter , of the insurance policy , spattered with the life blood of the dead man , and all of that stuff . Then , he 'll throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a jury that 's hardened its heart to bring in a death penalty verdict . " " What I do n't see , " said Everly , " is how you 're going to stop him . " " I 'm not going to try to stop him , " smiled Perry Mason , " I 'm going to head him off . " Della Street walked into the room . " Mr. Drake is out there , " she said , " and says it 's important . " Perry Mason smiled at her . " He 'll have to wait just a minute , " he said , " I 'm explaining something to Frank Everly . " Della Street looked at Perry Mason with eyes that were warm with tenderness . " I can remember , " she said softly , " when I madeyou explain something to me . After that , I 've hadenough faith in you so I do n't need any explanations . " Perry Mason watched her with speculative eyes . " You 've read the papers ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how the trial is going ? " " Yes . " " You gathered that I was putting up a pretty weak defense ? " She stiffened slightly , and looked accusingly at Frank Everly . " Who said that ? " she asked .   " It 's intimated in the newspapers , " said Perry Mason . " Well , " said Della Street , " I just made a bet of half of my month 's salary , with Paul Drake , that you were going to get both defendants acquitted . That shows how much faith I 've got in you . " " Then , " said Perry Mason , " Drake must have some bad news . You two get out of here and let me talk with him . You know he 's doing some work for me on this case . He 's probably got some inside information . It was n't very sporting of him to bet on his inside infor-mation . " " That 's all right , " Della Street said . " He was square about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did he tell you what it was ? " " No , he just said he had it , and I told him I had some too . " " What did you have ? " asked Perry Mason , staring speculatively at her . " Faith in you , " she said . Mason waved his hand . " All right , " he said , " you folks get out and let me talk with Drake . We 'll see what he 's got to say . " Drake came into the inner office , sat down , grinned , and rolled a cigarette . " Well , " he said , " I 've got the lowdown for you . " " All right , " Perry Mason said , " what is it ? " " The rough shadow did it , " said Drake . " Never mind the methods , " said Mason . " I want the facts . "  | " Well , " said Drake , " the story goes like this . This Mrs. Mayfield is a hard-boiled baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason . " She tried to hold me up a couple of times . " " Yes , I got all the lowdown on that , too , " said Drake . " The only trouble is , Perry , that it looks like hell for your clients . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , in the first place , Mrs. Mayfield does n't know quite as much as she tried to pretend she did . She made the mistake of going to bed at the wrong time . She went to bed just about fifteen or twenty minutes before the murder was committed . But she 'd spent the evening snooping around . " It all starts in with the fact that she found out Gleason and Frances Celane were married . She started in trying to capitalize on that knowledge . She took quite a bit of money from Frances Celane ; I do n't know how much , around ten thousand dollars , I think . And then , in some way , Edward Norton got wise that Frances Celane was paying blackmail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him whom she was paying money to and why . Naturally , she did n't dare to let him know . But Norton was a pretty obstinate individual , and , in order to find out , he shut off the girl 's allowance . That put her in the position of having no money with which to pay any blackmail . " On the other hand , Mrs. Mayfield said that she could capitalize on the information elsewhere , and if Frances Celane would n't give her money , she was go-P256ing to sell the information to some of the charitable institutions who would benefit by the knowledge . " Of course , this was all bluff , but Frances Celane did n't know it . The whole situation came to a head on the night of the murder . Frances Celane had a stormy interview with Norton , and they quarreled bitted ) . Norton said that before he went to bed that night hr was going to execute a written document terminating the trust and giving to Frances Celane the annuity provided by the terms of the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a bluff on his part or not I do n't know . Anyhow , that 's what he said . Then Mrs. Mayfieldwent to bed . Next morning Frances Celane hall money , lots of it . She gave Mrs. Mayfield twenty-eight thousand dollars to keep quiet . Mrs. Mayfield promisedshe would . " Rob Gleason was there in the house that night , and participated in at least a part of the interview with Norton . Norton was furious , and accused the girl of all sorts of things . She got mad and used language that must have raised a blister on his ears . " Afterwards , Gleason went down to the girl 's room . That was after Crinston came , and before the murder . Along about that time Mrs. Mayfield went to bed . Site does n't know exactly what happened , except that she 's certain Frances Celane did n't go out in the Buick automobile . Therefore , she knows that the alibi Frances Celane was trying to make was false . " She went to you and tried to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You turnedp257her down hard , so she started concentrating on the girl , and actually collected from her . Then she found out that the money she 'd taken from Frances Celane was in thousand dollar bills that were numbered consecutively , and knew that these bills would be traced in the ( went that she tried to change them for smaller bills . So she has these bills hidden , and has tried to create the impression that Frances Celane gave you twentyeightthousand dollars to apply on a fee . She has told the District Attorney 's office that that is what happened , and the District Attorney 's office has been trying to locate the twenty-eight thousand dollars . They 've made examinations at your banks , and have even gone so far as to search the office . They have now come to the conclusion that you must be carrying the twenty-eight thousand dollars on your person . " The District Attorney is intending to use her as a surprise witness . She 's going to testify as to the falsity of the girl 's claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to the quarrel that took place . " It 's the theory of the prosecution that a bitter quarrelwas interrupted by Arthur Crinston ; that the two people hatched out this murder plot and waited until Crinston had left to carry it into execution ; that , as soon as Crinston drove away , they dashed up to the office and killed Mr. Norton , then planted the evidence in Pete Devoe 's room in order to make it appear Devoe was the guilty party , in the event the officers did n't fall for the jimmied window and the footprints in the soft soil . "  | " How about Graves ' ? " asked Perry Mason . " Have you done anything with him ? " " I 've done lots with him . That girl has turned him inside out . He 's going to be a bad man for you to handle , but he tells the girl that he 's trying to protect Frances Celane , or that he was trying to protect her until the District Attorney brought pressure to bear on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my theory of this case is that Norton gave Fran Celane that money before Crinstoncalled . Now , Graves must have some information that 'll support that theory . " " That , " said Drake , " is the worst part of his testimony . He says he could hear every word of the conversation ; that Norton took out his wallet and showed the girl forty thousand dollars , telling her he had originallygotten the money to give her , but that he was n't going to give her anything except a small amount for current expenses . Then he took out two one thousand dollar bills and handed them to her . " Don Graves has the idea the girl took the one thousanddollar bills , and that she and Gleason planted those one thousand dollar bills in the pocket of Devoe , the chauffeur , while Crinston was talking with Norton ; that the girl and Gleason came back afterwards and killed Norton , taking the balance of the money from his wallet to use for the purpose of bribing the housekeeper to silence and paying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . That 's the theory Graves has . " The District Attorney had things planned so thatp259most of this would come out on cross-examination . He was going to slap you in the face with it . The fact that you 've restricted your cross-examination so much has got Drumm worried . He 's going to try and bring out all of this stuff on redirect examination now , asking permission to recall the witnesses . " Perry Mason stretched his long arms , stared at the detective , and laughed . " Paul , " he said , " there are times when caution is a vice . " What do you mean by that ? " Paul Drake asked . " I mean , " said Perry Mason , " that at times it is wise to stake everything on one dramatic blow , one crashing knock-out punch . I 've only got one string to my bow in this case . If it breaks , I 'm finished . But if it does n't break , I 'm going to shoot an arrow right through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , Perry , if you can figure this thing out , you can do a lot more than I can . The more I see of it , the more mixed up and confused it looks . " Perry Mason started pacing the floor back and forth . " The thing that I 'm afraid of , " he said , " is that I'mnot keeping my real objective sufficiently concealed . " " How do you mean ? " the detective inquired . " I 'm stalking a bunch of geese behind a horse , " saidferry Mason , " and I 'm afraid the horse may not be bigenough to give me the concealment I want . " Paul Drake started for the door . " Listen , " he said , as he paused , with a hand on the knob of the door , " do n't worry about that . I 've seen ap260lot of murder cases in my time , and I 've talked with a lot of lawyers who thought they had a point when they did n't have . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your clients in this case , you 've got more optimism than I have . I just bet half of Della Street 's salary for this month , that your clients were going to be convicted , and , after talking with you , I 'm going out and try and get a bet for the other half . That shows how much confidence I 've got . " As he closed the door , Perry Mason was standing in the center of the office , with his feet spread wide apart , his jaw thrust forward , heavy shoulders squared , staringin steady concentration at the closing door , P261HEADLINES streamed across the front page of j the STAR . " WITNESS TO MILLIONAIRE 'S MURDERREFUSES TO MAKE TEST . " Perry Mason , with the paper propped up in front of him on the table , cracked his three-minute eggs and smiled with satisfaction . Down below the large head-1 i nes were smaller headlines : " DISPUTE OVER VISION OF STATE 'S STAR WITNESS . DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO MAKE TEST AND PROSECUTION RE-FUSES . " Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square of butter , reached for a slice of crisp toast , and chuckled . He read the verbatim account of the trial , noticed that the challenge which he had hurled at the prosecutionwas printed in black-faced type , finished his breakfast , folded the newspaper , and went to his office . " Any news ? " he asked Della Street . She regarded him with a wistful , half-maternal smile on her lips .  | " You 've got it in your pocket , " she said . He grinned at her . " If the District Attorney refuses to accept the challengenow , I 've got the case won in front of the jury , " he said . " What will you do if he accepts the challenge T ' she wanted to know . Perry Mason walked to the window and stared thoughtfully out at the morning sunshine . " Now that , " he remarked , " calls for another question . Did you double your bet with Paul Drake ? " " Yes . " " Good girl ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test ? " she asked . " Yes . " " How are you going to determine that it 's a fair test ? " " I ca n't , " he told her , " but there 's no harm in try-ing . " " Well , " she told him , " you 've got some good advertisementin this case , anyway . Every morning newspaperis speculating what it is you 've got up your sleeve . You 're referred to a dozen times as The Old Fox of the Courtroom , ' and most of the reporters state that the chief trial deputy was plainly worried at the manner in which the case was expedited . " " You mean , " he told her , " the newspapers figure I could n't possibly be as dumb as I seem . " She laughed . " I 'm betting on you , " she said .   " The D. A. 's got a couple of surprise witnesses , " Perry Mason said . " Surprise to whom ? " she inquired . " That 's the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside office . He had no sooner closed the door than the telephone rang . " This is Drumm on the line now , " said the Toice of Della Street . " Hello , " said Perry Mason . " Good morning , counsellor . This is Drumm speaking . I have been thinking over your demand for a test of the vision of Don Graves , and have decided to consent to making a test under exactly identical circumstances . I shall ask the court for an adjournment over the week end to enable the test to be completed and thought I would let you know . " " Nice of you , " said Mason . " Not at all , " snapped Drumm . Mason chuckled . " I meant letting me know , " he said . " Oh , ' - ' said Drumm . " Have you any plans worked out for making the test 2 " " I will announce that in court , " said Drumm . " Good-by . " Perry Mason was still chuckling as he slipped the receiver back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Everly to his office .   " Everly , " he said , " there 's going to be a continuance granted in that trial this morning , so that arrangements can be completed for a test which is to be made . I 'm not going up to court , but am going to send you up , to be there and arrange for the continuance . There will be nothing except the formality of getting the case continuedover the week end . Drumm will undoubtedly have some scheme worked out under which he 'll want the test made and he 'll try to rush you into a consent to that scheme , while you are there in court in front of the jury . " Simply tell him that you were sent up to represent me for the purpose of consenting to the continuance , and that you have no authority to conclude the terms under which the test is to be made . That will necessitatehis getting in touch with me when we are not in front of a jury . " Frank Everly nodded his approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " You forced him into it , eh ? " " I do n't know . He 's consenting to the test . That 's all I want . I do n't care why he 's doing it . " " And by this means , " said Everly , " you keep from having to quibble over the details in front of thejury ! " " Exactly , " smiled Perry Mason . " Tell him that I 'll be in my office this afternoon to arrange the details of the test with him , or that I 'll meet him at any mutuallysatisfactory place . Be sure when you make the statement that you do it with an air of the utmost candor and frankness . The jury will be watching yotiP265closely and there 's been a little too much talk in the newspapers about my being an old fox . " " Okay , Chief , " said Everly , and swung out of the office , his face flushed with enthusiasm . Perry Mason got Harry Nevers on the telephone . " Just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deputy District Attorney just called up and told me he was going to consent to a continuance over the week end this morning , so that a test could be made . " The voice of Harry Nevers sounded in a husky , bored monotone over the telephone . " I can go you one better on that , " he said . " I was just going to call you and give you a tip . The D. A. 's office has a scheme framed up for that test . They 're going to put it up to you in front of the jury . You wo n't like it , but you wo n't dare to argue with it in front of the jury . " " All right , " Perry Mason said , " I can raise you one on that . I 'm not even going to be in court . I 've sent my : assistant up to-consent to a continuance . He has n't any : authority to stipulate in regard to the conditions of the test . Harry Nevers laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Will the court order the test ? " " No , " Mason said . " I do n't think the court will want to have anything to do with it . It 's something that will have to be handled by stipulation . We 'll awake the test and then let the witnesses testify Monday morning . " " When are you going to figure on the details of the test ? " asked the reporter.  | " Probably right after the court adjourns , " Mason told him . " Drumm will get in touch with me . I thought I 'd give you a ring and let you know that I ca n't controlthe publicity that comes out of the D. A. 's office , but as far as I 'm concerned you 're going to have an exclusive on the details just as soon as I reach an agreement with the District Attorney 's office . " Harry Nevers gave a dry chuckle . " I guess , " he said , " it 's a good thing that I had the photographer get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . Something seems to tell me we will be running them about Tuesday morning , or in the evening editions Monday night . " " There 's one other thing I want you to do for me , " Mason said . " Gee , you 're full of those suggestions , " the reporter told him . " That 's all right . This is a simple thing . " " All right , shoot . " " When that test is arranged , I 'm going to have things fixed so that Drumm and I will be downstairs in the automobile , and Graves will be upstairs . We 'll summonhim by some kind of a signal . When we give that signal , I want you to detain Graves up there in that room . " " For how long ? " asked Nevers . " As long as you can . " " What 's the idea of that ? " " I want to get him rattled . " " You ca n't rattle that bird . He 's a foxy guy , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's foxy , but he can be rattled just the same . I want you to put up some proposition to him that will hold him behind until he has to appeal to the District Attorney . " " Now , " said the reporter , " you 're asking something that 's making me suspicious . " " It does n't need to , " Mason told him . " If you 'll do that , I 'll give you a break afterwards so that you can claim you participated in the final result . " " Maybe I do n't want to participate in the final result , " said Nevers . " Those final results sometimes ai n't so hot . " " You wo n't have to unless you want to , " Mason pointed out . " I 'll take all the responsibility . You can share in the credit . " " I think , " Nevers told him , " I 'd better come over and talk this thing over with you a little bit . " Mason chuckled . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Forget what ? " asked the reporter suspiciously . " That bottle of whiskey in my desk , " said the attorney , and slipped the receiver back on the hook .   THE Norton mansion blazed with light , every window in the place was illuminated . More than a dozen automobiles were parked along the curb , or crowded into the driveway . Men came and went through the open door , and four or five police officers strutted importantly about the premises . Up in the study where Edward Norton had been murdered , Claude Drumm stared speculatively at Perry Mason . " I do n't know what you could ask for that is more fair than this , " he said . " Well , " Perry Mason told him , " it does n't seem particularly complete to me as a test . Don Graves has only a fifty percent chance of guessing wrong even if he were blindfolded . " " I do n't see what you 're getting at , " said Claude Drumm with purposeful stupidity . " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in a black dress and one in a pink dress . You 've got three men , all of whom are known to Graves . Now the idea is , as I understand it , that Judge Purley will drive his car up the roadway at exactly the same rate of speed , as nearly as he can remember , that he drove it on the night of the murder . When the car reaches a certain position in the roadway , Judge Purley is top269shout : ' Look ! ' And at that time Graves is to turn and look . " After we have started up the roadway , the figures will arrange a pantomime . One of the three will stand with a club in his hand , and one of the women will stand so that her head , shoulder and arm are visible to a person going up the roadway . " " That is correct , " said Drumm . " Very well , " said Perry Mason . " Now the point that I am making is this : As far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stand one chance in three of being right . As far as the women are concerned , if he simply guessed , he would stand an even chance of being right . " " Well , " said Drumm , " you ca n't ask to have conditionsany more favorable to your side of the case than they were at the time of the murder . Now there were only two women in the house at that time . There was Mrs. Mayfield , the housekeeper , and Frances Celane , your client . Now , it 's conceded that there was a woman in the room at the time of the murder ... " " No it is n't , " snapped Perry Mason . " Well , according to my theory of the case , and according to the testimony of Don Graves , a disinterestedwitness , there was , " said Drumm , " and , if the test is going through , that has got to stand . Now that woman who was in the room either had to be Mrs. Mayfield or Miss Celane . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . There was Pete Devoe , the chauffeur , who was drunk when we found him , but who , nevertheless , was under suspi- cion ; there was Rob Gleason , the defendant in the action , and Purkett , the butler . One of those three men must have been the one to swing the club . " " That , " said Mason , " is taking for granted that the evidence of the footprints under the window , and the window that had been jimmied open , is evidence that was planted . " " Of course it is , " said Drumm . " You would n't want us to have the whole city standing here in the room because there might have been someone in the city who had broken into the house . You ca n't have this thing all your way . " " I should have it enough my way so that we can tell whether Graves uses his eyes , or whether it 's just a lucky guess . " Claude Drumm showed a glint of triumph in his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " under circumstanceswhich are identical to those which surrounded the commission of the crime . This test is made as the result of a challenge by you . Now , if you are afraid to have Graves go ahead with it , all you have got to do is to say so , and we 'll call the test off , because you did n't dare to let the witness go through with it . " Mason shrugged his shoulders . " Very well , " he said , " if you 're going to put it on that ground , go ahead . " The glint of triumph which had been in Drumm 's eyes became a light of victory , and he grinned with blatant assurance . " All right , " he said to the compact group that hadP271gathered about the two men , " I think you two gentlemenunderstand the situation perfectly . We are to go up the hill in the car . I will be seated in the back seat with Mr. Graves . Mr. Mason , the attorney for the defendants , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After the car has started up the hill , you gentlemen of the press will select one of these women , who will stand so that her head , neck , shoulder and arm will be visible through the window , to anyone standing on the curve in the road at the point where Graves looks back . You will also select one of the three men , each of whom is attired in a distinctly different suit of clothes , to stand with a club in his hand , leaning over the chair in which Edward Norton was sitting when he was killed . " I think that covers the situation . The reputation and integrity of Judge Purley will be sufficient to guarantee that whatever may happen in the automobile will not subsequently be distorted by either party . " Perry Mason said : " Just a minute . Before Don Graves leaves this room I want to have a confidential word with Judge Purley . " Drumm looked at him suspiciously . " Not unless I am along , " he said . " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidential words with anyone , I 'm going to hear what they are . " " I have no objection to your listening , " said Perry Mason , " but naturally , inasmuch as this is a test , I do n't want Don Graves to hear it . " " Very well , " said Drumm . " You can wait here , Graves , until we call you . " i " We 'll blow the horn on the automobile , " said Perry Mason , " when we are ready . " In frigidly dignified silence , the two opposing attorneyswalked down the broad stairs , through the front door , and to the automobile where Judge Purley sat in ponderous dignity , surrounded by flashlight photographers , his face wearing an expression of satisfactionwhich he endeavored to conceal beneath the cloak of a judicial and ponderous dignity . " Are you ready , gentlemen ? " he asked . " It is understood , " said Perry Mason , " that I am to sit in the front seat with Judge Purley ; that you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Don Graves ? " " That is so understood , " said Drumm . " Under those circumstances , " said Perry Mason , " I am going to ask that you remove your glasses . " " That I what ? " snapped the Deputy District Attorney . " That you remove your glasses , " Perry Mason said . " You will readily understand that if you are wearing your glasses so that your vision is fully corrected , and you should turn at the same time that Don Graves turns , it might be that by some involuntary exclamationor motion , you would signal Don Graves which one of the three men you thought was holding the club . In which case I should be having a test made with two pairs of eyes instead of one . " " That sir , " said Claude Drumm , " is an insult to my veracity . " " No , " said Perry Mason , " it is no such thing . It isP273merely a matter of precaution against an involuntary betrayal . " " I refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , " said Perry Mason , " I shall not insist . I have merely mentioned the matter . One other thing is that I am going to ask Judge Purley to keep his eyes straight ahead on the road . " " No , " said Drumm , " I am not going to consent to that condition , because when Judge Purley was drivingthe car on the night the murder was committed , and Don Graves gave his exclamation , it was only naturalthat Judge Purley should have looked back to see what it was that had caused the exclamation , and in doing this , he naturally slowed down the car , which gave Graves opportunity for a much longer and steadier look . " Perry Mason sighed wearily , after the manner of one who has been out-generaled . " Very well , " he said , " summon Graves . " Judge Purley pressed the button of the horn on the automobile . They waited a few minutes , and Perry Mason reached over and again pressed the button of the horn . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left palm imperatively against the button on the steering post of the car , looking expectantly up at the window . There was a commotion for a moment , and then Don Graves stood in the window and shouted : " One of these newspaper reporters wants to change the conditionsof the test . "  | Claude Drumm gave an exclamation , slammed open the door of the car , strode across the street , and stood under the window . " The conditions of that test were fully arranged when we left the room , " he said . " Do n't discuss the matter with any of the newspaper reporters . If they ca n't cooperate in this thing they 'll be excluded . Come down here at once ! " " Very well , sir , " Don Graves said , and left the window . Almost at once Harry Nevers thrust out his head and called : " This test is n't fair . We should have the right to have one of the men stand where Graves claims the woman was standing , if we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the other occupant of the room was a woman . It might have been a man . " " In a pink negligee , eh ? " sneered Drumm . " Now listen , the only function that you gentlemen have is to pick which one of the three men , and which one of the two women , will stand in that position . That was definitelyunderstood , and that is the condition of the test . If an attempt is to be made to change it , I will call off the test . " " Oh , very well , " said Nevers , " have it your own way . But it does n't seem fair to me . " Don Graves came down the stairs , left the front door , and said in a low voice to Claude Drumm : " The man is drunk . He made a nuisance of himself up there , but I did n't want to offend him because I did n't want his newspaper to roast me . "   " All right , " snapped Drumm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All ready , " said Perry Mason . They took their positions in the automobile for the last time . Flashlights boomed up in puffs of dazzling flame as newspaper photographers took action pictures of the car pulling away from the curb . Judge Purley snapped it through the gears and drove up the winding roadway at a fair rate of speed . " It is understood , " said Perry Mason , " that Don Graves will not look back until Judge Purley indicates the place on the road where Graves first gave his ex-clamation . " " So understood , " snapped Drumm . The car purred up the roadway , swinging around the curves . " Now ! " said Judge Purley . Don Graves pushed his face up against the rear windowof the automobile and cupped his hands around his eyes . Perry Mason flashed a glance at the study window of the house . The figures could be seen for a single brief glimpse , standing in position . The car swept around the curve in the roadway , and the house vanished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Don Graves . " Who was it ? " asked Judge Purley , braking the car to a stop . " The man in the blue serge suit with the dark hair , and the woman in the pink dress , " said Don Graves . P276Claude Drumm heaved a sigh . " There , counsellor , " he said to Perry Mason , " goes your defense in this case  --  blown to smithereens ! " Perry Mason said nothing . Judge Purley sighed ponderously . " I will now turn around and go back , " he said . " I presume the newspaper people will want to make some more photographs . " " Very well , " Drumm told him . Perry Mason said nothing . His rugged face was expressionless . The patient , thoughtful eyes stared meditativelyat the face of Judge Purley.  |p279tion  is centered upon the witnesses , upon the judge , upon the dramatic personalities of the attorneys as they match wits in legal arguments . So long as the issue is in doubt , so long as the interestremains centered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators continue to fasten their eyes upon the witnesses ; upon the actors in the drama that is being unfurled . But let some event crash the testimonyto a climax , remove the element of uncertainty , convince the spectators of the guilt of the defendant , and the eyes of the spectators will automatically shift to the defendant ; not trying now to visualize how the defendant looked in the commission of the crime , but staring at the prisoner with that morbid curiosity which comes to men who look at one who is about to die . They like to terrify themselves by thinking of the morning when the inevitable hands will drag the protestingprisoner from the cell and march the lagging footsteps along that last grim walk . It is the sign which lawyers dread , the verdict of these masses , the thumbs-down signal which shows the turning point has been passed , and that the prisoner is condemned . Never a veteran trial lawyer who has fought his way through the intricate web of many cases , but has learned to appreciate the dread portent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance , often they smirk with satisfaction as they see themselves the sudden cynosure of the eyes of the spectators ; but not so the attorney who sits at the coun- " Is it a fact , Mr. Graves , that you have some animus , some prejudice against the defendant , Frances Celane , in this case , due to the fact that she is married to Robert Gleason ? " The question came as a surprise , and there was that suppressed rustle of motion from the courtroom which indicates a sudden snapping to attention on the part of the spectators , a craning of necks , a pushing forward to the extreme edges of the seats . " That is not true ! " protested Don Graves , with a show of feeling . " I did everything I could to keep the name of Frances Celane out of this . I am testifying in this matter only because I was forced to court under a subpoena . " " And you have no bias against Frances Celane for any other reason ? " " None . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hold no feeling of friendship for Robert Gleason because I know him but slightly ; but for Miss Celane , my feelings are entirely different . I would not say a word in this courtroom which would connect her in any way with the murder of Edward Norton unless I knew absolutely and beyond all reasonable doubt that what I said was true and correct . " " No further questions , " said Perry Mason , with the air of a man who has been defeated . Claude Drumm got to his feet , and said with just a trace of a sneer in his air of triumph : " I have a few questions to ask upon redirect examination . You were asked upon cross-examination , Mr. Graves , whetherp281the District Attorney desires to examine this witness as to the test , I shall make no objection , subject , however , to the fact that I shall have the right to cross-examine the various witnesses to that test , as to the actual circumstancessurrounding it . " It had been said of Judge Markham that the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise to the face of the magistrate when he was sitting in a court of law . Now Judge Markham stared at Perry Mason as though he would try to read what might be in the mind of the counsel for the defense , and his eyes were wide and thoughtful . Perry Mason met his gaze calmly and placidly . " Shall I proceed with the cross-examination of the witness ? " he asked . " Proceed , " snapped Judge Markham . " You are familiar with the business affairs of EdwardNorton ? " asked Perry Mason in an even monotoneof passionless inquiry . " I am fully familiar with all of those affairs , " said Don Graves . " You are then familiar with the expiration date of the insurance policy which lay upon the desk of EdwardNorton ? " asked Perry Mason . " I am . " " What was the expiration date of that insurance policy ? " " The twenty-sixth of October of the present year . " " Ah ! Then the insurance policy expired but three days after the murder of Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is human nature to crowd breathlessly forward as spectators when men are risking high stakes on : t single card . Therefore the reading public eagerly devoured the newspaper accounts of that which had happened . The outcome of the case was now a foregone conclusion . Don Graves had vindicated his ability to identify the occupants of the room from the exact point where he had seen the murder committed , and under exactly similar circumstances . The gaze of the spectators in the courtroom had shifted now from the witnesses , and was fastened upon the defendants , particularly upon the shapely and slender figure of Frances Celane . Old campaigners who have participated in hard fought legal battles will agree that this is the most ominous sign which a courtroom can give . When a case first starts , the attention of the spectators is fastened upon the defendants . They strain their necks with curiosity , watch the faces of the defendants for some flicker of expression which will convey a hint of their feelings . The average spectator likes to look at a defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances surrounding the crime , and reach an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner , to the extent that he or she seems visually to fit into that picture . Then , after the trial is under way , the auditors becomeinterested in the unfolding of the story of the crime itself , in the battle over testimony . Their atten/you had ever made a test , under circumstances identical with the circumstances surrounding the murder of EdwardNorton , to determine if you could recognize personsin the room where Edward Norton was mur-dered . " " Yes , " said Don Graves , " I was asked that ques-tion . " " Since that question was asked you , " persisted Claude Drumm , " have you made such a test under exactlyidentical circumstances ? " " I have , " said Don Graves . " Describe the circumstances under which that test was conducted , and the result of it , " said Claude Drumm . " The test was made at night , " said Don Graves slowly , and in a low tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were three men in Edward Norton 's study and two women . One of the women was dressed in black , and one in pink . One of the men had on a blue serge suit , one had on a tweed suit , and one had on a plaid suit . I knew each one of the men , but had never seen the women before . There were presentrepresentatives of the press , and there were present Mr. Drumm , the Deputy District Attorney , also Perry Mason , the attorney for the defense . " " Then what happened ? " asked Claude Drumm . " Then , " said Graves , still speaking in that low , strained voice , " we got in the automobile and went up the winding road which goes over the hills toward the main boulevard . When Judge Purley had the car at the place where it had been the night of the murder , v when I gave the exclamation , he told me to look back . I looked back , and continued to look until the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What did you see ? " asked Claude Drumm . " I saw a woman , the one who had the pink dress on , standing in about the same position that Frances Celane was standing when Mr. Norton was killed , and I saw the man who wore the blue serge suit holding a club over the chair where Mr. Norton had sat on the night of the murder . " " Cross-examine the witness , " said Claude Drumm triumphantly . Perry Mason 's voice was almost drawling . " You have n't told all that happened there during the test , have you , Mr. Graves ? " " Yes sir , all of the important points . " " Was n't there a newspaper reporter there who annoyedyou and delayed you somewhat ? " asked Perry Mason . " Yes sir . There was a chap named Nevers , I believe , who kept insisting upon certain changes in the way the test was being made . I had no authority to make any change in the conditions of the test . Those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told this reporter so . But he kept hanging on to me , even hooking his finger in the buttonhole of my coat , and holding me . " " Where were we at that time ? " asked Perry Mason . " You were down in the automobile . " " How did you finally get free from him ? " Mason inquired  | " I called down to Mr. Drumm , and he told me definitelythat there were to be no changes in the conditionsunder which the test was to be conducted . When this reporter heard Mr. Drumm make that statement , he seemed to realize that he was out of order , and let me go . " Spectators who had been straining their necks to listen , now glanced curiously at one another . " That is all , " said Perry Mason . " Call your next witness , Mr. Drumm , " said Judge Markham . " Just a moment , Your Honor , " interrupted Perry Mason . " Before the prosecution goes on , I would like to recall Arthur Crinston for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Markham . " The proceedinghas been slightly irregular , but , under the circumstances , the matter being entirely in the discretion and control of the court , I will permit you to cross-examine any of the other witnesses that you may care to call . The court is not unmindful of the fact that various new conditions have entered into the case since your very brief cross-examination of the other witnesses . " Judge Markham could not resist a slight emphasis upon the words describing the brevity of the cross-examination ; an emphasis which was in the nature of a very faint judicial rebuke to counsel who would so lightly dispose of the cross-examination of important witnesses in a murder case . Arthur Crinston came forward , his face grave , his eyes solemn.  | THE courtroom was jammed with spectators as Judge Markham marched in from the chambers in the rear of the bench . " Stand up , " shouted the bailiff . The spectators arose and remained standing while Judge Markham strode to the judicial chair and the bailiff intoned the formula which convened the sessionof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gavel , and spectators , attorneys , jurors and defendants dropped into their seats . The atmosphere of the courtroom was electric , but sympathies were all with the prosecution . In man there is implanted a sporting instinct to side with the underdog , but this is in man , the individual . Mob psychology is different from individual psychology , and the psychology of the pack is to tear down the weaker and devour the wounded . Man may sympathize with the underdog , but he wants to side with the winner . And the results of the test had been spread to the public through the pages of every newspaper in the city . It had been dramatic and spectacular . There had been about it something of the element of a gambling proposition . The defense had staked much on the happeningof a certain event , on the turn of a single card ,  | sellors ' table , his law books piled in front of him , his face calm and serene , but his soul shrinking from the portent of that silent verdict . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of murder in the first degree for both defendants , and there was no recommendation of mercy . Judge Markham 's level tones cut the tense silence of the courtroom . " Mr. Don Graves was on the witness stand , " he said , " and was being cross-examined . The case was continuedfrom last week , pursuant to a stipulation by counsel that a test was to be made with this witness  --  a test that had been suggested by the defense , and stipulatedto by the prosecution . " Gentlemen , do I understand that the results of that test were to be received in evidence ? " Claude Drumm rose to his feet and said sneeringly : " It was a test which was conducted with every possible degree of fairness to the defense , at the challenge of the defense , and pursuant to stipulation . It was participatedin by this witness under conditions identical to those which surrounded the commission of the crime , and I asked that it be received in evidence . " Judge Markham looked at Perry Mason . Perry Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " there is no objection to that . It is , however , not a part of my cross-examination . That is , it must come in as a part of the redirect examination of this witness , and the question is thereforenot properly before the court at the present time . But , when the question does come before the court ,
