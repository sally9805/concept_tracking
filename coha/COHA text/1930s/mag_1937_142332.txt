Like many another outraged oldster throughout the land , Richmond Pearson Hobson sat up late in Manhattan one night last week discussing the depravity of President Roosevelt 's plan to rejuvenate the Supreme Court . Most of the nation 's unofficial denouncers that night were content to vent their spleen in talk , go modestly to bed . But Richmond Pearson Hobson was a professional zealot who , in 30-odd years of windy crusading against alcohol , narcotics and un-Americanism , of drumming up fears of Japanese invasion and Communist infiltration , had never forgotten that he was once the No. 1 U. S. Hero . Before he retired , Richmond Pearson Hobson sat self-importantly down , wrote the President of the U. S. a letter announcing his regret that " I am not able to go with you on this Supreme Court fight . " Having thus given the President fair warning , 66-year-old Richmond Pearson Hobson slept soundly , ate a hearty breakfast next morning , but toned up his overcoat for the trip to his office , fell dead of a heart attack . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handicapped by wretched ships , equipment and support , sailed his rusty little fleet of four cruisers and three destroyers across the Atlantic , straight through the operations centre of an over whelmingly superior U. S. fleet set to catch him , and safe into harbor at Santiago , Cuba without once sighting or being sighted by a U. S. warship . Navy censor ship hid that inglorious episode from the U , S. public , gagged war correspondents for another fortnight while the Navy made up its mind as to just where Cervera was . After Commodore Winfield Scott Schley had ventured close enough to sight a Spanish cruiser lying in plain view near the entrance to Santiago harbor , Admiral William T. Sampson determined to bottle up the enemy fleet by sinking a ship across the narrow harbor entrance . Because of his knowledge of ship construction , Lieutenant Richmond Pearson Hobson , nine years out of Annapolis , was chosen for the attempt . With seven volunteers aboard the stripped old collier Merrimac* he steamed up to the harbor in the dark of the moon on June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedoes with which Hobson had planned to scuttle his ship refused to explode . The Spaniards were execrable marksmen , but they shot away his rudder chains and the Merrimac drifted helplessly past its mark into open harbor . There two Spanish torpedoes sank it in a spot where it did no one any harm . <P> Clinging to a raft , Lieutenant Hobson and his men were fished out of the water by a Spanish launch at dawn , imprisoned with utmost courtesy .
