When the U. S. went to war in 1917 , critical citizens declined to take at face value President Wilson 's pronouncements of an idealistic national purpose . Right or wrong , they insisted that the country had been driven into the fight for selfish economic reasons . Bankers who had made large military loans to the Allies were charged with seeking to protect their investment . Industrialists whose factories already hummed filling foreign munitions contracts were accused of fostering U. S. participation to increase their own profits . After the Armistice this skepticism of U. S. war motives was increased by the presence of Government contractors who had grown inordinately rich , big corporations from which the U. S. could never recover excess war profits . Veterans , drafted to fight in France at $30 per month , returned to the U. S. in disgruntled amazement to find free workers drawing $300 per month in safe factories . Bankers seemed more prosperous than ever . <P> W. P. C. Growing with the years , this dissatisfaction with the last War has crystallized into a demand to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has agitated for what it calls the " Universal Draft . " Oftener and oftener is heard the suggestion that Capital and Labor , as well as mere soldiers , be conscripted hereafter . So politically insistent has this movement become that the last Congress created a War Policies Commission . The duties of the W. P. C. were to investigate the details of the last war and prepare legislation " to equalize the burdens and minimize the profits of war . " <P> Secretary of War Patrick Jay Hurley was named the Commission 's chairman and with him sat the Secretaries of the Navy , Agriculture , Commerce , Labor , the Attorney General , four Senators , four Representatives . In March the Commission held a short series of hearings at which it went straight to the economics of war . Last week it returned to the task of devising ways &; means of conducting the next armed struggle more efficiently , more economically , without profit to anyone . <P> Baruch Plan . Most important proposal before the W. P. C. came from Bernard Mannes Baruch , astute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Industries Board , which mobilized and controlled business to supply the Army during the War , Mr. Baruch learned from experience all about war profiteering . To eradicate it he proposed a Federal command of **25;12967;TOOLONG . " In modern warfare , " he testified , " administrative control must replace the law of supply and demand . To measure inflation of price and profit we must have some norm . The obvious norm is the whole price structure as it existed on some antecedent date near to the declaration of war . . . . That determined , we need a method of freezing the whole price structure at that level . The obvious way to do this is simple : By proclamation to decree that every price in the whole national pattern as of that determined date , shall be one maximum that thenceforth may be charged for anything-rents , wages , interest rates , commissions , fees , in short , the price of every item and service in commerce . . . . Such a system would reduce the cost of war by 50% . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's resources and preserve the morale of its people . . . . "
