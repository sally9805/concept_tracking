txt The Tragedy of Prohibition . To the Editor of The New York , Times : I sat in a local motion-picture theatre Thanksgiving night . Coming attractions were being announced , chief of which was " An American Tragedy . " This interested me , for at that moment an American tragedy was being enacted right behind my back ? an American tragedy uninspired by the pen of any creative genius , one that will never merit a Pulitzer prize or any oher commendation , Four or five young boys , I call them boys because they appeared to be in their early teens , were drinking copiously of bootleg poison , the odor of which was nauseating . The Unmanly resolutions and epithets produced by the alcoholic saturation of their brains was a tragedy that no American can boast or be proud of . How much longer must this dastardly piece of legislation remain as an integral part of the Constitution to vitiate the youth of the country ? Prohibition has had more than a fair chance and has been pronounced unenforceable by leading citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sane thinking parents who can not control the actions of their children after reaching a certain age . If they must drink , better that they drink " good stuff " than the poison that has flooded the country for more than eleven years . D. A. BARNIE . New York , Dec. 1 , 1931.
