" I do n't care what sentence I get , " said Prisoner Peter Stuart in the dock of a London court last week , " because the fight will go on . " Peter got 15 years . Michael Joseph Mason got 17 . Seven of their friends got 59 among them . Their crime : being good soldiers of the Irish Republican Army-i.e. , bomb-planters . <P> The political reasoning behind I. R. A. 's English bombings is about as involved as a Rube Goldberg invention : 1 ) one of I. R. A. 's 15,000 members gets a job in England as a mechanic , poster painter , motorman ; 2 ) he plants a bomb in a place where it will raise merry hell but probably kill no one ; 3 ) the terrified English people put pressure on the Government ; 4 ) the Government cedes Northern Ireland to Eire ; 5 ) a unified Irish Republic is formed , which will be so anti-British that it will take sides against Britain in the next big war . So far , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as Step 2 . The British people have been angered but not scared by the Army , which is illegal in both Eire and Britain . Last week 's trial was the severest measure England has yet taken to keep the machine from working at all . <P> Wary after threats from all nine sentenced men , London last week put a strong guard around the house of the judge who presided at the trial . But I. R. A. terror , like poison ivy , breaks out in strange places . Late that night , motorists and pedestrians going sleepily home over Hammersmith Bridge , the farthest up-Thames within London , were rocked by a sudden Boom ! Suspension chains snapped , a support-girder sagged , windows 100 yards away on the north bank crashed to the street . Bam ! In mid-bridge another blast shook the 52-year-old structure from tower to tower . The whole span drooped a foot below its usual level . <P> As traffic was detoured. pending an examination , officials hesitated to jump to the conclusion that " the fight " was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no doubt left . In Fleet Street , centre of London 's newspaper offices , the presses were grinding out morning editions . Suddenly came a bomb 's heavy thud . Part of the News-Chronicle office crumbled . No one was hurt but . when the presses were stopped , it was discovered that one story they had been running off was a gloating little piece about Michael Joseph Mason 's 17-year sentence , Peter Stuart 's 15 years , and their seven friends who got 59 among them .
