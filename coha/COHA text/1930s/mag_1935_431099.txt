THERE are some things one never forgets . One of them is how white the moonlight seemed to a boy kneeling at his bedroom window , dreaming the dreams that would not let him go , while all the world seemed asleep and careless of the beauty that was almost like pain . Another is of the illimitable number of the stars when one stood where the whole of the heavens , not just a fragment of them , could be seen ? stars that twinkled happily and stars that were soberly staid ; stars big and little , bright and dim ; stars unchanging and unchanged in the time of man ; a multitude of stars , but each star radioing the message , " There is , there is something more to life than there seems to be ; keep your eyes on us . " One would not want to forget such memories or such messages , but we of today take little time to refresh them or to find out if the old assurances still flash down . We are busy about many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leisure that belongs to the shining night has no appeal for us . Then , too , we are actually shutting out the stars , building ourselves towns and cities where the thousands and the millions gather and the garishness of noonday floods the streets and banishes the kindly , whispering dark , so that no eye can penetrate to the great spaces where troop the stars , or see them in their marching . This is bitter loss , none the less so because so many do not know it . The flower may not be conscious of the dryness creeping about its roots , but it fades . The soul may not miss the sprinkling of the dust from the stars , but something that has no other source is gone ? a something that inspires , that conceives dreams , that whispers , " Never be satisfied . " " It is no small damage that we city folk lose the stars , " says a metropolitan editorial writer . " Can it be entirely accident that the birthplaces of great ideas have been so largely spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures of the Hebrew prophets have held the world 's thoughts for nearly thirty centuries so largely in their fingers if the high hills of Palestine had been forever overcast with clouds ? " Do those questions mean anything to you ? Do they remind you that the stars are still there , and the everlasting hills , with their calling , their consolation , their content ? Man 's body is flying these days ? dashing across the skies with all the beauty of the world spread out below , clear in the sunlight , mottled with cloud shadows , breath-taking in its grandeur ; with the glory of the lights of heaven sifting down through untrammeled space to give one a sense of freedom , of daring , of brotherhood with all the courage that man has ever known . It is a daring age ; but do we dare give up the search for higher things ? The stars look down ; do they find us looking up ? " No country boy , " says the writer quoted above , " stepping out-of-doors on a clear night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours . " It is good knowledge to have , and as , this month , we stand night after night where the stars seem very close , we shall hope that you , too , are wondering about the purposes of God , and why the hand that is and holds Beauty should give and withhold not .
