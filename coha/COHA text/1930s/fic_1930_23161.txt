AN UNWRITTEN STORY A STORY BY J. C. SQUIRE I T WAS the first time that Wilfrid Evans had ever been a member of a rather large house party in a rather large house , although he had described many such parties in his novels . Competently too : he was intelligent , well enough bred and well enough educated ; and he had sufficient sense and imagination ( he flattered himself ) not to deduce a whole upper class from the occasional specimens whom he had met when some more enterprising , if not raffish , brother of his craft had taken him to a cocktail party in a mews , a semi-smart night club , or a late supper on the more elegant of the coasts of Bohemia . Some of these were eccentric , some of them had to scratch where they could for a living , some were disreputable . Some were declasses , making the best of things , some were parvenus , painstakingly languid , arrogant , and a-sthetic , and some were merely amusing themselves by an occasional dive into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No : Wilfrid Evans was not deceived , and he was aware of his own percipience . He saw life steadily , he thought , and saw it whole ; he missed very little indeed , and thoroughly agreed with kindly critics who commended his " eye for fine shades . " Why enter into further details ? He had at all events ( as he frequently with some legitimate complacency told his friends ) come to the conclusion that human nature and the distribution of good and bad were much the same in all classes , that nobody could be quite so vile as the aristocrats in Mr. Nokes 's books , and nobody quite so epigrammatic as those in Mr. Stokes 's . And , in the best quarters , his reputation was immeasurably superior to Nokes 's or Stokes 's . He continued , without having lived among the established rich , to describe their habits , conversations , loves , hates , and surroundings in a manner which satisfied that intelligent minority among them , almost all women , who ever read novels at all . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deferential , not to say sentimental , attitude towards the prosperous ? The wisest and subtlest of the dowagers , who had seen much and remembered Mr. James , Mr. Meredith , and even Mr. Jowett , were pleased with him . " A relief after all that rubbish ! " they said , then looked him up in Burke , thinking that he was probably somebody 's second cousin , and found that he was not . It was through the latest of his dowagers that he was now at Milstead . She had written to him , with charming apologies ( " perhaps you will forgive an old woman .. . " ) for the intrusion , a month after the publication of his last book , The Poynings ; and his reply had led to an invitation to tea in John Street , Mayfair . He naturally went . The house was small , and the door was opened by a middle-aged maidservant , with long service clinging like an aura around her . He was shown upstairs into a tiny empty drawing-room and waited . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few philosophic and religious books included , and a table on which were all the recent books of which anybody thought anything . He strayed awkwardly about , touching the dark Chippendale and the Dresden shepherdesses , and finally took to gazing at himself in a round , convex Empire mirror , surmounted by gilt eagle and ball , studying with interest the shrewd , wrinkling eyes behind the horn-rimmed spectacles and the firm , rather ironic mouth under the little dark mustache . The door softly opened ; he turned with a slight start , and there was a little old lady in black , thin and hook-nosed , but with cheeks that still had color , eyes that still sparkled , and a voice which was girlishly silvery as it greeted him . Soon he almost forgot that she was not really a young woman , so quick was she , so sensitive , so keenly interested in everything contemporary , so gaily humorous , so pleasantly complimentary to himself . Afterwards a candid friend told him that it was the art born of long experience that enabled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid and even eager an account of himself and his hopes ; but at the time it was as though two minds and two hearts were fully opening , quickened by each other , for the first time . Then , at last , there came a knock at the door , momentarily annoying . He cursed silently , and felt himself closing up . " Lady Hunter , " said the maid . Elizabeth ! " said the dowager : " Mr. Evans , my niece Elizabeth . " It did not take long for Evans 's annoyance to pass . Lady Hunter had not her aunt 's wide cultivation and would never move with such certainty . But her instincts were fine , though she was diffident and flushed easily , at first because of the occasional exposure of her lack of information and slowness to take allusions , and then , as the triangular talk warmed up , and Evans was tempted to an eager fluency , from pleasure at his whimsicality or at the reflection of thoughts she had known but never formulated . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away from the house , and how well we got on " ? recovering the picture of her tall , graceful figure , her neat , light-brown hair , and straight features , direct gray eyes , and swift smile , her modesty , responsiveness , and fundamental gravity which at moments seemed even tinged with sadness . " I am sentimentalizing her , " he said to himself . " She is a healthy countrywoman of forty who looks less because an easy pheasant-shooting husband gives her everything she wants . Novelists ought to be more detached and keep their eyes fixed on things as they are ! " Three months afterwards , when the old lady had twice taken him to lunch with Elizabeth Hunter and the very ornithological and very kindly Sir Francis in Bryanston Square , he was asked down to Milstead for a week-end . " My aunt , " wrote Lady Hunter , " says that you wo n't mind our asking you , and we feel that we really know you quite well through your books . I 'm afraid that you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household ; perhaps you 'll enliven us by telling us one after dinner . " He was to meet ( for the list was given save that several young women were not individually specified ) a number of delightful people , whose dignities ranged from the Marquisate of the Glasspools to the captaincy of a certain Geoffrey Poole . So there he was at Milstead , a house full of rugs , skins , and heads , the first t.1 down fur dinner , standing in front of a great stone Tudor fireplace , endeavoring to sort out in his mind the names and faces of sixteen strangers , whose cars had intermittently swept up through the autumn twilight , half of whom he had never heard of before , though they all , old and young , evidently knew one another extremely well . Echoes of many scraps of greeting and conversation rang softly in his head : " Diana ! " " Mary ! " " We both liked your last novel so much . " " Geoffrey , you 're a perfect scandal . " " Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be another month before the leaf 's off properly . " " No , there 's a new Master ; Bill could n't afford it any longer . " He could quite well invent such a mixture of flimsy remarks  --  he had , in fact , often done so  --  they were natural , indeed , inevitable . But it was one thing to describe a milieu and invent personages who resembled those who existed , and another to invade the milieu and guess at the relations of a number of actual individuals . The world of his novels was like this world ; but which of his characters did these particular people resemble ? In the world of his novels painful things were hushed up and deplorable things were known within a certain small society and remained a complete secret to the population at large . He had heard to-day a girl in low tones saying something to another about . " Booby and Edith . " Who was Booby ? Who was Edith ? For that matter , who were Pinky , Foxy , the Badger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This actual small nation of people was as removed from him as Sweden or the Argentine so far as knowledge of personal characters and ties were concerned . It was not his society , and he had , he told himself with a little pride , no ambition to step into it , preferring his homelier club and the conversation of one or two people at a time , people with his own tastes and familiar with his own surroundings . But here he was and he should certainly keep his end up . He was not very shy and not immoderately humble . He would , he knew well , come through without clumsiness . With Sir Francis he had felt thoroughly familiar from the first , the friendly old country baronet with a hobby might have walked straight out of one of his own books . And , after all , there were one or two rather striking and attractive faces among the others , which should make the visit worth while . There was , for instance , the lean , deep-socketed , sunburnt , intelligent face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if he saw him a few times they would probably become friends . There were marks of suffering , he thought , in that face ; then , as his habit was , he pulled himself together and reminded himself that effects could also be produced by late nights or malaria . Food and wine had come and gone ; they had been served with fruit , and the port was going round . Evans , seated three from his hostess on the right , had kept going not so badly with his two ladies . his neighbor on the left , Mrs. Fitzgerald , plump , blonde , and fifty , was easy : musical up to a point , an inveterate and not stupid theatergoer who knew everybody , including all the senior litterateurs , and drew him , especially after three several wines , into an almost flirtatious exchange of mildly malicious gossip and criticism  --  nothing is so unifying as a joint , half-suppressed titter . The girl on his left was not so easy ; she was twenty , looked with a dutiful profundity into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was really roused when he mentioned hunting , but became a shade more tepid when it became evident that he knew no more about foxhunting foxhunting than a Zulu . However , she was obviously consoled by the knowledge that he was a celebrity of some sort , and had easy relief with a young , rounded , curly-haired , fair-mustached , jocular man on her left . who was patently an intimate . Evans felt mellow and at his ease , as a conversation a trais between these two and a cleverish , hard-looking girl , Diana Spurway , beyond , developed and left him for a moment free to listen , watch , or lapse into brief reverie . The general babble grew dim , as he gazed at the light shining through his wine , at the long , polished table , the napery , the painted china , the shining silver , the shadowed shirts , and faint-gleaming buttons of the men-servants , the curtains which shut out dark lawns , dark trees , an infinite , mysterious countryside under the cold sparkle of the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discreetly allowed his eyes to roam from end to end of the table . Lord Glasspool 's serious , horselike face with the small side-whiskers was half visible beyond Mrs. Fitzgerald , whom he was instructing in the economics of the sugar-beet . Lady Hunter , cool to the gaze in a soft blue gown and a single pearl pendant , was talking with interest to Sir Michael Strode , one of the youngest and ablest diplomatists in the Service . Mrs. Bulfinch , a pleasant blonde American widow of forty , in red , was vivaciously engaged with Captain Poole , Evans 's immediate vis- ? - vis . As Evans 's eyes lingered on this pair , particularly on the mobile , expressive , dark face of Poole , there was a light laugh from Lady Hunter at the end of the table . Poole shot a swift , responsive glance towards her , and the thought flashed across the novelist 's mind : " That soldier admires our hostess as much as 1 do ! " Then he rapidly tried to fix the characters of the others : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd ; somebody 's husband , fat , bald , clean-shaven , monocled , fifty-eight , also giggling , also shrewd ; an elderly indeterminate spinster on his right ; Colonel Fox , dark , hard , cynical , rather repellent . Beyond him , Lady Glasspool , an evident sock-knitter , was getting on very unaffectedly with dear old straightforward Sir Francis , with his untidy hair , twinkling eyes , ruddy complexion , dawning second chin , and protuberant shirt-front . Sir Francis was doing all the talking : the subject , therefore , would certainly be the habits of birds . Between Sir Francis and Diana Spurway , hardly visible unless he craned his neck , were Strode 's colorless wife and the far from colorless Lord Queenstown , a jovial Irish peer of seventy who had lost all his estates , had no money , and doubtless divided his time between his club and visits to the houses of old ladies whom he had known in the hunting-field in youth and with whom he could now chuckle over ancient scandals . And then Diana Spurway . Brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face in a young woman , and there was a tinge of bitterness in her expression which had struck him when they were first introduced , and which had even seemed to give a hidden , vague irony to her first " How d' you do ? " They were varied , he thought ; they ought n't to make a bad audience for his story , if they really remembered to ask him for it ; though it would probably be too subtle for most of them . . . . " A penny for your thoughts , " whispered Mrs. Fitzgerald roguishly in his ear . He felt himself flush because of his unintentional rudeness and said be was n't thinking of anything  --  then , remembering that truth sometimes makes the most amusing conversation , corrected himself , " No , that was n't quite true : I was thinking of the characters of everybody round this table . " " Not mine I hope , " laughed Mrs. Fitzgerald , " but I wonder how far you got them right . Character is destiny you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His powers of repartee might have been unduly taxed , but at that moment Elizabeth Hunter rose , and the ladies filed out of the room . Sir Francis changed ends ; the men closed up towards him ; the decanters passed . Except that Lord Queenstown occasionally murmured a jocular aside to the fair young man , the conversation was monopolized by the three at the table 's end : for Sir Francis , after an attempt on the birds of the Balkans had fallen rather flat , insisted in his bluff Englishman 's manner , on pumping Strode about the situation in the Near East . , There was comedy in it for the listener : Sir Francis honestly trying to measure a hideously intricate situation with his few honest notions about fair play and foreigners , Sir Michael endeavoring to indicate the complications of the position without indicating the ignorance of his host , and Glasspool reducing everything to wool with a second-rate politician 's cautious but sonorous platitudes . Evans caught gleams , now of quick interest , now of amusement , in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , had spent in the Near East his leaves from India ; but the other seemed bored , and Colonel Fox flicked the ash from his cigar in a manner which suggested not only boredom but disdain  --  some of which Evans felt to be unreasonably directed towards himself . How he hated these conceited men ! . . . A last refusal of port , and they moved to join the ladies . In size and character it was more like an Elizabethan Hall , long and warmed by two huge fireplaces in one wall . By the door was a billiard-table , and yards had to be walked before they reached the comfortable end where the nine ladies , two of them already knit ting , the others conversing in small groups , were scattered about on chairs and sofas . In the far left corner Evans noticed a great high-backed chair , dominating the assembly . " Well , " he thought , " if I am to tell them a story that is where I should obviously sit . " There was dispersed conversation ; Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lord Queenstown about the state of Ireland , and asked Sir Michael for news of a personal friend of his own who was Vice-Consul at a Roumanian port . He felt a little chagrin when , during a lull , he heard Sir Francis suggest bridge . But the ladies had not forgotten . Amid a chorus of feminine assent , Mrs. Bulfinch took the floor . " No , Sir Francis , " she said , " we 're all agreed we 'd like another form of entertainment to-night . " " As you like , " he replied gallantly . " What is it ? Forfeits ? " " No , Frank , " came quietly from his wife , " we 've a famous novelist here , and I 've told Mr. Evans that if he only would , we 'd all like him to tell us a story . " " Good idea , " said Lord Queenstown , Geoffrey Poole , and Mr. Fitzgerald . " Admirable , " followed from Sir Michael . " Rather , " said the fair young man . Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence of Colonel Fox and the yawning silence of Lord Glasspool , but after all , he was not going to be cowed by men like those . " Oh , please , " he stammered with becoming modesty , " do n't think I want to be professional at the week-end . Do play bridge . I 'm sure everybody 'd rather ! " This did not work , nor did a tentative effort to allege that he could not open his mouth in public  --  for Mrs. Bulfinch had heard him lecture " divinely " at a Woman 's Club in Boston . With head diffidently bent he was led to the high-backed chair , while the elder ladies smiled complacently and the younger tittered with flattering excitement . " Come and sit by me , Geoffrey , " he heard Diana Spurway say to Poole in that puzzlingly malevolent voice . " I believe that girl 's in love with that man , " he thought ; then , endeavoring to concentrate on his task , he surveyed the circle ( Lord Glasspool was obviously preparing for immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broke the oppressive new-born silence . " I am not , " he said smoothly , " a story teller out of Arabia . I have n't a repertory . I ca n't , in talk , even tell one whole story with all its detail of circumstance . If I must bore you , it can only be by giving you the vaguest sketch of a story I 'm thinking of now , which I suppose will be the next that I shall write . " The elderly indeterminate spinster spoke for once . " Is it a sad story ? " " Not exactly , " said Evans , smiling at her . Peggy Strode joined in , " Is it about real people ? " " I should think not , " he replied indignantly . " This modern trick of pillorying real people , whether one 's friends or acquaintances or strangers , in works of fiction seems to me thoroughly disgusting and caddish . I 'd rather stop writing than do it . For what this is worth I 've certainly made it all up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " gushed Miss Strode , " and we shall hear it before anybody . " " S  --  sh , Peggy , " came from her knitting mother across the room . Anyhow , that was attention ; the studied indifference of Fox and the somnolence of Glasspool did n't matter with all the rest so eager : Lady Hunter all sweet encouragement , her husband all sturdy attention and admiration for a world beyond him , Geoffrey Poole so intelligent and so obviously friendly . " You see , " he went on , " I do n't know how other people work ; but for myself a situation comes into my head , and then a few main characters involved in it , and then the background and minor developments of the plot , most of which I know nothing about until I start writing . The result is that all I can do virtually is to tell you what the story is about . " There was a rustle , a match was struck , and silence returned . " It 's an odd thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happens to be about a house-party and about a novelist reading a story to them after dinner . " " You rogue , you 've made it all up ! " said Mrs. Fitzgerald . " That is n't fair ; it really is n't , " he went on , with a touch of warmth , " I do n't get ideas as quickly as all that . This thing I first thought of ages ago , long before I ever dreamed of coming here . Well , it 's like this , and though I do n't want to boast " ? he laughed ? " I must say I think it 's rather ingenious . " There 's a country-house  --  any kind of a house , Tudor or Georgian , or modern , it does n't matter  --  and a weekend party . This novelist who might be me , but I hope I 'm not quite so simple as I mean him to be  --  is asked down not knowing a soul except his host and hostess , and not knowing the relations between any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accidentally drawn . Well , what I 'm going to do is to make him tell a story which will apply to some of the people in the room . Everybody there will become gradually embarrassed as they realize this , only he will never realize it himself , having no clue to the secret . " There was a pause as the party turned the notion over in their heads . Then , with determined curiosity Miss Spurway 's voice was heard , " Have n't you thought out any details of the embarrassing story that he 's going to tell ? " " Well , " said the narrator , stroking his chin with his knuckle , " I have ? ? ? ? ? ? 110 roughly , but only roughly . It 's like this : you know how one frequently hears things one 's never guessed at about people one 's known for ages , and then finds that all sorts of others have known all about them all the time ? " " Yes , " was the general murmur . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist unfortunately wo n't have heard about . There 's going to be what they call a triangle . " " How thrilling , " came the hard voice of Diana Spurway , while something like , " What , one more ? " seemed to come from Lord Queenstown . Evans took no notice and continued . " Three people are involved , and a special point is that they 're all nice . " Colonel Fox 's eyebrows , he thought , suggested that there was a departure from life here . " There are a husband and wife ( let us say the host and hostess , for drama 's sake , though it does n't matter ) and another man . " A log fell on the hearth with a thud . Lady Glasspool 's needles clicked . " The husband is kindly but older than his wife ; she has an immense affection for him , but when she married him she was too young and mistook her admiration for him and liking for his decent company for the real thing . The other man she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have gone out of her life for years ; then he will have returned , and they will have fallen hopelessly in love with each other , but will for the husband 's sake run no risk of his finding this out . There may ( though I have n't made up my mind ) be a further complication with another woman who is in love with the man . The novelist will innocently tell this story ; but the whole party , except the husband , will know that it applies to these three people in the room , and they 'll all know that all the others know , for it will have been whispered about for years . " Mrs. Bulfinch lighted a cigarette , and then , with what seemed to Evans a rather ill-mannered endeavor ( after being particularly pressing originally ) to rob him of the chance of filling in his outlines , remarked heartily , " So that 's that ; quite a good plot . " " Yes , " drawled Colonel Fox , " thanks very much . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that he was capable of telling anything which might be awkward in mixed company . Happily , help came . " No , but do let him go on , " said Diana Spurway , sweetly . " He must , must n't he , Geoffrey ? " Poole 's smile was set and cryptic . " Yes , " lie replied , " there are lots of things one wants to hear about . " " Yes , Geoffrey , " came the even , bell-like voice of Lady Hunter , " but do get my embroidery from the morning room first , and then Mr. Evans can go on . " Poole left the room ; there was some talk in constrained undertones ; Mrs. Bulfinch half began to speak to Evans and then checked herself . When the work had been brought , and Elizabeth Hunter 's head was bent over it , Evans took up his tale again . " Now , " he said , " as I 've summarized it , I daresay it sounds a pretty crude and simple tale . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be some subtlety and grace about it . Neither the actual pair nor the imaginary pair in my novelist 's story are to be engaged in a mere vulgar and deceitful intrigue . " " How are you going to manage that ? " asked Sir Francis , with a genial laugh . " Let me explain . What I mean is that for the husband 's sake ( or , if you like , for honor 's sake ) they refrain from what is called technically guilt . " " Does n't sound like flesh and blood to me , " said Sir Francis , " but go on , sir , go on . " There was a tense silence which was interrupted by the level and deliberate tone of Strode , staring straight at Evans , " I think I understand . " " I know it may be difficult to make the notion plausible , " Evans answered , " but I am convinced that there are , however rare they may be , some people whose natures are so fine that they are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My couple may not even kiss each other ; or perhaps they may have just once when their first certainty of each other 's Jove forced them to utterance . It will be frightfully hard for them , of course . It will be all the harder for her because she has no children and now no hope of any ; for him because his youth is just passing and he knows that he is dedicated to old and lonely bachelordom , and is perpetually agonized by the thought that if time could only be turned back he could so easily put things right . I do so hope you will realize the sort of characters I mean them to be : both of them so very sensitive and scrupulous , and the husband such an absolutely perfect old dear that , after they have first compelled themselves to face the situation they simply never even toy with the idea of letting him down  --  apart from everything else , they know they 'd be haunted ever afterwards if they did , but they do n't really think of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do get something out of it . Rather than part completely or do what they have decided to be degradingly furtive or unforgivably cruel , they will control themselves and make the best of such consolations as they can snatch . " " Do tell us what those might be , " said Diana Spurway . Evans closed his eyes . " I ca n't tell exactly what my imaginary novelist would say . I have n't thought it out . But there 'll be things like these . They 'll be happy when in company to know that they 're thinking the same thoughts about everything aroundthem , and they 'll occasionally catch each other 's eye and smile with understanding . They 'll both know that if they 're ever in difficulty or trouble there will be one absolutely safe comforter and confessor for them . They 'll meet openly everywhere as friends , not caring what people say so long as they have no good grounds for saying it . And sometimes they 'll have meetings alone , natural or stolen . " I see them sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience to an utter hush , leaning over the parapet of a terrace , looking at the blue distance together , or walking in a wood together , saying nothing , needing to say nothing . And now and then they 'll have quiet meals together in London , talking commonplaces with the utmost intimacy . He 'll be left happy , perhaps , with a bunch of violets or even  --  for strength goes often with the most girlish sentiment  --  a handkerchief . " Evans heard Poole 's voice , very gentle , as though it were expressing the common feeling of the audience , " And they never have more than that ? " " Yes , " he replied , " I think they must have just a little more than that . I think that just once , when the man is staying with the others in the country , they must be stirred to an unusual pitch of emotion . Anything may do it : an event , such as his being ordered away somewhere , or some brutality of fate to one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy young pair of lovers , or even the influence of a serene moon . " He paused , and spoke slowly and impressively , the artist sure of his spell , " They will both be restless perhaps . Long after everybody has gone to bed , she will think she hears somebody outside , look from her window , and see his dark form against a balustrade , staring over the moon-mottled park with its motionless elms and lawns and sleeping cattle ; and , with her heart fluttering but her lips set , she will throw on wraps and steal down the great staircase , and open the door softly , and he will hear her feet brushing the stones , and see her pale face with a finger at her lip and wait for her ; and they 'll stay there for an hour , cheek against cheek , clasping each other 's hands . " Diana Spurway spoke , " I thought you said they were only to kiss once . " " What does it matter , " said Mrs. Fitzgerald impatiently , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a fatuous story anyhow , " commented Diana . " Well , " remarked the American lady , emphatically , " I call it rather a noble story . " " Excellent , excellent , " droned Lord Glasspool , pretending to be awake . " What do you think , Geoffrey ? " Miss Spurway went on . Poole appeared unconcerned . " It seems to me quite ordinary and possible , and I think Mr. Evans told it very well . " " Daresay , daresay , " was Sir Francis 's remark as he rose , " though it sounds a bit complicated to me . But I never professed to understand the present generation . " Whisky , soda , and glasses were remembered . Everybody stood up , preparatory to retiring . The ladies gathered their work and their books and good-nights began to be exchanged . Lady Hunter , who had not spoken for a long time , stepped up to Evans and looked at him so closely that he was rather bewildered . " I must thank you , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an author , " she added , with a little laugh , " who realizes that there is a certain amount of delicacy and honor left in the world . " Evans blushed : he felt very highly complimented . She moved to the door . " Good-night everybody , " shesaid . " I hope you 'll sleep well , Mr. Evans ; good-night , Geoffrey , do n't read too long . " " Good-night , Elizabeth , rather not . " Poole joined Lord Queenstown and the fair young man in their session with the whisky . Colonel Fox came up to Evans and scrutinized him keenly . " D' you mind my asking , " he inquired , " did you say your novelist man will never discover the howler he made after he has inflicted this dreadful evening on all these people and even risked giving the show away ? " " Good Lord , no , sir , " replied Evans , surprised to find that this supercilious-looking man had been listening at all ; " it would spoil the whole yarn if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Fox , " and is the old husband to have the scales removed from his eyes ? " " Certainly not , and I do n't see why he should . After all he 's a simple old thing who has never had the least suspicion of his wife , whom he adores and who is sweetness itself to him . Why it would be quite tragic if I made my story end by breaking his heart . " " Quite right , " said Fox , " it would be . Good-night to you . " Wilfrid Evans thoroughly enjoyed his week-end . His hostess and Geoffrey Poole were particularly kind to him , and Lord Queenstown seemed to relish his company immensely ; while Sir Francis , who thought him " a very clever fella , though a bit odd , " obviously liked him . When Monday came Evans went away without suspecting anything . Nor , happily , did Sir Francis suspect anything . As for Sir Michael Strode , he went off to the Near East , sighing because involved problems did not always work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
