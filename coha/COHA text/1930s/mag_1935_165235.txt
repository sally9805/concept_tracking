For all the fine things devised by Science for the safety and convenience of men , little has been done to dispel the danger and delay inherent in fog . In 1935 it is still the rule , when fog blinds land and sea , to stand and wait until it clears . Last fortnight a great white pall closed in on the Atlantic seaboard , spread over the U. S. as far west as Iowa and Nebraska . When it lifted last week it had lasted four days , the worst since the five-day fog of 1914 . <P> From Nova Scotia to North Carolina fog-sirens in shore stations set up a lugubrious caterwauling , and harbors were hideous with metallic moans . A dozen great ships inbound from Europe and the Caribbean , and scores of lesser liners , hove to rather than try to make port . The Cunard-White Star liner Majestic stood off Ambrose Light for two days while her impatient passengers bet on the length of the delay . The Empress of Britain reported more business at the bars during one day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner Champlain stuck briefly in a mudbank . Near the Statue of Liberty a ferry sank a coal-barge . The Hamburg-American liner Resolute sideswiped a freighter , erasing the last six letters of her own name from the bow . Ellis Island 's Immigration Station reported it was short of food . <P> On land there was more trouble . East of the Mississippi , from Alabama to Canada , airports announced " Zero-zero " weather , and air transport stood stock-still . For three days not a plane reached or left the world 's busiest port at Newark . In Chicago a lost , invisible plane thrummed round &; round the 30-story Furniture Mart for hours . In Alabama Lieut . James L. Majors , U. S. A. , tried to land in a fog-wrapped field , crashed , died . <P> Consensus of shipping men was that the fog had cost them $1,000,000 . James Henry Kimball , Manhattan 's longtime weatherman , was inclined to double that figure . American , Eastern and United Air Lines and TWA estimated fog losses totaling $110,000 . Manhattan 's Empire State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <P> Fog is produced when warm , wet air encounters cold water , cold ground or cold air which condenses the moisture into droplets ranging from .00004 to .0008 of an inch in diameter . Thus last week 's great pall was accompanied by unseasonal warmth . It was really a double blanket : an ocean fog caused by high pressure over the Atlantic and a land fog caused by low pressure over the Ohio and Mississippi valleys .
