Mosr of us who have given consideration to religious matters assume that we know why we stand thus and so in the tangle of conflicting faiths . If one is a Christian Scientist , a Roman Catholic , an orthodox Presbyterian , he can usually , and with manifest sincerity , set forth impressive reasons for adhering to the doctrines of his sect . It was only after I had passed through radical changes in my religious convictions that I came to doubt whether pure reason plays much part in fixing our attitude toward such questions , and to suspect that underlying our reason there is , as a rule , some emotional drive which determines the trend of our logic . As I look back over the double shift in my religious views , I am led to believe that the average man or woman , even though he be as staunch and genuine in his faith as the Pope himself , is likely to remain unconscious of the forces that control his reasoning processes . In this he is like the little metal ball at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensitive to the working of the governing mechanism within the clock . Hoping to throw some light upon the secret coils and springs of the mind which determine the swing ' of human convictions , I shall relate those events of my life which marked my progress along the road to Rome ? and back again . As I reflect upon it , it seems to me now that both in becoming a Roman Catholic and later in ceasing to be one I was not at all the conscious director ofmy destiny that I imagined myself to be at the time . I was the little ball at the end of a pendulum , and forces which I did not understand swung me first to one religious extreme and then to its opposite . I My parents were New Englanders , whose standards were fixed by a strict Puritanism . Dancing and other forms of amusement in which my friends found harmless pleasure were forbidden me , and my girlhood was monotonous . In compensation I threw myself into my school work with great ardor and fed upon the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was not prosperous , and there seemed little chance of realizing my ambition unless I earned my way . With this in view I took a short business course after graduation from high school , and secured a position as stenographer in a small city not far from my home . I changed offices several times , little by little increasing my salary and putting aside part of it toward a college education . Life , however , continued drab . Finally I went to work in the office of a promising young business man , highly respected in the city , who happened to be a Roman Catholic . Within a short time after this I noticed that life had taken on color . My new employer , Patrick O'Neill , appeared to me to be perfection in human form . It surprised me , provincial that I was , to 407 discover that a Catholic could be as upright in his business dealings as I soon recognized my employer to be , and at the same time so human ? always ready with an encouraging joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a Catholic , and had given no thought to the teachings of the Roman Church , but I had formed certain opinions just the same ? highly unfavorable opinions , based upon such hearsay as I had picked up among my family and friends . Now for the first time I began to question my attitude . The religion of Patrick O'Neill could not deserve the abuse I had heard heaped upon it . I had not been in the office very long before I learned that Mr. O'Neill was engaged to be married to a girl with whom I sometimes saw him outside of business hours . The information did not affect me except as an interesting item of news . I went on working and saving my money . The months grew into a year , and I realized , without probing the cause of it , that I was more contented with my lot than I had ever been before . My days were full ; only the Sundays , spent alone in the city , reminded me how dreary my life had been . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go away . I made the excuse that I would rather stay and keep up my work , but Mr. O'Neill insisted that I needed a rest . That vacation period seemed an age . With nothing else to occupy my thoughts , I was forced to face the fact that I was in love . The realization filled me with acute distress , and I debated with myself whether it would not be best for me not to go back to the office . That was the only place , however , where I had ever been happy , and in the end I decided to return , resolving at the same time that I would manage somehow to overcome my feelings . The first day back at the office I remained after the closing hour to attend to some important work that my substitute had been unable to handle in my absence . Mr. O'Neill stayed to check it over with me , but an unexpected turn of events drove all thought of business from our heads . Mr. O'Neill suddenly told me that he had realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to marry me instead of Marie , the girl to whom he was engaged . This engagement worried him a great deal , he said . When he was too young to know what he was about , he had been led into it , largely through pressure from his family . Because he had never been really sure that he loved Marie , he had postponed marriage for years ; then , since he had allowed matters to run on so long , he had felt that it would not be just to her to break the engagement . Now he could n't help himself , he said . Being certain at last that he wanted to marry someone else , he could hardly make Marie an ideal husband . He 'd have to pluck up courage , tell her the situation frankly ; when he was free , we 'd make our plans for the future . Foolishly , but humanly , we did not wait until he had come to an understanding with Marie , but started immediately to talk about the happiness that lay before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . This , he said , would fit in well with his own ambitions . Although he was thirty years old ? ten years my senior ? he had never lost his desire to study for the bar . Heavy financial responsibilities had kept him from doing it when he was younger , but now his dependent mother was dead and the two sisters whom he had supported were well married . He had enough money saved to put me through college and himself through law school . Thus was opened out before me a vision of all that I had asked // of life ? marriage to the man I loved , and a college education . In the weeks that followed I learned what it means to walk on air . ' But , light-hearted as I was , I could not rid myself of the haunting fear that something might go wrong with our plans . I could see that Patrick was worried . Several times he admitted that he had not yet summoned courage to tell Marie , but that he would have to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of which we both had catalogues well thumbed ) was drawing near . Besides , he felt that he had done very wrong in speaking to me before he had settled matters with her ; it was n't fair to either of us . Now that he had gone so far in reaching an understanding with me , it seemed harder than ever to ask her for his release . At length his business affairs were wound up and things were turned over to his successor . Patrick suggested that I go home and rest until he could complete the final arrangements for our marriage ? in case he gained Marie 's consent . We jested and laughed about the proviso , but , after I left , it kept running through my mind like an ominous refrain and I could not shake it off . Then one day , soon after I had returned home , Patrick arrived suddenly . With great difficulty and many expressions of self-reproach he told me what I had already guessed only too well . But even as he explained all that had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed religion only once , when he had asked me whether I should be willing to receive instructions from a priest and be married in his Church , and I had agreed and promised that our children should be reared as Catholics . He never thought , I am sure , of asking me to become a Catholic , and such a possibility had never entered my mind . I knew hardly a detail of Catholic practice . From Patrick 's story , related haltingly under the stress of his emotion , I gathered that he had gone to his confessor and told him of his understanding with me , although he was still engaged to Marie . When he had stated his intention of going to her immediately and asking for a release , the priest had said No : an engagement was morally binding ; Patrick must keep his word . I could not understand it at all as he told it to me , but now I realize that my being a Protestant probably had something to do with the priest 's decision , for Marie was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church toward ' mixed marriages ' is explained by the Catholic Encyclopedia ( Vol . IX , pp. 698-699 ) in these words : ' The very intimacy of the union necessarily established between those joined in wedlock requires a concordance above all in their religious sentiments . Holding this doctrine , it was but natural and logical for the Church to do all in her power to hinder her children from contracting marriage with those outside her pale , who did not recognize the sacramental character of the union on which they were entering . . For the issuing of a dispensation for a mixed marriage , the Church requires three conditions : that the Catholic party be allowed free exercise of religion , that all the offspring are to be brought up Catholics , and that the Catholic party promise to do all that is possible to convert the non-Catholic . It is not to be supposed , however , that even when these precautions have been taken , this is all that suffices for the issuance of a dispensation . In an instruction to the Bishops of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propaganda declared that the above conditions are exacted by the natural and divine law to remove the intrinsic dangers in mixed marriages , but that in addition there must be some grave necessity , which can not otherwise be avoided , for allowing the faithful to expose themselves to the grave dangers inherent in these unions , even when the prescribed conditions have been fulfilled . The bishops are therefore to warn Catholics against such marriages and not to grant dispensations for them except for weighty reasons and not at the mere will of the petitioner . ' On February 5 , 1932 , the Congregation of the Holy Office in Vatican City issued a decree ordering that even stricter guarantees concerning the Catholic education of children must henceforth be given before dispensations may be granted for ' mixed marriages . ' ? Aurnon Repentant for having led me to build upon mistaken hopes , Patrick suggested with a real delicacy of feeling that he would make whatever amends he could by paying my college bills ; nobody need know it . As for himself , he would marry Marie without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of propriety fixed in childhood , I tearfully refused his kindness and we parted , he assuring me that he would see to it that I had a good position when I wanted one . Not long afterward word came to me of an excellent opening in the city , and , anxious to forget my troubles , I took the next train to work . Once back in town I learned that Patrick had carried out his resolution and had already left for the University with his bride . II Through Patrick 's recommendation of me to several of his friends I secured all the extra work I could do , in an effort to keep so busy that I should not have time to brood over what had happened . One night I remained at the office , without dinner , until half-past seven . Feeling faint , I became fearful that if I waited longer I should be unable to reach my room . As I was walking slowly home , my ear was caught by strains of mournful music which sounded just the way I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a convent , all dark except for a few windows on the ground floor , which gave forth a soft light through stained glass . Suddenly the thought burst upon me that this was Catholic music ; Patrick must have heard its like a thousand times . Scarcely knowing what I did , I stepped to the entrance , opened the door , and made my way into the chapel . At the farther end of the room I beheld a central altar ablaze with many candles . At the foot of the altar knelt a priest , resplendent in white and gold , his face upturned as if he were drawn toward the radiance . Behind him was massed a group of black-robed figures . They , too , looked up as they sang , their eyes held by the same effulgence . I dropped upon a kneeling bench near the door . A sense of security and peace stole over me , and I felt united in spirit with those sombrely clad Sisters as they repeated the melancholy cadences of their song . Why , I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why had I never sought to know more about this religion that had given Patrick almost superhuman power to follow the path of duty as he saw it ? Why did that radiance at the altar make all the sorrows of life seem trifling and insignificant ? After prayers the nuns filed slowly out . Several noticed me and smiled a welcome . Their faces shone with goodness and happiness . Could it be that their troubles had all been poured forth into that sad melody and miraculously wafted away ? One Sister paused to speak to me . Eagerly I asked her for information about the Catholic Church . She wondered why I was so anxious . I just wanted to know , ' I replied ; it was the only true answer I could give . She put some books into my hands , ? an armful of them , ? and as I walked hurriedly up the street toward my boarding house I was no longer weary . I was impatient to read deep in those volumes , buoyed up by the hope of finding there the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night I read , enthralled . Were these really the teachings of the Church which I had so often heard maligned ? Even when I went to bed I could not sleep for joy at having found the way of contentment . I realized that I did not yet comprehend the secret , but that with earnest study I should understand . After this my life was lived for those hours I could spend with the nuns . Under their guidance , and later under the direction of Father Griffin , the kindly pastor of a city parish , I devoted all my free time for months to reading books on Catholic doctrine . At last I was conditionally baptized and taken into the Church . During these months of confidence with the nuns and with Father Griffin I had never spoken of my experience with Patrick . I saw no reason to . In that chapter of my life there had been not the smallest sin to confess , and it never so much as occurred to me that there could be any connection between this shattered romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not forgotten my bitter disappointment , but the keen edge of it was dulled and I was content . Indeed , if I had supposed that my conversion was in any way the result of my frustrated marriage , I should have thanked God for the whole painful episode ; I should have felt that this was the drastic means He had used to make me realize my need and lead me into the fold . III Father Griffin needed a stenographer and I went to work in the rectory office . There , in addition to my regular duties , I did all sorts of stenographic and accounting tasks for the Sisters without a thought of compensation ; it was a pleasure to be able to do something for them . As a consequence of this intimate , daily association I began after a while to entertain a serious idea of becoming a nun myself . No one urged me to take this step . On the contrary , everyone in whom I confided cautioned me to wait : God would direct me in deciding whether I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance , the Sisters prayed for me , and Father Griffin remembered this intention ' each morning at Mass . During these weeks of special prayer I thought continuously upon the subject of my vocation . ' I could see only one impediment to happiness if I entered the convent ? that I should never be a mother . I loved children and felt that life would be incomplete and unsatisfying if I should never have any of my own . In the end I disclosed my feeling to Father Griffin . This , he believed , was an answer to our prayers . My part in God 's scheme was to be a good Catholic mother . Emotionally unsettled as I was , I received this pronouncement with some glimmerings of common sense . How was I to become a good Catholic mother if I did not know a single man who wanted to marry me ? Since I had been working in the rectory office the only Catholic laymen I had met were those who had called to pay pew rent , arrange for Masses , or attend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they thought about me at all , had doubtless noticed my devotion and set me down as one who was destined for the convent . Of social life among the Catholics of the city I knew nothing . Father Griffin was quick to comprehend my predicament , but he was ready with comforting faith . A sincere Catholic always has a way out of difficulties . He can always pray ? even for the granting of desires which , to a Puritan , would seem immodest , almost scandalous . God would help me find the right mate . ( I thought then , and I think now , that Catholics are more sensible than Protestants in their realistic attitude toward such matters . ) We decided , then , Father Griffin and I , to start a novena to the Blessed Virgin that I might be directed to a good Catholic husband , if this were God 's will . I took a few nuns , including the Mother Superior , into my confidence . She decreed a novena of the entire Sisterhood for this very special intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dental work done , and the Sisters recommended a Dr. Leo Murphy . They did not know whether he was a Catholic or not , though his parents were ; he never came to Mass , and it was suspected that he had fallen away . ' At any rate , he was a kind young man . He gave his professional services to the Sisters without charge , and they , in gratitude , were praying hard for him . I went to Dr. Murphy and found him a large , genial Irishman bubbling over with good nature and good talk . He kept up a running fire of amusing chatter while he worked , which so diverted my thoughts that the hours I spent in the chair seemed very pleasant interludes . One day , when I had expressed my admiration for the Sisters , he burst out : ' Good gracious , girl , it 's an outrage for you to live cooped up with nuns and priests ! You need life and fun . Next week there 's to be a dance , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to some real people . ' My heart thumped . I had always wanted to dance , but I did n't know how . ' That ' s all right , ' he laughed . ' I guess you 're not too old to learn . I 'll teach you myself . ' So it was arranged that we should meet several evenings at the home of a friend of his , where he would give me the necessary lessons ; and before the day of the dance arrived he pronounced me ready to take my place on the floor . I took from my trunk a gown I had purchased to wear at college parties with Patrick O'Neill , and , forgetting all about the disappointment that had caused it to be packed away unused , I went to the dance with Dr. Murphy and had a glorious time . After this he escorted me frequently to dances , to the theatre , and to concerts . Meanwhile I continued my work at the rectory office and my intimacy with the Sisters , and went to Holy Communion every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should be ready for this religious rite at seven o'clock , and this always annoyed Dr. Murphy , provoking him to say unkind things ? not about me , for with me he was gentleness itself , but about the Roman organization . Little by little I learned that he felt he had great grievances against this Church in which he had been reared ? grievances which I shall not go into here , since they belong to another story . Suffice it to say that he was a declared agnostic . He was good to the Sisters , he said , because he believed in being good to everyone ; that was his only ' article of faith . ' If he was especially kind to them , it was because he was more sorry for them than for anybody else . They were victims of a misleading religious system . ' Such talk worried me greatly , but I could not argue with Leo ; he seemed to know my responses before I spoke . Meanwhile it appeared to me that in every other respect he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had any doubts upon this score , he finally put them to rest by asking me to become his wife . He had hesitated to ask me , he confessed , because he disliked the idea of being married by a priest . At first he did not think he could bring himself to make the promises which he knew would be demanded of him . Now he was ready to submit politely to some priest 's futile blessing , ' and would give his word that any children we might have should be given Catholic instruction as long as I wished it . With characteristic frankness he added that he // knew I would n't hold him to his promise very long . He was n't sure of many things , but he was sure of this : once I was happy in a home of my own , I should soon laugh at my obsession with religion . I was touched by Leo 's concessions , made against convictions which were very dear to him , and I knew he would keep his part of the bargain even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , I could give him no definite answer . How , I asked myself , would Father Griffin look upon this marriage ? When I consulted him about it I was prepared for his disapproval . I suggested that my marriage to Leo might be the means of bringing him back to the faith , since I was praying for him incessantly . But Father Griffin stood firm . ' No , child , you 'd lose your faith . The precious gift of faith must be guarded no matter whit sacrifice it may entail . And think of your children . In spite of Catholic instruction , they would probably become atheists . Do n't yield to this temptation , my child . ' Finally , after weeks of vacillation , I sent Leo away , but even then there were moments when I came near weakening and reversing my decision . Father Griffin understood the moral struggle I had gone through and sug , gested that I needed a change of environment . I 'd better go to college . He knew I had some money saved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to it that I had enough to finish my course . I did not like the idea of borrowing money , but Father Griffin 's suggestions were not to be lightly put aside . So , although it was then the middle of the school year , I set off for a college for women that was conducted by nuns . Here I stayed several years , and in the search for knowledge I managed for a time almost to forget the ache at my heart . After graduation I returned to my former city and secured a position tenehing in a high school . I was kept very busy , but the monotony and emptiness of my life made me feel again all the pain of my earlier disappointments . Several times Dr. Murphy telephoned and asked if he might see me . I was tempted to renew our friendship , but , knowing it to be both foolish and dangerous , I refused to let him call . I made frantic efforts to find something with which to occupy myself in my leisure hours . One Sunday it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention of the Holy Name Society the following week ; women of the parish were urged to help in serving dinner to the visiting members at the Knights of Columbus Hall . I gladly volunteered . After dinner on this occasion Father Griffin brought up and introduced to me a man from a neighboring city . From the first , the serious attentions which John Garrett offered me made it plain that he was looking for a wife , and I suspected that Father Griffin had told him my story . He asked if he might see me home and I consented , although it troubled my conscience to give even so slight an encouragement to a man to whom I was not particularly attracted , and who had made it only too evident that he was very much in earnest . He came to see me several times , and after a few visits made his proposal . I had every intention of refusing him , but before I could speak he urged me not to be hasty ? to think it over prayerfully. and give myself time to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem to Father Griffin . He spoke of Mr. Garrett in terms of highest praise : he was a good man , religious , kind , generous ; besides , he could offer me a fairly good living . All this I granted , but I did not love him . ' That does n't matter , ' my fatherly adviser assured me . ' Love will come in due time after you are married to such a man . You prayed once , very fervently , for a good Catholic husband . Now that your prayer has been answered , years after it was offered , will you not do your part in trying to make yourself love a man who is suitable in every respect ? God may not favor you again , my child , if you reject the one He has sent you . ' I protested to Father Griffin that I could not even think of marriage until I had paid back the debt I owed him . He waved this objection aside , saying that he would feel better repaid by seeing me do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere money . In the end he wore down my resistance , and thus it was that I became Mrs. John Garrett . VI John was thirty-two years old when we married . He had always conformed strictly to every moral injunction of his Church in the suppression of human desire . Before our wedding he had not even offered to kiss me . My life had been equally austere . Now , thrown suddenly into marriage , I suffered a great emotional shock . There was tragedy in the situation for both of us . Disturbing as this was , it was not my only worry . Soon I was preparing for a baby and was very ill . John was as considerate and kind as a husband could be , and I reproached myself for . my inability to repay him by a return of his affection . I determined to make up for it , as well as I could , in other directions . It began to look , however , as if I should never again be well enough to do for him the many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another serious illness , and a second baby . One after another they came ? a steady procession of helpless infants to be tended , and parallel illnesses which unfitted me to perform my duties as a wife and mother . It seemed unfair to all of us , but I knew the strictness of Catholic teaching upon this point , and prayed for strength . When my health failed to improve , I went at last to my confessor and asked if there was n't some way by which I might avoid having children quite so rapidly . He replied that a Catholic may not interfere with the working of ' natural laws ' except by a complete suspension of conjugal relations . This sacrifice I could not demand of John , since I had already done him an injustice in marrying him . Children continued to come until I had eight in as many years . Bills piled up . Nothing multiplies as rapidly as bills when one is trying to support an ever-increasing family on a modest income . We had to mortgage our home and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always at our wits ' end to know how much of what bill to pay each month . While we were in the midst of this financial struggle our parish priest decided to build a new parochial school , and every family in the parish was taxed for the project according to its resources . There was hardly anyone in the community who could pay his share without sacrifice , and many families would be even more closely pinched than ours . In spite of this , I wanted to // go to the priest and ask him to excuse us , or at least to reduce our contribution , ' but John would not hear of it . With him , Church obligations take precedence over all others . So I conjured and scraped , cut down on milk and fruit for the children , stopped buying meat almost entirely , patched night after night on old clothes to make them hold together , and somehow paid our tax toward the school . ' By this time my reason had begun to show occasional signs of rebellion against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the judgments pronounced by the priests appeared to me to be debatable , to say the least , and I proceeded to debate them with myself . I felt keenly the injustice that resulted from the application of infallible ' dogmas to every problem that arose , regardless of the individual circumstances involved . Always , however , my indignation burned itself out in secret , and not even my husband suspected how perilously close I had come to an open rupture with the Church . I did not even realize it myself . I regarded myself as a good Catholic ? more critical than I had formerly been , to be sure , but still a good Catholic . VII When my eighth child was four months old , the doctor told me that I should have to undergo a serious operation if I wanted to live to rear my family . How we should be able to manage the expense I did not know , but John was determined that everything possible should be done for my safety . He secured a loan through a second mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our physician , who was a Protestant , had made it clear that I could never have another child after my operation , but since this extreme measure had to be taken to save my life I had no notion that it would be wrong . The day before the operation John asked the priest of the parish in which the hospital was situated to call that afternoon and hear my confession . When he arrived at my bedside , I had only the u-sual peccadillos to confess . The priest listened to my recital , and when it was finished inquired about the nature of the operation I was contemplating . I explained frankly . Then he asked my age . I told him . He looked very grave . ' You are still of child-bearing age , ' he said . ' Are you aware of the fact that after this operation you could have no more children ? ' I replied that I was . And do you know that such an operation is forbidden by Catholic teaching , and that to submit to one is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I answered faintly . Well , ' he said , with evident kindliness , it is too bad you did n't know before you went to all the trouble of coming here , because now you wo n't be able to carry out your plans . ' At first I hardly realized what he meant . When I did , I tried to explain that I had to live to care for my eight children and ? this actually popped into my head as a dominant consideration ? to help pay the bills . My husband could never make ends meet if he had to depend on a housekeeper ; she would not even try to watch her pennies as I did . And my children would run wild like little ragamuffins . I 'd have to have the operation ? there was no other way out for us . ' I know , ' the priest said gently ; you 're nervous and upset . Just now you ca n't trust God to care for your children and help your husband out of his difficulties if you should die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they could , with God 's help . Anyway , you wo n't act contrary to Catholic teaching . If you should persist , I could not grant you absolution . " For a while , overwhelmed by a sense of the momentous choice I had to make , ? and make immediately , ? I was unable to think . When at last my reasoning processes began to function again , it came to me in a flash that Dr. Murphy had once prophesied that my religious views would probably undergo a change when I knew more of life . I had to admit , now , that he was right , and in the firmest tones I could command I announced to the priest that I would not alter my plans . Next morning I came out of the ether glad that the ordeal was over , and The Catholic Encyclopedia states emphatically in many places that it is sinful to interfere in any way with the normal working of ' natural laws , ' but a careful search through the volumes , under all the headings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of a principle which might be held applicable to such a case as mine . The " closest approximation to it occurs in a broad discussion of eugenics ( Vol . XVI , p. 89 ) , which contains this sentence : ' The operation to produce sterilization of the unfit is not permissible , except as a necessary means to bodily health , and consequently except for this necessity may not be performed even with the patient 's consent . ' By a broad interpretation this ruling , laid down for the specific problem of dealing with defectives , might conceivably have been thought to apply also to my predicament . If so , it would appear that my hospital confessor either questioned the Protestant physician 's opinion that the operation was necessary to save my life , or , as I think more probable , pushed the ordinary objections of the Church against such operations further than they were meant to go . ? Aunroa since then I have never regretted my decision . I did the only sensible thing I could do under the circumstances , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before taking leave of the Church in which I was for so long a devout communicant , I should like to set down here , in a spirit of fairness and justice , a few observations which have been strikingly brought home to me by my own experiences . Most of the charges that are leveled against the Roman Catholic Church by ignorant , unthinking people ? particularly during a political campaign when a Catholic is running for office ? are scandalously false . At one time this fact impressed me as a strong argument for the Church , and perhaps it is . At least no one can blame Catholics for replying that , if their enemies have to conjure up malicious falsehoods , their faith must be impregnable to attack by honest methods . And indeed the list of virtues rightly attributable to the Roman Church is a long one ? too long for me to itemize here . Suffice it to say that many of its staunch adherents are the salt of the earth . Any religion which can produce this result in human lives can claim a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest asset of the Catholic Church is the method it employs to triumph over all the ills that flesh is heir to . At the very moment when a kindly pastor is most acutely sensitive to suffering among his people , he advises them to court hardship . The stony path is the way of salvation . Sorrow is accepted by devout Catholics as the absolutely essential means of gaining happiness . The more intense the pain , the greater the reward . They see in the divine plan a reason ' for suffering ; so they welcome it while worldlings fight against it , try to escape it , and plunge into a mad scramble after diverting pleasures . It does seem superhuman ? this conception of pressing an agony to one 's breast and converting it , as if by miracle , into a token of divine favor . And perhaps , after all , it is better to be buoyed up by such a faith , even though it be only an illusion . As for myself , I would give a great deal if I could return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first burst upon me , lay my troubles upon that radiant altar , and , even though I could not forget them as I did in those early days , at least accept them as blessings in disguise . Freud tells us that continuous repression , without satisfying compensations , may make people ill , causing them to lose control of their nerves , and , in extreme esses , their minds . I have no doubt that the harsh repressions of my youth had something to do with my conversion to Catholicism . To the masses of mankind , for whom manifold thwartings of ambitions and wishes are inevitable , the Catholic religion ministers powerfully as a soporific , just as it ministered to me upon my first contact with it . Its beautiful ritual , its hierarchy of ever-helpful Saints , its soothing emphasis upon heavenly rewards , provide effective outlets for all the emotions born of defeat and disappointment . It is no wonder , then , that millions cling to this Church as they cling to nothing else in life . In spite of the seemingly unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of him with sincere affection . It was his interest in my welfare that made him appear dictatorial . He once intimated to me that he had himself made supreme sacrifices in becoming a priest , but that he felt fully repaid , knowing that he was doing that for which he would earn an eternal reward . He could therefore , in all honesty , urge others to go and do likewise . He only preached what he practised . I also realize that mistakes made by individuals within any organization should not be held against the group they represent . Father Griffin , in advising me as he did , was perhaps not typical of the Catholic clergy . His insistence upon my marriage to John Garrett and the insistence of Patrick O'Neill 's confessor upon his marriage to Marie were based , at least in part , upon purely personal opinions , and should not be construed as involving doctrine that is hard and fast in its application . The Roman Church does discourage ' mixed marriages , ' ? rightly , I believe , ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be that my hospital confessor applied the teachings of the Church more strictly than is customary in such cases . However this may be , I have merely stated truthfully the facts as they affected my own life , and have tried to show why it was hard , and in the end impossible , for me to follow the instructions of my spiritual advisers , and how , in my resistance , I found that I had ceased to be a Catholic . Perhaps I was unreasonable in letting my faith be touched by such personal considerations , but ? reasonable or unreasonable ? that , too , is a fact , and I have set it down along with the rest . IX Sometimes as I review the series of extraordinary situations through which I have passed , it almost seems as if some god the Spirit of Irony , no doubt had chosen me for his most bizarre experiments . As I reflect upon it , it is clear that much of my unhappiness would have been avoided if the sequence of main events had been altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick O'Neill , the priest might have come to a different conclusion about Patrick 's engagement and I should have married him . Or , again , if I had ceased to be a Catholic before I married John , I should probably have become the wife of Dr. Murphy . It is all very puzzling . Why could not at least one of the changes in my religious beliefs have occurred soon enough to permit me to marry a man I loved ? Some people may believe that such shifts in one 's fundamental ideas depend wholly upon the accidental interplay of circumstance and environment ; if this is so , I can only conclude that chance worked against me , and it is just too bad . It maybe , though , that these changes in attitude are not the result of mere chance . They may be brought about through the operation of definite but elusive laws . Perhaps I became a Roman Catholic primarily because I loved a Roman Catholic and was unconsciously moved to imitate him . Then , reversing the process , perhaps I slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout than myself and a man toward whom I have never been able to feel the sympathies of a wife , I was unconsciously driven to the opposite pole of thought from him. , Whatever may be the mysterious truth , ? and I know very little about theories of human behavior , it seems to me that if my experiences reveal any ; thing about the matter they show that emotion plays the dominant role in ' conditioning ' and determining our convictions . If this is so , it follows that our boasted reason is by no means the reliable arbiter of our destiny that we like to think it is . Once our emotions have driven us , willy-nilly , to take up this position or that , reason comes along like a dutiful handmaiden and spins out a beautiful rationalization to justify us in what we have done . May it not be that this is the stuff of which even the most shining faith is made ? Indeed , it seems to me that cherished opinions in politics , theories of social and economic justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun out thus to uphold us in what we have already deeply felt . Because such cases as mine are comparatively rare , most people go on living within the little closed circle wherein they were born , believing more or less fervently just as their fathers did before them . The great majority of human beings are able to follow the even tenor of their lives from the cradle to the grave without once being forced , as I was in the crisis at the hospital , to take a seemingly impossible step which runs counter to all their settled convictions . The moment such an action is decided upon , it cuts through the shoddy of too easily assumed beliefs , and one 's sincerest emotions surge to the surface to crystallize as a new orientation of faith . Perhaps , then , my little history may serve to throw a ray of light upon those darkest recesses of the mind where faith is enshrined , and from whence fanaticism often lifts its ugly head simply because the believer never really understands why he believes as he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind has been thoroughly explored and charted , human beings may be brought to understand that the same emotional forces which make religious zealots of some of us are also at work making doubters of others . Then at last will come the dawn of an era of broader sympathies and more genuine tolerance .
