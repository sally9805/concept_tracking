The pleasant London of the right , tight little British ruling class is such a small place that what goes on quickly reaches the ears of everyone who matters without benefit of newspapers . There was no need last week to advertise that No. 18 Cadogan Gardens is for sale . Still less need to explain this little fact 's large significance . It meant that esteemed Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , who in his lovable way makes from time to time such disastrous bumbles , had decided to call back into the cabinet " The Man Who Was Right . " <P> In upperclass London this tag now designates Lieut . Colonel the Right Honorable Sir Samuel John Gurney Hoare , Bart. , of No. 18 Cadogan Gardens ; and a very short search at the Foreign Office would discover " The Man Who Was Wrong " in upperclass eyes , Captain the Right Honorable Robert Anthony Eden , today His Majesty 's Principal Secretary of <P> State for Foreign Affairs . Last week , however , Mr. Baldwin did not go so far as to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretaryship . That would have been crass . <P> Seven months ago , when the Prime Minister needed to win Britain 's last General Election , he turned the trick by having Anthony Eden appear dazzlingly in Britain 's public eye as the Siegfried of Diplomacy , the handsome young man who was going to save Ethiopia from Italy with that flaming sword , the League of Nations . Having won the election Mr. Baldwin , who had created for " Tony " Eden the hitherto unheard of office of " Minister for League of Nations Affairs , " sat back contentedly to let Ethiopia and Italy be dealt with in practical fashion by Sir Samuel Hoare , then Foreign Secretary , and by the bril liant professionals of the Foreign Office whose permanent head is Sir Robert Gilbert Vansittart . In a few short weeks , by cooperating closely with the then French Premier , thick-lipped and unprepossessing Pierre Laval , they had produced " The Deal " ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) ready for signing in Paris . <P> As signed by Sir Samuel Hoare and M. Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Benito Mussolini and adorned with the signature of Haile Selassie after a little suasion , " The Deal " provided in essence that II Duce should content himself with roughly half of Ethiopia and agree to the continued rule of its Emperor over the rest . Had " The Deal " gone through , Ethiopians would have been spared the horrors of wide spread poison gas warfare ; Haile Selassie would have been reigning in Addis Ababa last week instead of being snubbed in London ( see p. 20 ) ; and Britain , France and Italy might have resumed their " Stresa Front " against the ambitions of Adolf Hitler . Advantages of " The Deal " were so obvious , and it had been so entirely conceived by the best professional brains of Whitehall , that astonishment was the mood of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin when he discovered that British public opinion considered this a " Dirty Deal , " betraying not only Ethiopia but also the British voter who had balloted for honest Stanley Baldwin in the belief that his Siegfried Eden , plus the League of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benito Mussolini clean out of Ethiopia .
