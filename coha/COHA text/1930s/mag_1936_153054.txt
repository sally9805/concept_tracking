Few weeks ago the lawyers for Manhattan 's banking house of Lehman Brothers wrote a long letter to John J. Burns , general counsel to the Securities &; Exchange Commission . They wanted to know , in effect , whether it would be legal for Lehman clients and certain associated bankers to stabilize the market for stock in Flint-kote Co. , control of which Lehman bought from Sir Henri Deterding 's Royal Dutch-Shell ( TIME , March 30 ) . Lehman was distributing stock in this old U. S. roofing and asphalt concern to the public , and the open market price of the stock had dropped $3 per share below the figure Lehman was asking on its offering ( $47.25 ) . <P> Manipulation of a security is forbidden by law , though just what constitutes manipulation has not yet been defined . Pegging operations ( " stabilization " ' ) are subject to SEC rules &; regulations , which have not yet been issued . In this legal swamp Lehman wanted to be on ground as solid as possible . <P> Having mulled over the Lehman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pegging was permissible ; 2 ) pegging need not necessarily imply a fixed price , though " activities designed substantially to raise or lower stock exchange prices are clearly manipulative , " hence illegal ; 3 ) the prospectus should disclose the fact that the underwriters were engaged in pegging the price of the stock ; 4 ) " this represents my opinion and is not to be taken as an expression of the views of the Commission . " <P> Last week this letter was made public day after Lehman hastily dispatched new prospectuses to its dealers , announcing in a rider that the underwriters were trading in Flintkote and would continue " to make such purchases and to execute such orders in such amounts and at such times for such period or periods as they shall deem advisable . " For all bankers and dealers this exchange of lawyers ' letters was significant because most of them have been pegging new issues to some extent without admitting it in their prospectuses .                  @ @ @
