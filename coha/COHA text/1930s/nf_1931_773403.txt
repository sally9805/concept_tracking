txt too Consciousness and Its Purpose time , and greater momentum is thus acquired . Adolescence provides a pliability , an elasticity of thought which is detrimental unless it be stabilized by reason . Thought functions within the channel desire provides . And ever alert is the soul for fresh experience . During this period many a soul tastes the dregs of disillusionment again and again before cognizance is taken of the import of thought . Turning now to the maturity which denotes intellectual capacity , what do we find ? We find mind a concrete and dependable organ . Vacillation is no longer possible , for Reason guides the thought-stream within the channel of conservatism . Thought functions with a surprising clearness and brilliancy . It has the power of dissection , of concentration , of analysis . And it builds that which it creates with the skill of an adept , embellishing it with jewels of rare beauty . We may well term this process the building of the Temple of Thought ; and it is intellect which is the basic , fundamental principle manifested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire . And I reply : at this stage of progress a grievous condition at times is apparent . Thought which flows through the deep channel of wisdom gathers its substance from that which experience provides , reinforcing it with a rare spiritual understanding . This is a sane and normal growth . But when science imposes upon the soul the urge for knowledge , to the exclusion of the spiritual understanding , the intellect assumes a brilliancy which is metallic in its keynote ; the tone lacks the fullness , the richness , which the spiritual note induces . Many a great scientist has learned to his discomfiture that fame and adulation are as the echo of fulHypothesis of The Universal Mind iot filment and only after transition takes place is he cognizant of the reason therefor . To differentiate between knowledge and wisdom is to sound the keynote of universal thought . For , whereas wisdom is the pure stream which flows from the immortal concept of thought , knowledge is based upon that which science deduces with the microscope of self-illuminative thought . TRUTH To differentiate between that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult process . But within reason lies the power of discrimination . Truth is ever veiled and there is a reason therefor . It is that man may use the power of thought , that through intensive concentration he separate the grain from the chaff . And why is this necessary ? ? you inquire . To concentrate is to focus thought upon an objective point . The mind of necessity participates in this process , for it is so soul functions ; and its mettle is thus tested . ' With all the strength it possesses mind co-operates , imposing upon brain the burden of expression . By its strength is determined the depth of concentration possible . If its elasticity is insufficient thought will rebound , without having penetrated the substance upon which it is directed . But if the mind , through concentrative training , has acquired the necessary strength it will bore within the substance , penetrating its depth and bringing to the surface the inmost and integral part of its being . It is thus we differentiate between concentration and meditation . To meditate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspirational flow // to enter therein . This is contrary to the orthodox interpretation of meditation . But it is the spiritual analysis through which the inspirational flow is regulated . To enter the silence with a true humility of spirit is to attune the soul to the source of supply . Often the statement is made that there is truth in all things . But how can this be so ? If truth is the antithesis of error , how then could error exist if it were truth ? Reason defines truth as that which is eternal ; it has no beginning and therefore no end . But error is founded on that which is the opposite of truth . It has a beginning and therefore it must of necessity have an end . Many intellectuals use this statement to illustrate the theory of universality of matter . But matter is composed of many ingredients : mineral , vegetable and animal . And Reason demands an accounting , an allotment of each to its proper sphere of usefulness , delineating the substance thereof . In gold there is alloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chemical process is extracted from the pure . In copper is found the alloy of lead , which must of necessity be extracted . You may inquire : what is alloy ? And I reply : alloy is that which disintegrates , that whose permanency is not established . Error is the alloy of the soul which Infinite Mind extracts with the tincture of pain . The Master Chemist demands the pure gold when the ultimate chemical analysis is complete . Just so does the physical body disintegrate . Consider the individual in the prime of vigor , before senility has extracted the essence of vitality . The bloodstream is more enriched , the muscular reaction far greater , the elasticity of thought more pronounced . Even the flesh has a different texture . But Time is the inflexible task-master who thrusts the decomposition Hypothesis of The Universal Mind to3 process upon the physical vehicle , extracting little by little the wine of life which flows through the veins , diluting it with that which tempers progress . It is thus momentum is slowed , that soul may approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who understands not the intricate mechanism of the mind the suggestion of the segregation of ideas doubtless seems a feat difficult of accomplishment . But this is easily accomplished by the master of thought-control . Let us compare consciousness to a vast area wherein are numberless receptacles in which to store surplus thought . Experience provides that which enlarges our store and we , of our own initiative , determine the quality thereof . Thought may flow through a channel of purity whose depths reveal a clarity of surprising beauty . Or it may follow the retrogressive trend , with murky shadows outlining its course . But of whatever nature thought is , it reveals but the real and inner Self . To one whose soul status has ( through a succession of existences ) attained an innate purity is the inspirational flow an active part . And that which is stored within the depths of the consciousness enriches the soul beyond measure . It is as a rare collection of jewels with which he embellishes his Temple of Thought . And they are imperishable . To return to the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul finds expression , and as each idea forms within the thought-stream mind seizes upon it for its mental digestion , assimilating its substance and storing it away for future use . What then a happens when at a later period mind desires to once // again meditate upon this selfsame material ? By the process of concentration it delves within the subconscious and brings to light the material it desires . Here the lay-mind intervenes : please explain this process . By the process of concentration does mind impose the dictum of restraint on desire , lulling to acquiescence all but the thought in question . This accomplished , the intellect responds to the urge of the soul and calls to the brain for co-operation . To sift the accumulated dregs of experience is but the work of a moment . Thus inspired , Reason lends a helping hand and proceeds to illumine mind , with the result that the idea is once again firmly implanted therein , and is carved by the process of thought into its ultimate form . Somewhat obtuse ? objects the lay-mind . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within his store-house the knowledge concerning mind and soul , their conception and relation to thought , and the various planes they must of necessity traverse to reach the adolescent or mature state of being . To segregate ideas it is necessary to tabulate them thus : constructive and destructive , uplifting and perverse , spiritual and material . This is not an easy process . Habit is a factor therein . And will-power too plays an active part . To construct is to build that whose foundation is firmly entrenched within the intellect , that which adorns , which has no disfiguring angles , but whose contour suggests grace and repose . It is thus the artist builds his theme , with spirituality the underlying tone . The musician too embellishes his theme with the concrete accoutrements . The poet builds around his theme that which immortal is , the lullaby Hypothesis of The Universal Mind ios of the ages which lives forever in the heart , thrilling with its rich cadence , its rhythm , its harmony . Is not all that which has a spiritual undertone of immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realm of Immortality it is that which is divine in its concept . The ear which is attuned to harmony has found the keynote of love , for all Nature is the expression of the great harmonic chord struck by the Master Musician upon the soul of the human , which responds in a greater or minor degree according to his development and its equivalent understanding . To enrich the thought-stream let a systematic control of thought take place . Eliminate from the mind that which suggests perversion or which has not the full tone of harmony within its depth . Then , as the habit is established , does the mind of its own volition segregate the pure from the impure , the constructive from the destructive , the inspiring from the retrogressive . All is retained which promotes growth and that which deters is discarded as waste . It is thus the soul demands an accounting of that which the consciousness has stored within its depths . Segregation means what ? The classifying of a thought or idea according to its true worth or value , retaining like matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste material reaches a state of excess ? A combustion must of necessity take place , a readjustment which entails a hardship , with ensuing pain and disillusionment . It is thus the Master Physician works , to cauterize the consciousness and to give a new standard for thought . ) 6 Consciousness and Its Purpose HYPOTHESIS OF MATTER Within matter is the hypothesis of being . For , upon the physical plane where man dwells matter is the source of life . It provides the activity through which the physical organism functions . And just what is mat-r ? Webster defines matter as that which occupies space ad is perceptible to the senses . Very illuminating ? at where does matter derive its substance ? Here material mind is nonplussed . Matter derives its being from the formation of gaseous vapors thrown off by lanetary orbs , which function through the ether . Vithin the law of physics is to be found the axioms relative to gas and vapor . Combined , what do they form ? ubstance , which passes through the various forms f disintegration and combustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregates with increasing substantiality as Time binds together that which forms eventually a planet of lesser size . lathering momentum , this accumulative mass enlarges its proportion and , as its breadth increases , inentations are formed by the cosmic force which concentrates for a brief period upon a certain point , with the resultant void which man eventually designates as sea or lake of vast magnitude . Through eons does this formative process continue and from time to time , as the highly etherized air becomes charged with the necessary attributes which susLin life , namely oxygen and nitrogen , new-born souls take up their first existence in a physical body thereon . If brief duration is this incipient life . And the ininctive preservation of the same is the predomiating characteristic of this stage of development . To follow the course of the individual soul as it miHypothesis of The Universal Mind I07 grates on in its evolutionary cycle , with each intervening span spent upon a somnolescent plane of thought , slowly and laboriously acquiring greater momentum and strength for a fresh experimental existence , is a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul traverses the orbit of its Karmic Path to attainment of the intellectual status , which eventually frees and purifies the soul of all which is not pure desire . Many an individual regards this process with horror and asserts the belief that his could never have been such an experience . But it is thus Infinite Mind propels the embryo soul on to it mature growth and none can differentiate the course from that which is provided . Wherein does the body attain its eventual growth ? ? is here interposed . That which man knows as the physical body is a vastly different organism from the one of his earliest existence . With thought functioning as a mass rather than as individual thought , the soul could build but a habitation of the crudest order . Infinite Mind permits not a complete revelation of these embryo periods until the soul growth sanctions an assimilation of the same without ensuing shock . But when soul has attained the ultimate freedom and its stability is assured the privilege is granted to follow throughout its course the Karmic thread of continuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus an infinitessimal part of the great Plan is revealed . For who can follow the magic of the incipient soul , with its faintly glowing spark of Infinite Mind , on through the evolutionary period , without a feeling of awe for the supreme art herein revealed ? Many metaphysicians have revealed that which purported to be the origin of the soul . But many false D8 Consciousness and Its Purpose inceptions exist . He who speaks these words does so rith the authority of a Master-intelligence , whose sanding is unimpeachable . And to delve within the substance heretofore given , digesting its content , is to cknowledge the same . Upon the plane of universal thought , where funcon those Master-minds who term themselves the Vhite Brotherhood , is no partisanship , no preference Dr creed or denomination . They are banded together i the spirit of universal love and work in unison with the precepts ever before them which were first given y the greatest Master-mind of the ages ? the Christ . and it is he whose active leadership ever inspires to reater effort the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a higher level and to ive to the thinking mass a new standard of ideal . To labor thus is to each day attain a greater likeness f him who embodies all ? tolerance , understanding , we . INTRINSIC VALUE What is valuation ? Within valuation is the true Torth of an article deduced , the integral substantiality f its value . It is thus Infinite Mind deduces from the um-total the worth of the individual soul . He scrutinzes with the eye of the Master Intelligence its weak nd salient points and that which of necessity must be liminated is labeled as waste material . Many a person of egotistical temperament demands roof of this statement . Wherein lies the reason for the reat number of crimes committed upon the physical lane , which man designates as the earth ? Is it not to hock the perpetrator into a realization of his predomnating weakness , through subsequent remorse and disHypothesis of The Universal Mind tog illusionment , accompanied by the corroding element of regret , intensified by anguish ? Comprehension dawns with all the glaring light of reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be lulled to acquiescent silence until soul realizes to the full the extent of its weakness . Thus works the Karmic Law , propelled by the great cosmic force which regulates its functioning power . To value an ideal is to place it within reach of fulfilment ; to hitch one 's wagon to the star is through concentrative effort to attempt to draw nearer to that which symbolizes the longing . It is thus soul impels effort , thrusting before the inner vision the desire for the attainment of the same . What then constitutes the intrinsic value which Infinite Mind demands in the final accounting ? It is that of which the basic fundamental is purity . Love must be the motivating impulse . This must of necessity be so , for within the great law of harmony it is the love-vibration which is its dominant power . And whence comes this force which dominates all life within the universe , that which propels the human on to the completement of his evolution , and that which animates the realm of immortality wherein function those whose freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being is the cosmic force generated by the Supreme Intelligence , within the domain of supreme dimension . And where is this ? ? you inquire . It is that superlative realm which lies beyond and above the celestial plane , so far beyond that the Immortal but dimly senses its exact location . But the force which emanates therefrom is that which thrills his soul with Consciousness and Its Purpose the joy of creative effort and supplies impetus for the same . Many there are who have declared the Great Intelligence is visioned by the Immortal Throng . But this is a fallacy . His great love and manifest concern for every soul are evidenced in numberless ways . But the spiritual vision has not the strength to withstand the magnitude of His being . I , who give these words , speak with the absolute finality of one who has been designated by the Great Intelligence , in co-operation with that band with which I serve , to release that through which will the world embarked on a retrogressive debauch take cognizance of His ultimatum . But though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance ) moves freely among us , I refer to the Christ , who is the one and only Elder Brother of this vast immortal group , yet we know not the Great Intelligence except as He whose love dominates all . Truth must find an echo within the mature soul and it is to this soul that this illuminative text is revealed , to him whose evolutionary period is drawing to a close and to whom the call has come to join in spirit that invisible throng whose deep concern is to lift humanity to a higher thought-level , to avert a calamity which must of necessity take place unless materialism ceases to dominate the mass-thought to the exclusion of all else . Within revelation lies the curative measure and through many a mind attuned to the realm of infinite thought will it at this time be forthcoming . The precepts which animate this group-force are those which are founded on but one great factor ? peace . Hypothesis of The Universal Mind III THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE Principle is the standard by which one gauges his desire . It corresponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vague and indeterminable quality which lures with its promise of fulfilment , a principle is a fundamental or basic part of that on which a business or line of thought is founded . It may be termed the idealistic background of thought , for the very name designates the character thereof . In the study of metaphysics or mental philosophy , as many prefer to designate this line of thought , the principle which is the underlying foundation is that of a universal love , a oneness of mind through which thought is united as a mass-form and when directed toward a purpose is a powerful force . At the present time the world is permeated by a general unrest , a disturbance which finds its origin in the wave of materialism which is sweeping throughout the mass , deterring progress and instilling the retrogressive urge , - which manifests itself in an ever-increasing longing for lawless diversion . Diversion is necessary to the welfare of the human as is the meditative hour . But it needs necessarily be of an uplifting nature , that which heals with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means of relaxation for tired nerves ? After a strenuous day , spent perhaps in the turmoil of the business world , a craving for even more excitement drives him forth to the cinema , where a picture of lurid delineation appeals to the sense-centers and stirs the already weary brain to renewed activity . Or , he goes forth to one of the numerous cafes where a wierd form of amusement is in order . He goes through a strange performance of mucular contortion which is // the modern interpretation of the dance . His flagging spirits respond to a greater physical activity by the imbibing of alcoholic beverages of a more or less poisonous nature . What is the reaction ? A sense of extreme fatigue , with the nerve-centers unduly excited ; a troubled sleep which has little effect toward imposing the required rest and relaxation . What then of the offspring of such parentage ? It stands to reason that the physical organism must be that which is of an inferior nature , for is it not a part of the parental root ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy which demands incessant relief , the seed bestowed must partake of this same weakness or lack of stamina . As has been before stated , the mental attributes of an offspring , or let us term it by its real title , the soul , brings into the new existence only that which it has built through a series of existences . And , if desired , it builds the outer form of its physical habitation ; but the inherent strength of tissue , red corpuscles and nerveforce is its rightful heritage from the parental root . Therefore the individual who , through excess , brings into the world that which is denied a strong physique has contracted a debt which must eventually be paid . Other forms of diversion there are which prove of immense benefit . Nature provides an endless variety of out-of-door amusements . She bequeaths with a lavish hand that which enriches thought . How many in this strenuous age pause for a brief moment to thrill to the beauty of the sunset ? How many listen to the tide as it ebbs and flows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , that which beats within the mighty heart of Nature and is the pulse of her being , that which the cosmic element provides that to man may // life be possible ? All life is motivated by this tremendous force which propels the planetary system onward in its orbitary way . And even as the mighty universe hinges on the cosmic power , so does the heart of man respond to the same force . Is not this worthy of serious consideration ? In time to come the mind of man must widen its perspective . To what does civilization tend ? To progress . And this progress embraces the spiritual and the mental unfoldment , as well as the material . To this end was the thought-form of the radio implanted within the mind of its creator through the channel of thought-transmission , as a further evidence of a Supreme Power . How many pause to meditate on its potential possibilities ? It is still in its infancy from a scientific standpoint . And if melody may be drawn in from the otherwise silent void of space who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually be crystallized into being and made receptive in audible form within the millennium ? From the era of our forefathers , who plowed the field with oxen , to the present age is a mighty step . But it is thus progress revolves upon the axis of Time , and the mind of man must keep pace therewith . PROOF OF CONTINUITY OF LIFE Within the present era great numbers seek in various ways to establish proof of the continuity of life . They long to know for a certainty that death is not oblivion , and its very uncertainty , which torments with the longing for alleviation , drives the individual on to excess of various forms in his endeavor to allay this unrest . Various creeds offer a temporary refuge . But too r 14 Consciousness and Its Purpose many limit the field of thought and the near horizon reveals but little which may be termed enlightenment . A mind which is of normal growth spreads its roots in all directions ; they penetrate the soil of all branches of science , seeking a universality of knowledge rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individual of broad vision converses with ease on a variety of topics : current events , political problems , spiritual truths ? all form the gist of his conversational output , with a lighter vein permeating the thought-stream at times to refresh the mind . In other words , the versatile mind is the aim of all true seekers of knowledge , a mind which is ever responsive to the need of the moment . Many statesmen have inscribed their names on the walls of the Hall of Fame through this very achievement . Who does not recall the delightful personality of Chauncey Depew , that grand old man of the senatorial field whose anecdotes charmed and refreshed many a social gathering in the political world ? A rare soul , this ; typifying the intellectual , spiritual and political ideal . Within the maelstrom of modern life thought functions with amazing rapidity . The mind grasps each new development the age produces and instantly accepts it as a matter of course . Perhaps adaptability would better express this state of being . But the thought-stream is of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how often does it delve within its depths to determine the cause of its birth ? For instance , take the compass . How many can give a plausible analysis of this exceedingly delicate and intricate instrument ? How many realize that the same magnetic force which permeates the ocean 's tide Hypothesis of The Universal Mind motivates this small mechanical device ? That it sways to a magnetic current is a foregone conclusion , but how many reflect on the source of the same power which provides impetus for action ? Gravitation is the process through which an object is drawn to the invisible magnet whose power is manifest . That which draws the soul of man onward to the completion of its destiny is the magnet of Love , which is in reality the Supreme Intelligence . And that same power supplies the cosmic force which is generated within the realm of supreme dimension and which permeates all space . Within the present age exists a soul to whom revelation has given the power to promote a scientific problem . I refer to Millikan , whose theory regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pros and cons galore . This master-mind must of necessity work in the scientific field , imparting the knowledge which is released through the channel of his mind to an incredulous world . To enter into this problem would be to intrude upon the field of scientific calculation which time alone will bring to a logical conclusion . Entering the physical organism through the region of the solar plexus , the cosmic force permeates the nerve-centers of man , providing that which quickens the heart beat , which stimulates the brain to action . When in time of stress apoplexy takes toll , what actually happens ? A conflict occurs between soul and Infinite Mind , with the resultant issue of a sharp reprimand . Paralysis occurs and the soul is withdrawn hours before death takes place . This perhaps is a drastic measure but the soul thus released knows naught of 1 16 Consciousness and Its Purpose physical pain . It experiences but a swift release . This phase of transition will be gone into at a later period . From time to time in various parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press gives a brief resume , perhaps with an undertone of scorn or disbelief permeating its context . This is invariably the reaction to a phenomenon which should be of vital interest to the world at large . It is true , charlatans are largely responsible for this attitude of the mass-mind toward revelation . But are there not charlatans in every branch of science ? Does not the political life of the nation fairly reek with charlatanism ? What of the medical profession ? Its old and sacred traditions record many a proof of a black sheep within the fold . To discriminate against that which is of vital import is a grievous error . For the press is a tremendous factor in the national life of the country and sways public sentiment to an alarming degree . To suppress the various yellow sheets which blazon the moral delinquencies of those who live within the limelight would be a real step in lifting thought to a higher level and through the process of starvation would the perverted appetite for salacious reading material die a natural death . There is continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And man but evolves on and on as the seasons rotate upon the axis of Time . Spring succeeds winter . And autumn lulls to acquiescent rest the summer of life . All operate within the Karmic Law , which is but the dictum of the Great Intelligence man knows as God . DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATIVE LAW Within the Law functions all life . And to oppose Hypothesis of The Universal Mind i j this Law is of no avail , for it is irrevocable , indisputable . It is the supreme and ultimate dictum of the Great Intelligence and it governs the universe , including all planetary life , all organic and inorganic habitations of the same . It finds its source within the Immortal Mind , whose power is of a dimension that can not be determined . To refute the theory of reincarnation does not make the process an obsolete form . It but emphasizes the lack of growth to which the soul denying acceptance has progressed . It relegates him to the period of adolescent growth , with mind but commencing to embrace the fundamental truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round out the necessary and essential fund of wisdom that will eventually furnish its content . Many an advanced soul who , through a prolonged period of mental concentration , has built his Temple of Thought to the required proportion , still refuses to accept the reincarnative doctrine as an authentic fact . What does this denote ? It denotes an egotistical condition of mind , a self-sufficiency . The thought-stream has of necessity poured through the channel of outward manifestation . That which constitutes the store of knowledge hoarded within the consciousness lacks the spiritual essence which is derived from the inner source . The brilliant mind has centered its concentration on the scientific field , limiting its horizon thereto and thought has crystallized . It lacks the elasticity which is necessary to normalcy . Transition will illumine this soul and the ultimate will be attained thereby . Denial constitutes a barrier to real progress . For , when spirituality is the basic principle , the mind is as a fertile field and respond : 1 18 Consciousness and Its Purpose with amazing rapidity to the seeds the inspirational flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when its deduction is drawn from that which is at variance with spiritual interpretation the mind of man is of necessity limited as to vision . For the physical eye has not the power to penetrate space . It draws its deduction from its experimental analysis of matter . But the Immortal knows neither time nor space . When he has traversed the various planes of creation his vision has no limitation of perspective , for it embraces all . And , with the microscope of thought all creative force lies revealed as a vast panorama which he scans at will . To impart this knowledge from time to time is his privilege if it be for the betterment of humanity . Certain cycles demand enlightenment in order to combat retrogression and the present is such a time . Civilization thrusts upon the realm of spirit the opportunity for real service and unanimous is the response to the call . Humanity is but another name for brotherhood and if , within the ranks , is a disintegration of thought apparent those who have passed beyond the turbulent chaos feel the urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to temper the momentum to safety and to unite those whose advancement makes this possible under the common banner of universal love . DESIRE Desire is the craving or longing to attain a certain condition . It finds birth within the soul , which suggests to mind the achievement of the same . Without desire soul would remain as an inanimate mass with neither volition or incentive . It would be Hypothesis of The Universal Mind ii comparable to a candle without a wick ; for the spark of spirit , which animates soul , motivates through the desire it thrusts upon soul for experience . When this inanimate mass first takes up an abode in close proximity to the physical vehicle through which it operates ( for contrary to the common belief soul does not enter the physical organism but , being the spiritual counterpart , it hovers near , at times indistinguishable , so closely is it allied ; at other times completely detached and operating from a considerable distance , functioning through the mind , thus during the repose of the night soaring aloft in search of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates itself with the physical vehicle it lacks the initiative for progress until desire is manifest , thrusting upon soul the incentive for gratifying the same . Desire then it is that supplies incentive . And incentive supplies initiative . Desire may follow the retrogressive path , leading to perversion , followed by excess and subsequent disillusionment . Or it may be the desire which uplifts and inspires soul , giving fresh impetus to growth . It may center its longing on achievement of an ambition , thus being a power for good . But of whatsoever nature , it is the essential factor of progress , for it provides experience without which progress would be nil . We often hear the subconscious desire designated as the cause of dreams which torture with their semblance of reality . Freud emphasizes this phase of perversity , claiming that the dormant sex longing induces the presentation of the same . Doubtless this is to some extent true . But if thought-control were evidenced and the mind was not permitted to dwell on this form of excitation the consciousness would not have that // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many a dream which the lay-mind classifies as a phantasy of thought is in reality a brief memory of that which actually occurred upon an intermediate plane , during the soul 's nocturnal journey thereto . To the soul whose stability permits , the memory of the nocturnal visitation to the higher realm remains as clear as reality . But when the soul , by its sensitivity , is unprepared for the revelation therein experienced the veil of oblivion is drawn before it resumes its position in close proximity to the physical habitat . Much discussion has taken place regarding the position of the soul , many claiming that it enters the physical body at the moment of birth , abiding therein . But would not this vital separation at frequent intervals be in the nature of a shock if it actually dwelt within ? It is the aura which facilitates its withdrawal , supplying the necessary elasticity . Again , when in a period of insanity soul soars aloft , receiving on a plane of somnolescence the healing treatment which it craves , the break must necessarily occur . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , decreed its present situation . And could the physical eye vision the ease with which it soars aloft it would marvel at the sublime skill revealed in the creative art . To the inner vision this transition is as natural as the means of locomotion of the physical body . Soul is propelled through the force of thought and thought vibrates to the cosmic power which motivates all life . Here the materialist inquires : what does the terminology " inner vision " actually mean ? The inner vision is in reality the spiritual power of concentration through which is plainly visible that which in reality is composed of the essence of thought . For all within the // realm of spirit is in thought-form , built to a perfective state by the concentrative intuitive ability . Not intangible and unreal as the mind of man deems it , but though ethereal the essence of love gives to the Immortal the power of creative genius , and that which he creates is eternal . To vision the rainbow is to thrill to its beauty . But though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while man has not the power to grasp its substance , his mind accepts it as an established fact . It is but a shadow of that which is distinctive of the immortal realm . For within color does the creative genius build a theme of superlative beauty . That which the inner vision reveals is truth , reality . For it is eternal , imperishable . Whereas the world of matter is subject to constant change , climatic , geographical , political . All is fleeting , evanescent . Even thought is an unstable quality there . It bestows fame upon a hero today only to snatch the crown from his head tomorrow , to laud another 's victory . Continents-disappear from view as did Atlantis and volcanic eruptions bury beneath the debris of Nature 's fury entire villages . But that which is of truth and which is built by immortal genius imperishable is through all Eternity . SUBJECTIVE TALENT Talent is the innate ability to accomplish that which the soul designates as the means through which it seeks expression . It may partake of an artistic desire which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the creative impulse , which sooner or later is given birth within every soul . Or , it may follow a mechanical bent such as engineering or draughtsmanship . Or , // ble of assimilation today is digested by the mental process with ease tomorrow . So decrees progress . COSMIC RADIATION Within the ether lie the elements , nitrogen and oxygen , which combined form the air man inhales and exhales through the process of breathing . But there is another vital force which permeates this substance , giving to it that vibrant quality which stimulates and sustains life within the cells of the human organism . That to which I refer is the cosmic ray , which is in and of all . Radiating from the plane of supreme dimension , impelled by the Great Intelligence which man knows as God , this ray is the invisible nucleus of life . The scientist has sought through long years of research to dissect and apportion its true valuation but , inscrutable , it reveals but a small portion of its magnetic power . To differentiate between the cosmic ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fractional part of the great whole . Whereas , through Divine Providence , the mind of man has leashed the lesser current , making it adaptable to his manifold needs , it yet gives forth but a small portion of that which it will ultimately yield . To Thomas Edison , well termed the wizard of the age , has been entrusted the task of revelation . But whether this great scientist believes that which he has adduced in the way of experimental knowledge has found birth within his own consciousness , or whether he dimly senses its implantation through the medium of thought-transmission , is difficult to say . But that the precept which guided his hand unerringly was that // bestowed by the Supreme Creator through the channel of intermediary thought is a foregone conclusion . Perhaps if we liken the cosmic force to a torrent of great magnitude , which pours forth in a broad stream from its hidden source , leashed at its distributing point and diverted through a series of innumerable channels into a given area , its magnitude diversified within that area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process through which the cosmic ray operates . Man is the objective point . But before the ray penetrates the human organism at the point of the solar plexus it first animates all space , passing through the intermediate or astral realm and thereby impelling thought to a greater impetus of momentum . It is thus thought is quickened by its animating genius . To refute this theory is to refute that which provides the impetus for all life . The planetary system must of necessity orbit on the cycle of its rotating power , which the same source provides . The infinitessimal flower which blossoms by the wayside responds to the same force . Therefore is it not a plausible fact that man too vibrates , the pulsation of the heart best attesting to the innate response to the authorship of its being ? From time to time a new exponent of truth appears upon the geographical plan of divine ordination and gives forth that which impresses the few . Ridicule may turn the shaft of ironical laughter within the heart of the given data but with the passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time revolves upon the axis of Eternity with the precision Infinite Wisdom provides , and the mind of // man orbits on the cycle of Karmic revelation in much the same manner . From time to time the veil which separates man from the source of all wisdom is drawn aside for a brief moment and a new era dawns . Old standards are replaced by new . And false precepts are thrown to the discard as waste material . Tomorrow dawns and today is relegated to the past . Only the time-worn traditions which are based on truth survive through the eternal ages . The hieroglyphics inscribed upon the ancient Egyptian tombs attest to this fact . Is there aught constructed within this materialistic age which will stand intact for the generations which follow after , to scrutinize with the eye of understanding ? Reason points to the Sphinx , the Pyramids , the Catacombs , ancient Greek temples , Egyptian dynasties , which still reveal the elements of creative genius centuries old . After scrutinizing these relics of a past civilization she turns to the present era of architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present generation a seriousness of purpose is lacking , a stringent disregard for that which history provides for enlightenment , a sad and deplorable lack of true appreciation . And we must look askance at that which will provide history with the wherewithal for future exploitation . Mechanical inventions of a superlative perfection , yes . But from the standpoint of creative art this era of ancient history will be as a barren field devoid of vegetative life . ELECTROTHERAPY To this branch of science does the therapeutist turn , seeking a curative power with which to combat physical disabilities . And no doubt this form of treatHypothesis // ment is of tremendous value from a medical standpoint . But what does this portend ? It reveals the process of combatting disease with the elements which Nature provides for its elimination . Trite and obvious , the critical mind may here intervene . But what is the element embodied in that which you call electrotherapy ? ? I ask . And you are nonplussed . To differentiate between the cosmic force and the electric current is futile . For one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great whole , just as a star is an integral part of the planetary system . Electrotherapy forms an interesting field of experimentation and its benefits are manifold . To concentrate upon a given or objective point that which animates it is to magnify its power , to give to it an increased vitality . Do not many medical experts today endorse the treatment which the sunbath provides ? And what is this but the exposure of the physical vehicle to the rays which penetrate with greater freedom its depth , with that which to a minor degree shields it , removed ? Within the ether are manifold currents producing what is called an air-pocket . And for what purpose does Nature place there this vacuum ? That the rays of the cosmic force may be deflected for the time being . When certain atmospheric conditions demand safeguarding she thus provides that which lessens this potent power . Within the human organism is that which we differentiate as the nervous system : nerves of infinitessimal delicacy , sensitive to a superlative degree . And what happens when a lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neurasthenia , // a depression of spirits , a general inertia of thought . The neurologist prescribes a cessation of labor , a period of rest , a general relaxation . And to what end ? That , when a general readjustment takes place , the individual may once again pursue the even tenor of his way , responding with the ease of normalcy to the animating force of Nature . Does not this teach a lesson ? Suspended effort can be but for one purpose : to provide a reflective period , to thrust upon soul a period of inactivity , to give a general readjustment . And is not this the ultimate result ? The material mind sees but the outward manifestation of the illness , with its subsequent recovery or nearrecovery , as it may be . But the Supreme Creator sees a subtle change take place within the soul , with a resultant strength through this period of enforced rest . The peculiar lamentation of the neurasthenic over this disability is very raucous to the one compelled by close association to listen thereto . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant knowledge of its own discomfort and the near attendant must exercise to the full his patience , to avoid a manifestation of irritation . To Nature must we turn for a further explanation of this , her great vitalizing force . NATURE Nature to man denotes a variety of composite parts . For to her must we attribute the seasons which rotate upon the axis of divine ordination ; the dawn which provides the artist with the theme for his text , which he delineates ofttimes in colors that are immortal in their texture ; the rainbow which arcs the dome of earth 's dimension , for so man terms this great aura of 1 // superlative beauty . And what in reality is Nature ? Nature may be defined thus , as the outward and visible expression of Infinite Mind . To divest Infinite Mind of the attributes which Nature provides is to extract that through which He operates . Man , without the sustenance which Nature gives , would have no animating force . Therefore to Nature do we turn for a revelation of supreme power . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Intelligence known as God and Nature . But Nature must perforce be superinduced to the manifestation of creative life . And only an Intelligence of tremendous and illimitable magnitude could exercise this power . Therefore , if we deduct the limitation of which the mind of man must of necessity give evidence we find that in the sum total Nature is that through which the Supreme Intelligence operates . To delve within the bowels of the earth is to find an unexplored field , vast subterranean passages , underground streams of great magnitude , volcanoes whose glowing embers reveal a menace to a future generation ? all of these are the silent and hidden mysteries with which she intrigues the mind of man . It is as looking within a glass filled with an inky substance . We glimpse the surface and the surrounding contour but the inner source eludes us . Were it possible to turn a microscope of great magnitude within the earth 's depths man would have a greater realization of the thin ice upon which civilization skates . Atlantis , once a mighty continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlighten the world today of her true status . From time to time a tragedy occurs within the upper strata which man 13o Consciousness and Its Purpose excavates for the purpose of obtaining ore or coal , or other vitalizing ingredients , and the combustion of gases causes an upheaval , with a corresponding loss of life . Does this not demonstrate the presence of a vast force beneath ? Oil is brought to the surface after a pipe is laboriously projected many hundreds of feet beneath the earth 's surface . All that which contributes to the real comfort of man is brought from beneath the soil . Iron , which provides the wherewithal for locomotion , copper , zinc , gold for the more decorative purpose , platinum , diamonds , natural gas , even the food which the vegetable kingdom provides , must first find its inception within this same source . To ponder on Nature , the great and only source of supply , is to achieve a deeper comprehension of the power she wields . From the ether of space is drawn the air we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapor gives to the plant-life its benediction , the solar rays whose light and warmth are necessary to life . To Nature must the mind of man bow in homage . And what is Nature ? Nature is the outward expression of Infinite Mind . EXPONENTS OF LOVE Within the numerous cults existent today are many who use the cognomen of love as that with which to cloak their activity . They purport to be banded together for a universal unity of mind and they practice wierd and unhealthy rites in connection therewith . To the thinker this is a defamation of the sacred principle which the Christ provided as the base of human relationship . He founded that which was to be a universal creed , a brotherhood of man , with tolerance and unHypothesis // derstanding as its predominating law . But as Time rolled away the stone from the tomb of universal discord a general disintegration took place and that which was to have been a crown of joy became a cross upon which individual worship is crucified . Today sectarians deprecate the scant attendance within the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dogmatic law to provide a greater elasticity of action but , even so , the lure fails to draw the necessary influx of souls for pecuniary maintenance . Certain creeds which demonstrate a new thought or mental philosophy are appealing , with a greater attendance each calendar month . And why ? Because the present state of civilization demands a more advanced teaching . The elementary interpretation of biblical data no longer satisfies the sophisticated mind and the spiritual analysis satisfies the current need . Thought of necessity flows through a more liberal channel . And individual yearning demands freer expression . To what does this lead ? To a general inflation of philosophical mind . The pudding is no longer eaten as a whole but each ingredient thereof is scrutinized with the epicurean eye of discernment . In the Greek philosophy Plato sought to extemporise the eternal truth and to date he stands supreme as an intellectual genius . Aristotle too bequeathed the fruits of his great intellect . But to the Christ was given the supreme achievement of bequeathing to the AngloSaxon race the fundamental principles of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone satisfies our need . To think of this great spiritual force not as a secondary deity , to be worshipped from the distance the physical mind imposes , nor even as a supreme // intelligence ( for God alone reigns supreme , dominating all universes alike ) but to regard the Christ as the Elder Brother of superlative spiritual attainment , is to truly know the joy of his communion . It is thus he serves with that great force known as the White Brotherhood . His real concern is for the betterment of humanity . I repeat : to thus designate this divine disciple of love is to acknowledge his true relationship to man . MANIFESTATION OF POWER Power is the ability to control effort . And effort is the manifestation of thought . Within thought does the soul give expression through the medium of the brain , animated by the infinitessimal spark of Spirit therein .

And that which soul encounters registers on the consciousness so vividly that memory resurrects the imprint thereof and seeks to analyze the wherefore of the nocturnal experience . To call such an experience a dream is a fallacy . For true dreams are fleeting , evanescent . But that which remains vividly in the memory is an occurrence which actually took place upon the astral or intermediate plane . And this thought-form was materialized by one proficient in mental healing , in order to shock the soul in question into a cognizance of its significance . Ofttimes an impending calamity in the nature of a bereavement is revealed thus and it answers a twofold purpose . It prepares the soul in question for that which must inevitably occur and its need is ministered to in order to alleviate the pain . Here material mind interposes : does soul of necessity need this ministration ? And I reply : soul is an exceedingly sensitive organism and a shock of too rude a nature has the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event actually occurs the very fact that the consciousness has already imprinted upon it the outline of the tragedy tends to relieve the tension and shock thereof . Prophetic dreams there always have been , dreams which sear the consciousness and bring to soul a realization of its futility to withstand defeat . When an impending calamity is aborted soul seeks in concentraHypothesis // Live thought to solve the reason why it was thus threatened . Often a person states that he has had a miraculous escape from death . Is not this in reality a warning of the frailty of the thread of life , a suggestion that but for the momentary intervention the soul might have soared to its predestined fate ? To scoff at predestination is a grievous irony . For Infinite Mind predestines the path through which each soul wends its evolutionary way . What then is the use of effort ? ? is here interpolated . Because in effort alone is experience gained , and without experience soul would develop but little fortitude to withstand adversity . Fatalism holds an element of danger and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must perforce be so . And soul has the power to develop initiative to conquer defeat . Incentive provides the initiative to further purpose . And it is desire that impels incentive to action . Because the soul must , through preordination , traverse the Karmic Cycle to the completion of its destiny is not sufficient reason to embrace the fatalistic faith , or rather , let us say lack of faith . For the Great Intelligence permits soul to make the choice of the route it desires to traverse . And it also has the prerogative of traversing a straight path to attainment or , by devious routes , it may dally ; adding one existence after another to its ultimate whole . But , with tender love and infinite concern , does the Supreme Intelligence follow the trail and if the journey be too long , with too many detours to delay progress , Fate intervenes and thrusts upon the dalliance manifested a realization of its import . The Oriental mind lends itself easily to fatalism ; stoical and unemotional , hiding beneath a blank ex136 Consciousness and Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddha for absolution . And no doubt this selfsame Buddha is but the Christ in another guise , for as such he serves humanity . PROPHETS AND SAGES Prophets and sages there have been without number in biblical days , and to each one has the prophetic gift been given through divine will . And for what pur-pose ? Man has ever been susceptible to prophetic utterance . He may jeer and scoff . But deep within the soul of every human lies a desire to have foretold for him that which will eventually occur . Even in this materialistic age charlatans there are without number who , hiding beneath the robe of spiritualism , fleece the gullible and perjure their souls , thus jeopardizing progress , that the earnings they derive may give to them a greater degree of comfort . Perhaps , and as is often the case , their livelihood is obtained in this way . A pitiful condition here exists . On one side , the yearning soul , even while protesting it is done only in the spirit of adventure , seeks in revelation its knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking information as to the solving of a material harassment . Is not faith here evidenced ? Else why would the medium be besought to divulge that which is to come ? On the other hand the medium , if sincere , has not the power except in rare cases to project thought beyond the confines of the astral realm ; and there contacts an entity undergoing the purging process , one of the same thought-level , who purports to impart the information the medium seeks . Understand once for all , // those Immortals who function within the supernal realm deal not with material problems . It is the spiritual problem which they seek to solve . For , having passed beyond the plane of relative thought , they see the physical existence as a brief span of experience . And though the one bound to them by the affinity of soul suffers , their understanding of its import assures them it is a necessary experience . The tie which binds these advanced souls together , no matter what the terminology of the relationship , husband , wife , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the magnetic vibration of love will reunite , with all the joy of a spiritual reunion , when the Karmic Cycle is complete and ultimate freedom is attained . That which really binds together two souls is an affinity of taste . The same vibration started them forth on their evolutionary careers and during each succeeding existence , before it came to a close , the magnetic attraction drew them together again . Even though the sea divides it can not separate companionate souls . Here the scoffer intervenes : What then of the marital tie in the Great Beyond ? The marital tie is forever dissolved when freedom of soul is attained . Having eliminated the dross , or more plainly speaking , the sex impulse , soul is as a pure substance . And therefore the companionship is that which is based on spiritual magnetism . Thus , two souls may pursue their spiritual evolution in the closest harmony . But once the fire of the lower nature is extinguished naught but ashes remain . Not a glowing ember breathes of life therein . Is not this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Immortal build that with which to embellish his // longing and the creative impulse ever finds impetus for effort . " Build thee more stately mansions , oh my soul " ? is indeed a true interpretation of the immortal privilege ; and no doubt Oliver Wendell Holmes , who bequeathed these words , with the inner vision glimpsed that of which he sang . FEUDAL ANTIPATHIES When , in the course of time , one individual meets another to whom he feels instinctively and violently antagonistic , a mental antipathy is experienced . How is this to be accounted for ? To fully explain this antipathy of soul it is necessary to follow the thread of continuity back into a past existence , scanning the relationship of soul to other individuals therein . These two who reveal a dislike for each other have without a doubt experienced a relationship which has resulted disastrously for one or both . The very fact that the soul still senses the instinctive dislike reveals the closeness of the previous relationship . What is the significance of this reunion ? It is because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Karmic Law through time and space has reunited them , that through another given opportunity they erase from the consciousness the instinctive dislike registered therein . Every debt that man contracts must be paid and the law of moral turpitude provides the way . Drastic indeed is the punishment meted out now and again to a delinquent . Let us analyze the word debt . A debt is an obligation incurred . And an obligation entails a responsibility . Is not this significant ? Debts are of three denominations : spiritual , moral and material . A spirHypothesis // itual debt is that which soul contracts , refusing to listen to the inner voice which pleads for spiritual manna . If denied sustenance retrogression becomes apparent and Karma builds that which must at a later period be torn down and rebuilt . Another existence paves the way to a rehabilitation of soul . A moral debt is that through which the sense-centers demand appeasement and will-power is insufficient to stabilize desire . The moral obligation may also be of the nature of theft , or a perverseness of thought bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of untruthfulness denote the inability of thought to function normally . This state of being reveals a faulty foundation built in a previous existence and it entails a rigid control and supervision of thought to eliminate the inherent weakness . If this is not accomplished still another physical existence will pave the way to an elimination of the predominating weakness . A material obligation involves that which partakes o a pecuniary laxity and this is a common weakness of the present age . Temptation is rampant , and the momentum of life is too fast for safety . This weakness brings in its wake no surcease from worry and care . The continuous harassing of soul tends to weaken the morale . For , ever does it breathe of futility . And what is the purpose ? It is to strengthen the will-power . Disillusionment ever follows in the wake of sorrow and worry paves the way to an understanding of responsibility . When to you comes the longing to retaliate , when a person has wounded your susceptibilities , pause a moment and reflect . How can you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt you contracted in the forgotten past ? // When the curtain of oblivion , which enshrouds the past , is drawn aside and with the eyes of understanding you view the eternal thread which binds you thereto , comprehension will dawn and illumine for you many a problem which torments now , with its semblance of mystery . OBSESSION AND THE REASON THEREFOR From the psychologist 's point of view obsession is a real problem . It explains the idiosyncrasies of that which the psychiatrist terms a dual nature . When an individual who has pursued the even tenor of a more or less uneventful life suddenly , and without apparent reason , gives way to strange and erratic behavior reason tells us that some condition , not heretofore existent , has developed . The psycho-analyst here probes the subconscious with the keen knife of intuitional discernment and perhaps his efforts will be rewarded in a minor degree . But the cause lies deeper than this . It is due to one of two things , problematical it is true but indisputable . Either in a previous existence the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness ( inherent from the reincarnative point of view ) and the wall of resistance which has been built through concentrative effort on the plane of reconstructive thought , within the period between reincarnations , has not been sufficiently reinforced , thus giving way at the psychological moment . Or , through a weakness in the morale , an insufficiency of will-power , a secret longing of a perverse nature , the way has been paved through thought whereby the soul in question is susceptible to the influence of one on the astral plane , whose longing for this particular form of vice has not been appeased Hypothesis of The Universal Mind t ? i through satiation before leaving the physical plane . The force of magnetism draws these two souls together in a fervor of longing , with the result that the stronger and more dominant personality obsesses the conscious or unconscious recipient of the obsession . This may eventually prove of great benefit to both as it tends to bring the disillusionment necessary in order to eradicate the predominating weakness . An obsession of this order is extremely difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions on a material plane . When transition takes place the force of gravitation , which propels aloft to the intermediate or astral plane , dissolves this unity of minds and each faces the result of this debauch of thought , realizing to the full its significance . How does this obsession take place ? ? the curious mind interpolates . And I amplify the text : Upon the astral plane hibernate numberless souls undergoing the purging process , combined with that period of concentrative thought preparatory to another existence upon whatever planet Infinite Mind designates as best suited to the individual need . When through force of accumulative desire which the subject has been unable to assuage through self-analysis ( it is unnecessary to state that this condition takes place when the lower nature dominates the spiritual Self , as in the early stages of evolutionary progress ) and , I repeat , the mind becomes surcharged by accumulative retrogressive thought the soul thus afflicted returns in thought to the haunts he formerly frequented and there , drawn by the power of gravitative thought , draws near to one similarly affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion he gradually accomplishes a unity of thought , a dominion over // the mind , of which the obsessed may be totally unconscious . But the united desire forces a consummation of the act and momentarily a relief is obtained for both . Strange as it may seem , the mind of the discarnate spirit works in such close proximity that only to the spiritual vision is a dual personality discernible . A grave misdemeanor is this , a serious infraction of Karmic Law , which will cost the obsessing entity an indeterminable length of time to rectify . For the morale is torn to shreds and must again be laboriously rebuilt through a series of existences . But to the afflicted one thus obsessed it is of eventual benefit , for it brings sooner the disillusionment through which comprehension dawns , and he commences laboriously to strengthen and rebuild the weakened morale . For one whose longing trends the perversive path rehabilitation is possible only by a determined effort at thought-control . And this is exactly what the soul undergoing the purging process is subject to . Man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he faces the consequences of his acts . This explodes the ancient fire-and-brimstone Hell of early biblical days . The fire which cleanses is the Spirit , scourging with the flame of comprehension the consciousness of its predominating weakness . DEDUCTION OF MATERIALISTIC MIND What is the reaction of the material mind to enlightenment of a spiritual character ? Let us turn first to the evolutionary period of the materialist . It is what may be termed the adolescent period of progress . Mind , propelled by soul , has attained a functioning power . It may even be of a brilliant order . But within its masonry is evidenced imHypothesis // perfect labor . It has been built too hastily perhaps , and is not reinforced by the cement of spiritual understanding . In other words , each stone laid therein has been imperfectly placed and the regular outline is blurred . Picture a building built thus . It stands and offers a habitation . But it could not be passed as a perfect product and it is not pleasing to the eye . So it is with the materialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this period the article or individual is judged according to the material value represented . Therefore , placing a monetary valuation on that which he scrutinizes , how would it be possible for that which is of spiritual value to receive from him a true analysis of its intrinsic worth ? According to the understanding does every individual balance his Ledger of Life . And the mind visions only that which its perspective permits . The horizon which bounds the physical vision also limits the spiritual vision of the mind 's area . Let the advanced thinker judge leniently the adolescent stage of thought , realizing that in the growth of the soul from infancy to maturity all grades are necessary and each one is a step to a higher consciousness . Because the universal mind reflects not on this fact is largely responsible for the lack of tolerance exhibited . This does not mean that weakness is to be condoned ; rather the reverse . But let censure not color thought to the extent of eliminating compassion . Place the renegade under restraint if necessary , where his moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Time adjust that which he will eventually eradicate through thoughtful self-analysis . If this does not take place on the physical plane it // will when transition carries the soul on to the astral corrective discipline . Segregation is the only method to be employed with the moral delinquent , whose activities are of an extreme abnormal manifestation . The weakened willpower permits not of verbal correction . The pathological mind must of necessity diagnose the character of the affliction . But the humane instinct must be that which determines the punishment necessary . Within the universal mind is evidenced a supreme indifference to capital punishment . When an understanding of metaphysical law is prevalent among the scientific intelligentsia there will be a general adjustment of curative measures with the criminal . Capital punishment will be abolished , for the more humane discipline of a permanent incarceration within a penal institution . There the soul will in meditative thought be forced to face the result of its criminal activity . Whereas , the noose catapults the unprepared soul into Eternity with a cataclysmic force of dynamic intensity . Indescribable anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does predestination govern pro-gress ? This question is often projected by the lay-mind to the exponent of spiritual truths . Predestination governs progress to a limited extent . As has been stated , when the embryo or chrysalis soul reposes within the conceptive realm , by the process of concentrative thought the innate desire for a vocational effort is implanted within the depths of the new-born consciousness , with which every new soul is of necessity // equipped . So indelibly is this imprinted that it gives to soul in later years the power of incentive . With no objective point progress would he impossible . It would be as a ship starting forth on a lengthy voyage with no port as its prearranged destination . So , thus , within soul is placed an inherent desire which facilitates its progress . It does not necessarily limit soul to this one field of activity . For with growth comes a diversity of tastes and with knowledge a wide field opens to the mental vision , embracing eventually all branches of science . Soul , through this inherent desire , focusses its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but when freedom widens the field of activity it embraces all that the creative impulse fosters ; and eventually , within one channel of creation , finds its supreme achievement . Thus , while inherent desire impels soul to the accomplishment of its purpose , the field of diversity is ever open to desire . A vocation is that which the word implies , a certain branch of activity to which soul adapts itself with the greatest facility . Often the student of metaphysical knowledge stresses too deeply the desire for enlightenment . He seeks to penetrate the veil which screens from him the result of past effort , and to no avail . For the Karmic Law permits no scrutiny of that which lies behind until understanding prohibits all possibility of shock . From time to time a mere fragment is released through the efforts of one attuned to the supernal realm . But this is not gleaned at will by the one who projects his thought therein . Rather , is it released for a definite purpose ? to rouse a deeper interest , to stimulate thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of matter all life functions // through the Karmic Vibration . Each thought , each word , each deed , reaps a corresponding effect . And for what reason ? That progress may be facilitated , that experience may furnish the individual that which soul must have . Choice then is accorded the individual of the path he traverses to the fulfilment of his destiny . To refute this is impossible . Is not the mind endlessly forced to make a decision ? Does not thought determine that which results in action ? And is it not desire which is the real autocrat of destiny ? Does not the individual permit this desire to function at times to the exclusion of all else ? From a mere suggestion mind concentrates upon the object desired until the longing becomes so pronounced that all else is sacrificed for the attainment thereof . Thus does man shape his destiny . And whether the course he pursues leads him through the fertile meadows or across the parching sands , the objective point is the same for one and all . SUBJECTION OF MIND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is regulated by the force of thought . To many this is an ambiguous statement . But let us illustrate thus . Suppose an inventive genius gives to the world an article of superlative interest : a radio or an automobile , for instance . At once the mass centers its interest on this article and it becomes the object of general conversation . It is discussed pro and con , and its various attributes are deduced and analyzed to a microscopic degree . Again , suppose a Lindbergh performs a feat of great magnitude . The mass-mind dwells and focusses // its attention on this to the exclusion of other and less important items . Therefore , the universal mind sways to the power of suggestion to a marked degree . If , within the world of matter , a new idea is projected through the medium of thought-transmission , if it be of sufficient import , has it not a tremendous power for good ? When Lincoln centered his humane and instinctive longing on the freedom of the slave did it not result in a country separating into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not this same slavery suggest a barbaric condition ? To what law could one ascribe the right to own and dominate another soul ? All souls are created free and equal in the beginning and all souls are free and equal in the end . This condition is worthy of analysis . I n the desire to own and dominate the human cargo affected was glimpsed the remnant of a barbaric regime . Evolution solved the problem . And the present generation views with distaste the thought of slavery . But only three generations back did this condition exist . And what was its real cause ? Turning back the leaves of historical data , we find in ancient Egyptian days a multitude of human beings held in physical bondage . Many of the dominating autocrats were forced to face the results of their own autocracy , and reincarnation provided the means . Tasting the misery of dominion and the hardship of abuse , the soul thus operating through the negroid race is today learning an invaluable lesson . To disown a kinship with our dark-skinned brother is not possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . And within the immortal realm all souls function as pure substance . To every individual has been given the same inex148 Consciousness and Its Purpose haustive process of growth . During his various existences the skin pigment has changed from time to time , from the dark tone of the mulatto to the white pallor of the Caucasian . In its incipient stage does the soul express the child-like attributes of the negroid . But when a Booker Washington materializes it is in reality an old soul , reincarnating from choice to give to the race a greater impetus of thought . Analyze the nature of the average negroid ; is it not child-like in its development ? impressionable , irresponsible , easily influenced ? Let understanding provide the compassion merited . Racial prejudice must be overcome . For , brotherhood of man is the eventual basis of universal mind . SUBJECTIVITY OF MATTER What in reality is matter ? Matter is the composite element of substantiality . It is that which is perceptible to the senses , that which is tangible , which defies destruction , which disintegrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it susceptible to divine ordinance ? Within the planetary system a new activity is evidenced . New matter is in process of formation . And within the inceptive realm numberless souls are , through the creative process , being evolved . What does this portend ? It signifies but one thing : that the Supreme Intelligence is , through the propagative instinct , widening the scope of activity , that these new planetary orbs will eventually , through the power of gravitative force , traverse the orbit to which the Supreme Magnet relegates them and that when the etherealized and rarified atmospheric condition reaches // the exact status required a new influx of souls will announce the dawn of a new generation . Eons must pass ere the soul now in its incipiency evolves into that which knows individual thought . But with the inscrutability of supreme wisdom is the Plan of the universe being shaped to the desired requirement . Perhaps to estimate the actual time required for the soul to evolve from its chrysalis to the mature period of thought would interest the seeker of truth . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accomplished separation takes place and on different planets is the early period passed . But ever and anon , within this evolutionary progress , soul is reunited with that whose inception occurred during the same era . For what purpose is this ? That , through comparison and cohesive companionship , each soul be given a greater impetus of thought . Here then the egotist inquires : how does it benefit soul if memory-provides no knowledge of a former existence ? Within the somnolescence of sleep soul ever soars aloft and upon another plane of thought contacts its companionate affinity . The more profound the sleep , the more satisfying the reunion . For then mind remains acquiescent and makes no demands on the brain for conscious thought . He who never or seldom ever dreams is singularly blest , for it indicates that the mind obeys the mandates of soul and gives complete obedience thereto . This may seem to conflict with a previous chapter . But many an individual there is to whom the dream period is practically unknown . When to man is given the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ISO Consciousness and Its Purpose vision that which illumines for him a vast field of meditation . Then will he see the incipient idea and its innumerable avenues of development . As a nucleus does it repose therein and mind selects , with the subconscious alliance , that which seems most feasible of fruition . But before this power becomes an actuality soul must renounce the fetters which bind it . Only through freedom , which indicates the elimination of ulterior motive , with resultant purity , is the vision permitted to penetrate the veil which screens from the material mind the vast realm whose store-house of wisdom is inexhaustible . To pave the way purge thought of impurity , thus vibrating to the law of Karmic obligation . THE ALLIANCE OF CREEDS That which forms the basic principle of every creed is worship ? the homage which soul gives to the Supreme Deity . For what other reason does man enter a tabernacle set aside for this purpose ? And the feeling that should be manifest toward all others who enter therein is tolerance , which is the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thought is given to the real reason for worship . Man accepts it as a part of the week 's routine . And if he enters the door of any denominational sanctuary it is with no feeling of awe or rapture permeating his soul . How may we account for this absence of a oneness with Infinite Mind ? It is because the individual has enshrouded the soul with a veil of indifference . His lackadaisical mode of worship bestows upon him naught but a sense of relief that he has once again done his duty and he returns home with a self-complacency that tends to // enrich his self-esteem . A good and worthy citizen , one who forgets not to place the customary donation within the plate . But , when his span has drawn to a close and soul journeys forth into the Great Unknown with no spiritual robe to cover its nakedness , then futility whispers softly : " for what purpose was man given the power of communion with the Great Intelligence ? " In olden times , when our forefathers made their weekly pilgrimage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility of spirit . And , while the straightlaced dogmatic law repels today with its suggestion of austerity , yet did it not instill within that era a sacred form of worship that was more than a form ? The Christ it was who , through his great humility , walked among the multitude , shorn of all but his great and tender love . Choosing to reincarnate as a humble carpenter , he sought thus to bring to the world a message of understanding and tolerance . Peace was the keynote of the religion he sought to establish . Refusing the opportunity for his last existence on a physical plane in aught but the most humble birth , he selected the parentage of Mary and Joseph . For in them both he recognized a rare spirituality . This is contrary to the belief of many . But , with the manger as a cradle , he attested to his desire for a humble birth . Had this principle been kept intact , instead of being split into numerous creeds , the world today would be a far more livable place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actuality . Whereas , the only true brotherhood representing this , his ideal , is that which functions upon the immortal plane , which bears the name of the White Brotherhood and of whom he is the dominating head . What then more natural than that this band of Im152 Consciousness and Its Purpose mortals should unite their efforts for the common cause to ( through concentrated effort ) strive to lift the thought of the mass to a higher level , instilling within , through the channel of thought-transmission , these selfsame principles which he brought in his last visitation to a physical plane . Love , understanding , tolerance , peace , form the essentials thereof ; a love for all humanity , combined with an understanding of the individual need ; the tolerance which censures not but gives the compassion required ; and the peace which is ever bestowed upon the true seeker and which passes understanding . This is the doctrine of the Christ . GREEK MYTHOLOGY In ancient history little is actually known of the origin of Greek Mythology . It dates far back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known of a Supreme Deity , when mind functioned with an instinctive faith rather than an assured knowledge , an innate sense of yearning for that which embodied a power of supreme dimension , It was for this reason that Jupiter was given birth within the minds of the philosophers of that time and to him was accorded a homage that savoured of worship . Juno shared with him the imposing throne . Apollo drove the gleaming sun-chariot across the eastern sky when Aurora flung wide the portals of the dawn . Diana likewise guided the moon-chariot through the hours of the night . Lesser other deities there were by the score . Different hemispheres were governed by the imaginary descendants of this august and ofttimes tyrannical couple and numerous progeny swelled the list of mythical Greek deities . Hypothesis of The Universal Mind is The delineation of the same served to found the base for ancient art . Statuary and canvas alike reproduced the artist 's ideal and even the poets rhapsodized on the tender love lavished upon the companionate union ; thereof . Is this not significant of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christ appeared , a race symbolized in art their interpretation of that which they instinctively sensed . What is there today that bequeaths to the coming generation a comparative beauty ? The modern exhibition of the artist ' : creative longing centers on the nude , it is true ; but the spiritual beauty , which differentiates the ancient from the modern art , is sadly lacking . The nude figure today is suggestive of the sex lure . Whereas , the galleries of Europe , still housing the ancient canvases , convey nc suggestion of sex , but rather the cold and marble statuesqueness emphasizes the purity of the theme delineated . Rare exceptions there are , but of art in a genera way am I extemporizing . Wherein lies the racial difference ? It would doubtless surprise you to be told that many of those philosophers and creators of ancient Greece dwell upon the physical plane today and that the trend has been downward instead of upward ; that retrogression has transformed the bud which promised a rare loveliness of perfective beauty into the blighted fruit . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , through dalliance in one existence after another , have buried their talent deep within the subconscious . where it lies dormant until the veil of materialism i withdrawn ; when once again it will flame into living beauty . Have you ever thought of trying to account for the great genius of a Mozart , a Grieg , a Wagner , a Franz // Schubert ; or in the modern age , a Paderewski , or a Melba ? This rare degree of efficiency bears the stamp of centuries of cultural achievement . A supreme gift is achieved in this way alone . To listen to the gifted virtuoso , Mischa Elman , is to draw from the past its veil of mystery . For only in reincarnation does the talent of a supreme order develop to a finished state . To study the language of ancient Greece is to reap a wealth of enlightenment . But today racial prejudice forbids an interchange of soul communion . And the average American seeks through the Anglo-Saxon tongue to express his soul 's longing . Progress , with the broom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . CAUSE OF FATIGUE Within fatigue does the physical organism give warning of depleted energy . And Nature , during the hours of sleep , replenishes the nerve-cells , recharging with renewed life their motivating power . It is to Nature then we turn for explanation of the process . When , in the chaotic existence which progress has bestowed upon the human race , soul seeks a surcease from the problems it thrusts upon mind , which in turn appeals to brain for co-operation , it then lulls to acquiescence these intermediary powers and draws the curtain of oblivion over conscious thought . Mind , unless tormented beyond its endurance by soul 's habitual insistence , acquiesces ; and sleep aids tired muscles to relax , as inertia becomes apparent . What then happens , which revitalizes the nervous system ? The cosmic force , concentrated upon the human organism at the point of the solar plexus , pours its vitalizing current within , inducing a fresh impetus to the // depleted cells , revitalizing , recharging during the time Nature provides for the resuscitating process . I1 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of sleep or rest , for curative measure ; and without this mind could not function normally for any great period of time . Man thinks of sleep as a vague period of rest . But could he but see the continuous inpouring of this great force he would have a deeper appreciation of the profound wisdom which provides this process . What then happens to mind during slumber ? Mind remains normally in a quiescent state , in close proximity to the brain , whose connecting tie is the thread of thought . And this same force , which provides the impetus for renewed effort on the succeeding day , gives to mind a greater vitality and elasticity ; protected by the aura which is the sounding-board of thought and whose dynamic tones vary according to the reaction of the emotions thereon . What a test this is of the art of the Supreme Intelligence ? this intricate and delicate organism known as mind ! Here the scoffer intervenes : has man ever visioned the mind ? And I reply : has man ever visioned thought ? Yet its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence . Within rejuvenation lies renewed strength . And to apportion a regular routine for sleep is to adjust to a nicety Nature 's schedule for healing and supplying the vital element of being . When fatigue accumulates through insufficient rest , and the accumulation of mind 's waste effort is too pronounced , what happens ? ' A condition of neurasthenia results and soul is enwrapped with an inertia which it vainly seeks to throve // off . But will-power refuses to aid . And a continuous lamentation , akin to complaint , is resorted to . Let Nature , the great healer , provide the necessary stimulus and a general state of well-being will produce a greater clarity of thought . RELAXATION Relaxation is the power to release muscular effort . And within relaxation is the strain of action removed . In the present generation is a tendency to tenseness , a disinclination to relax . Mind is tense . Thought functions with a harshness , an abruptness , which imposes a strain upon mind . And soul , which expresses through thought its inner longing , is animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not evidencing the steady flame which indicates a spiritual foundation that stabilizes thought . To , for a brief period each day , lie supine , with every muscle in a state of perfect relaxation , is of immense benefit to the individual . It takes practice to learn the art of complete relaxation , for habit is tenacious and the general tenseness is as a cord drawn to its fullest length , with a corresponding tension . To release it suddenly means a twisted coil , which must be straightened out by a laborious method . So do the tense muscles respond , until their pristine elasticity is restored . For instance , a course of callisthenics at first induces a general lameness , amounting to acute pain if the exercises be not gradually practiced . Mind , too , if projected with too great rapidity within a new field of profound thought rebounds with a tenseness indicative of shock . Use the same method when pursuing a new course of mental exercise . Accustom the mind by a // gradual process to its new activity . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partaken of ; unless it absorbs a crumb at a time a spiritual paralysis takes place , with an instinctive recoil . Moderation in all habits promotes longevity . Soul , mind , brain ? all are exceedingly delicate instruments and their mechanism defies all but the art of the Master Physician to adjust and attune to a new line of thought . Within metaphysics does the true seeker find his soul 's sustenance , not in that which the lay-mind designates as spiritualism . For , whereas metaphysics deals with the philosophy of thought , with its expanding proportion , spiritualism is but the outward expression of psychic phenomena , whose real value is nil other than as a means of providing evidence of the continuity of life and of the survival of spirit over matter . It may at times tend to assuage grief . But unless the soul has the power to project thought ( through a previous purification process ) beyond the astral or intermediate realm to the source of all good it is a dangerous experiment , and is to be discouraged . A strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity provides , attempts to navigate the plane where reconstructive thought is a necessary element . Better far , through meditative thought to attune soul to the key of harmony , the great chord which Infinite Mind strikes upon the universal soul of man . THE NEED OF HUMANITY Within the pulse of humanity is registered an uneven beat , a tempo which indicates a feverish condition of thought . The vital spark burns with a fitful flame , rather than with the steady flame which denotes // a state of spiritual well-being . To liken the pulse of humanity to the rhythmic flow of the tide seems to illustrate its predominant weakness . Whereas , the tide manifests the universal law of harmony , whose vibration is the under-current of the cosmic power , the pulse of humanity indicates an uneven flow , with a constant backwash of thought . The debris of the mind reveals an accumulative power which is disastrous to progress . Many a humanitarian today seeks in conscientious study to determine the means to alleviate the current need . But , against a massed thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Perhaps in revelation lies the ability to waken the mass to a realization of the predominating weakness . A series of catastrophies from time to time shocks the universal mind into a momentary consideration of life 's purpose . But the materialistic lure lulls to acquiescence the inner longing and the mass forges ahead in its endless pursuit of pleasure . To watch the pendulum of the clock is to learn the secret of Nature 's power . It swings to its widest limit before its momentum compels a reversal , through which the other extreme is attained . And thus does Nature pivot on the axis of Infinite Mind . The seasons , the calendar months , the hours of the day all indicate that the pendulum swings through the allotted space . Even thought varies from grave to gay . And laughter is the antithesis of tears . To temper hate with love is to swing the pendulum of understanding to its utmost limit . Let us compare life to the clock whose animating force is the pendulum . The face may be the outward expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the hand of desire delineates. // When the pendulum is stilled the rhythmic beat ceases and the hand of desire no longer delineates the various emotions . But within the depth is still the silent mechanism . Is not this a powerful illustration of thought ? To reflect on the soul 's mechanism is to know for a certainty that the vital spark which animates it receives its power from that which indistinguishable is , and even though its outward expression is stilled by transition it continues to operate on another and broader plane of consciousness . The mighty pendulum of Time swings on the axis of Eternity . And individual life is but an infinitessimal expression thereof . MORALITY What constitutes morality ? Society bases its deduction on the distinction of an act which savors of marital infidelity . It defines virtue as the essential point on which purity is based . But does not this suggest puritanism ? An individual may be as guilty in thought as he is in act . For , to build a thought-form is to create an image . And while manmade law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet Karmic Law defines immorality as an offence of the mind . Within the criminal court many an outcast is sentenced to a life of servitude who is but a tool of the law and many a legal light who defends the culprits of humanity perjures his soul in his vocational attempt to prove the guilty innocent . What effect has this mode of reasoning on the consciousness ? Reason tells the student of psychology that there must be an effect . Is it possible for an individual to steadily and consistently affirm that to be true which 16o Consciousness and Its Purpose for a certainty he knows is false , and not built up a wall of resistance within the consciousness to Reason 's man-date ? In the time to come , when transition has paved the way to a broader understanding , the soul will be compelled to laboriously reconstruct each item of false evidence , relegating it to the pigeon-hole which the conscience designates . And with appalling reality will the innocent victim appear before the inner vision to torture with the accusation of injustice . To perjure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be classed as an infringement of moral rectitude , which exceeds any other form . To many in the adolescent stage of progress the sex urge , fostered by desire , compels to a desecration of the marital act . What is the real extent of the harm accomplished ? The individual must eventually appear before the bar of his own conscience , who is the judge that sentences him to a self-analysis . In deep humiliation and contrition will he regard with loathing the thought of his moral transgression . And what if a third person is involved , for whose deep unrest and unhappiness he is responsible ? If not in this existence , in the next one to come a reversal will take place and he too will know the torture of abused confidence . What does this teach the individuals concerned therein ? It reveals the working of the Karmic Law . Every deed , every thought , which is a transgression thereof , is as a seed implanted within the soil of the consciousness and it will bring to fruition that of which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flower is implanted within the soil ? Fruition will eventually take place . And does not the weed multiply in the same // manner ? Who can differentiate between the multiplicity that each will bear in the course of its growth ? Morality is that in which integrity is the fundamental principle . It may be of thought , of speech , or of action . But the principle involved is the same . A moral bankrupt is the saddest of humanity 's profligates . For to re-establish the lost credit of self-esteem is a long and laborious process . IMMORTALITY Immortality is that which is eternal , that which an all-wise Intelligence provides for the soul which has traversed the orbit of its evolutionary path and has emerged as pure spirit , with all the dross extracted . This is the ultimate goal of all . But within the various existences which the Karmic Law provides many , through dalliance , prolong the period of their subjectivity to the Law . To evolve from one existence to another it is necessary for comprehension to have dawned of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire must have been given birth to once again enter upon a physical existence for the purpose of eradicating the inherent weakness . Until soul manifests the desire to build anew it must perforce repose on the plane of reconstructive thought . It is thus many find in dalliance that eons pass before comprehension dawns that the Karmic Law demands a growth into a higher spiritual status . To reincarnate soul must first have given precedence to those whose claims supersede , through the right of having been acquiescent to Divine Will for a greater period of time . In other words , they were ripe for this experience earlier than others ; and within the confines // of the astral plane are numberless souls awaiting this very opportunity . The population thereof far exceeds that of the souls dwelling within the worlds of matter . And for what purpose is this insufficiency of vehicles apparent ? Because the Law demands a true appreciation of the privilege granted . And within the present chaotic condition the late war thrust upon many thousands of unprepared souls the necessity for hibernative repose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent between the reincarnative periods varies according to the individual need . But it is safe to say that a century or more must elapse , giving the soul a new condition to face and providing a greater wealth of experience for its absorption . The earlier existences are spent on various planets designated by Infinite Mind . But that era which is spent upon the planet Earth is the last variation in the eternal scheme and the soul who has progressed to the stage where this world meets its required need knows for a certainty that the Anglo-Saxon tongue will eventually be his natural speech , until his cycle is closed with experience balancing the scales and with reason the dominating factor . Many there are who will refute this statement , preferring to give credit to some other exponent of enlightenment , with a different formulation . Just why Infinite Mind designates the Earth as the final scene of the soul 's pilgrimage is difficult to say . Perhaps because the momentum of life is swifter here than elsewhere and the temptation is correspondingly greater . At the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls there are who are still traversing the path to attainment upon the identical planet where // many centuries ago they saw the dawn of one era after another , spanning their absence therefrom . Within the sectarian denomination the clerical mind , as a rule , prefers to cling to the ancient belief that all that is supernormal is necessarily meant to be veiled from the human race , until the millennium or Judgment Day . But , with a new standard of thought replacing the old , revelation paves the way to a broader interpretation of spiritual truth . Just as the dawn of a new civilization replaces the ancient coach of progress so does the trend of thought undergo a metamorphosis which demands a new vehicle of expression . To limit the mind 's horizon is to restrict the same . THE MORAL OBLIGATION An obligation is a responsibility which the soul acknowledges as a rightful debt . It may be of the order of a spiritual obligation , one which accedes to the desire for a closer communion but denies soul the prerogative of embracing that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow confines of one creed or cult the gist of its knowledge . Whereas , soul perhaps has outgrown the haven this particular creed offers and in reality is subject to a mental paralysis . To deny soul the manna for its sustenance is a grievous error . For it is akin to a slow process of mental starvation and if denied that which it craves for an indeterminate period a feeling of inertia gradually enwraps it , forcing an inactivity of thought upon it . To combat this the interest should be stimulated by that which appeals in the form of a new line of thought . Liken soul to a garment with which Spirit robes its being . And compare the animating spark thereof to the human vehicle when , through growth , the outer // garment enshrouding the body becomes too small for ease of movement . A discomfort is distinctly perceptible . At first , a slight twinge of the muscular system announces its cramped condition and , as the increasing avoirdupois accentuates this discomfort , a feeling akin to pain is experienced . Soul goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new heights and the soul refuses to give to it a greater freedom of movement . Spirit is the motivating or vital part of soul and through its inactivity does the evolution assume a dormant state . In a person of normal growth a general unfoldment takes place , a gradual growth . Little by little the mind expands , embracing a wider scope of thought , spreading the tendrils of incentive longing in various directions , and embracing whatever appeals to its innate need . Mind responds to the urge of soul with amazing docility , increasing its functioning power and imprinting upon the consciousness each fleeting thought with the clear-cut precision of the etcher 's art . But , when desire is manifested and soul functions on the downward or retrogressive trend , the outline is blurred and lacks the clear imprint thought gives when directed within the right channel . Here the material mind proffers : by what do you deduce the conclusion of mind 's impressionistic state ? And I reply : the knowledge I impart is that gleaned from the intensive study of various phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the completion of its evolutionary progress , gleaned by actual observation of each delicate and intricate part thereof , delving within the consciousness with the clear and illuminative inner vision which is the Immortal 's prerogative when his progress has passed i // through and beyond the plane of relative thought to the plane of universal knowledge , where all life , organic and inorganic , is as an open book which he scans with the clear vision Infinite Mind bestows as the functioning power through which he serves humanity at large . To deny the Immortal this privilege is to deny the existence of a Supreme Intelligence . For , when the dross is extracted and only pure spirit remains , the immortal soul is once again an integral part of Infinite Mind . And the superlative ability of perfect concentrative power , with its illuminating sequence , is his divine right . Within the mind of the instrument who receives this material is the perfect attunement to the supernal realm which has been developed through the purification process , superinduced by an extensive self-analysis extending over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness , where the valuation is based on the spiritual rather than the material attributes . In addition , a severe disciplinary method of thought-control was resorted to until an innate purity of thought was attained . This was necessary , else a perfect attunement could not have been accomplished . And to make a receptive and sensitive instrument it must of necessity be of innate purity of thought . This perhaps delineates the process of purification . Infinite Mind issues the call . And the conscience is the tribunal before which the responsive soul appears to accept the ultimatum imposed . GREED Greed is the accumulative desire which permeates
