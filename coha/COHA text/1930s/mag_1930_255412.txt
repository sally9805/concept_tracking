The " family air yacht , " a four-passenger dirigible newly built by Capt . Anton Heinen , bobbed at its stubby mooring mast at Toms River , N. J. one chilly afternoon last week . When the engine refused to start , two young mechanics applied a compressed-air booster* to " kick over " the sluggish pistons . Instantly the compressed-air tank and the engine burst , the explosion throwing the crew and their one passenger 40 ft. to the ground , wrecking the fore part of the gondola , scattering a shrapnel of splinters . Flames from the carburetor shot upward but burned out without igniting the hydrogen-filled bag . <P> Capt . Heinen , a Zeppelin pilot in the War , later a consulting engineer for the Navy 's ill-fated dirigible Shenandoah ( TIME , Sept. 14 , 1925 ) , built his " air yacht " to be produced commercially " for family use . " Its initial cost was $19,000 , but the prospective purchase price , the designer said , would be " far below $10,000 , " the operating cost-per-mile lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight Capt . Heinen had landed his blimp in 46 sec . He was planning to make the gondola detachable from the bag , for operation on earth as an automobile . At the end of the flying season , the owner might deflate the bag , store it in his garage . <P> <P> *Not to be confused with a " booster " magneto , for auxiliary starting ignition , the compressed-air principle is also used in starting ordinary engines in heavier-than-aircraft ( e. g. the Heywood starter ) . Other types are : 1 ) hand inertia ; 2 ) electric inertia , comparable to the automobile starter , by means of a storage battery ; 3 ) a device inserted into an engine cylinder and employing a 12-gauge shotgun shell . When the shell is fired , it creates enough compression to turn the engine several times . The latter device , invented in France , was first shown in the U. S. by Charles A. Levine . Option for its manufacture is now held by Eclipse Aviation Co .. Orange , N. J. , sole manufacturers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
