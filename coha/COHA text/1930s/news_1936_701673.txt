txt A motion by Bruno Richard Hauptmann 's attorneys for a writ of habeas corpus was denied here today by Judge J. Warren Davis of the Federal Circuit Court , who held that any other action by him would " in effect be overruling the Supreme Court of the United States . " He also refused to grant a stay to give time for an appeal . The action , although it had been expected , was quick and dramatic . Judge Davis 's ruling closed one more exit through which Hauptman had hoped to escape the electric chair , unless a reprieve by Governor Harold G. Hoffman grants the necessary time for him to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals in this district . The defense attorneys had another coxference this evening at which they discussed their next possible move . The only comment was made by Neil Burkinshaw , who when asked if the defense was through replied , " Not by a long sight ! " No Decision on Course . One possible legal move would be to seek from another Circuit Court judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision today . Another would be to seek a similar certificate from the United States Supreme Court for an appeal directly to that body . No decision was reached on what course would be taken . The allegations in the petition made for Hauptmann contained no new evidence or legal argument , which was the reason , Judge Davis indicated , that he felt constrained to turn it down . Unless new evidence can be mustered in the time remaining before Friday , the date set for the execution , the possibility of obtaining a stay and a new trial from Justice Thomas W. Trenchard , which is another possible escape . will also be blocked . There remained the possibility that Governor Hoffman 's independent investigation of the case might lead him to grant a reprieve . In warning the Legislature , which opened here today , that a reprieve might cost the State of New Jersey more money , Attorney General David T. Wilentz said he had " reliable information " that Governor Hoffman had already determined upon such a course . Message Silent on Case . Governor Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislature , but sent it to them in written form , remained in the city only a part of the day . He said , however , that he had not made up his mind whether he would grant a reprieve . There was no official mention of the case to the Legislature . The action before Judge Davis took place late in the afternoon . Hauptmann 's three usual attorneys ? C. Lloyd Fisher , Frederick A. Pope and Egbert Rosecrans  --  accompanied by Mr. Burkinshaw and Nugent Dodds , two Washington lawyers recently retained , came to Trenton about 2 o'clock in the afternoon . They took the typewritten petition that was to be presented to Judge Davis to the prison for signature by Hauptmann . The signature was witnessed by the prison clerk . It was after 4 o'clock when the lawyers reached the office of Judge Davis , who was waiting for them . Another delay followed while Judge Davis called Attorney Gen eral Wilentz . The defense attor neys insisted that time was precious and the Attorney General , accom- panied by Joseph Lanigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb of the State police , arrived in Judge Davis 's chambers a short time later . The hearing was adjourned to a court room , which quickly filled as word spread through the building . Mr. Burkinshaw presented the petition for the defense . Its main allegation was that Hauptmann was " exposed to an overwhelming mob spirit during the trial , both during and between sessions of the court , which in effect deprived him of his constitutional rights " by causing his conviction without " due process of law . " The jurors , the petition alleged , were " exposed and subjected to hostile influences " - by being incompletely sequestered , being taken back and forth from the court room to the hotel through dense crowds without proper protection and so " exposed to opinions . " They heard the expressions of the crowd , the defense argued , heard the cries of newsboys and saw newspaper headlines , had their meals in a public dining room which was thronged from day to day ; and " sat protected only by a thin cloth screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there were disorderly occurrences in the court room . Derisive cries directed at the defendant and his witnesses arose . A motion picture camera was set up in the court room and operated for long periods , with a microphone established in an electric fan directly behind the jurors . " In the hotel , sounds of radio broadcasting by commentators arose to their quarters from the floor below . The broadcasting equipment was just inside a porch on which the jurors exercised . On the same floor on which they were quartered newspaper reporters were also quartered , and opinions from the latter could be overheard by the jurors . " The court room was thronged and many prominent persons sat behind the counsel table . " The petition then went on to charge Attorney General Wilentz with " intemperate insinuations and expressions of opinion which were prejudicial . " Suppression of Evidence . Switching from the subject of atmosphere to that of evidence , the defense charged that the prosecution had suppressed evidence that might have been of importance to Hauptmann . It was charged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was described by testimony of State witnesses as having been constantly in the possession of the State police when " in truth said note was out of their possession almost immediately and before subsequent notes appeared . " The prosecution was also accused of having kept secret letters to Hauptmann from Isidor Fisch , the furrier from whom the prisoner said he got the ransom money , and from Hauptmann to Fisch , which were taken from Hauptmann 's home in the Bronx . Mr. Burkinshaw read a long decision by the United States Supreme Court in the Mooney case , in which the suppression of evidence by the prosecution was held to be deprivation of " due process of law . " Mr. Burkinshaw was energetic , precise and quick . His presentation of the petition took less than fifteen minutes . At the end Judge Davis , a large , gray , slow-speaking man , began asking him questions . It was established that the points raised in the defense petition had been passed upon by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Wilentz was by turns indignant and satirical in his fifteenminute reply . He opened with the assertion that if " one important change had occurred since the trial to alter the case against Hauptmann , it would not be necessary for his counsel to be here , for we would immediately go into court to see that justice was done . " He pointed out that the defense counsel never once during the trial made a complaint . The State witnesses and the counsel for the prosecution , he said , did not eat in the same ' dining room with the jurors , but the defense witnesses and counsel did . As for use of the hotel to house the jury , he said , it was done with the " acquiescence and consent of the defense counsel . " The whole charge of prejudicial atmosphere , he said , " was a subterfuge and a fraud attempted to be imposed upon the court . " Recalls Prisoner 's Shout . " Who shouted out in the court room ? " he asked . " Who but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet to call a witness a liar and , upon his example , his wife was provoked to follow suit . " We do n't have mob spirit in New Jersey . That is just a phrase thrown in an effort to intimidate the court . As for the throngs , it was the attorneys for the defense who most often had their photographs taken smiling and calling friendly greetings to the crowd . " In response to the charge that he had been " intemperate , " he declared that " apparently , when the Attorney General said the defendant was a murderer , they think that violated his constitutional rights . " Of the ransom note , he said : " My recollection is that one day Colonel Lindbergh did have possession of that note , but what if he did ? The important thing about the note is who wrote it . Why , even the defendant himself admitted that the handwriting looked like his . That is the material question , the question of who wrote it . " Concerning the defense allegation about the Fisch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper in the hands of the prosecution that would be of any help to the defendant . " In closing , Mr. Wilentz described the action as " an attempt to use the habeas corpus in the place of a writ of error , " continuing : " They have appealed to the Court of Errors and Appeals and to the United States Supreme Court and had their rulings . On the basis of this petition , what they ask now is that Your Honor , in effect , reverse the United States Supreme Court . " In rebuttal Mr. Dodds quoted as one of Mr. Wilentz 's " intemperate insinuations " his statement in summing up that : " Hauptmann is cold . But he will thaw out when he hears that switch . That is when he will talk . " Judge Davis then began his decision , speaking with a slow , easy enunciation in a low voice . When he finished he arose and had almost left the bench before Mr. Burkinshaw succeeded in attracting his attention to ask a stay , which the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the form of a conversation with Senator Charles E. Loizeaux of Union County , the chairman of the joint appropriations committee . He told Senator Loizeaux that he had " reliable information that Governor Hoffman had decided to grant a reprieve , " and said that if this were done he would have to come to the committee for more funds to carry on the case . If a reprieve were granted , he said , it would mean additional litigation and money would be needed . No request had been included in the regular budget of the department , he said , because at the time the budget was drawn he had considered the case closed . Mr. Wilentz did not indicate how much money he thought would be needed or what kind of litigation he considered likely to follow a reprieve . The Hauptmann case has already cost the State more than $300,000 , which includes the investigation that preceded the arrest and the costs of the trial . That Governor Hoffman is continuing his investigation of Dr. John F. Condon was indicated this morning when he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an unnamed person . William S. Conklin , the Governor 's secretary , declared that no effort would be made to have Dr. Condon returned , but that the Governor expected that " Tafsie " would come back voluntarily . He can not return before the execution date unless there is a reprieve . Mr. Conklin would not explain how the Governor had come into possession of the letters , which follow : 2,794 Decatur Av. , Bronx , N. Y. C.
