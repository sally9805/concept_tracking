Cheerful financial news there was , last week , in September 's railroad earnings report . Net income for Class 1 roads was estimated to be a swaggering $36,000,000 , twice September 1937 's $16,110,527 , three times August 's $10,053,000 , six times September 1938 's $6,276,573 . <P> Principal surprise was that when gross operating revenue humped sharply ( 18.3% ) since last year , expenses were kept down so well that nearly all of the increase in revenue was brought down to net operating income . Typical of this policy was New York Central , whose gross jumped $5,900,000 ( from $25,800,000 to $31,700,000 ) compared with September 1938 , while its net operating income jumped $4,100,000 ( from $2,200,000 to $6,300,000 ) . On the other hand Pennsylvania , which in September was already hard at work repairing down-at-heel freight cars ( such repairs are charged to maintenance ) , had a $3,000,000 increase in various costs which held its net operating income down . Result : its net rose $3,000,000 , its gross $8,300,000.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
