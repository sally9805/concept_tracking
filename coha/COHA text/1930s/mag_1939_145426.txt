Christmas in pastoral Bessarabia is visiting time . This Christmas a bitter , blizzardy Rumanian winter swept down off the Carpathians but the quaint railway cars that spin from Kishinev down to Galatz , Braila and Bucharest were thronged with festive , gaily-cloaked peasants visiting from village to village . East of Galatz two holiday trains sped along the winding , single-track line in a blinding storm . Someone had blundered , for they were running head on toward each other . Near Reni they crashed . For hours the dying lay with the dead in the heaping snow while rescue trains ploughed through from Galatz . Late Christmas night the dead were counted at 80 , the wounded , 259 . <P> &gt; From the AffonsoArinos school at Bello-Horizonte , some 300 miles across the steep slopes of the Serra da Mantiqueira range from Rio de Janeiro , last week a boisterous troop of boys raced for the depot of the Central do Brazil railway . They clambered into the nine creaking wooden coaches and snuggled down for the ecstatic ride home for Christmas . Winding south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to Sao Paulo farms . <P> At Barbacena it began the laborious ascent of the single-track over the Manti-queiras . Near the town of Stio came catastrophe . Again , someone had blundered , for thundering down the mountain through signals came a heavily laden freight . Headlight to headlight the roaring freight and the snorting passenger train met . They disintegrated over the grade like kindling . Soon fire crackled through the broken sticks and torn bodies . <P> Three students were among the 59 dead , 15 of them among 66 wounded and dying . <P> &gt;More rugged than Brazil 's coastal slopes are the rocky volcanic upjuts that wall Mexico City . One rail route down to the Gulf at Veracruz skirts the hills around Tlaxcala , 45 miles east of Mexico City . One morning last week more than 1,000 Government employes and their families , off for a collective workers ' Christmas holiday , jammed their way into seven obsolete wooden , second-class cars , equipped inside with long , hard , wooden benches . Seven classier steel cars completed the train . Rounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke an axle , jumped the track and spilled all 14 coaches down the slope . Toll : according to press reports , 40 dead , 51 injured ; according to the Mexican Railway , four or five dead , 30 injured .
