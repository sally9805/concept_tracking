While Prime Minister Chamberlain 's policy of playing ball with Mussolini was receiving distrustful glances from France last week , it received its first nod of approval from the voters at home . In a parliamentary bye-election at Aylesbury , Bucks. , fought largely over Conservative Prime Minister Chamberlain 's foreign policy , the Conservative candidate , Sir Stanley Reed , won a comfortable victory over his Liberal and Laborite opponents . Sir Stanley polled 21,695 votes , the Liberal candidate 10,751 and the Laborite 7,666 . <P> The score on bye-elections held since the resignation of Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden two months ago now stands : two for the Opposition , one for the Government . The Opposition victories were hung up in West Fulham , outside London , and in Lichfield , onetime home of famed , blustering Dr. Samuel Johnson . In these contests , although Laborites and Liberals have rejected the idea of a " Popular Front " to oppose Prime Minister Chamberlain , the two parties fortunately managed to put but one candidate in the field . Last week anti-Chamberlain factions bewailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a united front would have meant little change in the result . The Conservative Party has long had the Aylesbury constituency under control .
