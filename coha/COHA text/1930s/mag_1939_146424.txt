To Cremona last week drove Premier Mussolini , interrupting his crop inspection long enough to judge an exhibition of paintings entered in a competition to illustrate one of two prescribed subjects . He saw 44 pictures depicting the " State of Mind Created by Fascism , " 79 pictures of " People Listening to a Radio Speech by Il Duce . " Apparently Il Duce did not like the way people listen to his radio speeches . He awarded no prizes in that category . To State-of-Mind-Painter Luciano Richetti , Il Duce gave $2,725 , congratulated him for showing " true Fascist spirit . "
