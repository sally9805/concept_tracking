Similar to the U. S. Book-of-the-Month Club is the Book Society of England , but its officials are frequently remiss in their labors . Without carefully reading the manuscript . Book Society officials picked for their May selection Coronation Commentary by Geoffrey Dennis , ordered 10,000 copies . The title was perfectly timed . Of the author , the officials knew that he was Editor &; Chief of the Document Service of the League of Nations Secretariat , well-versed in the history and procedure of the British Crown , author of many a forceful magazine article , and husband of a great-niece of Dante Gabriel Rossetti . They knew too that Author Dennis had been at Oxford with the Duke of Windsor , presumably liked him . <P> Most of Coronation Commentary was written by November 1936 . Two chapters , on the Abdication and the Coronation of George VI . were added later . When the book went on sale last week Book Society officials saw that they had approved the following remarks : <P> Of Mrs. Simpson : " For Queen of England King Edward had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-husbands living . . . . She came too far below , she clashed too crudely , with the nation 's idea and ideal , dream and myth of feminine royalty . . . . She would not do . The comedown from Queen Mary to Queen Wally was too steep . " <P> Of her friends : " They were as a rule no credit to the great country they had exploited and deserted , nor to the one in which they were now roistering and ruling . <P> . . . Their money could apparently buy everything . . . . Their accent was beginning to be an asset , even to the English themselves , in truly ' smart ' circles ; it was beginning-you listened in that night ? - to be heard in the voice of the young tribal God himself . . . . They were cock-a-hoop , and since Edward 's accession getting insolent and out-of-hand . There was but one more world to conquer . The first woman to sit in the ancient Commons was a divorced American. * why not then also- ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people alive , and that their native country had scornfully spewed forth , were closest around our King . " Of the Duke of Windsor : " Without base flattery , nobody I think could have called him artistically or intellectually gifted , nor have attributed to him a subtle , remarkable or especially interesting mind . ... At the age of 40 he had not heard of the great writer who was Charlotte Bront . . . . <P> He had no friends , rest he was incapable of . Violent exercise was , after his thirties , not stimulus enough . . . . <P> " Unfortunately . . . there were things done and said in his infatuation ; his lover 's prodigality ; his shrill King 's rage against those who denied her to him . In moments of recourse to other sources of courage as well . In hours of erratic or erotic obstinacy . Things left undone in his infatuation . Duty neglected . Papers curiously , neo-Kaiser-ishly annotated . ... Irregular hours , irregular habits , meddling . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
