Five Days in Decatur HAYWOOD PATTERSON has been found guilty again ? for the third time ? and for the third time has been sentenced to death . The other Scottsboro defendants are being tried and some of their cases will have been decided before these words appear in print . What has happened to Patterson is almost certain to happen to them . I am a Southerner and I know how the South feels about cases like this . We dislike criticism , it makes us furious when it appears in Northern newspapers , and we all have an impulse to defend " the honor of the South . " That impulse comes down to us from the Civil War . The honor of the South , however , may be defended in various ways . One way is the way it is being defended here in the courtroom at Decatur . Another is to get beyond the blur of our fixed ideas and settled convictions and admit that what is taking place here is cruel and tragic and unnecessary . I , as a Southerner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson 's trial . Here it is . It will be read by many Southerners . It is to them , especially , that I would like to say : " This iswhat is happening in Decatur . This is what is happening to the honor of the South . " Monday. ? It takes a long time to get a jury , but finally one is selected . Ten of them are farmers , one is a house-painter , one owns a small store . Most of them have gray hair . Their faces are tanned and deeply wrinkled , not intelligent or unintelligent , typical faces of the deep rural South . Each one of them , under questioning , has declared he has no prejudice against the Negro . Each has said this under oath and men in the deep rural South take oaths on the Bible very seriously . They are sure they are telling the truth , they would not deliberately lie after swearing on the Bible , but perhaps they do not know what a prejudice means . They have no prejudice against the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Negro is black and behind them lies the distinction which has prevailed in the South for over a hundred years . They have no prejudice against the Negro , but the Negro belongs to a lower class and smells bad and has a black skin and is one of the punished sons of Ham . After the jury is seated , judge Callahan slaps his band on the bench and calls for the first witness . judge Callahan 's name is William Washington Callahan . He looks the way a Hollywood producer thinks a Southern judge should look . He has thinning silver hair which stands up straight when he runs his lingers through it and broad shoulders and wears silver-rimmed spectacles . He is given to making caustic remarks , most of which are directed at Samuel S. Leibowitz , New York attorney for the defense . Once , after a verbal clash , he tells Mr. Leibowitz to sit down . Mr. Leibowitz starts to answer but the judge cuts him short . " Sit down , Mr. Leibowitz ! " The New York lawyer obeys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callahan slaps violently on the bench several times and tells the crowd he wants none of that foolishness . The laughter subsides but there are running undertones of conversation . " He ai n't goin ' to stand for none of that New York smart stuff . " " We got us a man on the bench this time . " " He ai n't goin ' to be free-'n ' - easy like Judge Horton . " Judge Horton is the judge who presided over the Scottsboro trial here in Decatur last spring . It was he who declared a mistrial in the case . He did not gain any popularity by doing so . The Alabama general elections are to be held next May . Judge Horton , who has not been opposed for years , will have two aspirants running against him . His defeat is taken for granted . Judge Callahan is also running for reelection . There are many voters in the courtroom and there is more feeling against the Jewish lawyer from New York than there is against the Negro boys . Tuesday. ? The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being cross-examined by the Jewish lawyer from New York . Mrs. Price , who accuses the Scottsboro boys of having raped her in a gondola car while she and a companion , Ruby Bates , were on a hobo trip , is a young woman in her early thirties . She looks much older . She has a hard , bitter face and her accent is strikingly Negroid . She is known to be a prostitute . She came into the courtroom chewing gum , but before she took the witness stand she spit her gum upon the floor . She wears a hat with a seductive half-veil but more than a half-veil is needed to make her seductive . Victoria Price hates Samuel Leibowitz . There are moments when , answering his questions , her lips retract themselves over her teeth in a snarl . Leibowitz forces her to describe her condition after the alleged attack . She says she was hit with the butt of a pistol , punched in the face , thrown by savage hands , torn and bleeding . Leibowitz hurls questions at her , revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising rage and glaring eyes . Leibowitz asks Judge Callahan to instruct the witness to answer with more respect . Judge REPUBLIC Callahan tells Leibowitz to trea ? the witness wiritt more respect . A murmur of approval rises front-the courtroom . Victoria Price is a prostitute , every man in the courtroom knows this is true , but Leib ? . witz is a Jewish lawyer from New York . During the course of the cross-examination , as Victoria Price flounders more and more helplessly in the mire of her own making , unable to remember what she said a moment before , she frequently glances toward Attorney-General Thomas E Knight , Jr. , for assistance . Mr. Knight is a young man but he has already gone far in politics . He is ambitious to go farther . In the May elections he will run for Lieutenant-Governor . Leibowitz undertakes to show that on the night before the alleged attack occurred , Victoria Price and Ruby Bates spent the night and had sexual in tercourse with two white men in the hobo jungles outside of Chattanooga . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of eight boys . The facts are not denied and in the trial before Judge Horton this evidence was allowed to be introduced into the official record . But Knight rises to object . He bases his objection on the grounds that the evidence is. immaterial . " Objection sustained , " drones Judge Callahan . Leibowitz , doggedly determined , makes a second effort to introduce the evidence . Again Knight objects . Again Callahan sustains the objection . " I have warned you , Mr. Leibowitz , not to try to place illegal evidence before the jury . Do n't try to do it again ! " Judge Callahan is not going to support a New York Jew against the Attorney-General of the state of Alabama . Not that Tommy Knight needs anybody to take care of him . No , sir . Tommy Knight can take care of himself . Alabama needs men like Tommy Knight . He 'll make a good Lieutenant-Governor . Yes , sir ! Tuesday Night. ? This is the first night session of the trial . Judge Callahan is keeping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness stand . His woolly hair is slicked down and he is dressed in a purple sweater , a white shirt and a pair of brown trousers . He is very black . It is said of him that he looks like a bad nigger . In the South some Negroes are said to look like good niggers and some are said to look like bad niggers . It is impossible to describe what makes one Negro look like a bad nigger and another look like a good nigger , but the distinction is there . Patterson tells his story very simply . He was oil the train , he and the other Negroes got into a fight with some white boys , he helped drive the white boys off the train ? but he did not attack any women . He did not know any white women were on the train . He knew nothing about a rape . " If I had , " he says , " I 'd of gotten off the train . " The state subjects him to a severe cross-examina ? tion but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is none of the lurid involved conN of the elsborafe melodrama recited by Victor ice and the other star witness of the site , Orville Gilley , self-announced poet and reciter poetry , hobo and bum and wandering troubador , Carolina Slim . Some of the other boys take the stand . The first is Willie Robinson . Willie is the type of Negro called in the South an ape . It is better , however , to look like an ape than it is to look like a bad nigger . There is something comic about a Negro who looks like an ape . Willie has a hanging lower lip that bares his under teeth and a wild shock of bushy hair . His story is even more simple than that of Patterson . He was in a box-car on the train and did not leave it until he was taken by the posse at Paint Rock , where the train was stopped . He knew nothing about a rape nor could he have participated in a rape even if he had wanted to . He says he was suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a bad way . " Willie is followed by Ozey Powell and Olin Montgomery and Andy Wright . Powell 's story is also simple : he was on the train , he saw the fight but did not take part in it , he saw no white girls and knew nothing about a rape . Olin is almost blind . One eye is out and the other is very weak . He can not see five feet ahead . He walks blindly to the witness stand , stumbling over a chair . " Noss* Ah did n't see no white girls . Ah knowed dere was a fight , Ah could hear de boys yellin ' , but Ah did n't do nothin ' to no white girls . " Andy Wright is still a young boy . He always seems to be smiling but he is not really smiling . When he was first arrested and taken to the Scottsboro jail , one of the guardsmen who was suposed to help protect him from the mob jabbed him in the cheek with a bayonet . The wound is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound healed it so contracted his cheek that he always seems to be smiling . " Yessuh , I was in the fight . I did n't do much fightin ' myself because I had mah lil brother to take keer of , but I was in the car whar the fight was goin ' on . Nossuh , I did n't see no white girls . I did n't see them ontil they took us off the train at Paint Rock . Nossuh , I did n't do nothin ' to no white girls . 1 was jist in a rock-fight , that 's all . " The crowd pushes its way from the courtroom and goes down the stairs . Outside it is colder . A man smoking a corncob pipe takes the pipe from his mouth and says to a group of companions . " I been around niggers all my life and I can allus tell when a nigger is lyin ' . Them boys ai n't . It 'd take more than 's been shown against them to make me send them to the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen nose and a cut lip and a wound on her forehead , she says she was bleeding from her vagina , but Dr. Bridges says he found only a few scratches on her wrist , which could have been caused a hundred different ways , and two small blue spots on her back . Somebody is lying and it is not Dr , Bridges , and a woman is not raped by six Negroes with only a few scratches on her wrist and two small blue spots on her back to show for it . Dr. Bridges has also testified that he found signs which indicated that Victoria Price had recently had sexual intercourse . He made it very clear , however , that such signs did not mean that she had been raped . It might easily be , although this the doctor did not say , that she had spent the night before with a white man ? perhaps in the jungles just outside of Chattanooga . It is well known that she did , witnesses are in the courtroom to testify to it , but his learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not legal evidence , that it has no bearing on the case . The arguments began yesterday afternoon . Mr. Wade Wright made the first speech and H. G. Bailey , the Scottsboro solicitor who acted as prosecutor during the original trial , followed him . Mr. Wade Wright is a youngish man but is paunchy and has a sagging double chin . He started off in a conversational tone but in a few minutes he was bellowing . His words bounced back from the walls like tennis balls . For his text he took the words Victoria Price said were spoken by Haywood Patterson when the Negroes piled into the car in which she was riding : " All you white sons-of-bitches unload . " These words , said Mr. Wright , showed that the whole affair was a premeditated crime . He talked to the jurors in their own language . He made numerous references to God Almighty and talked about the worst crime ever committed under God 's shining sun . The folks said , after the session , that it was one of the best talks Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . gray hair , gray eye , gray eyebrows , gray clothes . There even seems to be a grayish pallor to his skin . He also began with the line about white sons-of-bitches . He repeated it several times . Gradually the point was getting home , gradually the meaning behind the words was sinking into the jurors ' minds . White sons-of-bitches . White sons-of-bitches . The Negroes had not said Mister or Miss . They had not even said white-folks . They had said white sons-of-bitches . " I do n't care what they say about Victoria and Ruby , let them say what they want , but instead of painting their faces and standing on the streets of Huntsville , they were brave enough to go to Chattanooga and look for honest work . They are not as fortunate as some girls . . . not petted and pampered and raised in the lap of luxury . . . but women , gentlemen of the jury , women . " They say this is a frame-up ! They have been yelling frame-up ever since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame them ? Did Brother Hill frame them ? We did a lot of awful things over there in Scottsboro , did n't we ? My , my , my . And now they come over here and try to convince you that that sort of thing happened in your neighboring county . " Samuel Leibowitz opened the argument for the d , : 2 Mr. Leibowitz is a brilliant lawyer and his handling of the case under the rulings of a hostile judge is something to be marveled at , but he is a Jew and lives in New York . His plea to the jury was a masterpiece of orderly logic and legal design . He examined the evidence in detail and showed how impossible it was for Victoria Price to have been attacked . He indulged in but little sound and little fury . He ripped no passions to tatters . He made no speech . The crowd began to leave during his argument like the audiences during the last act of a vaudeville show . This morning Mr. George W. Chamlee , the Chattanooga attorney who so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , resumed for the defense . Mr. Chainlec knows the South and knows its language . As he stands before the jury , waving his hands in a slightly fluttering gesture peculiar to him , the en- ? tire courtroom listens to what he has to say . Mr. Chamlee is a Southerner and knows only too well what has happened . His simple and homely eloquence , his sincere plea for an acquittal , is like a cool wind blowing across inflamed minds . Attorney-General Knight follows Mr. Chamlee , however , and what has been cooled is inflamed again . The jurors say they are not prejudiced , they have sworn it on the Bible , but in their minds are coiled all the old images of distrust and suspicion and fear . Again the line is heard : " All you white sons-of-bitches unload . " The jury understands now . It has all been made very clear to them . judge Callahan slaps on the desk and begins to charge the jury . His charge lasts for over an hour . One of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price as reported by Dr. Bridges is to be taken as an indication of rape . He is so engrossed in telling the jury how to find the defendant guilty that he completely forgets to tell them what to do in case they find him innocent . Friday. ? The courtroom has been crowded every day now since Monday and the air is thick and vile . There is the smell of old perspiration and old tobacco smoke and the heavy smell of muddy brogans . The jury has been out almost twenty-five hours . The court is trying to select a jury for the second trial , that of Clarence Norris . At five o'clock exa , aly there is a loud knock on the door of the room in which the jury has been deliberating . When the jury files out and lines up before the judge 's bench it is so still you can hear a radio playing in a house across the street . The foreman of the jury hands the clerk a slip of paper on which the verdict is written . The clerk reads it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Punishment ie fixed at d The silence persists . Mr. Chamlee turns hit h toward the Patterson boy , who sits with uncha expression in a chair against the wall . Mr. Cha whispers something to him and Patterson =SW with a timid smile . You can still hear the radi playing . You can hear it until Judge Callahan 's voice blots it out . He is thanking the jurors for their services in the name of justice and the State of Alabama .
