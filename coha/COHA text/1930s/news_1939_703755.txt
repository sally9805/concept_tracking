txt A committee of cotton producers yesterday asked Congress to appropriate funds for a supplementary $1.000.000,000 farmaid program designed to enable farmers to receive parity prices for their products . The recommendations , which had already been made to farm administration officials last week , were brought out in an informal meeting between members of the growers ' committee and senators and representatives from cotton - producing states . Specifically , the committee asked for a program designed to achieve parity prices for cotton farmers which would entail an appropriation of approximately $400,000.000 . A comprehensive program to achieve the same end for other agricultural products  --  a program that has the support of the cotton group  --  would involve an appropriation of approximately $1.000,000,000 , committee members said . Processing Tax " Last Resort " Congressional representatives at the meeting insisted upon the point that some means for raising funds for a higher agricultural appropriation would have to be found before the funds could be voted . Cotton planters said that they regarded a processing tax as " a last resort ' but that they would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . C. G. Henry , of the Mid-South Cotton Growers Cooperative Association , who was chairman of the committee , said tnat his group had been summoned to Washington by officials and asked to explain " what we thought would cure the situation . " The committee 's recommendations , Mr Henry said , were aimed at the achievement of two major ends . The first is to recreate farmer purchasing power through a program that will bring to the producer the difference between market prices and parity prices . This would involve a billiondollar appropriation for all farm products ? $400.000.000 for cotton growers alone . The second major aim is to reduce cotton surpluses now held by the government . To achieve this end . the committee offered three proposals : First , that Congress relPase about 1,500,000 bales of government-held cotton to be diverted into Secretary Wallace 's proposed . ty-product manufacturing , such as cotton mattresses , road building material , etc . Supplementary Acreage Reduction Second . that cotton planters be permitted to make a supplementary voluntary reduction of acreage for which they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind or in certificates from a pool which would be set up for the purpose . To qualify for these benefits , farmers would be required to plant acreage taken out of cotton with sod-improving crops . Third , that farmers be allowed to repossess cotton held by the Commodity Credit Corp under the loan program at a price 30 points under the market price . The commodity corporation would thus lose the difference between the amount of the loan and the resale price . The question of tax schemes to finance a higher agricultural appropriation was first raised when Senator Connally , ( Dem. , Texas ) said " it has been my thought we would have to come to processing taxes . " Later in the meeting , Senator.Bankhead , ( Dem. , Ala. ) . said " if I had my way , I would put an excise tax on manufacturers . " As for the Agricultural Adjustment Act , the committee recommended that certain changes in operation of the act would be necessary but that these could be effected through administrative rulings and that the statute should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the loan program . The only amendments recommended by the committee were for the purpose of reducing surplus stocks held by the government .
