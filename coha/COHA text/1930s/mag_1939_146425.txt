David Low 's first published cartoon was printed in a New Zealand paper in 1902 , when he was eleven years old . It represented the local authorities as lunatics because of their reluctance to remove certain trees that obstructed traffic . Ever since that time he has pictured himself as a " nuisance dedicated to sanity . " His definition of sanity embraces a good many statesmen and policies : Benito Mussolini , Adolf Hitler , armament races , Nonintervention , and Prime Minister Neville ( Chamberlain 's political " realism . " Some of the personages scared by his corrosive brush have had good reason to regret that young David did not become a bishop as his mother wished , instead of becoming the world 's deadliest political cartoonist . <P> After free-lancing in New Zealand and Australia , David Low went to England in 1919 , where he drew for the London Star ' until 1927 , when Lord Beaverbrook hired him for his Evening Standard . There he has ever since made fun of his employer 's arch-conservative opinions . This month , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of David Low 's work , with an explanatory text by Quincy Howe ( author of England Expects Every American To Do His Duty ) , is to be published in the U. S.* Covering the hectic years of 1932-39 , most of the car toons have kept their timeliness surprisingly well . His interpretation of the " Open Door , " drawn in 1934 , anticipated by five years Japan 's present at tempt to drive foreign interests out of China , an eventuality which the British Government at that time thought highly improbable . The drawing of the gorged wolves appeared on Dec. 2 , 1938 , shortly after Polish troops occupied Teschen , completing the post-Munich occupation of Czecho-Slovak territory . The Spanish dancers were drawn last February when France and Great Britain were preparing to recognize the Franco Government . <P> Cartoonist Low is a unique combination of a student of contemporary politics and a superb draughtsman . A passionately sin cere democrat , he is also a hard worker . <P> He begins the day at 8 o'clock , digesting thoroughly the daily papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , and his two young daughters threshing out the news . After breakfast he walks to his roomy , book-lined studio where with much pacing and squirming and pipe-smoking , he struggles to express a complex idea in a few vivid lines and a brief , usually wry , caption . The final drawing is done rapidly with a fine brush . <P> How Artist Low got that way politically is not hard to explain . He recalls that he became " socially conscious " at 19 , when he went from deeply socialistic New Zealand to deeply laborite Australia . But for all his savage conviction , he is still a sly humorist . The words he puts in the mouth of his most famous cartoon creation , globular , mustached Colonel Blimp , archtype of the Tory diehard , are an acid parody of Conservative thought . Sample : " Come , come , let 's be fair to Franco . <P> Let 's assume he is a great Christian gentle man , prepared to doublecross his Italian and German friends without the slightest hesitation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cartoonist 's conception of himself .
