 | The Cult of Ugliness Condensed from Today and Tomorrow ( January , Myfanwy I. Caw.rhay There is every likelihood that this age will go down to history as the ugliest . Generations to come will have plenty of opportunity for proving how little we cared for beauty when they consider what we produced in the way of music , books , sculpture any of the things to which one looks to discover the esthetic side of a nation 's life . Also that we were dishonest in our appreciations may not escape the student of the future who examines some of the work we have acclaimed . Our toleration of the unbeautiful will seem all the more surprising when it is reviewed in conjunction with certain achievements which grace these times the dignity and harmony of line in some of the new architecture , the victory over drabness in certain aspects of life inside and outside the home , in town planning , in a few worth-while books , in a very few lovely musical works . For so long the principle underlying the creative artist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are startled by a new production we are afraid to praise it . Obvious beauty , such as beauty of melody , undistorted form in drawing , simple clean themes in a novel , unaffected ideas , quiet color , is not to be readily praised unless one is willing to admit that one is a lowbrow and few of us are willing to do that . The Victorian Age had ugliness how we have sneered at it but it was infinitely less aggressive than ours . Much of its music was sugary and its furnishing a strange mixture of stiffness and fussiness . But no picture from the past can compare in restlessness and garishness with some of our interior schemes and decorations . Clumsy furniture all straight lines and no nonsense " which eliminates all ornament and soft curves , hangings of hard bright color in a gigantic pattern , a picture or two in cold color which no one can understand without the artist 's explanation , ceilings , doors , and window-frames all showing the same stark colorings , are poor alternatives to the quiet details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no crime to be dull if one wanted to be so . But our despising sentimentality , dullness and stiffness has put a burden upon  | us ; it is terribly wearing to be continually as bright and as hard as polished metal . Tinkly love songs , wax fruit , and stiff-backed chairs have gone which would be all to the good , no doubt , if the broom had stopped there . But it did n't : it also swept away the restfulness of unobtrusive color in rooms , soft lines in furniture , the mellow tones of old china , old prints , old carpets . Few of us really admire the crudeness and the blatancy which characterizes so much of modern life ; but to condemn blatancy is to condemn ourselves as out of date . So we withhold condemnation when we see ugliness and wait until its creator defends it as he is prepared to do sooner or later , since he knows that he has struck across tradition and perhaps across decency . He ( or she ) will tell us , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is little to understand in it except that it is ugly . When someone hails it as an achievement in " a new manner " we do not dare to treat it with contempt . When someone still bolder sees in it a return to some very early form the last shred of disapproval slips from us . Did not Epstein stop the wail which went up when his " Night " and other Underground Building figures came into view by talking about the influence of ancient art form ? The man in the street has not the time and inclination to trace the connection between the new and the old if there is one and stays quiet before this accusation of ignorance . Our lack of sincerity about our likes and dislikes makes it easy for the creators of ugliness to " get away with it . " We are afraid to say frankly , " This means nothing to me ; I can find nothing pleasing in it " when a fresh hideous experiment is put before us . Both critics and patrons of art prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such words as " soul " and " rhythm , " " mood , " " sensitiveness " are used repeatedly without regard to sense , rather than judge them by the effect produced on the heart and conscience . Why do we tolerate hideous sculpture , noisy , untuneful music , garish painting , indecent books , and crude decoration ? One of the reasons is that we mistake experimentalism for progress and lack of self-control for originality . Where was the crowd densest at the last Royal Academy exhibition ? Not round the few lovely pictures that depicted life as we know it , but round some of the ugliest portraits in this or any recent exhibition . A famous actress looking as if she had been put under a steamroller was a great attraction . No artist had yet conceived the idea of showing  | a fair lady at such a disadvantage . It was the " new manner " again and as such entitled to almost reverent attention . Recently I listened to the first performance of a nervy , almost meaningless , quite uninspired " tone-poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work came to an end can not be explained . I glanced at my neighbor , a young man in a cricket shirt open at the neck : he had the impassioned look that I have noticed on the faces of American baseball enthusiasts when a favorite team has won . He was clapping , I feel sure , not the work , but the audacity of the man who had put his heel on accepted form and offered a joke with perfect gravity . That it was a joke I , too , had decided halfway through the performance . That some of the new sculptors and painters are laughing at us I am equally sure . I can name at least half a dozen books produced in recent months which have had enormous sales where the mark of the joker is as plain as a pikestaff . When our host takes us into his newly decorated rooms and shows us a jumble of stark colors on ceiling , walls , and furniture and talks about the Idea behind the scheme , the effect of Color on Health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explains why that shapeless piece of furniture he has just bought is going to rank more highly than Chippendale in years to come , we match our mood to his and nod gravely . Really we ought to laugh before the first impression , which is that it is very ugly , has faded . The danger to the spirit which is the result of surrounding ourselves with unbeautiful things is very great . The cult of ugliness is growing among us like a disease and seems all the more deplorable when the remarkable energy and striving of this generation is considered . Never before has there been so strong an urge for expression . In all the arts there are signs of tremendous interest a reaching out for new ideas , for new forms , for a wider influence . People want to know more , to feel more , to embrace more culture . The creative artist is making the most of his chances ; he would rather have a quick , superficial success than build up a permanent reputation . Until there is more conscience behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness things will go on getting uglier . A gloomy reflection .
