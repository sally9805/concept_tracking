Twoscore Army posts throughout the land last week found themselves on the defensive , fighting for their political lives . Anxious to economize for deficit reasons , President Hoover had picked the Army as his first big target ( TIME , May 18 ) . He knew he could not reduce the fighting force below its 118,000 men without encountering violent public objections . He did not want to retrench on river &; harbor improvements and flood control because they were essentials of his Unemployment relief program . Therefore he selected as the most likely bull's-eye for economy some of the Army 's 340 forts , garrisons , depots , camps , hospitals , flying fields and arsenals . To the country he issued a statement : " The General Staff has insisted for great numbers of years that the Army must be more largely concentrated . . . . We have actually abandoned 13 posts during the last two years. * The Staff probably will report between 20 and 30 more posts that should be abandoned ... if we are to accomplish some very considerable economies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandonments and see which of them could be used by other departments of the Government . . . . There are some of these posts that might be of very great value to the States for institutional purposes . It would relieve the feeling of deprivation of the local communities if these posts could be adapted to some other public purposes . We are endeavoring ... to create as little hardship as possible and will effect economies in many direction. , . " Well aware was President Hoover of the political battles his proposal invited . The War Department was swamped with inquiries from anxious and excited Congressmen as to whether this or that Army post was to go . A garrison , no matter how old or useless , in his district is a great feather in the political cap of any Representative . Supplies are bought in his community . Soldiers spend their pay among his constituents . Troops are on hand for all local celebrations . So tenaciously have Senators and Representatives fought for their Army posts that , as a group , they have succeeded in blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite President Hoover 's earnest effort to economize , War Department realists expected little to result . The upkeep of all Army posts is only $20,695,990 and the abandonment of 40 of them , even if Congress consented , would save only about $2,000,000 , a small drop out of a billion-dollar bucket . Coast artillery posts may be chopped but the War Department has up its sleeve as a defense substitute a $100,000,000 program for 14-in. railroad guns firing from 100 shorepoints . Cavalry stations may go but the cost of mechanizing that service with $75,000 " combat cars " instead of horses will wipe out any saving . <P> * Of these nine were abandoned , four made inactive . Of the abandoned stations five were flying fields and two outside the continental U. S.
