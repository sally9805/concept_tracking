Time : Late Summer . About four o'clock in the morning . Place : A corner of a private room in a smart caf in Paris . At Curtain : Four people are at the table  --  HIPPOLITUS LOMI  --  EMMIE SYKES  --  RONALD DERBYSHIRE and LUCILE LINGARD . LUCILE  --  who is Mrs. Charles Lingard of Dubuque , Iowa  --  is thirty-five  --  a very beautiful woman  --  slender and delicately lovely  --  and she is now wearing one of her new French evening gowns and looking extremely smart and distinguished . EMMIE SYKES  --  Lucile 's friend with whom she has come to Europe  --  is also from Dubuque . EMMIE is forty-five and very young indeed  --  pretty in a round eyed , baby sort of way . She too is now wearing her new finery . RONALD DERBYSHIRE is twenty-nine  --  a tall , good-looking Englishman  --  a writer with one successful novel to his credit  --  a few poems and sketches . RONALD is shy  --  sensitive  --  impressionable and full of ideals . HIPPOLITUS LOMI is sixty  --  small  --  dark  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an inheritance of many backgrounds  --  a suave old boy having lived through everything and everybody who has come his way  --  and now looking for the next . " HIPPIE " is slightly bald and wears a monocle  --  quite obviously all that he is. p. 3 Both men are in full evening dress . As the curtain rises the Maitre d'hotel passes through the room pausing for a moment to look over the table carefully and goes out at Left . A waiter is placing a champagne cooler beside the table . Dance music is heard at intervals throughout the scene . Only scraps of the conversation are heard for a moment after the curtain rises . EMMIE ( as HIPPIE fills her glass ) Why do I like it when it 's the only thing that gives me a headache the next morning ? You must n't let me take too much , will you ? LOMI ( speaking with a slightly Latin accent ) How much is too much ? EMMIE When I begin to believe everything you say to me  --  that 's much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are getting more charming every minute . ( LUCILE sings a little to the music as RONALD bends close to her . ) RONALD There it is . The one I danced with you first . LUCILE How divinely you dance , Ronnie ! RONALD Only with you . If I were dead I 'd hear that  --  and the same strange awful happiness would come back to me . LUCILE I know . Frightening  --  is n't it ? Happiness is terrifying . LOMI ( to the WAITER ) p. 4 Apportez une autre bouteille . Du mme . WAITER Oui , Monsieur . ( The WAITER goes out . ) EMMIE Did you order another bottle ? LOMI I took the liberty . EMMIE Do n't say liberty . Thank you . Keep on ordering .  --  Oh  --  I 'm going to miss all this when I get home . LOMI Why do you let yourself miss it ? Why do n't you keep it ? Why should you miss anything in the world ? When you have found what you want  --  it is yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nobody else does . LOMI You are a very foolish little darling . Why do n't you take what you want ? Why do n't you take me ? LUCILE Have n't you made up your mind about that yet  --  Emmie ? EMMIE I do n't have to make up my mind . I have n't got any . Oh dear  --  what time is it ? No  --  do n't tell me . I do n't want to know . Ten o'clock tomorrow that darned boat train leaves . That 's the worst of coming to Europe  --  you have to go home again . LOMI Poor Europe ! It is time for the American woman to go home again . You make us so gay with your pilgrimage to us  --  and then you set sail and leave us desole . Great fleets of you going back to your patient business men ! It is so strange that they let you come . If as many women went out of Europe every year and left their men  --  there would not be any men for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RONALD Something like that . LOMI The American man is not the world 's great lover . Is he Mrs. Lingard ? ( LUCILE does not hear  --  RONALD is talking to her. ) p. 5 If she belonged to me  --  do you suppose I would let her go three months away from me ? EMMIE Lucile  --  do you hear what Hippie is saying ? LUCILE I 'm sorry . LOMI Is the American man the world 's great lover , Mrs. Lingard ? LUCILE I 'm sure you are , Hippie . LOMI That is because I have so many kinds of blood in my veins . I understand all women . EMMIE Just what mixture are you , Hippie ? LOMI Oh  --  a little Viennese  --  a little Polish  --  and my mother 's father was a Turk . EMMIE It certainly does make you feel flat  --  to be just plain American through and through . LUCILE ( looking out through the archway into another room ) Look ! Do you think that woman at the table out there is American or French ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? LOMI She is French . LUCILE Why are you so sure ? LOMI By the look in her eyes . EMMIE Could you tell I 'm American ? LOMI At one glance  --  cherie  --  if I saw you in the moon . Show me a woman 's foot and I will tell you whether she is American or not . RONALD I think you can always spot an American man  --  but a distinguished American woman might be anything . The first time I saw Lucile I thought she was Russian . EMMIE I admit she looks a lot less like Iowa than when we left home  --  and I also know I look more so . ( They laugh at her affectionately. ) p. 6 I can hear Peggy now  --  " Oh , Mother  --  you 're too fat for those ear-rings . " What do you think , honestly ? LOMI You are not too fat for anything . ( Kissing EMMIE 'S fingers . ) EMMIE Do n't you think they make me look taller ? RONALD I do n't think anybody is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Emmie . ( The WAITER serves another bottle of champagne . ) EMMIE ( beaming at the WAITER ) Oh  --  Une autre  --  encore . WAITER Oui , madame . Madame desire la mme ? EMMIE Pardon ? WAITER ( almost without an accent ) Does madame wish the same kind ? EMMIE ( very carefully ) Oui . Et deux ou trois . Je ne suis pas sur encore . WAITER Oui madame . Certainement , madame . ( The WAITER goes out . ) EMMIE ( as the others laugh at her ) p. 7 It is n't true that it is n't necessary to speak French in Paris any more . I often find it very necessary . LOMI I find you very necessary . Why do you keep on torturing me ? You are cruel  --  cherie  --  a cruel little  --  EMMIE Now Hippie  --  do n't say that . You know it 's absolutely impos  --  LOMI No  --  I do not know it  --  and I do not believe it . RONALD ( to LUCILE ) You always are the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling . LUCILE It is n't true  --  but keep on saying it  --  so I can hear it for the rest of my life . RONALD You will . I 'm going to keep on saying it to you forever . LUCILE ( drawing away from him a little ) We 're losing our heads  --  we must n't . RONALD I 'm not losing mine . LUCILE It 's been so sweet  --  so sweet ! ( She closes her eyes . RONALD goes on talking to her  --  his lips close to her ear. ) p. 8 EMMIE ( rolling her eyes towards LUCILE ) Look at that . I ought to be chaperoning her  --  but it 's all I can do to take care of myself . LOMI Why do you make yourself so miserable ? Why do you feel so guilty when you are happy ? That is the most American thing about you . EMMIE Well  --  at least I have n't a husband . Lucile has you know . A perfectly good one . Though I do n't know but that a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought n't to lead my own life at all  --  you know  --  just hers . She thinks I ought to just revolve around her . ( The music is heard again . ) That 's why it 's so nice to come to Paris and revolve around myself for a change . ( She rises as HIPPIE rises to ask her to dance . ) Oooh ! I certainly am revolving around something now . LOMI Come and revolve with me . EMMIE I 'd love to . ( They move towards the entrance . ) Where is that American woman she was talking about ? I do n't see her . They all look alike to me . I do n't see any difference in anybody  --  and I hope nobody sees any difference in me . ( EMMIE laughs as HIPPIE takes her out. ) p. 9 RONALD ( to LUCILE ) Do you want to dance , dear ? LUCILE ( dreamily  --  her elbows on the table  --  her chin in her hands ) Not now . RONALD You 're going to tell him  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You promise that  --  do n't you ? LUCILE Ronald  --  we only have a few hours more  --  we must face the truth . RONALD That 's what we 're doing . You love me . Everything else is so unimportant . LUCILE But Charles is so good . How can I hurt him ? If we stop now  --  and keep this as a beautiful memory  --  RONALD Rot ! LUCILE We could . RONALD We did n't go after this you know . It came to us . Either it 's the most glorious thing that can ever happen to me  --  or nothing on earth is worth a damn . LUCILE But I ca n't believe you do love me like that , Ronnie . RONALD Why ca n't you believe it ? You mean something to me that no one else ever has . I 've never worked in my life as I have these last two months . If I have anything to say  --  you 'll make me say it . LUCILE Oh , darling ! That 's too marvelous . Me ? RONALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  inspiring , understanding . It is n't what you say  --  it 's what you make me feel . LUCILE That I should make a man of genius do better work ! That 's the most marvelous thing that can happen to any woman . It justifies our love  --  does n't it ? Makes it gloriously right  --  does n't it ? RONALD Of course . ( Kissing her shoulder. ) p. 10 LUCILE But  --  Ronald  --  it frightens me  --  a little . RONALD What does ? LUCILE All of it . My life 's been so quiet . There has n't been any of this in it . RONALD Any of me  --  you mean ? LUCILE Yes . RONALD Of course there has n't . And there has n't been any of you  --  in mine . LUCILE No one has ever known  --  what I might be  --  and how starving I am  --  to be  --  what I might be . And that you should know ! You 're so young dear . RONALD Twenty-nine . How old are you ? LUCILE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a weensie bit older than that . RONALD Then for every day and every hour that you are older  --  you 're just so much wiser and more wonderful than I am . LUCILE You darling ! ( She leans forward and kisses his lips impulsively  --  and then puts her arms on the table again with a sigh. ) p. 11 Everything that used to seem all right because I thought it had to be that way  --  is going to be horribly commonplace and ugly now . Beauty  --  beauty ! That 's what I want ! RONALD And you have so much beauty to give , Lucile . I do n't think you know what your voice might be . LUCILE I 've been awfully good  --  Ronnie . I have n't even flirted . You 're the little dream deep down in my heart come true . The little dream I 've never dared even whisper to myself . You 've given my soul wings . RONALD ( kissing her arm and holding her close ) You 're like a flower  --  unfolding to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of temptation ) What shall I do ? It 's so hard dear . RONALD I 'm coming over after you just as soon as my book is finished . LUCILE But that 's what you must n't do . RONALD But why ? LUCILE Wait . Wait till I come back here again . RONALD I 'm coming over to get you  --  decently  --  honestly . And in about three  --  or four weeks I 'll be  --  LUCILE ( as she hears EMMIE laugh ) p. 12 Be careful . They 're coming . I do n't want Emmie to know . She does n't dream how serious it is . ( EMMIE and HIPPIE come back . ) You did n't dance long . EMMIE You ca n't . Anybody who was moving at all was doing it on my feet . LOMI And disgustingly warm . We are going out for a little air . We are going for a little drive in the Bois . LUCILE What ? EMMIE Want to come ? We 'd love to have you . Would n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast someplace  --  our last breakfast together . LUCILE Oh no  --  I  --  I do n't think so . RONALD ( going to stand in the entrance and lighting a cigarette ) You go . That would be a lot of fun . EMMIE Go and see if my car is there , Hippie . You go with him , Ronnie . I want to speak to Lucile a second . Go and telephone to everybody  --  or something . LOMI Au revoir . RONALD I 'll come back in a few minutes . ( The two men go . ) EMMIE ( sitting at the table  --  opening her bag and taking out a handful of French bank notes  --  crushed together ) p. 13 It 's the bill ! You pay it . I could n't count it to save my life . ( Thrusting the bills into LUCILE 'S hands . ) LUCILE ( standing at the table as she straightens the bills ) Emmie , you ca n't go driving in the Bois with Hippie at this time of  --  EMMIE ( busy with her makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same boat . LUCILE Hippie ?  --  You ca n't let him . ( Beginning to count the bills . ) Fifty  --  one hundred  --  EMMIE I do n't know how I can help it . LUCILE He ca n't anyway  --  Three hundred . Without his passage  --  Four  --  and passport and everything . EMMIE He says he 's got ' em . LUCILE I do n't believe it .  --  Two thousand . How much did you think you had ? EMMIE That 's what I want you to find out . He says if I wo n't stay over here with him  --  he 's going over there with me . LUCILE Emmie Sykes  --  pull yourself together . ( Sitting again. ) p. 14 EMMIE Do n't preach to me  --  Lucile Lingard . If I went home and told all I know . LUCILE Told all you what ? EMMIE But I wo n't , dearie , do n't be afraid . LUCILE I have n't anything to be afraid of . EMMIE Not over here ! They do n't think anything of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does n't . But wait till you get home . I can see old Liberty now shaking her finger at me as we sail in  --  " Now , Emmie  --  you 've had a good time  --  settle down and behave yourself . " LUCILE ( moving closer to EMMIE ) Look at me . You have n't done anything you 'll be sorry for ? EMMIE No  --  but I may have left undone things I 'll be sorry for . That 's what I do n't know . That 's what I 'm not sure of . LUCILE What do you mean ? EMMIE Oh  --  stop that virtuous pose with me  --  Lucile  --  and own up . Now if you have  --  or you have n't  --  do n't you think it would have been better if you had ? Better to just have an out and out affair with Ronnie  --  let him be your  --  you know  --  while you 're about it  --  and you 'd go back to Charlie a great deal more contented . LUCILE Emmie ! You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what you 're thinking . We are n't used to talking about it at home . Europe lets you out  --  and makes you real . Do n't you suppose I know how you 've been arguing with yourself  --  up and down and sidewise ? LUCILE You do n't  --  EMMIE You 're flattered to death that a man does want you to be bad . You bet I am . It 's been so long since a man has thought I could be bad  --  that I 'm made over . And I do n't mind telling you that I 'm just as confused as I can be  --  over here  --  as to what is good and bad . If I were going to stay over here I honestly think I 'd just take a castle or something and live in it a while with him  --  and Peggy would never know anything about it . LUCILE Emmie  --  I did n't realize that you were in this kind of a  --  EMMIE Why should n't I have some fun ?  --  I 'm not as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in me . Things I 'd forgotten I had  --  have come out . I 'm darned sick of just being Peggy 's mother . Hippie says I have great individuality of my own  --  and real allure . And I have  --  too . I can feel it myself  --  over here . And I can also feel it freezing up like that  --  the minute I get off the boat . ( Beginning to cry a little. ) p. 15 I 'm lonely  --  lonely  --  way down deep in the bottom of my soul . I want to live  --  and be loved  --  and understood  --  before I die .  --  Why should n't I ?  --  Why should n't I ? LUCILE But Emmie  --  you ca n't let yourself go like this . Life does n't let us off so easily . EMMIE Oh life  --  poppy cock ! You never were as good looking as you are this minute because a man is making love to you . You 've got twice the magnetism you have at home . No wonder you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Well  --  Hippie thinks I look things too . And I do  --  when I 'm with him . I 've got a man in love with me too  --  and it 's just as thrilling as yours is . Now  --  I 've told you everything . And if you do n't tell me  --  I 'll know . LUCILE There 's nothing for you to know . EMMIE I 'm the one who ought to be shocked . At least Hippie wants to marry me . I do n't care if it is partly for my money . He does want to marry me . He 's not just making love to me . And I 'm not a married woman . As least my husband 's perfectly dead . LUCILE Why do n't you marry Hippie then ? EMMIE How can I ? Peggy would act like the devil . She 's going to say he looks like something the cat had brought in anyway . LUCILE Listen Emmie  --  Ronnie does want to marry me . He loves me  --  deeply  --  marvelously . EMMIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce and marry him . I 'm so unhappy  --  and so happy  --  I do n't know what to do . ( Dropping her head in her hands with a sudden break. ) p. 16 EMMIE Well  --  let 's do it . I 'll marry Hippie  --  if you 'll marry Ronnie . LUCILE It 's not so easy as that . Now Emmie  --  promise me  --  with everything in you  --  you wo n't breathe a word of this to any living  --  EMMIE Of course I wo n't . What do you take me  --  LUCILE But you 're a sieve , Emmie . You know you are . You 'll have to be careful every  --  Here they are . ( RONNIE and HIPPIE come back . ) LOMI Your car is here , my dear . EMMIE ( rising ) Well  --  you were n't a second  --  were you . You can trust me , darling  --  wait and see . ( Bending over the table and kissing LUCILE 'S cheek warmly . ) Come on Hippie . When I see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time in Paris . ( EMMIE and HIPPIE go . ) RONALD ( moving a little towards LUCILE ) Is she going to marry him ? LUCILE ( standing at the Right end of the table ) p. 17 I almost wish she would . RONALD Does n't she know  --  it 's her money ? LUCILE Of course she does . Emmie 's nobody 's fool . But she also knows it 's herself too . Emmie has her own charm . You may think she 's sort of  --  I know what she seems to you  --  but at home  --  she 's a perfectly dignified woman . A devoted mother  --  and everything . But why should n't she want  --  even Emmie !  --  Oh  --  it 's so hard !  --  I actually do n't know what 's right and what 's wrong . I honestly wish I 'd never seen you at all , Ronnie . What am I going to do ? RONALD ( as he helps LUCILE put on her coat ) The greatest wrong we can do is to turn our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full tide as it comes to us  --  we 're rotten little quitters . LUCILE But  --  RONALD But !  --  But !  --  Have you just been amusing yourself with me this summer ? If you have  --  it will smash something in me  --  my faith in life . I 'll never write another word as long as I  --  LUCILE ( putting her hand on RONALD 'S cheek to make him look at her ) p. 18 You know I have n't . It 's been the most wonderful thing in my life . I want to meet it full tide too . RONALD Then why do you hesitate ? Are you going through with it  --  or not ? Are you going to tell him decently and honestly that you 're in love with somebody else ? ( LUCILE turns away from him . He goes to her . ) Is that too much to expect ? LUCILE ( quietly  --  breathlessly as she pulls on her long gloves ) I 'm going to tell him  --  decently and honestly . I know I owe it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you  --  I owe it to myself  --  I owe it to him  --  to be strong  --  and honest . RONALD You 'll tell him  --  the minute you 're alone with him  --  wo n't you ? LUCILE As soon as I can  --  Ronnie . It 's going to be awfully hard . Charles is so good . RONALD The first minute you 're alone with him .  --  Will you ? LUCILE I 'll try . RONALD Oh  --  ( Turning away  --  jealously  --  and throwing himself down at the table again . ) LUCILE ( going to him ) p. 19 But Ronnie  --  RONALD ( hitting the table with his fist ) Why do you say you 'll try ? LUCILE I  --  RONALD Either it 's over this minute for him and you  --  or it 's over for us  --  now  --  forever . LUCILE But  --  RONALD Will you ? LUCILE ( standing close to him  --  her hands on his arms ) Yes . RONALD At once  --  as soon as  --  LUCILE Yes ! RONALD That you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to marry me . LUCILE Yes . ( She bends down to him and kisses his lips in a long kiss . The music swells  --  the lights fade  --  as THE CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : Five weeks later . Five o'clock in the afternoon . Scene : The living room in the Lingard house in the country near Dubuque , Iowa . The room is large and cheerful  --  and comfortable . Not individual but with a general effect of good style and good taste . A combination of old English charm and American comfort . At Curtain : CHARLES LINGARD is walking about the room . He goes to the piano and opens it  --  looks critically at a bowl of purple asters on the piano  --  looks about the room and resumes his walk . CHARLES LINGARD is forty-five  --  medium sized and unremarkable  --  but he becomes good looking as his slow charm grows apparent in his self effacement and his wise tolerance . His smile illumes his face and reveals a rare sense of humor and great sweetness . There is dignity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has built the house  --  but that he has not built it for himself . After a moment CHRISTINE opens the hall door . CHRISTINE is a large middle aged Swedish woman  --  plain  --  austere  --  radiating reliability and soap . She wears dignified black . CHRISTINE ( speaking with a slight accent ) Everything all right , Mr. Lingard ? p. 21 CHARLES ( in a warm agreeable voice ) It looks right to me , Christine . Do you see anything wrong ? CHRISTINE You want the piano open , do you ? CHARLES Oh yes  --  Yes . CHRISTINE ( looking at the sofa which is before the window ) It seems to me she turns dat end of dis sofa a little furder dat way . CHARLES Think so ? CHRISTINE I am inclined to t'ink so  --  yes sir . CHARLES If you 're inclined Christine  --  you 're pretty sure to be right . Give it a push the way you think . CHRISTINE ( moving the couch a little ) It 's because she likes to see the garden from dis end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've given them up for today . It 's five o'clock now . Traveling by motor is very uncertain business  --  especially with Mrs. Sykes . She may have changed her mind again . CHARLES ( chuckling and taking three telegrams from his pocket ) I do n't think there 's anything to make her change her mind between here and Chicago . We have n't had another one of these things yet today . ( Reading . ) " Docked on time . Marvelous crossing . Leaving New York now . Home Thursday . Love from us both . " Number two  --  " Delayed in New York . Leaving now . Arrive Chicago Thursday . Dubuque Friday . " Number three  --  " Delayed in Chicago . Leaving now . Home this afternoon . " They must be on the last lap now . p. 22 CHRISTINE But if they had got into Dubuque this afternoon do n't you think Mrs. Lingard would have telephoned right out to the house ? CHARLES U  --  m  --  she might  --  and she might not . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hall . ) Come in  --  Wilbur . Come in ! ( WILBUR LINGARD is CHARLES 'S nephew . He is twelve  --  a slender boy with a sensitive intelligent face  --  shy  --  on guard ) CHRISTINE ( going to the door and turning to look at the flowers on the piano ) Excuse me , Mr. Lingard  --  are those fresh again today ? CHARLES Yes . ( CHRISTINE goes out , closing the door . ) WILBUR Where do you want me to be when she comes , Uncle Charles ? CHARLES I had n't thought of that . S'pose you just pop in there in my diggins  --  and stay till I send for you . ( CHARLES nods towards the library door and then looks slowly and tenderly at the room and everything in it . ) WILBUR ( after a pause  --  having looked at the room too ) It 's nice . p. 23 CHARLES The room  --  yes . But you have n't seen her in it yet . That changes it . You 'll see something happen . The flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The things you think are chairs and sofas will take on a kind of a  --  something you did n't know they had  --  when she sits on them . They stop being ordinary . Understand ? ( He looks keenly at WILBUR . WILBUR nods without speaking . ) I guess you do . If you do n't  --  you will . WILBUR Will she want me to call her Aunt Lucile ? CHARLES She may  --  and she may not . She does n't look like anybody 's aunt . Let it take care of itself . You see boy  --  the reason I have n't told her you were here  --  Hello Peggy ! ( PEGGY SYKES dashes in from the hall . PEGGY is nineteen  --  slender  --  clean cut  --  and pretty in a fresh healthy way . She is wearing sport clothes and has an open telegram in her hand . ) PEGGY This is the latest . ( Reading the telegram . ) " Meet me Lingard house . Staying tea . Bringing friend home with me . Showing country . Have champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat it ? CHARLES ( chuckling ) That accounts for the delays . p. 24 PEGGY " Bringing friend home with me . " I 'll bet my hat it 's some dame coming over to lecture or raise money for the cause  --  and working mother to a finish . Mother 's probably backing her  --  or some cute little thing like that . ( Going up to the fireplace and throwing the crumpled telegram on the hearth . ) Hello , Wilbur . How are you ? WILBUR Hello . PEGGY ( as CHARLES sits on the large couch near the piano ) Does Lucile know Wilbur 's here ? CHARLES ( giving her a quick signal of warning ) Not yet . PEGGY Mother 's got a cute little surprise waiting for her too . I 've parked Jake outside . ( Going to the hall door . ) You know Charlie  --  what you think about Jake is going to cut a lot of ice with mother  --  so mind you get in your good work at the go off . You do think he 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there 's a good deal of him . PEGGY And you think all there is of him is just right for me  --  do n't you ? p. 25 CHARLES I would n't be fool enough to think that . PEGGY Why not ? CHARLES To think any man is right for any woman ? What do you take me for ? PEGGY A peach . Just a peach ! ( She blows a very emphatic kiss and goes out  --  closing the door . ) CHARLES ( motioning to WILBUR to come to him ) I was going to say  --  the reason I have n't told her you were here  --  is that I did n't want her to associate you with your father in any way . She only saw him once  --  because  --  well  --  she 's the kind of person you want to keep unhappy  --  disagreeable things away from . But she knows he died this summer . I did write her that  --  and I thought it was better for her to just find you here . WILBUR ( standing before CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLES I mean this . I want her to get you in her own way  --  without my bungling it . And I want to pound this into you . I did n't ask you to come and stay with me because you 're my nephew  --  or because I thought it was my duty  --  or any of that nonsense . But because I took one look at you  --  and here we are . ( WILBUR turns to the fireplace  --  his back to CHARLES . ) I would have been lonely as hell rattling ' round this empty house this summer without you . ( WILBUR turns and shyly smiles at CHARLES  --  then goes and sits in the big chair at the Right of the fireplace . ) You have n't the faintest idea how lonely I would have been  --  because you do n't know what it is to be without her . So I 'm greatly in your debt . See ? p. 26 WILBUR You just say that because  --  ( Lowering his eyes . ) CHARLES ( rising and going to stand before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with you . It 's just an accident that he was your father . More of a one than being my brother . Brothers are nearer than fathers and children . You did n't know that  --  did you ? I did n't either till a scientific fella told me the other day . But what I 'm getting at is  --  that you 're on your own  --  and you 're somebody everybody is going to like . WILBUR Will she ? CHARLES The joke is you wo n't know whether she does or not  --  you 'll get such a kick out of liking her . CHRISTINE ( opening the hall door  --  excitedly ) They 're here , Mr. Lingard . ( CHRISTINE goes  --  leaving the door open . ) CHARLES In there boy  --  quick . ( He hurries WILBUR into the library and closes the door . As he turns back  --  LUCILE comes in from the hall . ) LUCILE ( stopping just inside the door ) Charles ! ( She hesitates an instant and then goes to him . He closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face  --  her throat. ) p. 27 CHARLES ( in a husky voice ) Sweetheart ! ( She puts her head against him  --  crying a little . ) You 're here ! Let me look at you . LUCILE ( with a fluttering excitement ) I 'm a fright from the wind . We 've driven like mad to get here . CHARLES What 's happened to you ? LUCILE Nothing . What do you mean ? CHARLES I 've never seen you so  --  You 're more beautiful than ever . LUCILE It 's my hat . Emmie 's here too . CHARLES Kiss me . ( She kisses his lips lightly . He holds her close and kisses her again and again . ) Are you glad to be home dearest ? LUCILE Do n't be foolish ! What a dreadful old tie . Why are n't you dressed up for me ? I 've brought you some beauties . ( She touches his coat and his tie  --  avoiding his eyes . ) CHARLES I ca n't believe you 're here . Are you ? LUCILE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  restlessly  --  excitedly . ) And it 's all just the same  --  is n't it ? p. 28 CHARLES Is it ? ( Devouring her with his eyes as she moves about . ) LUCILE ( looking at the flowers on the piano ) And the asters ! What have you done to them , Charles ? CHARLES They 've been getting more purple by the minute since they knew you were coming . LUCILE ( going up to the mantel ) Bless their hearts  --  the darlings . ( She puts her hands on the mantel then moves towards the piano  --  touching the furniture as she goes . ) It 's all so comfortable  --  and American .  --  Is n't it . Is it in tune ? Yes  --  beautifully . ( Playing a strain as she stands . ) CHARLES It 's almost worth letting you go  --  to have you come back . LUCILE ( looking at him intently ) But you 're looking awfully well  --  Charles . You ca n't pretend you 've been lonely . Can you ? You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with his slow smile ) Oh yes . The clock just stopped that 's all . Now it 's begun again . p. 29 LUCILE You 're a funny old dear . ( They look deeply at each other . CHARLES ( very quietly ) God ! What if something had happened to you ? LUCILE ( starting towards the hall ) We must call Emmie . CHARLES ( stopping her ) How is Emmie ? LUCILE Emmie 's marvelous . She 's bought everything in Paris . There is n't a thing left . But Charles  --  you must be awfully sweet to her now  --  kind . CHARLES What 's the matter with her ? LUCILE You do n't know Emmie . CHARLES I 've only known her twenty years . LUCILE ( with a rising excitement she tries to conceal ) That 's just it . You think you know her too well  --  to really know her at all . CHARLES Un ? LUCILE ( standing close to CHARLES ) You 're so close to her  --  you take her for granted . There 's another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't understand that are the most important . Try to understand her Charles . p. 30 CHARLES I should have said if there 's one thing in life I do understand it 's Emmie . LUCILE You see  --  you think she 's just what you think she is . There are all sorts of things about her that I did n't know . Depths that you 'd never dream of . CHARLES Now do n't tell me Europe has stirred up hidden depths in Emmie . LUCILE Of course , if you 're going to be funny about her  --  ( Moving away from him and taking off her coat . ) EMMIE ( coming in quickly from the hall ) I 've come home too  --  you know , Charlie . You might at least come and speak to me . Pig ! CHARLES ( opening his arms to EMMIE ) Hello  --  Emmie ! Hello  --  hello ! How are you ? ( They kiss with intimate affection . ) It 's great to have you back . Is this Emmie ? You look like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) EMMIE ( looking at LUCILE ) Have you told him ? LUCILE ( startled ) Told him what ? p. 31 EMMIE About Hippie . CHARLES About what ? EMMIE Hippie . CHARLES What 's that ? LUCILE ( smiling  --  relieved and sitting on the couch near the piano at Left ) Emmie has a friend with her . CHARLES Oh yes  --  the friend . Where is she ? EMMIE It 's not a she . CHARLES What is it then ? EMMIE He  --  he ! He 's a he ! CHARLES No ! EMMIE Why should n't I have a he friend ? CHARLES ( with a glance at LUCILE ) Hidden depths ? ( To EMMIE . ) Where is he then ? EMMIE ( sitting in the chair by the sofa at Right ) I 've left him with Peggy and that awful boy she 's got with her  --  and she 's poisonous . She 's behaving just exactly the way I knew she would  --  only worse . Go and get him away from her , Charles . p. 32 CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Snapping her bag open and shut excitedly . ) LUCILE ( laughing ) His name is Hippolitus Lomi . CHARLES I beg your pardon . EMMIE Well , that 's better than Jake something . LUCILE Go and bring them all in here Charles . EMMIE And we 're staying for tea . I 'm not going to be alone with Peggy till she gets used to Hippie . CHARLES ( going to the hall door ) And in the meantime you can be getting used to Jake . EMMIE Never ! I 'll soon brush him out . Be nice to Hippie , Charles . The way you treat him will have great influence with Peggy . CHARLES U-m . EMMIE What ? CHARLES Nothing . EMMIE And do n't be surprised . CHARLES What ? EMMIE You need n't expect him to be just like you . p. 33 CHARLES God forbid ! I would n't expect you to go all the way to Europe and pick up something just like me . I hope you both had better luck than that . ( He goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mean by that ? LUCILE Nothing ! You 're so excited you 're behaving like a lunatic . EMMIE ( snapping her bag again ) You 're the excited one . Why Charlie does n't know there 's something the matter I ca n't see . LUCILE Be careful ! If you keep on thinking that , you 're going to say it . EMMIE I 'm not going to say a thing . But I keep thinking how guilty you look . LUCILE Shut up , Emmie . And stop doing that to that bag . Behave yourself . Be natural ! EMMIE How can anybody be natural with Hippie around ? ( They both laugh a little  --  foolishly . ) And he looks so much more unnatural than I thought he was going to . Peggy has n't taken her eyes off of him once . ( CHRISTINE comes in from the hall. ) p. 34 LUCILE Everything looks so nice , Christine . Just as though I 'd never been away at all . CHRISTINE ( going to the fire and picking up the crumpled telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank you . There are a great many letters and telegrams and flowers  --  but Mr. Lingard put your purple asters there with his own hands . He 's been nursing them all summer . EMMIE Oh God ! LUCILE Yes . They 're lovely . We 'll have tea now , and Mrs. Sykes and Miss Peggy will stay . CHRISTINE I thought they would . And will that other  --  EMMIE Yes . He will ! CHRISTINE Yes 'm . ( Stopping at the hall door . ) Will you have it here  --  or in the hall ? LUCILE Right here . CHRISTINE Yes 'm . ( She goes out . Closing the door . ) LUCILE ( rising and going quickly to EMMIE ) Why did you say " Oh God " like that before Christine ? EMMIE I could n't help it ! Charles putting purple asters around in the same old places with his same old hands ! What are you going to do ? p. 35 LUCILE I 'm going to scream . That 's what I 'm going to do  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the fireplace . ) EMMIE How do you actually feel  --  yourself ? Are you wavering or not ? Everything seems sort of slipping away from me . The right to live  --  you know  --  seemed so much more so in Europe than it does over here . Peggy looked at his monocle every second . Why it did n't crack right in two  --  I do n't see . LUCILE ( laughing ) You 're too absurd . EMMIE I know I am . I 'm just going to shut my eyes and try to remember how Hippie looked in Europe  --  and if Peggy says one word  --  PEGGY ( coming in from the hall ) Mother ! Where in the name of all that 's holy did you get it ? What is it ? How is it ! Why is it ? EMMIE Now Peggy Sykes  --  let me tell you something . He 's a very distinguished person . Tell her Lucile . His background and his culture are  --  You tell her how distinguished he is , Lucile . LUCILE Peggy can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see a good deal for myself . EMMIE ( uncomfortable under PEGGY 'S gaze ) Now I 've only had them plucked a tiny little bit ( Touching her eyebrows. )  --  and I 'm perfectly frank and open about my hair  --  and you are not going to get these ear-rings . PEGGY Mother , you 're a fool ! ( PEGGY and LUCILE laugh . PEGGY throws her arms around her mother 's neck . ) Your hair was just beginning to be sweet with a little grey in it . EMMIE Hush ! PEGGY Why did you let her out of your sight a minute , Lucile ? EMMIE Out of her sight ? You 'd better ask me why I let her out of my sight . ( LUCILE has started to leave the room  --  and gets to the door  --  but stops suddenly and goes back quickly to sit down with elaborate innocence . ) PEGGY ( looking at LUCILE with new interest ) Lucile knows her business . You look like a million dollars , Lucile . I 'm crazy about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 EMMIE Now you need n't expect much . We did n't waste time buying things . PEGGY ( standing between the two women and looking at them with amused tolerance ) What did you do then ? EMMIE It was n't a shoppie  --  dressmakerie kind of a time at all . ( Taking off her magnificent coat . ) LUCILE ( trying to be very casual ) We were really in Europe this time . Not superficially  --  but really  --  intelligently  --  from the inside . PEGGY Do n't tell me you graduated from dressmakers to cathedrals , mother . EMMIE No ! We were n't tourists at all . We knew people  --  all sorts and kinds . PEGGY Why pick Hippie then ? EMMIE I would n't expect you to appreciate anything continental . LUCILE It was unusual  --  rather brilliant in fact . I felt Europe as I never have before . EMMIE So did I. PEGGY How did it feel ? p. 38 LUCILE The things that are  --  interesting and stimulating  --  and satisfying are just there . It 's all so effortless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is over here  --  it just is . PEGGY What is ? EMMIE That 's just it . You ca n't put your finger on it . The air is full of it . PEGGY Of what ? LUCILE It is n't something you go out for . It 's life itself  --  over there . EMMIE Absolutely . It just oozes out  --  and you breathe it in . PEGGY I advise you to let it all ooze out of you before you see anybody else . ( Turning to the tea table and getting a cigarette . ) Oh  --  by the way  --  mother  --  I 'm giving a biggish dinner Sunday night . Could n't you and your boy friend dine here ? Could n't they , Lucile ? LUCILE Of course . EMMIE We could not . Why pray ? PEGGY He would n't fit into the picture . EMMIE I 'll do nothing of the kind . I would n't insult him . p. 39 PEGGY If you do n't want him insulted you 'd better keep him away from the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes off her hat . ) EMMIE Of course if you 're going to compare him with that giraffe you 've got out there  --  Who is he ? And his voice ! It 's the most American voice I ever heard in my life . I simply ca n't stand it . PEGGY You wo n't have to . He never says anything . He teaches Greek in the Junior High in town . EMMIE Greek ? How silly ! PEGGY He 's got the best mind in the state . He got a prize for it . EMMIE That 's too common for words . LUCILE ( powdering her nose as she stands by the piano ) Be careful , Emmie . They 're coming in in a minute . EMMIE Who is he ? Who is he ? PEGGY ( going to her mother ) He 's what I 'm going to marry . EMMIE Peggy ! You do n't mean it ! You could n't ! I wo n't have it ! What have you been doing while I 've been away ? p. 40 LUCILE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean it  --  do you ? You would n't . Would you , Peggy ? It 's not serious  --  is it ? PEGGY Is this Hip  --  Hip affair serious ? LUCILE Stop it ! EMMIE That 's a very different matter . LUCILE Emmie ! Do n't be silly ! PEGGY You would n't marry him  --  mother  --  would you ? EMMIE If I did you ought to be proud to have him in the family . PEGGY What 's happened to you , mother ? EMMIE ( rising ) What 's happened to you ? I wo n't have that long-legged thing around . ( She goes to sit on the couch at Left . ) LUCILE You 're behaving like children . Stop it ! PEGGY At least he does n't look like something the cat had brought in . CHARLES ( coming in from the hall ) Come in  --  Mr. Lomi . ( PEGGY hurries to sit on the couch at Right . HIPPOLITUS comes in looking more Continental and oiled than ever . JAKE CANON follows . JAKE is twenty-one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and much too big for the furniture . He too is wearing sport clothes  --  which increase his size . There is an awkward pause as the men follow CHARLES into the room. ) p. 41 CHARLES ( standing at the fireplace ) Well  --  here we are  --  such as we are . Are you addicted to tea , Mr. Lomi ? LOMI I am addicted to everything agreeable . CHARLES The tea performance is getting to be a habit ' round here  --  but it still seems kinda funny to me . LOMI Tea is funny ? LUCILE ( sitting on the couch beside EMMIE ) He means not quite middle west America yet . LOMI Oh ! CHARLES You 've seen a good deal of America by this time , Mr. Lomi  --  have n't you ? LOMI And now that I am seeing it I do not wonder you boast about it . PEGGY We do n't boast . We do n't have to . We know it 's the greatest country on the map . EMMIE Now , Peggy dear ! That 's the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEGGY ( with a side-long glance at HIPPIE ) It 's not the kind of thing that would embarrass me in Europe . p. 42 LUCILE ( going to HIPPIE and taking him to the window at Right ) It 's late for the garden now , Hippie  --  but when it 's at its best  --  it 's really quite lovely . ( As she passes PEGGY she gives her a thump on the back . ) LOMI I 'm sure it is  --  if it is your garden . CHARLES I think it 's cool enough for a fire  --  do n't you ? ( Stooping to light the fire . ) PEGGY ( with a sudden English accent ) Yes  --  a little frost in the air , old horse . Something 's going to get nipped  --  you know . ( PEGGY takes a cigarette from the tea table and sits on the stool , at Center , her back to the audience . ) EMMIE It certainly is . CHARLES Come here , Emmie . I want to see you sitting in your own place again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . ) LUCILE ( who has been talking all this time to HIPPIE  --  still at the window . ) But in June the roses are really beautiful . p. 43 PEGGY ( as JAKE goes to her to give her a light ) Mother says it 's Continental  --  what do you say it is ? ( JAKE grins  --  but says nothing and sits in the chair below the piano at Left . ) CHARLES ( looking down at EMMIE as he stands before the fire ) This looks good to me . October fifteenth  --  home safe  --  and all is well . It 's something for a man to be very grateful for , Mr. Lomi  --  to have two such good looking women come back to him . ( LUCILE sits on the couch facing the window . HIPPIE stands before her . ) LOMI It is indeed . How you ever let them go away from you is what I do not understand . EMMIE ( taking out a very long extension cigarette holder ) Will you give me a light Charlie ? CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to move to reach you . ( Lighting her cigarette with his lighter . ) PEGGY ( as she and JAKE lean over the piano  --  looking at a magazine ) Look at ma 's long distance holder . p. 44 LUCILE ( still on the couch talking to HIPPIE ) It all seems very new and shining to you , Hippie , of course . LOMI And comfortable . I begin to realize the power of American comfort . CHARLES ( watching LUCILE and speaking to EMMIE ) There 's something new and shining about Lucile , too , is n't there ? The trip 's done her a lot of good  --  has n't it ? EMMIE ( confidentially to CHARLES  --  as the others go on talking ) Yes  --  it has  --  it has Charlie  --  if you 'll only see it that way . CHARLES Un ? ( He looks down at EMMIE with tolerant amusement . ) EMMIE ( cautiously  --  looking to see that the others are talking and will not hear her ) Let me give you a tip . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet to Lucile now  --  tactful you know  --  and patient . CHARLES ( still more amused ) Why ? EMMIE Try to understand her . ( CHARLES laughs with keen enjoyment. ) p. 45 PEGGY What 's the joke ? EMMIE ( to JAKE as he goes to sit on the stool at Center ) My daughter tells me you 're a Greek  --  how do you happen to be that ? PEGGY ( as they all laugh ) Do n't bother to answer Jake . That 's as near to the point as mother ever gets . ( CHRISTINE and KATIE bring the tea service which they place on the table before the couch at Left . LUCILE goes to sit on the couch to serve the tea . The conversation goes on during this without interruption . ) LOMI You know Europe well , I suppose Mr. Lingard . CHARLES No  --  I 've never been there . LOMI Is that possible ? You Americans are such great travelers . CANON ( rising to help with the tea ) Somebody has to keep the home fires burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you break something . ( She pushes JAKE into a chair below the piano . ) CHARLES ( still at the fire ) I get my Europe through Mrs. Lingard . She makes me see everything she 's seen  --  and do everything she 's done  --  when she gets back . p. 46 LOMI That is very clever of her . ( CHARLES gives EMMIE a cup of tea which LUCILE has just poured . ) CHARLES I think I 'm going to get a bigger kick than ever out of Europe this time . EMMIE What do you mean ? CHARLES There 's something new and mysterious about you both . Is it Continental culture  --  or what ? PEGGY ( as she takes the plate of sandwiches and goes to her mother again acquiring a very English accent ) Oh  --  we realize that we seem very crude and raw to you  --  after your long life on the Continent of course . ( EMMIE refuses a sandwich and PEGGY goes back to JAKE who takes the plate and puts it on the piano . ) LUCILE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tea . Everything is funny to them . ( HIPPIE goes to sit beside LUCILE on the sofa . ) EMMIE But that 's not so funny as you think . Everything is crude . I kept telling Hippie in Paris how magnificently beautiful America is  --  and now that I 've been showing it to him  --  Well , it just is raw . p. 47 LUCILE ( with superior sweetness ) If they 'd only stop building New York and let it get old and mellow and soft and grey like Paris ! EMMIE Absolutely . And as to Chicago  --  Well , it 's just embarrassing . PEGGY ( leaning against the piano as she drinks her tea ) Look out  --  Jake came from Chicago . EMMIE That 's what I say . CHARLES I hope you apologized to Mr. Lomi for Chicago , Emmie . LUCILE Mr. Lomi 's been saying delightful things about America all along the way . EMMIE Hippie 's being polite . I know how he feels . If we were in Paris now we 'd be having tea under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there later . And the lights would come out  --  not blaze out and hit you in the eye  --  but just  --  LUCILE ( dreamily ) Just  --  melt out . EMMIE Absolutely . It 's all so soft , so subtle ! LUCILE Paris is so gay and so sad ! p. 48 EMMIE ( closing her eyes ) With that grey mauve mist over it all  --  as Ronnie says . ( She opens her eyes in terror . ) PEGGY Who 's Ronnie ? LOMI ( quickly but suavely ) A young Englishman  --  a writer . EMMIE ( relieved  --  but terrified ) Yes  --  just a writer  --  one of those . PEGGY What did he write ? EMMIE A  --  I do n't remember . PEGGY ( beginning to enjoy herself ) Charlie  --  the culture has gone deep . Do you remember what the writer wrote  --  by any accident , Lucile ? EMMIE Why are you so curious , Peggy ? PEGGY ( going to sit on the stool at Center ) Curious ? What else is there to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you want us to ask questions so you can answer them ? CHARLES Are n't you going to let us shine a little in reflected glory ? You tell us about the illustrious young Englishman , Lucile. p. 49 LOMI He is a friend of mine . PEGGY Oh ! Maybe you can give us a little information . We might like to read his book . Might we not Charles ? How about you Jake ? Would you like to read a book ? CANON ( with a grin ) I might at that . ( Crossing and uncrossing his legs . ) PEGGY ( looking at HIPPIE ) Well ? LOMI He has published one volume of poems  --  another of essays  --  one novel  --  and another is just about to come out . CHARLES ( amused and very much entertained as PEGGY teases EMMIE and LUCILE ) And we still do n't know his name . LOMI Derbyshire  --  Ronald Derbyshire . PEGGY Would n't you know it ? I do n't see how they have the nerve to name themselves things like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea table to put down her cup ) That 's because you do n't know anything about England . Derbyshire is a very fine old English name  --  and Ronnie is a very  --  p. 50 PEGGY I thought you said you did n't remember him . EMMIE ( putting her cup on the table suddenly ) I do n't ! Oh  --  you lighted a fire , Charles . No wonder it 's so hot here . ( She goes back to her chair . ) CHARLES I 'll open a window . ( He goes to the window at Right and opens it . ) PEGGY ( putting her cup on the tea table and going up to the fire  --  where she looks down at her mother ) What I want to know is  --  why is mother so hot and bothered about Ronnie . What is Ronnie to ma , Lucile ? LUCILE ( still on the sofa ) You do n't expect me to tell ? EMMIE ( astounded ) Well  --  I like that . CHARLES ( at the window ) Are we beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever was before ? I 've seen you both go through the performance of coming home a good many times  --  but it 's always been  --  " America looks pretty good to me after all . " A very flattering experience for any man , Mr. Lomi  --  to have a woman willing to come back to him from Paris  --  but this time I can see they 're not going to be able to stand us at all . p. 51 LUCILE ( poised and smiling ) Let me have your cup Hippie . Charles is making fun of us . He stays at home because he wants to . You could n't drag him away . LOMI Perhaps he does not need to go away for his  --  divertisment . CHARLES It 's the experience of a man 's soul that makes a country for him . Is n't it , Emmie ? EMMIE Oh  --  you 're just making that up Charlie . LOMI It is the experience of a man 's soul that makes everything for him  --  is it not ? ( PEGGY goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing back of PEGGY ) And if a man sees purple mists in his own back yard  --  need he travel into the unknown for his soul 's sake ? LUCILE ( looking into her tea cup ) It depends upon what his soul demands . EMMIE Absolutely . LUCILE You prefer home made things , Charles . CHARLES Perhaps there 's something wrong with me . Perhaps I like what I have too well . ( Going back to the fire. ) p. 52 EMMIE ( still peeved ) I know you do . CHARLES If I think my house and my wife are the best in the world  --  what more can the world give me ? PEGGY And if I think Jake 's a work of art  --  what the hell does it matter what anybody else thinks ? ( JAKE crosses and uncrosses his legs . ) EMMIE It matters a good deal . CHARLES Maybe you are n't half as nice as I think you are , Emmie . Maybe Lucile is n't the most perfect woman in the world . ( Smiling at LUCILE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman . Did that ever occur to you ? LUCILE ( rising and moving slowly to the window  --  at Right  --  which she closes ) At least it 's occurred to me that I 'm not in the least what you think I am . CHARLES ( looking at her with proud admiration as she moves ) What did they think of her in Paris , Emmie ? LOMI Paris thought very wonderful things about Mrs. Lingard  --  I assure you . p. 53 EMMIE ( with guileless sarcasm ) Yes  --  some people thought she was Russian . PEGGY And what did they think of mother ? What did Ronnie think of ma and the ear-rings ? A bit Swedish  --  What  --  what ? ( PEGGY and CHARLIE shout with laughter . ) EMMIE ( rising ) You both think you 're so funny . I think you 're perfectly nasty . I 'm going home . ( She starts to the door . ) CHARLES ( following her a little ) Do n't be foolish Emmie . We 're proud of you . Proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably a long line . EMMIE ( coming back to look at LUCILE ) Lucile  --  you tell them that Ronnie is nothing to me  --  absolutely . ( LUCILE smiles at her . ) Are n't you going to ? LUCILE ( very sweetly ) I 'm afraid they would n't believe me now  --  you 've made such a fuss about it . EMMIE ( aghast ) Well  --  of all the  --  p. 54 PEGGY ( rising quickly ) Mother  --  you 're actually blushing . EMMIE I 'm not blushing  --  I 'm bursting . PEGGY ( growing angry  --  suspicious and embarrassed ) I thought it was a joke  --  it does n't seem to be . LUCILE Of course it is . Do n't be so tragic about it , Peggy . PEGGY Then for heaven 's sake tell the joke . Do n't let yourself look like such a fool if you are n't  --  mother . EMMIE How dare you say that to me , Peggy ! How dare you ! I 'm sorry I came home at all . ( Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must not take Ronnie too seriously . There were many of us you know . CHARLES ( enjoying EMMIE 'S embarrassment immensely ) I 'm sure there were . Do n't go Emmie . Stay to dinner  --  all of you . EMMIE I will not . I 'm fed up . Come on Hippie . ( She snatches up her coat and goes out the hall door . HIPPIE follows her  --  CHARLES goes out with them  --  JAKE follows. ) p. 55 PEGGY ( as she goes out with the others ) Good night , Lucile . See you tomorrow . I hope I like what you brought me . ( LUCILE goes to the tea table . After a moment EMMIE comes back into the room looking for her bag . ) LUCILE What have you lost ? EMMIE My bag . ( Finding it in her chair she goes to LUCILE . ) I 'm not going to keep this up you know . I saved the situation this time  --  but I 'm not going to keep on being the goat . LUCILE Saved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you open your mouth you  --  EMMIE Well  --  I 'm not going to sit with my mouth shut forever . Tell him . For heaven 's sake tell Charlie and get it over . We ca n't live sitting on powder . And I 'm so sorry for him I could bawl when I look at him . CHARLES ( coming back into the room ) Well , Emmie  --  no wonder America seems tame to you . Are any more of your admirers coming over ? Is n't Ronnie coming too  --  so we can have a look at him ? EMMIE ( going to the door ) That 's not as funny as you think it is either . p. 56 CHARLES ( following her ) Sorry you wo n't stay , Emmie . We 'll see you tomorrow , wo n't we ? EMMIE I do n't know whether you will or not . Good night , Charles . ( Turning at the door and throwing her arms about CHARLES and kissing him . ) I love you  --  anyway . ( She goes out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe you 're right . I do n't know Emmie at all . LUCILE ( leaning against the piano ) Of course you do n't . CHARLES ( still very much amused ) Which one is it  --  Hippie or Ronnie ? LUCILE Hippie , of course . CHARLES Then why all the mystery about Ronnie ? I thought we were accidentally discovering some great and secret passion . LUCILE I asked you to be tactful  --  not to tease her . CHARLES Is she going to marry this one ? LUCILE Why not ? p. 57 CHARLES Why not seems obvious . It 's why should she , I 'm asking . LUCILE ( going up to the fire ) That I 'm afraid you 'll have to let Emmie decide for herself . CHARLES ( walking about carelessly ) I 'm afraid I will . If Emmie has chosen this to spend the rest of her life with  --  I see  --  at last  --  that I know nothing about anybody . LUCILE ( leaning against the mantel ) Of course you do n't . No one does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness for somebody else . CHARLES But Emmie !  --  Good God , Lucile  --  what were you doing ?  --  How could you let it happen ? ( Sitting in the arm chair at the fire . ) LUCILE ( twisting her belt with nervous fingers and trying to keep her voice natural and casual ) I do n't agree with you at all . You 're looking at him with the eyes of an American business man . He has charm  --  charm ! There 's a  --  something sympathetic and companionable about him that you do n't see . p. 58 CHARLES ( with good-natured amusement ) I s'pose he 'll find her money companionable too . LUCILE ( her frightened emotion almost breaking into her voice ) Of course he will . She knows that . But there 's something else  --  far more important . He understands her  --  and that kindles something in her that nothing else ever has . He lifts her out of the humdrum routine everybody else pokes her into  --  and makes her something she did n't even know herself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Turning suddenly to look into the fire . CHARLES Well  --  ( Looking at the carpet . ) It might mean  --  one or two other things . You  --  remember I wrote you about Tom 's death  --  and that I saw Wilbur ? LUCILE ( going to sit on the couch by the tea table again ) Yes  --  but I do n't want to see him . Do n't ever ask me to , Charles , please . It would only bring back that horrible experience of seeing your brother .  --  You 're unfair to Emmie . Do n't you see she must live ? CHARLES I 'm not trying to keep Emmie from living . p. 59 LUCILE Yes you are . At least you think she ought to go on  --  as you think she ought . CHARLES ( chuckling a little as he gets up ) Nonsense . I just have n't got used to these hidden depths yet . I want to tell you something about Wilbur , Lucile . Something sort of hard to tell . ( With sudden gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes down as she touches a teacup ) And I want to tell you something  --  that 's sort of hard to tell  --  too . It 's going to take all the understanding  --  CHARLES Now do n't tell me Emmie is living in sin  --  with Hippie . LUCILE ( rising quickly and moving to the piano where she stands with her back to CHARLES ) If you 'd only stop thinking everything is a joke  --  Charles . It is n't you know . CHARLES ( walking about as he talks ) Dearest  --  if Emmie thinks this little man can keep her amused for the rest of her life  --  and she wants to pay his bills  --  why not ? As you say  --  who knows what spells happiness for anybody else ? I 'm the luckiest devil on earth  --  and I know it . You 're the loveliest thing God ever made , Lucile  --  and you get more so all the  --  ( Going towards her . ) It 's a fact  --  you are more beautiful than when you went away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin  --  are sort of luminous . Is it because you 're so happy to be back ? ( He comes closer to her . Her eyes shift . She is afraid to move  --  afraid to stand still . ) You bet I want Emmie to live . I want everybody to live . I 've got more to be thankful for than any man going . What is it you want to tell me dearest ? ( Putting his arms about her and putting his head against her hair . ) Make me understand . If there 's something in life that I do n't know anything about  --  something it 's going to take all I 've got to see  --  you make me see it . ( He kisses her hair  --  slowly  --  tenderly . ) What is it you want to tell me , dear ? p. 60 LUCILE ( slowly drawing away from him a little  --  and trying to smile ) What is it  --  you want to tell  --  me ? CHARLES Wilbur 's in there . ( Nodding towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought him home with me . He 's been here all summer . LUCILE Charles  --  how could you ? CHARLES I could n't help it . The poor little devil did n't have any place to go . He 's all right , Lucile . LUCILE How could he be  --  with that inheritance ? CHARLES Pretty bad  --  I admit . A drunken loafer for a father and a silly half-cocked mother who is n't straight  --  I 'll bet my hat  --  but in spite of that the kid has managed to be a  --  Wait till you see him . He 's sound as a pippin  --  a regular fella . Likes to fish . We 've fished our fool heads off . LUCILE Oh  --  CHARLES And always here when I got home from the bank . Next to having you here it was  --  Gosh  --  you do n't know how it helped to fill up the cracks . I 've sort of kidded myself that he was my son . I could n't help keeping him till you got back and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay a little longer . Not just kick him out you know . ( He has walked away from her. ) p. 61 LUCILE ( a keen look coming into her face ) If he kept you from being lonely  --  I 'm glad . That 's the one thing you 've never forgiven me  --  not giving you a son  --  is n't it ? CHARLES ( turning back to her ) Oh  --  now  --  LUCILE If you did n't have me  --  you 'd like to have him  --  would n't you ? ( CHARLES nods . ) Let 's keep him , awhile  --  anyway . CHARLES You 're just trying to be decent . LUCILE I mean it . I want you to have him . CHARLES You 're  --  LUCILE Bring him out  --  let 's see him . CHARLES ( looking at her gratefully and unbelievingly and going to open the library door ) Come out , Wilbur . She wants to see you . ( After a pause WILBUR comes into the room  --  going slowly to LUCILE with wistful eyes . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he actually looks like you  --  a little through the eyes . How do  --  you-do  --  Wilbur ? p. 62 WILBUR How do you do ? LUCILE Call me Lucile . You need a new tie too . We 'll snitch some from Charles ' new ones . He tells me it 's been wonderful to have you here this summer . We want you to stay on for a while . Will you ? ( She has spoken to WILBUR with all her charm . He looks at CHARLES  --  speechless . ) CHARLES ( who has stood near the door watching them ) I guess you can manage that  --  ca n't you ? You have n't got too many other engagements , have you ? ( He smiles to cover the catch in his voice . ) You skip and spruce up for dinner . We have to buck up now and mind our p 's and q 's . Got to have clean collars tonight  --  the queen will be at the table . WILBUR Thank you  --  for asking me . ( He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to LUCILE  --  standing back of her ) That 's one of the sweetest things you ever did in your life , old girl . Well  --  that 's my secret . Now tell me yours . I 'll try and meet it as magnificently as you did . It seems to me there is n't anything in God 's world I could n't understand  --  with my arms around you . ( Putting his arms about her. ) p. 63 LUCILE ( her courage going ) I 'm awfully tired . Let 's wait till after dinner . I 'm going to get in the tub . ( She starts to go . CHARLES holds her . ) CHARLES You might give me a kiss . ( She turns back  --  kisses him lightly on the lips and goes hurriedly out . CHARLES stands looking at the door happily  --  as THE CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : Five weeks later  --  nine o'clock in the evening . Scene : The same as Act One . At Curtain : EMMIE enters hurriedly followed by CHRISTINE . EMMIE is wearing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Christine . Take my coat  --  and tell Mrs. Lingard I 'm here  --  and tell her to come down  --  quick . CHRISTINE ( taking EMMIE 's coat ) Yes , Mrs. Sykes . Is that another one of the new dresses ? EMMIE ( going to the fire and warming her hands nervously ) Oh , yes  --  it is . CHRISTINE I think I like it best of all . EMMIE You can have it Christine . If I did n't have to stay for the party I 'd take it off my back right now and give it to you . They 'll all be out of style before I can get them worn once . Will you tell me why I was such a fool in Paris ? CHRISTINE That 's what people go to Paris for  --  is n't it ? Did another European gentleman arrive this afternoon , Mrs. Sykes ? p. 65 EMMIE Yes  --  he did . CHRISTINE If you had all come here for dinner I could have given you a good one  --  but I have n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short notice . EMMIE Do n't worry about that Christine . Some of us wo n't have much appetite . CHRISTINE Yes ma 'm . EMMIE ( calling to CHRISTINE who has gone ) Tell Mrs. Lingard to hurry . ( EMMIE tries sitting in her new dress  --  then walks about to see how it looks  --  turning quickly to the hall door as CHARLES comes in . ) Lucile  --  Oh !  --  I thought it was Lucile . CHARLES You evidently have something momentous to say to her . EMMIE No , I have n't . I have n't at all . ( Going to the sofa near the piano . ) CHARLES ( teasing her affectionately ) Give me one guess ? EMMIE No  --  I do n't . CHARLES Ronnie . EMMIE Now , why do you say that ? p. 66 CHARLES Is n't he the excitement ? I 'm excited too . I want to see him . What have you done with him ? Did n't he come with you ? EMMIE No  --  he did n't . He 's coming with Hippie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few minutes . CHARLES ( standing before EMMIE as she sits on the sofa ) Well  --  how does he look  --  now that he 's here ? Just as illustrious as he did in Europe  --  or more so ? EMMIE He looks just about the same  --  to me . CHARLES And what is this going to do to Hippie ? Is it going to queer his chances ? EMMIE ( baffled and helpless ) Now Charlie  --  once and for all  --  Ronnie did not come over to see me  --  I mean just merely to see me . CHARLES What did he come to see ? EMMIE America . And I asked him to stay with us . I had to . CHARLES ( laughing and going to the fire ) You 're modest Emmie . When a man catches a boat three weeks after you 've left him in Paris and gets the first train out of New York to get to Dubuque  --  it looks a little suspicious . Dubuque is not the first thing they make for when they come to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits beside her. ) p. 67 EMMIE Now Charlie  --  CHARLES ( enjoying her confusion ) I think it 's great , Emmie . You 're putting it all over Peggy . She 's only got one beau and you 've got two . EMMIE ( a little mollified ) She 's acting like the devil about this , too . Anybody would think I had one foot in the grave and was disgracing myself just before I died . CHARLES If you 'd relent a little towards Jake  --  I think she would towards Hippie . EMMIE Never ! That 's different . CHARLES But just what is the matter with Jake , Emmie ? He 's got the biggest heart in the world . EMMIE Of course he has . Everything about him is the biggest in the world . He 's all right for a lot of things I suppose  --  but not for Peggy 's husband . What on earth she sees in him I ca n't see . CHARLES ( rising and going to the piano to get a cigarette ) And what you see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hippie 's beginning to get me . I 'm beginning to see what you see in him . p. 68 EMMIE Charles , you are a darling ! CHARLES No sharp angles  --  always there  --  agreeable  --  just slips along  --  mellow . EMMIE He is mellow . But Peggy will not admit it . She 's a mule . I do n't care what she says  --  he does belong to an older civilization and it does make a difference . He always knows just exactly what I want him to say  --  and says it . Whether he means it or not he says it . And you bet that helps . ( She goes to CHARLES . ) CHARLES You bet it does . EMMIE Charlie dear  --  you 're so sweet . CHARLES Sweet  --  but ! EMMIE If you just would stand right up on your toes and be a man of the world and show Lucile you  --  ( She stops suddenly as LUCILE comes into the room . ) LUCILE What is it Emmie ? ( Looking keenly from EMMIE to CHARLES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CHARLES ( admiring the dress ) I have n't seen that one  --  have I ? That must be the climax . p. 69 LUCILE Like it ? CHARLES I do . Is Wilbur coming in to see the celebrity ? LUCILE Of course . CHARLES Wood enough on the fire  --  think ? I 'll go and see about the drinks . We must have good ones tonight  --  must n't we , Emmie  --  to help us through this occasion ? I 'll do my derndest . ( He goes out . ) LUCILE ( going quickly to EMMIE ) What were you talking about ? EMMIE What do you s'pose ? ( EMMIE stands back of the couch , at Left , LUCILE in front of it  --  facing her . They speak in low excited tones . ) LUCILE I 'm scared to death to have you with him alone . EMMIE I like that . I keep the whole thing balanced all the time  --  and get no credit for it . LUCILE Where is Ronnie ? EMMIE He 's coming with the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to telephone you . I do n't know whether you 're supposed to have seen him when he got here this afternoon or not . p. 70 LUCILE No  --  no  --  no ! of course not ! EMMIE Well you need n't take my head off . He does n't know either . He said you did n't fix it when you left him . LUCILE We did . We did . Of course I have n't seen him  --  till I see him here  --  now . Nobody saw us together . When I drove up to your South gate there was n't a soul around . He got in my car and I drove down that back road  --  and he walked back . But it 's awful ! I 'm not going to do anything like that again  --  but I had to see him a few minutes alone . ( Sitting on the couch . ) EMMIE Well  --  he and I fixed it this way  --  if he was supposed to have seen you this afternoon  --  the minute he comes into the room I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know everybody here . " But if he is n't supposed to have seen you  --  I 'm to say  --  " And here 's Mrs. Lingard , Ronnie . " LUCILE Yes  --  but for heavens sake , get it right , Emmie . ( LUCILE rises and goes up to the fire . ) EMMIE Of course I 'll get it right . But I ca n't keep this up much longer . My head nearly splits wide open every time his name is mentioned . And how well does Charlie think you know him  --  anyway ? ( Going to LUCILE. ) p. 71 LUCILE Oh  --  scarcely at all . It 's you . EMMIE Have n't you even hinted to him that there was something in Europe ? LUCILE No  --  no ! EMMIE I am a slob  --  to let you pin this on me . How in the name of heaven are you going to begin now ? LUCILE Now that Ronnie 's here it has to come to a crisis . I have to be brave about it . I  --  PEGGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evening clothes ) What 's the big idea ? Why did you beat it over alone mother ? Hello Lucile . LUCILE ( poised and charming ) How pretty you look , Peggy . Good evening Jake . CANON ( shaking hands with LUCILE ) Good evening , Mrs. Lingard . PEGGY ( sitting on the lower end of the couch at Right ) You do n't look so bad yourself , Lucile . Where 's Charlie ? LUCILE Mixing the drinks . EMMIE Where are Hippie and Ronnie ? p. 72 PEGGY Taking off their coats . I must say Ronnie is all to the good . You did a pretty good job when you picked him up , mater . If he were twenty years older I would n't say a word . EMMIE ( standing by the piano ) If he were twenty years older he 'd be a great deal too old for me , let me tell you . PEGGY Oh come , mother  --  he must be ten years younger than Lucile . LUCILE Anybody under twenty always thinks anybody over thirty is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to remember her speech for RONNIE 'S entrance  --  and now discovers that she has forgotten it ) Lucile ! ! PEGGY What 's the matter , mother  --  you look seasick . EMMIE ( starting for the library door ) Come in here a minute , will you Lucile ? I want to speak to you  --  ( EMMIE and LUCILE go hurriedly into library  --  closing the door . ) PEGGY ( still on the couch and swinging her feet up onto it ) Mother 's so excited she does n't know whether 's she 's coming or going . Listen , Jake . There 's something phoney about this . Ronnie does n't seem to me any more in love with mother than he is with me . And I know she 's batty about Hippie . I do n't think I 'm going to be able to kick it out of her . Now why did Ronnie chase her over here ? Do you think he 's trying to get money out of her ? Do you think the two of them  --  Ronnie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get something ? p. 73 CANON ( standing at the upper end of the couch  --  looking down at PEGGY ) Did it ever occur to you it was the other one  --  Lucile  --  that Ronnie has come to see ? PEGGY Not Lucile ! It could n't be . She 's so damned proper . She never bats an eye at a man . CANON Un . PEGGY What ? CANON She 's all lit up ever since your mother got that cable . Every time I see her she 's more excited than the time before . You know  --  all kinda smouldery  --  underneath . Sparks sorta shoot out from her . ( Twiddling his fingers to indicate the sparks . ) You get it you know  --  that is  --  a man does . PEGGY ( as the probability of this dawns on her ) Lucile ? Jake  --  you 're a wizard ! CANON If you piece the whole business together  --  it sorta fits . I do n't think it 's your mother any more than it 's my foot . Anyway your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't . PEGGY But Charlie ! It would kill him . CANON Yep  --  I think it would . p. 74 PEGGY He 's a plumb fool about Lucile . He 'd never dream she 'd  --  Life 's hell , Jake . Let 's run straight . There 's nothing in the other . CANON You got ta put up a clean fight  --  or it 's a foul game . ( PEGGY puts her feet down and leans towards JAKE lifting her face to him . JAKE bends and kisses her mouth in a long kiss  --  without taking his hands from his pockets . ) PEGGY ( standing up ) Gee , I 'm getting excited myself ! Watch her Jake . And watch Charley . See if you can tell if he 's on . LUCILE ( coming in from the library  --  followed by EMMIE ) Where is everybody ? Where are the men ? Where on earth did you leave them , Peggy ? PEGGY I thought they were coming right in after us . CANON I 'll get ' em . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to LUCILE who is at the fire ) Ronnie 's terribly good looking , is n't he Lucile ? LUCILE Is he ? PEGGY Is he ? Do n't you remember whether he is or not ? p. 75 LUCILE Of course  --  in a way . PEGGY Were n't you around when he and mother were discovering each other ? LUCILE Oh , yes  --  but so many people discovered Emmie in Europe . CHARLES ( heard off stage singing ) " The drinks are in the hall  --  The drinks are in the hall  --  Heigh  --  Ho the Merry-O  --  The drinks are in the hall . " ( He comes in . ) Hello , Peggy . Where are the rest of us ? PEGGY Jake 's gone to get ' em . LOMI ( coming through the open hall door ) Good evening ! CHARLES Good evening , Hippie . ( They all turn towards the door as RONNIE enters . He hesitates at the door and EMMIE speaks . ) EMMIE ( standing below the piano ) Come in Ronnie  --  This is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turns away . LUCILE rises and goes to RONALD . They hesitate before shaking hands  --  having looked at EMMIE who failed them. ) p. 76 CHARLES ( smiling at LUCILE and RONALD ) You do n't seem to be quite sure whether you know each other or not . LUCILE I 'm delighted to see you again . RONALD Thank you . CHARLES ( with warm charm and hospitality ) I have the honor to be the husband . ( Giving his hand to RONALD . ) Let me welcome you to America Mr. Derbyshire . I 'll call you Ronnie in a minute . That 's what I 've been calling you for five weeks . I 'm glad to see you . This is the first time you 've been in America . Is n't it ? RONALD Yes .  --  It is.  --  Yes . CHARLES I 'll wait a few days before I ask you how you like it . You made a quick trip out . Did n't stop in New York at all , did you ? RONALD No  --  not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little hard on Dubuque to see New York first . ( WILBUR comes in through the hall door followed by JAKE . ) You better see it last  --  when you 're leaving . Come here Wilbur . ( WILBUR goes to CHARLES . ) Mr. Derbyshire  --  this is Wilbur , my nephew . He 's been staying with me this summer while my wife was in Europe  --  and I do n't mind telling you he 's a darned good pal . ( HIPPIE sits by PEGGY on the sofa  --  JAKE stands back of the sofa. ) p. 77 RONALD Yes ? CHARLES Yes , sir ! ( Patting WILBUR 'S shoulder . ) RONALD ( looking at WILBUR ) It 's splendid to have a pal , is n't it ? WILBUR ( to RONALD ) I read your book . ( LUCILE  --  frightened  --  watches WILBUR as she sits on the sofa at Left . ) RONALD Oh  --  Did you ? How did you happen to do that ? WILBUR I read it twice . RONALD I 'm flattered . Which one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . I have n't read it once . Where did you get hold of it ? WILBUR ( turning towards LUCILE ) In Lucile 's car . LUCILE ( serenely  --  after a vibrant pause ) Oh , yes  --  you left it there the other day , Emmie . I read some of them too . They 're charming . ( HIPPIE rises  --  anxious and alert. ) p. 78 CHARLES Why did n't you give it to me , Lucile  --  so I would n't be in outer darkness ? PEGGY Do n't tell me you 've read the poems , mother . EMMIE ( sitting in the chair below the piano ) And why not  --  pray ? PEGGY What 's your favorite ? Name one . EMMIE They 're all my favorites . WILBUR One was marked , Mrs. Sykes . CHARLES ( chuckling ) Which one was that , Wilbur ? WILBUR ( sitting on the sofa beside LUCILE ) The one about  --  hoping you can  --  always  --  love ' er . ( PEGGY and CHARLES laugh . ) LOMI ( quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite too . " It is not that I ask of life  --  That she will love me always  --  But that I may keep on loving her . That if she grows less to be loved  --  My love may never know . That if she is not always what she seems to me  --  That is what I ask of life  --  I may not  --  see . " ( There is a pause  --  eloquent and conscious for everyone  --  except CHARLES and WILBUR. ) p. 79 CHARLES ( with a smile that is full of sweetness and tolerant philosophy ) That 's rather a large order you ask of life , Mr. Derbyshire . I 'm not a poet  --  but that 's what I ask too . RONALD You probably do n't like poetry , Mr. Lingard . CHARLES Strangely enough  --  I do . The only trouble is there 's so little time to read it . Fortunately  --  all the poetry in the world is not on paper . But I 'll read yours before I go to bed tonight . EMMIE ( rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEGGY ( rising and going to the piano ) I did not . But I trust we have a beautiful sunrise tomorrow . ( There is a general movement as they all talk at once for a moment . EMMIE goes to HIPPIE . PEGGY strums on the piano and JAKE sits beside her . RONNIE stays at the fire and LUCILE goes to him . ) LUCILE Did you have a good trip over , Mr. Derbyshire ? RONALD Very smooth  --  very dull . CHARLES ( going to RONNIE and LUCILE ) What can I do for you while you 're here ? Hippie does n't play golf . I suppose you do . All good Englishmen are good golfers , are n't they ? p. 80 RONALD I 'm only fair . CHARLES I 'll put you up at the club tomorrow . What do you like ? RONALD Oh  --  shooting  --  fishing . CHARLES Fishing ? Now you 're shouting . Are you very keen about it ? RONALD Yes , I am . I like it better  --  yes I like it better than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my own heart . Are you game for an early start some morning  --  and make a whole day of it ? ( RONNIE looks at EMMIE who is watching him closely , EMMIE nods to him having had a cautious signal from LUCILE . ) RONALD Yes . CHARLES Good ! I 'm in luck . It 's great to find a man who likes what you like , is n't it ? Show me a real fisherman and I 'll show you a real man . Is n't that so ? Come and have a drink on that . ( CHARLES takes RONALD out through the hall door  --  leaving LUCILE and EMMIE staring after them . ) EMMIE ( going quickly to LUCILE ) I ca n't stand it . p. 81 LUCILE ( putting her hand on EMMIE 'S arm to calm her and speaking across to HIPPIE ) Go and have a drink , Hippie . ( LUCILE and EMMIE go into the library . JAKE stays at the piano picking out a song with one finger . ) PEGGY ( rising  --  to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOMI ( who has started to the hall door ) Yes ? PEGGY Is Ronnie a very intimate friend of yours ? LOMI I have known him a number of years . He is very charming is he not ? PEGGY I could fall for him  --  but mother ought to feel slightly maternal towards him  --  and as to what he sees in mother  --  well  --  show me . LOMI Is it possible for any daughter to see what any man sees in her mother ? PEGGY Now if it were Lucile he 'd fallen for  --  I might get it . But they do n't even seem to  --  even know each other . WILBUR ( who is on the couch at Right ) Yes , they do . p. 82 PEGGY ( looking at WILBUR in surprise ) What ? WILBUR Sure they do . I saw ' em together in Lucile 's car this afternoon . PEGGY ( after a pause ) Where ? WILBUR On the back road by your place  --  I was on my bike . CANON ( going across to WILBUR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilbur . WILBUR Why ? CANON It 's probably some joke they 've got on Mrs. Sykes . Let 's not spoil it . PEGGY No  --  you keep still Wilbur . CANON Let 's shake hands on that  --  to keep quiet . What do you say ? ( He puts out his hand . WILBUR takes it with a manly grasp . ) WILBUR Sure ! ( JAKE takes WILBUR out , closing the hall door . ) PEGGY ( going closer to HIPPIE ) What is this ? LOMI I do not know . I was not on my bike . p. 83 PEGGY You do know . It is n't mother at all . It 's Lucile . LOMI Are you not jumping very fast at conclusions ? PEGGY If you want to do something that will save an awful lot of people an awful lot of trouble  --  take Ronnie and get out  --  both of you . LOMI May I suggest that you are interfering in something you do not know anything about ? PEGGY You do n't have to know much to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to know much to know that you and mother married would be an impossible combination . LOMI That  --  it seems to me  --  is entirely for your mother to decide . PEGGY ( fighting back her tears ) You 've flattered her  --  and fooled her  --  and made an idiot of her . I wo n't have it . LOMI Now Miss Peggy  --  ( Soothingly and tactfully . ) PEGGY You would n't want to marry her without her money  --  would you ? LOMI Certainly not . p. 84 PEGGY ( looking at him in amazement ) What ? LOMI Certainly not . Your mother and I would be an impossible combination without her money . With it  --  we are an exceptionally good one . PEGGY Bunk ! She 's as unsophisticated as a baby . She has n't any continental standards . You 'd be mixed up with other women in no time at all . She could n't stand it  --  and I 'm not going to let her  --  LOMI But  --  since you are so sophisticated  --  Miss Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide enough variety of life to find a secure and peaceful existence with your mother the greatest novelty of all  --  and a perfect finish . PEGGY You 've got a nerve to say that to me . LOMI And your sophistication ought to tell you that it is because I have lived so much that I know I am truly deeply fond of her . If I were not  --  all the money in the world would not make her desirable to me . Your sophistication ought to tell you that the heartaches and miseries which Jake will bring to you  --  your mother will escape  --  with me . PEGGY You 're not putting Jake and you in the same  --  p. 85 LOMI Oh yes . In his own way he will make you as unhappy as I have made many women . CHARLES ( coming in from the hall with RONALD ) Have you heard my wife sing , Mr. Derbyshire ? RONALD Yes  --  I have . CHARLES What do you think of her voice ? RONALD It 's very beautiful  --  very rare . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you ? CHARLES I do . But I might over-rate it . I think everything about her is the most wonderful in the world . But you would know . You 've heard everything . RONALD It is one of the voices that the world ought to hear . CHARLES All the more wonderful that she is contented to stay at home and sing  --  is n't it ? PEGGY Did she sing much in Europe ? ( Watching RONALD keenly  --  and speaking very casually . ) RONALD A  --  LOMI I heard her  --  several times . p. 86 PEGGY She wo n't sing a bit since she got home  --  I wonder why . CHARLES I want her to sing now . Will some of you ask her ? LOMI I will  --  with pleasure . PEGGY I hear them  --  in here . ( HIPPIE follows her into the library . ) LOMI ( as they go ) I shall be very glad to hear Mrs. Lingard sing again . PEGGY I 'll bet she wo n't do it . ( HIPPIE closes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sing since she got home  --  and I 'm afraid it 's because she sings too well . RONALD I do n't understand . CHARLES ( speaking with great reserve and trying to keep the importance of what he is saying out of his voice ) I believe it 's getting too much for her  --  staying here  --  if she knows she 's got something that belongs out in the world . Has she ? That 's what I want to find out . You say you think she has . RONALD I think she has  --  yes . p. 87 CHARLES Sit down . ( RONALD sits on the sofa at Right . CHARLES draws a chair near the sofa . ) Will you answer another blunt question  --  honestly ? ( They sit after CHARLES has lighted RONALD 'S cigarette . ) RONALD I  --  Yes  --  certainly  --  if I can . CHARLES You can help me  --  more than anybody . I do n't often get a chance to have the opinion of a man of the world like you . Of course there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth about a woman . He 'd have to say something agreeable . Now  --  has she got that strange mysterious something that puts it over  --  the spark that would draw the world to her ? Has she got it for you ? RONALD Yes . CHARLES And what am I to do about it ? RONALD ( carefully ) What do you mean ? CHARLES I think a woman who has the real thing ought to have a chance to try . Lucile would n't ask for it . She 'd be afraid of hurting me . ( Rising and putting his chair back . ) Ask her to sing now  --  please . You 'll get a fresh impression . Then if you 'll tell me what you think  --  I 'll appreciate it . You stay here . I 'll send her out . ( CHARLES goes into the library . RONALD  --  ill at ease  --  rises and waits . After a moment LUCILE comes from the library  --  closes the door cautiously and goes quickly to RONALD. ) p. 88 RONALD ( tensely  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't told him . LUCILE I told you how hard it would be . RONALD You 've let me come into his house . I feel like a skunk you know  --  and I 'm not . LUCILE And do n't you think I 've tried and tried and tried ? And every time  --  he  --  ( She stands very close to him . He does n't touch her . ) RONALD But it makes it beastly instead of honest . LUCILE You 're blaming me . RONALD I 'm not  --  but  --  LUCILE Do you care as much as you thought you did ? RONALD Have n't I raced across an ocean and a continent to get to you as fast as I could ?  --  Do you care ?  --  Is that why you have n't told him  --  because you  --  are n't sure ? LUCILE I love you even more than I knew I did , Ronnie . Oh dearest , now that you 're near me again  --  I ca n't give you up . I must have the courage to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on like this another day . The only decent thing we can do is to get out . LUCILE ( moving away from him a little ) Darling ! RONALD We 've got to . LUCILE But  --  RONALD Tomorrow . ( They speak in whispers . ) LUCILE Oh , that 's too quick . I ca n't hurt him like that . RONALD What you 're doing is much worse . It 's horrible Lucile . I ca n't stick it . If you love me  --  you 'll come away with me tomorrow  --  or tonight  --  now . Why do n't we do it now ? LUCILE Oh no . It could n't be that way . RONALD It 's torture to be near you  --  like this . LUCILE Darling  --  EMMIE ( coming quickly into the room ) Have n't you got any sense at all ? You ca n't stay out here like this . You 're supposed to be singing you know . CHARLES ( as he comes in ) Have n't you been able to persuade her , Ronnie ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Sing " Dreams " Lucile . LUCILE I 'm sick of it . EMMIE So am I. We danced to it day and night in Paris . PEGGY Oh  --  there 's going to be a dance at the Country Club tomorrow night . Are we all going ? Lucile 's a marvelous dancer , Mr. Derbyshire  --  but I s'pose you know that . RONALD Is she ? LUCILE He does n't seem to remember whether I am or not . ( Sitting on the stool at Center . ) CHARLES ( standing below the piano ) I do n't dance  --  but Saturday 's the only day I can get away from the bank . I was going to say we take tomorrow for our fishing  --  while the weather 's good . Could you manage that  --  and the party too ? RONALD Surely . Why not ? CHARLES Will you let me have Ronnie tomorrow , Emmie ? EMMIE Yes , of course  --  if he wants to go . ( She goes to the couch at Right . Everyone moves  --  and talks at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low tones to LUCILE ) Lucile  --  if both these men are really after Emmie  --  she 's going to get herself in an awful mess . I 'm going to take Ronnie fishing tomorrow  --  and you can take care of him tomorrow night  --  at the party  --  so he wo n't be left out in the cold . I 'm not going  --  so that will be a good excuse to tell him to stop here and pick you up . See ? ( LUCILE nods and goes to the piano  --  playing softly . ) Oh , Mr. Derbyshire  --  Ronnie . Ask her to sing " Ah Love But A Day "  --  please . That 's my favorite . ( CHARLES goes to talk to the others . RONALD goes to LUCILE . ) RONALD ( in low tones to LUCILE as she plays ) He wants you to sing " Ah Love But A Day . " LUCILE I 'm afraid to try . RONALD I think you 'll have to . ( LUCILE plays the introduction of " Ah Love But A Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano  --  leaning over it . CHARLES stands before the fire . The others move quickly and sit to listen . There is a nervous tensity in them all as LUCILE begins to sing . She sings the first line " Ah Love but a day  --  and the world has changed . " ) p. 92 LUCILE ( stopping the song suddenly ) I ca n't . CHARLES ( moving towards her a little ) Go on dear  --  please . LUCILE ( going on  --  uncertainly ) " Look in my eyes . Wilt thou change too ? " ( EMMIE has risen and cautiously signalled to RONNIE to stop looking at LUCILE . RONALD lowers his head . As LUCILE 'S emotion grows in her singing  --  CHARLES  --  puzzled  --  looks from her to RONALD  --  and then at the others . The thing which the room is filled with  --  begins to come to him . LUCILE stops singing and rises faintly . ) CHARLES ( putting an arm about her quickly  --  but keeping his eyes on RONALD ) Are you ill  --  dear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CANON I 'll get it . CHARLES Thanks , Jake . Right there is the hall . ( JAKE goes into the hall leaving the door open . The others begin to talk  --  trying to seem unconscious of the situation . CHARLES turns back to LUCILE. ) p. 93 LUCILE I only want some air . I 'm going to lie down a minute . Do n't come . ( She goes into the library  --  leaving the door open . The two men slowly look at each other ) CHARLES ( to RONNIE  --  very simply ) Well ? RONALD ( as naturally as possible ) It  --  is n't fair to  --  judge her by that  --  is it ? CHARLES Is n't it ? ( RONALD goes up to the fire . CHARLES stays where he is . The revelation of the truth is in his face . JAKE comes back with a glass of water . ) EMMIE ( who has been watching everything and pretending not to  --  reaches out and takes the glass of water as JAKE passes her ) I need this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucile has these headachy faint spells . Let 's go home . I 'm tired myself . ( She starts PEGGY and JAKE  --  HIPPY and RONNIE  --  towards the hall door ) PEGGY ( at the door ) But we just got here . We have n't had anything to eat . p. 94 EMMIE You 'll get something to eat at home ! Go on ! Go on ! Go on ! We 're going  --  Charles . ( She motions to the others to go on out and goes to CHARLES . ) CHARLES ( pulling himself together and turning to EMMIE ) But how about supper ? EMMIE Nobody could eat a bite . And Ronnie 's dead after his long journey . I think it was silly to come over here tonight anyway . I know Lucile will be glad to get rid of us . She 's so temperamental about her singing . Is n't she ? Good night Charlie . You 're a lamb . ( She touches his shoulder tenderly and goes quickly to the door . ) LOMI Good night , Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . ( Moving to the door with EMMIE ) CANON Good night Charlie . PEGGY Good night Charlie . If it were n't for Jake I 'd be in love with you . ( Putting her arms about CHARLES as the others go into the hall . ) CHARLES ( stopping in the doorway ) Thanks for those kind words . It 's a date for tomorrow then , is n't it Ronnie ? Because tomorrow 's sure to be a fine day  --  and if we postpone it  --  we might put it off too long . ( He calls to RONALD who is out of sight in the hall. ) p. 95 RONALD ( calling back to him ) Why yes  --  surely  --  if you say so . ( RONALD goes down the hall with the others . Their voices die away as they call " Good night 's " to CHARLES . As CHARLES turns back into the room  --  leaving the hall door open  --  LUCILE comes in from the library . ) CHARLES They 've gone . LUCILE Oh  --  without any food ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lightly  --  nervously  --  trying to be natural . She takes her handkerchief from the piano  --  her vanity case from the mantel  --  and goes to the couch at right to straighten a pillow . ) After I 've gone to all this trouble ! The whole thing was her idea anyway . CHARLES ( not looking at her ) Are you all right now ? LUCILE Perfectly . CHARLES What was the matter ? LUCILE The room was smoky or something  --  I s'pose . I could n't sing . CHARLES ( going to the fire and standing with his back to LUCILE ) Ronnie thinks you have a very rare voice . p. 96 LUCILE ( breathlessly  --  her back turned to him as she picks up the pillow ) Did he say that ? CHARLES He did . And he seems a very  --  honest chap  --  to me . Does he to you ? LUCILE Why  --  yes . CHARLES That 's important  --  is n't it ? LUCILE What ? CHARLES To be honest . LUCILE Of course . ( WILBUR comes in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing with that book , Wilbur ? ( Frightened and off guard for a moment . ) WILBUR Uncle Charlie said he wanted to read it tonight . I thought he 'd like me to bring it in from the car . CHARLES Yes  --  I do want to read it . Thanks , Wilbur . You can go to bed now . You must be sleepy . Good night , boy . WILBUR Good night . Uncle Charles . ( He looks at LUCILE . ) Good night ! ( LUCILE does n't answer . WILBUR goes out  --  leaving the door open. ) p. 97 LUCILE ( watching the book as CHARLES holds it ) Let me have it  --  please . It 's Emmie 's . She did n't mean to leave it . CHARLES But surely it 's meant to be read , is n't it ? LUCILE ( putting her hand over the book quickly as CHARLES opens the cover ) No ! CHARLES Oh .  --  Is there something she would n't want me to see ? LUCILE Yes . CHARLES Sorry . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything she wants me to know  --  I s'pose she 'll tell me . LUCILE Y-e-s.  --  I suppose she will  --  when she 's  --  sure  --  herself . ( She goes to the door and turns to CHARLES . ) Good night  --  dear . CHARLES Good night . ( She goes quickly . CHARLES stands motionless a moment as the sickening pain comes into his face and body  --  then turns and goes slowly to the fire  --  standing with his back to the audience . ) THE CURTAIN FALLS p. 98 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO Scene II Time : Eight o'clock the following evening . Scene : The library . Only a small part of it is seen . A fireplace is at Center . Arm chairs each side of the fire . A cupboard is built into the wall at Left of the fireplace . A door is at Right . A long narrow table is at Left . A bridge lamp is above the chair at Right . At Curtain : The stage is dark  --  only the glow from the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the light from the hall shows CHARLES coming in followed by RONALD . CHARLES and RONALD are both in fishing togs  --  dirty  --  disheveled  --  and stiff with the cold  --  but , there is about them the sportsman 's satisfaction of a good day 's sport . CHARLES Good ! Here 's a fire . ( He lights the bridge lamp and a circle of light floods the room in front of the fireplace . ) And the Scotch is right here , too . Who 'd have thought it would turn off as cold as this ! ( He opens the wall cabinet next to the fire and takes out a quart of Scotch , a corkscrew and two glasses , then puts the glasses on the table and begins opening the bottle of Scotch . ) Press that button at the side of the door there and we 'll have some White Rock . We 'll have a nip straight first  --  if I can get the cork out . Ahh  --  There she is . ( He pours a little Scotch in each glass. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire ) Jove ! This fire feels good . It was the wind that made it so beastly coming back . CHARLES ( giving a glass to RONALD ) Here you are . RONALD You first . You need it most . CHARLES Go to it . Do n't wait . RONALD ( taking his drink ) I did n't know I was so cold . But it was a marvelous day  --  just right ! And as good fishing as I ever had in my life . CHARLES ( standing beside RONALD  --  with his own drink ) How 's that for Scotch ? I s'pose you think we have n't got the real stuff over here . RONALD That certainly is . How do you get it ? CHARLES How do we get it ? We just buy it . ( CHRISTINE opens the door . ) Hello , Christine . Bring some White Rock  --  quick . Mr. Derbyshire 's in a hurry . And do n't tell anybody he 's here . Jump now . CHRISTINE Yes , sir ! ( She goes out quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more whiskey in RONALD 'S glass ) Have another swallow ' til the White Rock gets here . RONALD Thanks . I must get along now and dress . But you do n't have to drive me over to Emmie 's . Could n't I just take the car  --  and come back in it  --  for Lucile  --  and go on to the club ? ( Taking another drink . ) CHARLES Not at all ! I 'll take you as soon as I thaw out a little . It 'll be a nice party . You like dancing , do n't you ? RONALD Oh , yes ! But I do n't think I 'm going to be much good at it tonight . My legs are so stiff . CHARLES ( pouring more whiskey into RONALD 'S glass ) This is the only thing that will  --  ( CHRISTINE comes back . She carries a tray on which is a plate of sandwiches and two bottles of White Rock . ) That was quick enough , Christine . Put it there . CHRISTINE ( placing the tray on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lingard . You must be hungry . CHARLES Hungry ? We almost ate some of the fish coming home . p. 101 CHRISTINE I 've kept some dinner for you . CHARLES Thanks , Christine . ( CHRISTINE goes . CHARLES folds a sandwich and puts it in his mouth for one bite and begins to make the high-balls . ) RONALD ( standing with his back to the fire devouring a sandwich ) Um  --  that 's good too . Everything 's good  --  and as I say  --  as fine a day 's fishing as I ever had in my life . CHARLES I 'm glad you were n't disappointed  --  and you certainly landed the big fellow as neatly as anything I ever saw done in my life . RONALD Think so ? God  --  I 'm cold ! Might as well be drinking iced water . CHARLES Me too  --  but keep at it . ( Giving RONALD a highball . ) Yes , sir  --  to land one that size on a thin line  --  that takes real fishing . RONALD He did n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I like . To see them jump like that . He was rather magnificent , was n't he ? CHARLES You can fish ! You 're all right ! You 're an all-round man . That 's what I like about you . ( CHARLES stands beside RONALD before the fire  --  holding his glass in one hand and a sandwich in the other . Both men are beginning to be comfortable . ) You 're a man 's man as well as a woman 's man . That 's a great combination . I often wish I had it . To understand women is a wonderful thing . Now you 've only been here two days and I expect you understand my own wife in some ways better than I do myself . p. 102 RONALD What makes you say that ? CHARLES ( talking with his mouth full ) You 've got a poetic  --  romantic  --  sympathetic side to you  --  that knows that complex mixed up thing we call a woman 's nature . RONALD I must get along now . CHARLES ( taking RONALD 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . RONALD No more thanks . No , really . CHARLES Just a drop for me then and I 'm with you . ( RONALD turns to the fire to light a cigarette . CHARLES pours a large drink into RONALD 's glass and only a drop into his own . ) Is it beginning to get to your toes a little ? You 'll dance all right . That 's another sympathetic thing about you . I ca n't dance . Lucile says I 'm light on my feet , but not on hers . She says I do n't respond to the music . Responsiveness  --  that 's what a woman wants . Now that 's what you 've got . RONALD ( having taken a long drink ) I do n't know about that . But you 're a man 's man  --  which is much more important . p. 103 CHARLES Think so ? RONALD Oh much ! Much more important for a man to be a man 's man . That 's what I like about you . CHARLES Well  --  I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is a man 's man . RONALD No , I do n't mean that . I mean a man  --  that all men recognize as a man  --  as an exceptional man  --  an outstanding  --  upstanding man . A man that a man knows is a man 's man . That 's what I call a man 's man . CHARLES Yes ? RONALD Oh yes . ( Putting a whole sandwich in his mouth . ) CHARLES You see  --  I like you . I 'd believe you . ( Sitting in the chair at Left of the fire . ) I thought we 'd have a good talk today about Lucile 's voice but we did n't seem to get at it . RONALD Yes  --  I thought we 'd have a good talk today  --  but we did n't seem to have time . CHARLES Well  --  now how about it  --  man to man ? RONALD ( tossing his hat on the floor ) I know you want me to be honest . p. 104 CHARLES You bet . RONALD Somehow  --  when I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as good as it did  --  in Paris . CHARLES But she had too much emotion last night  --  too  --  RONALD But that 's just it . The artist controls emotion  --  uses it  --  does n't let it run away with him  --  if you know what I mean . The road to the stars is over stony ground . A career takes courage  --  force  --  undying tenacity  --  to carry a thing through once it 's started . I mean moral force  --  not soft evasion along the easiest lines . CHARLES You mean guts . RONALD ( bowing to CHARLES very seriously ) Yes  --  that 's what I mean  --  though I do n't like to speak of a lady 's guts  --  if you know what I mean . CHARLES I get you . And what about her age ? Do you think she 's too old to begin ? Of course she seems young to me . I 'm forty-five . She 's only thirty-five . RONALD Good God ! She could n't be . CHARLES I must tell her that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do just you and I think she is ? p. 105 RONALD ( profoundly ) Well  --  a woman 's beauty is a strange thing . CHARLES It is  --  indeed . A very strange thing indeed  --  ( Looking at RONALD 'S feet . ) Are your feet warm ? RONALD They are not . ( Turning to the fire . ) In fact , I do n't think they ever are going to be  --  during the rest of my life . CHARLES It has n't got below my knees yet . ( Having taken RONALD 'S glass and again putting more in it than in his own . ) RONALD I must buzz off . You know old man , I have a very pressing engagement . But I want to make my point . ( He holds out his hand to make an eloquent gesture and CHARLES slips the glass into his hand . ) CHARLES Go ahead  --  make it . I 'll wait for you . RONALD ( after taking his drink ) Ah  --  What was I saying ? CHARLES ( cautiously as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  p. 106 RONALD ( dropping heavily into the chair opposite CHARLES ) Exactly  --  very strange indeed . It  --  a  --  largely depends on  --  surroundings . Now  --  a  --  somehow  --  Lucile does n't seem so beautiful to me right here  --  as she did in Paris . CHARLES How do you account for that ? RONALD Everything seems a little more real  --  more honest  --  over here . Less glamour . Things seem to me somehow to be just exactly as they are . If you know what I mean . CHARLES ( taking RONALD 'S glass and putting it on the table ) Glamour 's a great thing . But you see  --  to me  --  she has got all the things you think she has n't got  --  and if I give her up to somebody else  --  I want to be sure he 'd think she 's just as wonderful as I do  --  and keep on thinking so  --  forever . Get me ? RONALD ( on guard  --  watching CHARLES ) But I thought you thought it was a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at first  --  but since last night  --  I 've changed my mind . p. 107 RONALD What do you mean ? CHARLES She 's not happy . RONALD How do you know ? CHARLES I love her . I do n't want a woman just because she happens to be married to me  --  to miss what would fill out life for her . RONALD But if she has n't told you anything  --  why not let it alone ? Why dig anything up ? CHARLES I do n't love her that way . If she finds somebody she wants more than she does me  --  I want her to have him . RONALD ( rising with difficulty and with great dignity ) I must get along now . CHARLES Yes  --  you must . But here 's the door over here . ( Turning RONALD to the Left wall of the room where there is no door at all . ) Come on . You must n't disappoint Lucile . She 's a marvelous dancer . RONALD Yes  --  but not quite so marvelous as she thinks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the hell 's the door knob ? CHARLES There ! Right there . ( He puts RONNIE 'S hand on the small catch of the liquor cabinet. ) p. 108 RONALD ( fumbling ) Where is it ? These American door knobs are no good . I suppose you think they 're early American . Well  --  they 're not ! Everything you 've got came out of England . Do n't you know that ?  --  ( Turning to CHARLES . ) But I want to make my point . CHARLES And I want to hear it . This is a rare treat for me . I enjoy hearing a man of your intellect talk . ( Sitting in the arm chair which he draws to the Right end of the table . ) RONALD ( sitting in the chair above the table ) So do I. Now  --  what was I talking about ? CHARLES About Lucile . RONALD So I was . CHARLES ( putting an arm about RONALD 'S shoulders ) You think I 'm right  --  do n't you  --  in expecting her to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RONALD ( leaning across the table to CHARLES ) What would you do  --  if she did tell you she wanted somebody else ? CHARLES I 'd want to see him . p. 109 RONALD To  --  shoot ' im ? CHARLES Oh , no . I 'd want to know whether he could take care of her or not  --  so she 'd have what she always has had . Women have got to be taken care of  --  and the better you do it  --  the easier they think it is . RONALD Oh hell  --  I want a woman to take care of me . I say it in all modesty  --  I 've got a spark of genius  --  and it comes first  --  before any woman on earth . It 's got to . God  --  it 's life ! Women come and go  --  but it stays . It 's what I live with . When I find a woman who makes that spark burn brighter  --  that 's the woman I want . I thought I 'd found her once  --  my ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a pause ) fades away . Was that party tonight or tomorrow night ? CHARLES I think it was last night . RONALD Oh  --  well  --  that 's all right . That 's good . It 's so comfortable here . Well  --  ( Holding up his glass . ) Here 's to you , Charlie . ( They both drink . ) Lucile is perfect to you  --  is n't she ? How do you do it ? p. 110 CHARLES ( as they sit with their heads close together ) The more you keep on telling a woman she 's the most wonderful thing in the world  --  the more you believe it yourself . RONALD You do n't see a fault in her . CHARLES Certainly I do . I 'm not an imbecile . ( CHARLES ' own tongue has loosened by now  --  his own heart has become a little too warm and confidential . ) Do n't you s'pose I know I think she 's prettier than she is ? But she is a darn sight better looking than most wives . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thought we were safe  --  but the whole bloomin ' thing I thought we had  --  we have n't got at all . She is in love with somebody else  --  and I 'm trying to find out whether he 's enough in love with her  --  to make her safe with him . RONALD And if you thought he was  --  you 'd give her up  --  to him  --  because you love her so . ( After a pause CHARLES nods  --  unable to speak . RONALD puts an arm across CHARLES ' shoulders . ) Well , let me tell you something . When I first saw you I thought  --  no offense , mind you  --  I thought  --  Good God !  --  No wonder she  --  p. 111 CHARLES No wonder she what ? RONALD But let me tell you what I think now . I think any man that had the nerve to think he 's more of a man than you are  --  and to crash into what you 've made out of your love for a woman  --  ought n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked long and hard and slow  --  so he 'd have time to know what a bloody  --  low-down skunk he is . I like you better than any man I ever saw in my life  --  or ever hope to see . Charlie  --  now that we 're such good friends  --  and understand each other so well  --  I want to tell you something . I  --  ( LUCILE opens the door and comes in . She is in the gown she wore the last night in Paris . She stops aghast in horror  --  as she sees the men . CHARLES gets to his feet and pulls RONALD up . ) CHARLES It 's all my fault if he 's a little late , Lucile I  --  RONALD Good evening Lucile . How beautiful you look ! CHARLES He 'll be ready in no time at all . RONALD Ready for what ? I tell you I 've had the most marvelous time  --  LUCILE Do n't ! This is the most disgusting thing I ever saw . p. 112 CHARLES But  --  darling  --  LUCILE Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're beasts !  --  Disgusting  --  loathsome beasts ! RONALD I 'm sorry about the party last night . ( LUCILE goes  --  closing the door with a bang . ) She seems to be displeased about something . Is anything wrong , Charlie ? CHARLES Not a thing ! ( They put their arms about each other as  --  THE CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : Twelve o'clock the following morning  --  Sunday . Scene : The same as Act One . At Curtain KATIE is placing a bowl of flowers on the piano . EMMIE ( heard in the hall ) Where are you , Lucile ? PEGGY There does n't seem to be anyone here . EMMIE See if they 're in the living room . PEGGY ( coming in quickly through the open hall door ) Is Mrs. Lingard  --  Good morning Katie . Is Mrs. Lingard here ? KATIE Good morning , Miss . Yes , she is . EMMIE ( coming in from the hall ) Ask Mrs. Lingard if she wants me to go up to her room , Katie . KATIE Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to see her right away . KATIE Yes , Mrs. Sykes . ( KATIE goes out through the library closing the door. ) p. 114 EMMIE Now go on out and wait in the car with Jake and Hippie . I do n't need you . PEGGY I 'm afraid to let you see Lucile alone . I 'm afraid she 'll put something over on you again . I do n't suppose Charlie knows yet that she and Ronnie were n't at the party last night . And she 'll get you in that someway  --  too . EMMIE And where on earth were they ! That 's what I want to know . How could she do such a wild dangerous thing as to go off some place with Ronnie instead of bringing him to the Club ? And where did they go ? PEGGY ( sitting on the couch at Left ) Pretty raw !

And how could Ronnie go ? PEGGY He had to . He was nailed to the cross . It must have been a pleasant day for Ronnie . What did they talk about all day  --  do you suppose ? p. 115 EMMIE About the fish  --  I suppose . How could she be such a fool as to do this after I 've sacrificed myself letting Charles think I was  --  CHRISTINE ( coming in from the hall ) Excuse me , Mrs. Sykes .

You 've got to get yourself out of this mess quick , mother . You 're in deep . You 've helped Lucile fool Charlie from the very beginning . What are you going to say to him when he finds it all out and says to you  --  " Why did n't you tell me , Emmie ? Why did you deceive me , Emmie ? " What are you going to say to him ? EMMIE You 're making me so nervous ! Where do you suppose Charlie is ? PEGGY He 's probably singing " Onward Christian Soldiers " now , louder than anybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would n't he blame you ? If you 'd behaved yourself in Europe  --  Lucile would have too . EMMIE That 's very different . I 'm not married . PEGGY You bet your life you 're married  --  and got a grown-up daughter besides . What happened to you over there , mother ? You were all right before you went away . A cute little middle-aged  --  EMMIE Wait till you 're forty-three  --  and you 'll know that 's a long way from middle  --  PEGGY Forty-six . And why that silly stick ? You do n't need it . p. 117 EMMIE Of course I do n't need it . I do n't carry it because I 'm decrepit . It 's smart to walk with in the country . PEGGY I suppose Hippie thinks it 's cute . EMMIE Yes he does . He thinks everything I do is right . And I 'm going to marry him . I 've made up my mind  --  absolutely  --  and nothing you can say will have the slightest  --  CANON ( coming in from the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were coming right out Peg . PEGGY Have you seen Charlie ? EMMIE ( sitting on the sofa at Left ) Now keep still , Peggy . Do n't tell everything you know . It is n't necessary to discuss family affairs before  --  outsiders . PEGGY Meaning Jake . That 's good  --  since he was on to it all before I was . He put me wise . LOMI ( coming in from the hall ) Do you wish me to wait outside or  --  EMMIE I do n't care what you do . Lucile is n't here and Charlie 's gone to church . I do n't know yet whether Lucile has told him that she and Ronnie did n't come to the Club last night or what she  --  p. 118 PEGGY She 's probably told him that you went off and spent the night with Ronnie someplace . EMMIE Peggy ! LOMI ( going to EMMIE ) Oh  --  I am very disappointed and surprised at Ronnie . It was not graceful . CANON ( sitting awkwardly on the couch at Right ) Graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they got over it  --  Charlie would never have known . For I do not think it would have gone too far . I mean I do not think it would have gone so far as marriage . Oh  --  I am very disappointed in Ronnie . I have known him five years  --  but you never can tell what an Englishman in love will do . The honest shy ones are the most dangerous . This will hurt Charlie so much . PEGGY But you think it would have been all right for them to have an affair right here under Charlie 's nose so long as they did n't let him find it out ! LOMI You put it very bluntly , Miss Peggy . Oh , I am so very sorry . PEGGY It 's a cute time for you to be sorry . EMMIE Peggy ! p. 119 PEGGY Oh mother  --  the whole nasty mess is his fault  --  yours and his . If you had n't done what you 've done  --  this would n't have happened . ( EMMIE begins to cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANON I think that 's going some , Peg . PEGGY It 's the truth , is n't it ? CANON No  --  I do n't see that your mother has anything to do with it . ( EMMIE takes her handkerchief away from her eyes to look at JAKE in surprise . ) PEGGY She has everything to do with it . CANON She has a right to  --  to fall in love  --  if she wants to . EMMIE ( pointing to JAKE ) Even he  --  even he  --  treats me better than you do . PEGGY He does n't care as much as I do . CANON Oh now  --  PEGGY She 's my mother ! How would you like to see your mother help a woman have an affair and deceive and fool the best man in the world  --  and get mixed up herself with a queer foreigner ? p. 120 EMMIE ( rising ) I ca n't stand it ! I wo n't marry you Hippie . ( HIPPIE turns from the window . They all stare at EMMIE . ) I absolutely could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of my life if I married you . It is n't worth it . You 'll just have to go home without me . LOMI ( after a pause ) You are sure you mean that  --  Emmie ? EMMIE Absolutely . I could live with one of you at a time and let you each think I could n't live without you  --  but not both of you at once . I could n't . LOMI If you had told me in Paris  --  to go  --  I should have thought of you always as a charming memory  --  but now that I have seen you here  --  day by day  --  now that I have come to really know you  --  and have seen how amiable you are  --  even with your own family  --  it is very hard to go  --  Emmie . ( His voice breaks with real emotion . ) EMMIE What can I do ? She 's my own flesh and blood . LOMI Yes  --  I know . ( He goes out quickly through the hall . EMMIE turns her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( after a long pause  --  very much ashamed of herself ) If you do n't want him in spite of everything I say  --  you do n't want him much . ( A pause . ) I do n't pay any attention to what you say about Jake . ( Another pause . EMMIE keeps her back turned . ) Do n't you know your own mind ?  --  I believe he really likes you mother .  --  If you 've got to marry anybody  --  you 'd be a nut to let him go . Regardless of everything about him that makes me sick at my stomach  --  I like him . CANON ( getting up from the couch ) Atta girl ! EMMIE ( to PEGGY ) You 're the most outrageous  --  CHARLES ( as he comes in cheerfully from the hall ) Good morning ! What 's the matter with Hippie ? He would n't speak to me in the hall . He looks kinda knocked out . I hope there 's nothing wrong , Emmie . I 've grown to like the little man enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the most delightful fellows I 've ever seen in my life . I got to know him yesterday  --  alone all day with him . He 's all there  --  a good sport  --  and a high-minded decent chap . ( Going to the fire and turning and looking genially at all of them . ) How was the party last night ? Did you all have a good time ? I have n't seen Lucile yet this morning . I 've been to church and prayed for you all  --  especially for myself . I asked Lucile to take care of Ronnie at the party last night , Emmie  --  for fear you would neglect him . Did she ? ( EMMIE looks hopelessly at PEGGY. ) p. 122 PEGGY Yes  --  I guess she took care of him all right . CHARLES If you 've turned Hippie down I suppose that means you 're going to take Ronnie after all . EMMIE A  --  ( PEGGY shakes her head at her mother . ) CHARLES ( enjoying EMMIE 'S discomfort ) It must have been hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wise . I suppose an Englishman is safer and closer to us than Hippie 's mixture . I believe we 'll all be more comfortable with Ronnie in the long run . How do you feel about it Peggy ? Which do you prefer for a father  --  Hippie or Ronnie ? PEGGY Do n't be funny ! ( JAKE laughs . ) EMMIE ( with frigid dignity ) We can do without anybody 's sense of humor  --  just now . CHARLES Well  --  anyway  --  I congratulate you Emmie  --  with all my heart . I think Ronnie will be an ideal husband . ( LUCILE comes in from the hall . ) Good morning dear ! Have you been for a walk ? LUCILE I have . Why should n't I go for a walk ? ( Crossing to the lower end of the piano where she stands turning the pages of a magazine . ) Is there anything wrong about that ? p. 123 PEGGY Not so long as you keep on walking . ( Going to her mother . ) Mother  --  I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything 's Oke ? EMMIE Peggy ! ( PEGGY puts her arms around her mother and kisses her  --  then goes to the door . ) Come on Jake ! ( PEGGY stops at the door and points to JAKE to go . JAKE goes out  --  she follows . ) CHARLES ( trying to be natural ) I apologize to you Lucile  --  for messing things up last night . It was n't Ronnie 's fault . I 'll tell you all about it and just how it happened . ( Going up to the library door . ) I 'm going to telephone to Ronnie now . Do you suppose he 's up ? EMMIE I do n't know . He was n't down when I left . CHARLES I 've got a date with him this afternoon . I hope you do n't mind  --  Emmie . ( He goes out  --  closing the library door . ) EMMIE ( getting up from the couch and looking at LUCILE ) Are you absolutely mad ? p. 124 LUCILE ( puzzled ) What ? EMMIE Everybody 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do . LUCILE What are you  --  EMMIE Where were you last night with Ronnie ? LUCILE What do you mean ? EMMIE Do n't take me for a fool . Why did n't you show up at the Club ? LUCILE Ho ! EMMIE Where were you ? How could you do such a  --  LUCILE Oh do n't  --  do n't ! You do n't know what you 're  --  EMMIE Then tell me where you were . LUCILE I was here  --  here  --  waiting and waiting and waiting upstairs for Ronnie  --  and then I came down here and opened that door and found them  --  together  --  Charles and Ronnie  --  drunk . EMMIE Oh  --  thank God ! That 's the best thing they could possibly have done . LUCILE Do n't be an idiot . They were loathsome . p. 125 EMMIE Well  --  why should n't they be ? They 're men . LUCILE He 'd forgotten the party . They 'd forgotten me  --  utterly  --  both of them . EMMIE That 's the best thing they could do too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thinking about you every minute  --  when you 're not around . You 're lucky if they think of you when you 're with ' em . LUCILE You do n't know what you 're talking about . EMMIE What were they talking about ? ( She kneels on the sofa facing LUCILE who is standing back of it . ) LUCILE I do n't know . EMMIE What did they talk about all day ? LUCILE That 's just it . EMMIE Do you think Charlie knows ? LUCILE I do n't know  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't know . EMMIE They must have got awfully chummy if they got drunk  --  together . LUCILE Something 's happened . Ronnie was changed . p. 126 EMMIE Changed  --  or just drunk ? LUCILE Both . When I opened that door I tell you he had forgotten me as completely as if  --  KATIE ( coming in from the hall with a letter ) Here 's a letter for you , Mrs. Lingard . ( She goes towards LUCILE with the letter . ) LUCILE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KATIE Mrs. Sykes ' chauffeur gave it to me . EMMIE Henry ? KATIE No  --  the other one . He drove up just now . ( KATIE goes out through the hall , closing the door . LUCILE has opened the letter and is reading it  --  her back to EMMIE . ) EMMIE ( watching her ) What is it  --  ( Going towards her a little . ) What is it dear ?  --  What  --  LUCILE ( sitting slowly on the couch ) He 's gone ! EMMIE Ronnie ? ( LUCILE nods  --  too broken to speak . ) Lucile  --  darling  --  tell me . ( She drops on her knees beside LUCILE. ) p. 127 LUCILE ( reading  --  ) " If we had stayed over there  --  if I had n't come over here  --  we might have gone on persuading ourselves that it was a great and enduring love  --  that would have inspired us both to the things we think we are meant for  --  and can reach . Great enough to justify itself for destroying something else . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shining glory of a selfless love that has enveloped you and made you perfect in it 's own beauty . " ( LUCILE breaks and gives the letter to EMMIE . EMMIE gently takes it and continues reading . ) EMMIE " I have seen the fool and cad I was  --  and I 'm thankful Lucile , dear , that you have not had to come to see me as such yourself . " LUCILE He was n't a cad ! He was big enough to run away . That 's what he 's done , Emmie.  --  Oh God  --  Oh God !  --  Oh God !  --  That 's what he 's done ! ( She throws herself on the pillow sobbing . ) EMMIE Darling ! LUCILE ( lifting herself from the pillow after a moment ) It 's Charlie ! He 's seen how fine Charlie is . That 's what it is. p. 128 EMMIE " The shining glory of a selfless love  --  " LUCILE I 'm going to tell Charlie the whole thing . EMMIE You 're not ! I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes  --  ever again  --  if I do n't . EMMIE But you ca n't hurt him like that . Thank God he does n't know . Let it alone . There 's no reason why you should nearly kill him  --  just to help your own conscience . And it 's over . You  --  you will get over it  --  wo n't you ? LUCILE I do n't know . It 's like a  --  ( Striking her fist against her heart . ) But I seem to want him to know . Oh  --  he 's so sweet , Emmie  --  I believe he 'd understand . EMMIE He could n't . No man could . LUCILE But I want him to so terribly . EMMIE The kindest thing you can do is not to tell him . ( Rising and moving away a little . ) And after a while  --  I honestly believe  --  you 'll love him more than you ever have . Ronnie was awfully young , Lucile . It would have been awfully uncertain  --  compared to this  --  ( Looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did love me  --  in Paris  --  did n't he ? EMMIE ( going back to LUCILE and standing close to her ) Of course he did . Oh Lucile  --  those days in Paris ! LUCILE The charm  --  the beauty  --  the fun ! EMMIE Will you ever forget the first night we dined with them in that adorable dirty little place on the river  --  and saw Paris in that dim  --  soft  --  ( She stops and sits again beside LUCILE . ) But I feel so guilty  --  having Hippie . LUCILE Do n't be silly ! I 'm awfully glad for you  --  Emmie . You 've been a brick . ( She kisses EMMIE on the cheek with honest love . ) I 'm going to tell Charlie . ( She stands up . ) EMMIE No ! ! ( WILBUR opens the hall door and comes in . ) WILBUR Uncle Charlie wants to know if you want him and Hippie to come in here . LUCILE No . I just want him to come  --  not Hippie . Come here Wilbur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130 EMMIE ( going to the hall door ) Do n't Lucile . Sometimes the very worst thing we can do  --  is to do the thing  --  we ought to do . ( EMMIE goes out closing the door . ) LUCILE ( sitting on the sofa and putting out her hand to WILBUR ) I 'm sorry I was cross about the book last night . It did n't matter a bit  --  really . WILBUR ( standing before LUCILE ) That 's all right . LUCILE When I first asked you to stay it was  --  for something else  --  but now I 'd like you to stay  --  because Charlie wants you  --  so much . That is if you 'd like to stay . I mean really stay  --  forever  --  you know . Would you ? WILBUR ( swallowing the lump in his throat ) Do you  --  want me ? LUCILE Yes . WILBUR If you and Uncle Charlie wanted me because you kinda like to have me around  --  not just because you 're sorry for me  --  that would be  --  LUCILE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes all the difference if you kinda belong . LUCILE You do belong , Wilbur  --  to us . WILBUR Gee  --  that 's  --  LUCILE It 's swell  --  is n't it ? WILBUR I guess yes . LUCILE I think so too . WILBUR ( seeing LUCILE 'S disheveled condition and turning to look at the door ) Uncle Charlie 's comin ' . Your nose is pretty red . ( LUCILE laughs suddenly and shows him her wet crumpled handkerchief . ) I got one . ( Very proudly he takes an immaculate handkerchief from his coat pocket where it had been folded in a perfect pattern . LUCILE takes it gratefully . ) Your hair 's all kinda  --  I got a pocket comb too . ( Taking a small comb from his pocket . ) It 's clean . LUCILE That 's wonderful ! ( She leans against him with a sob . WILBUR blinks hard and shyly puts an arm about her shoulders  --  manfully patting her on the back . ) WILBUR ( after a moment ) You better keep on . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combing her hair a little with the comb WILBUR has given her ) How am I ? WILBUR You look nice . ( CHARLES comes in from the hall carrying a Sunday paper . WILBUR starts for the library door . ) CHARLES Where are you going , Wilbur ? WILBUR ( keeping his back to CHARLES ) Something 's the matter with my bike  --  I got ta fix it . ( He goes out the library door . ) LUCILE ( still on the couch at Left ) Charles I have something to tell you . CHARLES That Ronnie 's gone ? Oh  --  Emmie told me that . And she 's going to marry Hippie . That 's great , is n't it ? ( He pulls a chair a little nearer the window and sits to read his paper  --  pretending to be very interested in it . ) Have you read about the cyclone in Kansas ? I 'm tickled to pieces about Emmie , are n't you ? ( He has n't looked at LUCILE and he now opens the paper wide so that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) LUCILE Charles  --  listen to me  --  p. 133 CHARLES I 'm listening , darling . Emmie seemed to want to tell me something  --  but I told her I did n't want to hear it . Um  --  Three thousand people . She could n't help it if Ronnie fell in love with her . LUCILE But  --  maybe  --  he  --  did n't . CHARLES Oh  --  it must have been pretty serious for him to come half way round the world to get her . LUCILE But when he got here  --  and saw  --  how fine  --  CHARLES Hippie is  --  I think it was damned decent of him to turn right around and go away again . Damned decent . Do n't you ? ( LUCILE rises and goes to the fire . CHARLES knows this but goes on talking with the paper still up . ) It must be an awful lot of fun for a woman to have a young fellow fall in love with her . Gosh ! I can understand that all right . If I were a woman I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( coming in from the hall ) Dinner 's ready . CHARLES ( rising ) Well  --  I s'pose it 's the same old Sunday dinner  --  chicken  --  mashed potatoes and all . And I 'm hungry . ( To WILBUR . ) How about you ? p. 134 WILBUR ( radiantly happy ) We got ice cream  --  with chocolate sauce . CHARLES You do n't say . ( He looks at LUCILE who is still standing at the fire . ) Coming ? ( LUCILE goes slowly towards the door  --  then turns to CHARLES and sinks against him in complete abandon . ) LUCILE Hold me  --  close ! ( CHARLES puts his arms about her slowly and strongly . They start to the door . In the doorway LUCILE stops and turns to WILBUR holding out her hand to him . The three of them go through the door as  --  THE CURTAIN FALLS ( END OF PLAY. )                            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
