Tam animals talked about in " Curious Facts for Little People " are the mole , badger , otter , deer , dog , sheep , horse , birds , dolphin , and whale , with a capital illustration for each . The stories are fresh and attractive , and told in simple language as well as printed in bold type ; and the book is altogether a handsome and appropriate gift for a little child . " John Whopper " began his mendacity , we believe , in Old and Nets. , and though in the magazine the story was apparently designed for adult readers , it can hardly be classed by itself unless among juvenile publications . As the intellectual product of a grown man , or as the amusement of men and women , the performance is slight enough ; but school-boys and girls may possibly enjoy the fancy of a newsboy 's trips through the earth 's centre to the antipodes of Boston  --  to Canton in China  --  his passage through the earth 's axis to the North Pole , and subsequent voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to these adventures which will make them rather more interesting to read in the circle of which the Boston Transcript forms the centre than elsewhere . But the fiction is too purposeless to find enduring favor , we apprehend , even in those limits among the young . As to Mrs. Samuels 's success as a writer for children , there will hardly be two opinions among the little folks themselves . The six books which form her " Springdale Stories " will be found interesting by all children , from the youngest who can read at all up to boys and girls of twelve or fourteen years ; and two or three of the volumes --  " Adele , " for instance , and " Netta 's Trial , " and " Johnstone 's Farm "  - -  might be read aloud by parents to still younger ones , and found entertaining by both readers and listeners . And that , we suppose , is as much as saying that the books have plenty of incident , very little moralizing , no mock sentiment , and are written in what the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of the audience . The children , too , whose adventures are related , though we are not going to praise them for their naturalness , are yet quite sufficiently like real boys and girls to make a personal interest in them quite possible . Whether , however , the account of all the " hairbreadth ' stapes " that Mrs. Samuels puts her little heroes and heroines through  --  one of them , a boy of twelve or thirteen , goes down in a diving . bell , saves a baby from a burning house when all the adult firemen are afraid to venture , sets a prairie on fire and narrowly escapes being scalped by Comanches ; and the others have adventures nearly as thrilling  --  whether , we say , so much exciting reading will not make anything short of a sensational novel pall hereafter on the children 's tastes , is a question which parents might do well to take into consideration . The books are certainly more interesting than children 's books are apt to be , and that they are so is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession of striking incidents . That they are not over-probable incidents nor particularly natural characters to whom they occur , are defects which will be likely to trouble adult readers more than the little ones  --  and we suppose , too , that it is not at all to the detriment of the latter that the good children in these stories are once in awhile almost too good for this * " Curious Facts for Little People about Animals .

Optimism , even when it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . There is nothing to be urged against the " Fairy-Folk Series " on the score of its exciting character ; and children being , whether fortunately or not we do not pretend to decide , so willing to read or listen to anything in the shape of a story , they may not impossibly give pleasure to such of them as have nothing better to measure them by . They are tolerably dull , however , and show on the part of their authors a commonplace effort to be imaginative , and a desire to be perfectly decorous , and a willingness to adapt themselves to the supposed capacity of their readers , which is a rather melancholy indication that writing children 's books is not the precise work for which nature intended them . " On the Seas " is an English book , the scene of which is , however , laid in the first place in " New York , the greatest merchant city in the United States of America , " where the father of its hero , Captain Griffin , has a " handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad story of adventure in the Arctic seas , written with a certain old-fashioned simplicity of manner , and boys of twelve and upwards might find it interesting reading . Very much better than it , however , and for readers about the same age , is Mr. Locker 's story of life in the Australian gold diggings . Mr. Locker seems to understand his audience better , and to respect both them and himself more than is often the case with people who write for boys . His incidents are exciting without being unhealthily so ; and , with every temptation and facility for heightening his effects by means of the horrible , he never tells a cruel story , keeps himself well within the bounds of probability , and writes with a pleasant straightforwardness which will do his readers good . It is a book which may safely be put into the hands of boys , which is true of very few of the books written expressly for them . We being judge , as much could by no means be said of Mrs. Wood 's " Orville College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to us to be worse than worthless ; and the only moral it would be likely to suggest to readers of any age is , that a little less Christian forbearance , and a little more manly assertion of his authority and his claims to respect on the part of the martyr of the story , the persecuted German master , would have been much better for all parties concerned . This is the book , too , which Mr. Hope , the amusing author of the " Book about Boys , " criticised as having been written in a " peculiar dialect , based upon English " a criticism which any page taken at random more than justifies . We can not number the years since our first reading of William Howitt 's " Jack of the Mill , " but it was long ago , and we are glad to see the story revived , finding our pleasant recollections of it confirmed on reperusal . It is not beyond criticism , as an artistic narration , but that will not injure it in the opinion of its proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretty much as it was told by the fireside , being , as the preface describes it , a " hatch-up " ? that is , a tale invented as the author went along , and therefore unnecessarily ( though we think agreeably ) spun out with descriptions of nature and other makeshifts for the exercised imagination , This is especially true of the first part , which only after repeated tellings , perhaps , was linked with a more serious design than pure entertainment . As it is , it is a semi-historical novel , relating to the persecutions of the Lollards and the wars of the Hussites , under Ziska , and inculcating religious freedom also by examples of Jewish fidelity and humanity . The portraiture of Old England in those days , both in its scenery and in its social and political condition , is calculated to leave truthful and lasting impressions , while the romantic adventures of the hero are , if our own experience is a test , sure to be vividly remembered beyond the age of childhood .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
