txt An attempt to halt liquor " traffic " across the Connecticut border into Westchester County was disclosed today with the arrest of two persons , one of whom was seized late yesterday and the other today on the complaint of the Westchester County Liquor Dealers Association . One of those arrested , Mrs. Frank D. Potter of Rye , wife of a New York broker , was stopped here while driving to her home from Greenwich , Conn. , where she had purchased four bottles of gin and six bottles of wine . The wine , it was reported , cost a little more in Connecticut than in New York , but the gin was said to be $2.40 a case cheaper . The difference in price results from the absence of a State tax in Connecticut . The arrest of Mrs. Potter was made on the complaint of James Warnick , an investigator for the Westchester County Liquor Dealers Association . Mrs. Potter , who lives at Windcrest Road , Rye , was taken into custody by Patrolman Roland Patterson of Port Chester lupon the insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had all the evidence necessary . She was taken before Police Judge Abraham Tunick and Charged specifically with " feloniously , wrongfully , unlawfully , willully , falsely and knowingly " violating Section 102 , Article 8 of Chapter 478 of the State ABC Laws . " She was released in her own recognizance for hearing Friday . The other person arrested was Joseph Ryan , 40 years old , of 756 Main Street , New Rochelle . The complaint against him was signed by Harry Rhodes of 58 Buena Vista Avenue , Yonkers . Mr. Rhodes also is an investigator of the Westchester organization . The victim in this case was charged with transporting " wine and liquor . " He was re- I leased for hearing Monday . Connecticut liquor dealers indicated tonight that action would be taken against the Port Chester police . The Connecticut Retail Package Stores Association is planning to seek an injunction against further interference , it Was reported ' . When the matter of Mrs. Potter 's arrest was brought unofficially to the attention of Edward P. Mulrooney , chairman of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mulrooney asked the inquirer : " Was she transporting the liquor in her own private conveyance ? " A nswe r ? " Yes . " Mr. Mulrooney ? " Was it for her own personal use ? " Answer ? " Yes . " Mr. Mulrooney ? " Well , in that event I see no violation of the law . However , it is a matter for the judge to decide . But at the same time it must be remembered that liquor is no longer contraband . Why , up at the Canadian border private parties are bringing back a few bottles every day without breaking a law and I see no reason why it can not be done here . It would be a different matter if the liquor were consigned from Connecticut to New York to an unlicensed party or if it were transported in an unlicensed truck , but to bring in a few bottles of liquor for personal use is in my opinion perfectly lawful . " On the other hand , the complainant in the case contended that the liquor was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor or wine . " Mr. Warnick cited as follows from the ABC laws : " No common carrier or other person shall bring Or carry into the State any liquors and/or wines , unless the same shall be consigned to a person duly licensed hereunder to traffic in liquors and/ or wines as the case may be . " Meanwhile . Mrs. Potter , who declined to make a statement in her behalf , epgaged for her defense the law firm of Peck &; Schmidt , of which Frederick G. Schmidt , chairman of the County Board of Supervisors , is a partner . Iring ** a member of the firm , who was assigned to the cane , held that the ABC laws did not apply in this case . If they did , Mr. Toohill alleged , they could be upset on the ground of unconstitutionality . He pointed out that persons returning from foreign countries are permitted to carry $100 worth of liquor into New York State without question . " Why . " he asked , " should not the same apply to Connecticut ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Connecticut to evade the New York State tax laws . Mris . Potter , whose husband is a member of the firm of Pouch &; Co. , 1 Wall Street , and also is vice president and director of the American Oil Royalties Company of New York , could not be reached for comment tonight . Mr. Potter told callers there would be no statement made . From another member of the association . M. 3 , Passel , chairman of its law-enforcement committee , it was learned that the first arrests are for a threefold purpose . They are , according to Mr. Passel , In discourage law breaking by purchases outside the State , to protect local liquor dealers who suffer by this type of transportation , and to bring to the attention of the State Legislature the unequal tax laws . Mr. Passel said he was metropolitan counsel for the Retail Liquor Stores Association of New York City , of which the Westchester association was a unit . The other branches are in Manhattan , Bronx , Brooklyn and Long Island . -A crew of investigators has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and has collected considerable data against others buying outside the State , Mr. Passel declared . Chief of Police Leo Brogan of Port Chester said no arrests would be made by the police here except on specific complaints . At Greenwich , Gustav Dahl , manager of the Horseneck Liquor Corporation , where Mrs. Potter made her purchase said may of his customers were from Westchester and New York City . Rye whisky , he said , was $3 a case less in Connecticut and Scotch and Gin was $2.40 less than in New York . Wine , however , he declared , was more expensive because the Connecticut general sales tax . is more drastic than ' the New York State wine tax .
