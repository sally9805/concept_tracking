Invited last autumn to speak to the students of brokerage at the New " York Stock Exchange " Institute , " SECommis-sioner William Orville ( " Bill " ) Douglas stirred up a teapot tempest in Wall Street by unburdening himself on the " unestablished value " of customers ' men , a financial tribe marked for early SEC attention . Referring to the " practice of gentlemen teaching gentlemanly ways of redistributing the wealth of their clients , " tart-tongued Bill Douglas went on to observe : <P> " That which will at times appear to you , either by example or by precedent , as the end of the rainbow will be a carnation in your lapel and the comfortable club life of your city . . . . Your profession has no particular claim to distinction in this respect . . . . Our educational system has been too virile in production of men immunized from a sense of feeling of social responsibility ; trained in the art of plunder in gentlemanly ways ; imbued with the false ideal that the American way means exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his address to the undergraduate customers ' men . the genteel New York Times reported , " some of his hearers were dismayed by what they regarded as the cynical attitude of the speaker . " <P> Last week Commissioner Douglas again journeyed to Manhattan to make a speech , this time to the well-heeled members of the Bond Club . Again he spoke his mind " unofficially " but with almost savage candor . Because his subject was broader , his suggestions more radical and , more important , because he is a likely candidate for the SEChairmanship after James McCauley Landis retires next summer , his Bond Club speech reverberated in every banking house in the land . For the 38-year-old onetime Yale law professor proposed nothing less than a complete remaking of the country 's investment business . Said he : " Today , as you well know , we have a practical usurpation of the rights of the great body of investors , which can be only described as financial royalism . Our pres ent situation is a carryover from a previous age when there were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply when we are today a nation of investors . " The problem was , he said , to achieve " democratization in industrial management , " to make management responsive to the will of the " real owners of the business . " Commissioner Douglas ' solution harmonized perfectly with the dominant theme in SEC thinking : segregation and subdivision of the functions of finance to minimize , real or potential conflicts of interest . Among other things he would : 1 ) Remove bankers from industrial directorates ( " The economic utility of continuity of banking relationships is of unestablished value " ) . <P> 2 ) Require competitive bidding on new corporate issues ( " The banker may frequently exact charges from the company with little or no economic justification " ) . <P> 3 ) Divorce underwriting from security selling so that the underwriter , freed of the urge to manufacture salable merchandise , might act as an independent middle man representing the public ( " A type of dynamic salesmanship has taken root with in the securities business , in which it has no proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
