Take a Chance ( book by Bud G. De Sylva &; Laurence Schwab ; music by Nacio Herb Brown , Richard Whiting . Vincent Youmans ; Laurence Schwab , producer ) is fast , noisy , funny . It reverts to the pre-Depression type of musicomedy , makes no pretense of smartness but loses no entertainment value by its atavism . Buried in a torrent of gags , girls and Jew blues is a plot : a Harvardman , trying to cash in on his Hasty Pudding Club theatrical experience , woos and wins a lowly dancer whose fortune two shoe-string impresarios try to promote . No Harvardman was ever more blond and decorous than Jack Whiting ( America 's Sweetheart ) . No impresarios were ever more feverishly active than droll , cow-eyed Jack Haley ( Free For All ) , and hook-nosed Sid Silvers , who used to sit in an upper box and insult Phil Baker . Cropping out here &; there in the proceedings is curvesome , loud-shouting Ethel Merman ( Zimmerman ) . <P> Funniest situation : Messrs . Haley &; Silvers finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same bed . Most amusing lyric , sung by Miss Merman in a levee resort : <P> Eadie was a lady <P> Though her life was shady . <P> Though her life was merry <P> She had savoir fairey . <P> Eadie had class With a cap-i-tul K. . . . <P> There are other good songs ( " I Got Religion , " " Should I Be Sweet ? " ) but " Smoothie , " rendered by Mr. Haley and Miss Merman , consistently manages to stop the show to the embarrassment of Funnyman Silvers whose adjacent skit begins with his being kicked out of a saloon . The first two nights he was kicked out eight times . Take a Chance affords capital amusement-with a cap-i-tul K. <P> The Mad Hopes ( by Romney Brent ; Bela Blau. producer ) . From Romney Brent , a mad little player , could well be expected a mad little play . Pomposity is a Brent specialty , and the name of his heroine , an extremely fey matron , keys the whole comedy-Clytemnestra Hope . <P> Her long-suffering husband dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a dinner in the Russian Embassy . The play finds Clytemnestra , her two antic sons and more sensible daughter inhabiting their villa at Nice , broke . Even the daughter 's practical U. S. suitor can not keep Mrs. Hope from buying on credit everything she fancies , blackmailing the maid out of back wages , formulating grandiose schemes for selling " her poor little home " to an unborn literary club . With a pleasantly insane gleam in her eyes , she falls out with everyone , instantly makes up does housework in a white satin ball gown , frequently retires to her bedroom and communicates with her children on postal cards carried by the maid . An amiable rich Jew . whom she thinks " so Oriental . " finally appears to solve her difficulties . <P> Violet Kemble Cooper bustles through the delicate , amusing fabric of the piece with great success . The Mad Hopes warrants a visit if only to hear her gravely remark over a telephone : " Shakespeare ? - yes- yes- very talented . " <P> Gay Divorce ( libretto by Dwight Taylor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producer ) . For this bright little musicomedy Composer Porter ( The New Yorkers ) , whom Yalemen remember as the author of " Bulldog , Bull-dog , " has written some of his most beguiling melodies and lyrics .
