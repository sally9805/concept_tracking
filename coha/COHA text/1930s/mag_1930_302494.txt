Opera Glasses in the Senate Sirs : <P> WHY ? Recently I visited , for the first time , the two Houses of Congress in the Capitol at Washington , D. C. <P> It happens that my eyesight is seriously impaired and I frequently carry opera glasses to help out . I had anticipated pleasure in looking at , and identifying , many of the august ( ? ) members of the upper house , including Borah , Glass , Tom Tom Heflin who mortally fears , etc . Imagine my chagrin when I lifted my glasses to my eyes , to be told by the doorkeeper that it was verboten to make use of opera glasses in the Senate galleries . <P> Not so the House , to them it matters not , and if one wants to gaze down upon them through a length of stove pipe it is O. K. <P> Can you ascertain just why the Senators are so sacrosanct that one violates the properties in gazing at them through opera glasses ? <P> Does it make the dear things nervous ? <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presumably because the size of the room permits of high visibility with the naked eye the use of binoculars is habitually forbidden in the Senate chamber ( there is no written rule ) .
