Rev. Charles E. Coughlin boasted that he would swing 9,000,000 votes in the last Presidential campaign , but neither major party made any noticeable effort to enlist his support . When election time rolls around , the man upon whom wise political bosses count is not the howling demagog , but the obscure little wardheeler who , through family , friends and acquaintances , can be counted on to deliver 50 or 60 certain votes . Of the smallest cog in the political machine , the precinct executive who lives with his constituents and does favors for them year in &; out , Pundit Frank Kent wrote in The Great Game Of Politics : " He is the bone and sinew of the machine . He is its foundation and the real source of its strength . If he does not function , the machine decays . If he quits , the machine dies . He is the actual connecting link between the people and the organization , and he is the only connecting link-the only man in the machine who has any point of direct contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has any real influence with them . " <P> All the ordinary heeler wants in return for his services is a small official job and accompanying " perquisites . " If his party stays out of power too long , he will grow discouraged , seek other livelihood . That is what has been happening to the Republican machine since 1932 . But the heeler may be equally bereft if his party wins too often and too easily . For then the party generals and captains and lieutenants come to believe that they themselves achieved the victories , forget the rear-rank privates who did the actual fighting . <P> Last week in Washington one Walter L. Williams , a minor clerk in the office of the U. S. Engineers , announced formation of the National Union for Collective Bargaining for Democratic Workers . Clerk Williams , who once heeled in South Philadelphia 's " Little Italy , " proposed to build up a regular heelers ' union , with dues , locals , organizers and perhaps eventually affiliation with either the American Federation of Labor or the Committee for Industrial Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only machine men who even know the precinct workers ' names , and the only ones through whom they can do business with the higher-ups . <P> " We believe we can save the New Deal from the despotism of these petty party chieftains , " cried Organizer Williams . " They 're ensconced now . They feel they 're settled . There 's no more liberality . You ca n't even get in to see some of them . "
