txt The theologians of the Middle Ages who argued on the number of angels that could stand on the point of a needle are intellectual kin of our mathematical physicists who are trying to explain the nucleus of the atom . Like the angels , the protons , electrons , deuterons and neutrons about which we read are hypotheses . Luminous tracks are seen on a photographic plate . They are our only justification for assuming that particles are hurled out of the nucleus . It is a necessary assumption . Without it we could explain nothing about the atom  --  itself a hypothesis . Granting that the mysterious particles are indeed ejected when neutrons batter nuclei , what holds the atom and hence the universe together ? Gravitation , electricity , magnetism  --  none of these answers . Their " laws " have no validity- within the atom . So at last week 's symposium on nuclear physics held at Cornell , Professor H. A. BETHE suggested that undiscovered forces must be at work of which we have no conception . It may be so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the artful dodging in which science sometimes indulges . Not so long ago we were told by EDDINGTON , JEANS and others that to describe the behavior of two electrons , no fewer than seven dimensions , were necessary , one of which is our Einsteinian friend , spacetime . Does this mean that the two electrons , can not exist without seven dimensions , just as we can not exist without air and water ? Not at all , admit the learned . Merely that there is no other way of describing what happens when a system of two electrons is formed . Or as one astute scientist put it : " It is not the electrons that require " the seven dimensions , but the mathe " maticians . " So it is with the forces that Dr. BETHE believes that we need . His . plea is a confession that the mathematical physicist is baffled . It was not GOD but NEWTON who created gravitation  --  created it because a force was needed to explain mechanically how the solar system hangs together and operates : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , explained without anything so crude and Animistic as " force . " Yet here is Professor BETHE demanding new forces , more forces . Have n't we complexity enough ? What we need is unity , sim-plicity . At one extreme are the stars and nebulae behaving quite in accordance with relativity ; at the other , atoms with nuclei composed of hypothetical particles about which very little . is known and which must be explained in alccordance with a quantum theory , that has no relation to nebulae and stars . Oh , for another Newton to link atoms and stars in some superb , dazzlingly simple formula . Out seven dimensions , our longing for new forces would vanish like smoke in air . President Sraout of the University of California raid at a meeting of the National Education Association in Portland a word that should be repeated about youth , to whom we are making so many apologies these days : that there " must be nurtured in youth " that natural self-reliance and rode " pendence of action which is perhaps " their most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
