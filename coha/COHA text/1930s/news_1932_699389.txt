To judge by reports from the Executive and some of his close advisers , the prospects are not bright . " If not , we would be obligated to call an extra session .

" Collier Looks to Sales Tax . The executive session of the committee on Jan. 3 . Mr. Collier said , will be a round table discussion , in which he will call on all members for their views on possible sources of revenue . " I would rather have the dentist pull my baciv teeth than to support a sales tax , ' ' Mr. Collier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over very carefully and I am afraid that I do not see any other possible tax . But we are going to balance the budget , in fairness to the country and to the incoming administration , by whatever means is possible . " Asked what rate of taxation the sales tax would carry in the event the committee recommended it , Mr. Collier said that " if the President vetoes the beer bill , we will have to raise the sales-tax rate to compensate for the lost revenue . That will be his lookout , just as it is our lookout for vetoing some of his economy measures . " la the absence of definite figures from the Treasury , Mr. Collier estimated that his committee would have to raise about a half billion dollars to bring the budget into balance . The budget balance to which Mr. Collier referred would rest on the exclusion of capital outlays , such as public works construction , from the expenditures . The plan of financing such work by long-term bonds , with sinking fund provisions , was advanced by Governor Roosevelt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shift in gentiment Reported . Since stating on Saturday that he thought the sales tax had little chance of passing thin session of C-Augress , Mr. Collier said today that ht. has been informed unofficially there has been considerable change of sentiment in the House . " My State - has a sales tax , " he said . " so that a Federal sales tax would mean double taxation . However , we can not let the problems of the States stand in the way of balancing the Federal budget . The country is now running behind at the rate of about $100,000,000 a month , and no organization can stand that for long . " It will be impossible to balance the budget through economy in expenditure , Mr. Collier said . He indicated that the Ways and Means Committee probably would not summon Secretary Mills to appear in connection with any sales tax recommendations , " as he had made his position quite clear . " " Besides , " he added , " we would only get into a row if he did come . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
