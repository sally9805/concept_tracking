Franklin Roosevelt , master of words , is allergic to certain words with which the press has ticketed his acts . He disliked " death sentence " when applied to his holding-company bill . He felt that " court-packing plan " was unjust to his attempted reform of the Federal judiciary . " Purge " he hated ; it smacked of Stalin and Hitler . By last week a new word annoyed him : " appeasement , " as applied to his big push to restore Business confidence . " Appeasement " sounded as though he had done something to Business for which he now sought to apologize . <P> Under-Secretary John Hanes solved this phraseological problem at the Treasury by having printed in black on a batch of blue cards , to be attached to interoffice correspondence , an oft-repeated question of Secretary Morgenthau : " Does it contribute to Recovery ? " At the White House , when Mr. Roosevelt expressed displeasure at " appeasement , " correspondents asked him for a better word . He mused a while , then said he would look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roosevelt Recovery push proceeded on a dozen fronts-but not without incongruities . The most notable pushes : <P> 1 ) The President began tax-bill conferences with Messrs . Morgenthau &; Hanes about the possibility of removing tax deterrents to Business ( capital stock , capital gains , undistributed-profits taxes , the rule disallowing profit- &-loss; offsets from one year to the next ) . The President was described as agreeable to most of their suggestions so long as revenue is not cut . Chairman Pat Harrison of the Senate Finance Committee , field marshal of Vice President Garner 's Economy bloc ( see col. 3 ) , sat in on one session , after which he described the President 's tax attitude as " fine , harmonious . " <P> 2 ) The President 's Secretary of Commerce announced that U. S. national income might reach 70 billions this year , that he meant everything he said at Des Moines ( TIME , March 6 ) , that " Johnny Hanes and I have a substantial meeting of minds . " Word even went round that arch-New Dealers suspected Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> 3 ) Although the President again asked for another appropriation for WPA ( see col. 3 ) , his WPAdministrator " Pink " Harrington followed Congress ' instructions by purging 30,000 aliens ( 2,000 in Texas alone ) , and an unannounced number of political job holders , from his payrolls . He also called in all his regional directors to plan the discharge of 1,000,000 clients in case Congress was slow or balky about the money . <P> 4 ) Although the President is opposed to economy at the expense of national defense , last week he telephoned to tell Chairman May of the House Military Affairs Committee to cut from $25,000,000 to $10,000,000 the amount to be expended this year on the proposed $100,000,000 purchase of strategic imported raw materials for war ( tin , manganese , mercury , etc. , etc . ) . He announced he favored double-locking the Panama Canal instead of digging a second canal across Nicaragua , on grounds of economy ( $200,000,000 as against $720,000,000 ) .               @ @ @ @ @ @
