 | Bringing Back the Beaver Condensed from Natural History William H. Carr Director , Bear Mountain Trailside Museums BEFORE his near-extinction by the white man , the energetic beaver was America 's foremost conservation agent . His millions of dams from coast to coast stored the rainfall , prevented floods and erosion - and subsequent drought . Today the beaver is coming back ; the Department of the Interior and many state agencies are increasingly using this industrious animal engineer in their land reclamation programs . Last year a number of watercourses in Idaho were stocked with beaver . Already the animals have constructed dams that will increase the water facilities of the entire region . A field report from this area states : " One planting of beaver has constructed 17 dams on a small stream which a few years ago ran barely enough water for a horse to drink . The construction work made a continuous water supply , with ponds deep enough to form meadows along the formerly eroded stream . These ponds are also making excellent duckand trout-breeding grounds . In a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely destroyed . " How the beaver can restore the land has been strikingly shown in the Palisades Interstate Park at Bear Mountain , 40 miles north of New York City . In 1920 , three pairs of beavers were released there . By natural increase , they have now formed more than 6o colonies , spread over a 30-mile radius . Each pair annually raise from three to five young . Kittens appear in late April and when a year old they wander off to find mates in other colonies , build new ponds and lodges . Thus in 18 years it is estimated that more than 200o have sprung from the original three pairs ; many have been shipped to other states to carry on woodland rehabilitation . One pair in the Park were carefully watched . Journeying down a small brook , they selected a rocky gorge as a homesite . With sod , poplar branches , and small stones , the beaver dammed the stream . As the dam was enlarged , the pond deepened , the water soon covering several acres . Near the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge , made its appearance . The beaver home may be likened to a castle with a moat . Since they  | are unable to breathe under water , or to hold their breath for more than 11 y minutes , the living rooms of their lodge must be above water and ventilated . Underwater entrances lead upward through the stick-and-mud walls to the inside landing platform . When winter came , with eight inches of ice , the beaver were well established in a world of their own . The principal food of beaver is bark , preferably alder , aspen and poplar . Thus not a thing is wasted , for they consume the outward covering of their own building material . In addition , they eat lily bulbs , grasses , roots and leaves ; being strict vegetarians , they do not eat fish , fowl or insects . Since beaver do not hibernate , it is necessary for them in northern Iatitudes to store their food beneath t he ice . Consequently , in the fall , many small trees are felled and submerged near the lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile , quickly chews off a branch , : lid carries it into the house for a meal . Rarely are fine trees killed by beaver , although I have seen z8-inch trees cut down . For five years the Bear Mountain beaver labored in the little valley , as others were doing elsewhere in the park . Then the food near the pond became exhausted . The beaver left , in search of greener pastures . Though the dam was built solidly , r t soon commenced to disintegrate , deprived of the ever-vigilant bea- ver 's care . Receding waters revealed rich , black soil stored upon the pond bottom . While the dam had permitted a steady flow of water , even in dry seasons , it had nevertheless withheld topsoil and humus which otherwise would have been washed downstream during flood periods . Later that same summer , as the stream resumed its former course , small plants covered the moist pond bed . Deer came to feed in the new meadow . Each year the green tangle grew higher , binding the soil against spring freshets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fishermen sometimes complain that beaver ponds spoil their sport . As a matter of fact , they serve as breeding places not only for fish but for fish food . Of course there are instances where beaver become nuisances , flooding roads , destroying fruit trees , or otherwise interfering with man 's property . But it is a simple matter to capture beaver alive in large wiremesh traps and transport them to streams where their work will be valuable . The beaver 's chief tools are his four curved front teeth and his clever forepaws . These front teeth are some two and one half inches long , and their cutting edge is replaced as wear occurs , an ideal arrangement for an animal that will bite through a fourinch tree in 2o minutes . His flat , paddle-shaped tail serves as a prop when its owner is cutting down trees ,  | as a rudder when swimming , and as a warning device when danger threatens - the pistol-like report of the tail , brought down smartly upon the water , may be heard for half a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses his tail to plaster mud , or to ferry material across a pond , is false . Wrong , too , is the belief that beaver can cause a tree to fall in a given direction . Beaver have been killed by trees they have felled , so that if they determine the direction of fall they must have committed suicide . Truth about the beaver is remarkable enough to need no embroidering . Thanks to the accessibility of Bear Mountain Park , hundreds of thousands of campers and motorists have observed the fascinating life of this industrious animal . A Beaver Museum , with live animals , has been established in the park . Many campers have spent evening hours beside a beaver dam . n one occasion a patrolman gave an impromptu lecture to motorists while a particularly tame beaver pulled branches of a tree across the road , down a bank , and into the water . No man will ever know how many fertile fields were created by beaver in eras gone by . It is indeed heartening that the beaver is to have his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small empires for himself , but literally to knit ours more closely together .
