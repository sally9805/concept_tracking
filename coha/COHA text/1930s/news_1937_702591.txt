" The Committee had threatened a strike unless the cm poration agreed to bargaining conferences at cnce. ny a Stoll ** of 7 he tinging &fence; llonstor WASHINGTON . May 5 ? While discussions of new labor legislation continue it is clearly apparent here today following the second of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences that unless something very unexpected happens there will be no federal legislation for at least a year on this subject . In fact . it is learned . the important labor leaders who listened sympathetically to such discussions before the Supreme Court decided in fits or of the Wagner Act have now let it be known that they will oppose strongly any action for the time being . They insist that there must he at least a year " trial period " un- . der the Wagner Act before any further steps are considered . The unstated attitude of the labor leaders is reflected in the public statement of Miss Perkins who , yesterday , following a five hour con ; ference with representatives of labor . employers and the general public , expressed her disapproval of any modification of the Wagner Act until more experience has been gained under its operation or until ; it can be proven to be unfair to employers . Conference In Secret What happened in the conference itself remains an official secret Miss Perkins announced only that it has been a helpful - free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor mediation facilities in the different states . But from several independent sources it was learned that the conference , as its predecessor tu o Weeks ago . served Primarily to emphasize the enormous gulf which still exists between employer and labor on the subject of collective bargaining . At the first conference it was proposed to announce that all were agreed on the desirability of collecInc bargaining . To this the spokesman of a well-known organization representing employers objected , stating that many of its members " did not believe in colleotive bargaining " irrespective of the Supreme Court 's stamp of approval on it . Similarly labor leaders refused to commit themselves to any announcements of agreement . Yesterday 's session . due to the experience at the first , was unmai red by any effort to secure an aareement . The 26 individuals present - pent the day listening to about 12 of their number talk on the uppermost subject of labor relations . Hon enter , Miss Perkins believes in the %aloe of continuing such talks and plans to call a third conference a ' thin the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a gradual rapprochement can be brought about between the two great groups smarting limn the memory of recent atr.kes. and sit-downs on the one hand and of examples of employer ruthlessness of the Harlan County taiiety on the other . Power of Labor Support Recalled by the current situation as regards labor relations legislation is are fact that since the Roosevelt Administration took office in 1932 no laws have been passed on this subject which did not have the backing of labor . The NRA was the product of co-operation between industrial and labor lobbies . It was drafted originally within the walls of the U S. Chamber of Commerce building but the last votes in the Senate were gathered by a lobbyist for the American Federation of Labor . It is a practical political fact that no labor legislation can be put through Congress today without the appro  --  al of the major labor organizations  --  the A. F. of L and the C. I. 0 . This approval is now being withheld . The obvious conclusion IS that industry and business can talk themselves blue over what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be of no a  --  ail until such time as they can persuade labor that changes are to the advantage of both . But that time is not yet .
