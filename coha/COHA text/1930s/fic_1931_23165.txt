IN LOVING MEMORY A STORY BY ROLAND ENGLISH MOTLEY T HERE had not been so many people in the flat in all the years that he and Clara had lived here . For Clara was never much of a one for company . Now that the flat was full of people , Mr. Scotten felt himself growing strangely excited . All his other feelings were being absorbed in this one . For he was n't used to people . No more at work than at home . His little office at the hardware store where he was bookkeeper was on a mezzanine in the rear . Looking up from his desk be could see , through the wall of glass , people coming into the shop and going out again . But since he never heard their voices , but only saw their gestures , accompanied by silence , they were more like pictures than people . Then , at home , after dinner , he always sat in the front room and read his paper while Clara cleared things away . One day , a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , " Say , Joe , I pass your house at night when I 'm going down to get the street car ; and I can look in the window and see the back of your head and your hands holding up the newspaper ; and , by God , no matter how often I go by , there you are , and your head 's never an inch north or south of the regular place ! " The fellow had laughed as heartily as if there were something to laugh about ; and Mr. Scotten had grownunaccountably angry . That night he had moved his chair to the other side of the bridge lamp ; but the moment Clara came into the room she insisted the chair would have to go back ; and while he stood there guiltily she set it at the exact angle with the edge of the rug that seemed most effective to her . Clara was always particular about such things . " I do n't like chairs just stuck around any old way , " she said . On the next night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled down the shade as soon as be had lighted the lamp . But Clara , coming in later , was even less patient with this innovation . " Nobody can really look in , " she told him ; " and I do like to have the place looking cheerful from the outside . " Mr. Scotten could never understand Clara 's concern for the opinion of neighbors she had next to nothing to do with ; but of course if she wanted the shade up he would n't pull it down . For a night or two he tried reading in the dining room . " What in the world 's got into you , Joe ? " Clara demanded . " How can I get things cleared up with you sitting here ? Now you go on into the other room . " So Mr. Scotten 's head appeared thereafter in its usual place  --  his head that was growing quite gray these last years , with the hair a little thin on top . For a while he sat down each evening in a mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , he was thinking . . . . But after a few months he quite forgot about it . Once in a long while he suggested to Clara that they might go out for the evening . But Clara was a thorough homebody . " I 'm on my feet just about all day , " she said , " and when night comes I 'm satisfied just to get into my slippers and sit and take things easy . " On Sunday afternoon , if it was sunny and not too windy , they sometimes went to Golden Gate Park to hear the band play . They sat on one of the benches near a walk where they could watch the people passing . Clara liked to notice what the women wore . Leaning close to Joe and speaking from the corner of her mouth , she remarked on their costumes as they passed before her . Joe was more interested in people 's faces . " I wonder what some of them are like , " he often said . For as long as they sat there he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near . " They look kind of interesting , " he explained if Clara rebuked him for the steadiness of his gaze . Sometimes he even added , " I think I 'd like to know those folks , " and an eager note , almost of wistfulness , crept into this . It seemed too bad , in a world so full of people , to live too much to oneself and know all the others only as passers-by . But Clara always said , " Oh , people are all just about alike . " And perhaps they were . Mr. Scotten had had little opportunity of knowing . And that is why it was so exciting , now , to have all these people coming . The neighbors had been very good to him , considering how little friendliness Clara had ever shown . The Braggs downstairs , for instance . Clara bad always said , " We must n't be too friendly with people so close or itmight get to be a terrible nuisance . " And now the Braggs had just about taken charge of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done without them . As often as he went into the front room , Mr. Scotten had a feeling that Clara would be greatly disturbed if she could see the chairs " all stuck around " this way . He would go quickly over to Clara on some vague impulse to reassure her ; and at once when he saw her face he would know that Clara was not disturbed . Through all the twenty-three years of their life together he had never known Clara so calm as this , so unconcerned as to what went on in the flat . Standing there beside her , the horror of having her lying here like this came flooding again over Mr. Scotten . He could feel his arms beginning to tremble and his knees growing weak . If he were alone it would be very easy to kneel there . . . But he was never left standing alone for long . Almost at once someone would come up to him . A hand would come under his arm and a voice would begin talking about Clara . Mr. Scotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find so many things to say about her . Listening to them , answering their questions , he would feel the excitement coming over him again . The last day , the day when Clara went away from the flat , was the busiest and most exciting time of all . It was hard for Mr. Scotten to remember the names of all the people who came , but he did his best . The front room looked very splendid . There was hardly room to put all the flowers and still have space for getting about . Clara had never had more than a few blossoms in a vase , because she thought they made the air too heavy . Mr. Scotten now had to fight down the impulse to open wide all the windows ; he knew that is what Clara would do . Clara would say , " Goodness , I ca n't breathe in here ! " .. . As the slow , heavy words droned on and on , more like music than words with any seizable meaning , Mr. Scot-ten , sitting there between Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rough neck , and Mrs. Bragg , who breathed now and then in sudden long , deep sighs and then seemed to forget for a while the need of breathing  --  Mr. Scotten was thinking of the beautiful place they were going to take Clara . It was n't hard at all to think of her going away to a place so beautiful as that . He only hoped it was what Clara would have wanted . He could n't be sure ; they had never talked of this . Why should they How could they know that all at once , right at the onset of their middle years , one of them would lie down and say , " I do n't know just what 's the matter ; I do n't feel very well " . .. and never get up again . No ; they had n't ever talked about it ; and when Mr. Scotten was suddenly told , " Now , you must decide which it is to be , " he could only remember that Clara had always exclaimed at the neglect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To think of lying there forever in that mess ! " Clara had once said . He had gone with Mrs. Bragg on one of these last days to see the columbarium . Mrs. Bragg showed him first the niche where her sister 's ashes lay , in the older part of the building , and then led him on into the newer wing , where a series of courts , on slightly different levels , were roofed over by glass that left them as sunny as if they were open to the sky . Only a light screen of slender Gothic columns stood between one court and the next . Canaries sang in cages that hung beneath the pointed arches . Brightflower-beds filled the center of each court . Fountains tinkled in the middle of miniature lawns . It was all so neat and orderly that he thought this was surely the place where Clara would wish to be . It had , moreover , a spaciousness , a suggestion of luxury , that pleased Mr. Scotten 's fancy . Except in the moving pictures now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It made him proud to think of bringing Clara here . When Clara 's sudden illness came he had arranged with Mr. Gilbert to take this as his vacation time ; and even now he still had a week more before he must go back to his glass cage on the mezzanine in the rear of the hardware store . He was glad to have these days to be with Clara in the beautiful new place . On the first morning after Clara 's going away from the flat Mr. Scotten was there early . He went at once to the niche he had chosen  --  a niche low down above a flower-bed where now some yellow snapdragons held up their stiff stalks of bloom , and close beside a fountain that dripped slowly into a basin where goldfish were swimming . The niche was still empty . Mr. Scotten had a momentary feeling of dismay . But at the office they told him they were only waiting for his coming . Bells were rung , messages were sent along the halls , and presently Mr. Scotten met in the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze . This was gently placed in the center of the niche and a glass window set before it , while Mr. Scotten looked on . All this seemed to him to concern Clara no more closely than if it had been one of the preparations for her coming here . The young man finished screwing in the panel of glass , wiped it carefully with his handkerchief , nodded to Mr. Scotten , and went away . Mr. Scotten stood looking through the glass at the burnished bronze urn , and suddenly he knew that Clara was here . He felt a little qualm of uncertainty and suspense , as if he were waiting to know Clara 's judgment . One of the snapdragon stalks came up rather far in front of the narrow window . Mr. Scotten stooped and bent it aside , so that Clara should not be shut away from any of the beauty . A feeling of sureness and peace gradually came over him . He knew that this was the sort of thing that Clara had always liked . He stayed there a long while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in a low voice , " Good-by now , Clara . soon be coming back . " In the afternoon he was there again . Just to be here was comfort closely akin to happiness . The Iow tinkle of the fountain and the gay twittering of the canaries was the fit music to blend with the brightness of the flowers in the sunny courts . And now the organ was being played in the chapel , and its deep , rumbling tones seemed to filter through all the walls , like the immanent voice of the place . And in the afternoon there were more people . Their constant coming and going , in quiet little groups , brought back to Mr. Scotten the excitement of those last days at home with Clara . There was something like a holiday mood to be drawn from the presence of all these people . When the manager from the office passed through the court with a group of visitors and greeted him with a quiet smile , Mr. Scotten felt a glow run through him . He turned quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; were recognized and greeted . The sense of being at home here took hold so strongly on his spirit that when five o'clock came and he was told that the doors were to be closed , Mr. Scot-ten went out onto the street with amomentary feeling of utter desolation , as if there were no place else in the world he could turn to . The flat was tenantless now save for paling memories . The only home with life in it was here . But at the flat that night he found ample to do in setting things to rights , for a thorough cleaning had been a further expression of the friendliness of good Mrs. Bragg . Even the heavy scent of flowers was almost gone from the rooms , replaced by the pungent odor of driven dust . All evening he went about restoring the familiar order . He knew exactly where Clara had kept each chair standing , each vase . In the front room , when he pulled the wide-armed chair to its proper angle with the edge of the rug , he remembered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seeing him sit here night after night . Mr. Scotten felt a tightening in his throat . When he sat here now in the evening Clara would not come out to him from the kitchen , no matter how long he waited . . . . No ; Clara was in the new bright place with the birds and the flowers . He could hardly wait for morning to come , to go hack to her there . All through the final week of the vacation time Mr. Scotten lived his hours in these courts that he had never seen until a few days ago . He wandered from one court to another , he bent over the ferns and the flowers , he went to sit in the chapel when the organ was being played and watched the colored rays from the windows move along the gray-stone columns as if they had a life of their own , like this of the trembling notes . And from all these wanderings he came back to Clara . Each day his sense of being utterly at home here was strengthened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers at the niches came to know him and always had a nod or a word of greeting for him now . It seemed to Mr. Scotten that even some of the canaries recognized him . The week went by very quickly . Almost at once Sunday was here . But Sunday was a day of climax , a festival day . The courts were full of people as Mr. Scotten bad never seen them before . And everyone brought flowers . The narrow room where the flowers held new blossoms , so that the walls grew to be like upright gardens , where every minute new bursts of bloom came forth . There was a mood of brightness over the scene that Mr. Scotten shared in fully . He even had somewhat the sense of being a host here ; for many of these people were coming for the first time . The memories of this day went with Mr. Scotten back to his tasks over the books in the office . When Mr. Gilbert offered his condolences and the boys said , " Too bad , Joe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightness of his thoughts that were constantly wandering back where Clara was . Every angle of these courts , every narrow stairway from one level to the next , every bend of the lawns and droop of the shrubs and flowers was as familiar now to his inner vision as the rooms and furniture of the flat . He had always looked upon Sundays in the past only as days when one might sleep a little longer , and could perhaps go without shaving , and sit around in old clothes . But now Sunday was a day of rich delights . Sunday was the day that all the rest of the week hung waiting for . On Sunday Mr. Scotten was out among people , in a place of beauty . He was here of right , with no need to feel apologetic . He was here because Clara was here . This place was theirs . As the months went by , Mr. Scot-ten 's feeling of proprietorship deepened . Once in a while he could get sufficiently ahead with his tasks to take an hour from his books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts when work was going forward . He liked to watch the gardener setting out new plants in the narrow beds . He would bend above the kneeling man and discuss with him what plants were likely to do best , although he had no knowledge of gardening . All the members of the staff knew him well by now . They said , " Howdyc-do , Mr. Scotten , " when he came . He spoke to them about any changes that he noticed . " That 's a very handsome urn up there by the stairway , " he would say ; or , " That side of the Court of Palms is filling up quite nicely . " Sometimes he took an hour to walk about , through the old parts and the new , reading the names and dates on the urns . He read these names so often that many of them had a ring of familiarity for him now and when in his slow wandering , his mind attuned to the dull progression of names , he came to an urn that bore the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental groping before he connected this with himself . Clara was slowly becoming one of the others here . She was only a part now of the meaning of this place . Life and death were growing inextricably confused . With the people who came regularly to the court , those who had niches near his own , Mr. Scotten felt himself on terms of growing intimacy . Often they told him something of their lives , and he in turn found much to say of his own . Life had never seemed so full before , so various and rich . In the year and more since Mr. Scotten 's first coming to the court its niches had become densely populated . There were left now but few more opportunities of entrance to this fellow-ship . The second niche above Clara 's , in the tier to the left , was the last to be tenantless near at hand ; and one Sunday when Mr. Scotten came there was an urn bearing the name John Maurie , with a final date already several months old . Later in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche . She was a short , rather plump little woman , with a round face and quick-glancing eyes . In one hand she carried flowers , with a florist 's twist of paper about them ; with the other she reached up for the empty metal cornucopia ; and then stood looking rather helplessly back and forth from one hand to the other . Mr. Scotten after a moment went up to her , holding his hat in his hand , and spoke in the low voice that was usual here . " The flower room . . . where we arrange the flowers , you know . . . is around on the other side . " She gladly accepted his offer of guidance there , and in the narrow little room he stood beside her at the shelf while she set the iris one by one in the metal vase and took endless care arranging the asparagus fern . Then he went back with her to the court by the fountain . " I 'm all mixed up in this place , " she said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem so to me , " Mr. Scotten said . " I know it very well . " She turned to him with a gentle glance . " Your . .. your ... ? " she began questioningly . They were back by the niches now , and Mr , Scotten pointed to the urn with Clara 's name . " My wife .. . Clara , " he said . " That 's a lovely place , " she murmured , " right there by the fountain . " " Yes . . . Clara always kind of liked to hear water running " His companion had bent nearer to read the dates . " My husband 's been gone nearly eight months , " she said as she straightened up . " It 's hard , is n't it ? " The ring for the vase at her niche was above her easy reach , and Mr. Scot-ten set the flowers in place for her , though he himself was far from being a tall man and had to go up on his toes to do it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Maurie was breathing beside him . " It 's just the sort of place that John would like . " They walked about a little in the court , to see the different kinds of flowers set freshly everywhere ; and then they sat for a while in the wicker chairs in the wide place of the path , where the lawn is indented . Mrs. Maurie talked of her husband , who had died in one of the Valley towns . They had almost always lived in country towns , but this last one they had hated , and only business held them there . She knew that John would n't even want to be buried in that place ; and as soon as affairs were settled , she had come away . But being a stranger in a big city was not so pleasant , either  --  especially now . " I used to he lonely too , " Mr. Scot-ten told her , " but coming here Sundays there are always people to talk to , and people coming and going like this all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds and all . . . but especially the people . . . it makes it 1. ind of nice . " Mrs. Maurie sent a volley of her quick little glances about the court but made no other answer . On the next Sunday Mr. Scotten waited rather eagerly for her coming . He had brought some especially handsome roses for Clara 's vase and he hoped that Mrs. Maurie would think them beautiful too . It was late afternoon when she came . Mr. Scotten had almost given her up . She could come any day , he was thinking . But about four o'clock she hurried in . He was watching and he saw her cross the wide entrance hall by the chapel , with her quick little steps . Mr. Scotten went with her again today to the room where she arranged her flowers . Back in the court she admired Mr. Scotten 's roses . She rearranged the maidenhair fern that he had so carefully set about them . To-day they sat once more in the wicker chairs and talked a while . Mrs. Maurie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not knowing a soul , feeling lost in all this hubbub . When she spoke of this , Mr. Scotten found himself pleased by the thought of her loneliness ; for now she would be willing to sit here and they would each have this companionship . To-day when she was leaving she said , " I expect I 'll see you here next Sunday . " And Mr. Scotten answered , " Certainly ! Of course ! " with a fervency quite unusual to him . After a number of Sundays he felt that he and Mrs. Maurie were friends . Though she never stayed for long there was time in their repeated talks for much give and take of personal reminiscence ; and when she was not there he was thinking so much of what she had told him that it was almost as if they were longer together . He introduced Mrs. Maurie to the other people who came to the court . He felt proud to act as host here . He hoped that this bit of social life might reconcile her somewhat to the barrenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her what coming here had meant to him . He was n't used to explaining himself and found it difficult ; but he brought out fumblingly some account of the narrowness of his life before and the remarkable richness given it by his coming here . Though Mrs. Maurie listened attentively and nodded in a friendly fashion , she did n't seem wholly to understand . " Maybe I 'm different , " was all she said . Mr. Scotten felt quite unhappy on the day she told him that she was going away . She could n't stand the empty city any longer ; even the Valley town had gained a charm in retrospect ; and she was going back . 11r . Scotten felt a little brighter when she added , " Of course I 'll take a run down here once in a while , on account of John . " He eagerly offered to keep flowers in her vase while she was away . " I 'm here so much anyway , " he said ; " and just a few little daisies or lilies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two vases to fill and care for . It was interesting to plan different combinations of flowers , so as to make the two bunches a little unlike , yet without too great an expenditure . Mrs. Maurie was gone for just nine weeks . On the Sunday of her return she and Mr. Scotten greeted each other like old and warm friends . He had already put dahlias in her vase that day , and it was only with much reluctance that she replaced them with the asters she had brought . Mrs. Maurie was willing to stay longer than usual this time , to tell of her trip . It had been a great disappointment , she frankly admitted . The little country town had seemed to her as distasteful as ever ; her old acquaintances had very quickly wearied her . It had been an effort to stay there these nine long weeks ; but she just could n't go running back and forth all the time . " I do n't seem able to get hold of myself at all , " she ended hopelessly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Mr. Scotten felt an impulse to reach over and touch her plump hand that lay in her lap . He did n't yield to the impulse , of course ; but when Mrs. Maurie got up to go he went with her . It was the very first time that he had ever gone away on Sunday before the closing hour . But now it seemed an obligatory act of common friendship not to let Mrs. Maurie go away alone in this mood of depression . It was a long street car ride out to the part of town where she lived . Repeatedly on the way she told Mr. Scot-ten how badly she felt that she could n't offer him dinner . If she just had a place to cook she would be so happy ! But she had only a room in a lodging house . . . oh , a very nice house and very nice people . . . but just a room . It gave her such an uprooted , temporary sort of feeling . Mr. Scotten thought he could understand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , because he had dreaded being cooped up in a room somewhere . He had heard the boys at the store talk of their rooms and he knew he could never stand that way of living . . . . He told Mrs. Maurie of this as they rode far out on the street car . " Oh , you were wise ! " she said ardently . " You do n't know how wise you were ! " He left her at her door , at the top of the bang , high flight of steps ; and all week his memory was harassed by the lonely expression in her eyes as he turned away . It was n't right that a woman should be alone like that . It was bad enough for a man ; much worse , he thought , for a woman . The next Sunday , even though it was much earlier when Mrs. Maurie came , and though she stayed a very short time , Mr. Scotten went with her again . Outside , as they were waiting for a car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . . . maybe . . . could n't we have a bite of dinner somewhere . . . together .. . before you go home ? " Mrs. Maurie was so happy that he was filled with a great glow of pleasure . " I 've been wishing all week , " she said , " that we had done that last time . " The little restaurant that Mx . Scot-ten chose was crowded with returning Sunday motorists ; they could n't even have a table to themselves ; but they enjoyed it none the less and told each other so quite abundantly afterwards . They did not separate without a plan for meeting for another of these pleasant dinners one evening during the week . The next Sunday morning Mr. Scot-ten arrived at the court unusually early . As he arranged the flowers at Clara 's niche , and talked to acquaintances , and did all he could to be helpful to strangers , in the way that had always given him so much pleasure , he felt quite happy and excited ; and he was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wonderful place in all the world . In the afternoon Mrs. Maurie came , and then the day was quite complete . She was scarcely there before she spoke of going ; and though Mr. Scotten would have been glad to stay a little longer , he did not suggest it . Their meetings between one Sunday and the next grew more frequent , and more important to them both ; and after several months it seemed the only natural thing that they should marry . Mr. Scotten had the flat and Mrs. Maurie had her need of a home ; they were both alone ; they liked to be together ; and so , Mrs. Maurie said , it seemed foolish even to hesitate longer about it . She was quite sure in her mind from the first day they spoke of it , and Mr. Scotten gradually grew more sure as they talked on other days . When this much was settled there seemed no reason whatever for waiting longer . They would never be any younger , Mrs. Maurie said . And Mr. Seotten , looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how deeply the lines were cutting in about his eyes and mouth , realized that she was right . He had not before thought of himself as growing old ; age , one way or the other , had meant very little to him . But now he agreed wholly with Mrs. Maurie that what was left of life was a thing to be prized and exalted to all high uses . They were married on a Tuesday and Mrs. Maurie . . . no ; Ella ... it was very hard to think of her except as Mrs. Maurie . . . Ella came at once to the flat . Anything like a trip was out of the question , as he had already had his vacation for the year . It was pleasant , having a companion in the house again . The Braggs , downstairs , thought he had done very wisely in marrying ; they liked Ella from the start . She moved things around a little , and that was disturbing ; but it was nice to have someone to talk to at meal-times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up not very much later than his usual week-day rising hour . He got up very quietly , so as not to disturb Ella . But she was awake . " You do n't have to be up so early this morning , do you ? " she called after him . " I usually try to get over there by about half-past nine or ten , " he explained . She made no answer to this . As he shaved , Mr. Scotten was feeling a little sorry that Ella was n't getting up too , so that they could go over there together . He knew that now she would n't be ready to go out much before noon . He remembered how long it took women . . . . But he would go over for a little while in the morning , then come home for lunch , and in the afternoon they would go together . The thought of their going there together made him happy . It was such a beautiful place . Maybe now that Ella felt more settled , she 'd be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the room , to put on his collar and tie , Ella spoke to him from the bed . " I 've just been thinking , Joe .. . I do n't believe we ought to go over there to-day . " Mr. Scotten turned and faced her , his two hands held out from his throat with the ends of the tie . " You see , " Ella went on slowly , " now that we 're married , it seems to me it would look kind of funny , our going there . " " But I . . . I always go , " he brought out . A slight note of sharpness came into her voice . " We 've been married just five days , Joe , and it seems to me you owe more to me than wanting to go over there . " He let his hands fall slowly to his sides and with the ends of the tie dangling at his shoulders went out into the kitchen . It was quite a while before Ella came out too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe , " was the first thing she said . A little later , as she was busy about the gas range , she said , " I do n't mean to say that we should n't ever go . Of course we 'll want to go once in a while . But just now I certainly do n't think either of us ought to spend as much time there as we used to . To say nothing of just about living there , like you did ! It would n't look right . " " I 'm just sort of used to going there , " he said dully . " That 's just because you did n't have anything else to think about , " she told him . He found it very hard to think of anything else all day . He sat in the front room with the mass of newspaper in his lap , but he could n't read it . This was the first Sunday in more than eighteen months that he had n't been over there . He sat thinking of the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountain , and the way the light fell through the Gothic arches onto the flowers . . . . And all the people . . . . It was very hard to sit here quietly , with these thoughts ; but if he began to go nervously from room to room , Ella said , " Do n't be so fidgety , Joe . " In the middle of the afternoon , when the restlessness was growing almost unendurable , he suddenly thought that perhaps Ella might like to go somewhere else . He eagerly suggested all the places he could think of : the Park , a moving picture show , a walk about the streets . But Ella went on quietly with her sewing . " I 'm a good deal of a homebody , Joe , " she said . " You remember I kept telling you how much I missA having a home . And now that I'vegot one again , I 'll be good and content to stay right in it . " Toward evening he had become a little quieter . After dinner he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he lighted the lamp and dropped into the chair beside it , a memory flashed back to him : that long-legged fellow at the store who had laughed at always seeing his head there , night after night . He scrambled violently out of the chair and took a few quick steps toward the door . " Why , what 's the matter , Joe ? " Ella asked anxiously . He halted there . " Nothing . . . nothing , " he mumbled . He came back slowly and let himself into the chair again and took up his paper . Let that fool laugh if he wanted to . . ? let him laugh . SONNET BY EDNA ST .
