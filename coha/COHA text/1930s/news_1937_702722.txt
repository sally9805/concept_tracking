txt Measured in percentage of the national income , dollar volume of stock trading on the Now York Stock Exchange is near the lowest level of the past 65 years . This situation is pointed out by chart and discussion in the current issues of the Cleveland Trust Co . Business Bulletin , edited by Col. Leonard P. Ayres . The Cleveland economist , however , does not draw any conclusion from statistics involved in this chart . In explaining tate chart be states that " In the latter part of the long depression of the 1870 's , the total value of the stocks traded was only about 80% se great each year as our national income , but when business recovery and prosperity returned in the early ' SOS it suddenly advanced until in 1881 it amounted to over 106% as much as the national income . It declined from that peak ? , until it again fell below 30% in the depression of the ' 90 's . " The next fifteen years , " continues the discussion , " constituted a period of active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 , the year cv the famous Northern Pacific corned. , to over 119% of the national income . In 1929 , just before the beginning of the great depression , the value of stock trading rose to 110% of the national income . It fell to 19% in 1932 , and to 15% in 1934 , and so far this year it has been running only a little above the 20% level . " In another section of this month 's bulletin Col. Ayres views " widespread labor difficulties " slid " increased costs of construction " as major factors in " the gradual slowing down of business " . lie testes , however , that this slowing " has become apparent in only small degree as yet In the indexes of production and trade , but the adverse influences have shown their effects in the securities markets " . Commenting further on the labor situation , Col. Ayres declares : " At present the CIO is working at its highest speed and with almost feverish energy to organize the workers in the mass production industries . Meanwhile , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours and wages bin must be acted upon at this session . One can not help wondering if there is involved something of a contest for priority . If the Black-Connery bill is enacted , there would seem to be left little appeal for the workers in the arguments of the new labor movement organizers . On the other hand , if the organizing progress of the CIO should continue to be as rapid as it was during ? the first four months of this year , one might well wonder whether the wages and hours bill could be enacted . " Wages and Hours Sill Discussed In a more detailed discussion of the wage and hour bill , Col. Ayres presents two charts to show the vast problems that would confront any board attempting to set wages and hours for the country 's workers . One of these shows the wide range of wages from industry to industry . From an average of 43 cents an hour in the tobacco industry , the pay ranges up to 93 cents an hour in the tire industry . The second chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South Atlantic ' tier of states , to $22.02 in the East North Central section . States Col. Ayres : " The present prevailing wages were reached by the slow processes of continuous competition . They are subject to never ending change . They will be different next year , and even next month . They are all subject to varying rates of change . They involve many thousands of different occupations . The bill under discussion assumes that a board of five individuals can determine the proper hours and wages of the workers in each occupation in every locality more justly than it can be done by trial and error and experience and competition : but the validity of that assumption may well be doubted .
