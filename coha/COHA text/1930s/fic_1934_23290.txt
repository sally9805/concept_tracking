DEATH AND THE CHILDREN A STORY BY PAUL HORGAN LL one afternoon and all the next day the boys kept arriving at camp . They traveled from Albany and changed trains , mounting through the Adirondacks in an ancient train whose coaches smelled of a generation 's bananas and pipes and disinfectant . The engine , that snorted like a terrier , turned and puttered up through the black pine green of the country , where notches in the hills showed pale-blue lakes under little clouds . Edmund Abbey had come early to camp , which was run by a Catholic order , and now roamed round , watching the other boys arrive , feeling superior and sorry about them . He had been introduced to his tent and given a tent mate of his own age , ten . His counselor was a tall , blond student priest , who held the boy 's hand and squeezed his arm and shoulder while blinking rapidly over his hearty questions . Edmund was homesick and laid doubtful by the cold flashing rain that came out of a gray wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly the world was alien . Cone was the sunlight world where boys ran and shouted in khaki shorts and the lake looked warm and pure and where the dark shadows in the pines were adventurous and the stone dome of Mount Baldy above the children invited the sky . It was all gone , that zest in a new place and an adult feeling of independence . He stood in his tent , with eyes blurred with rain , and looked out across the muddy camp field , toward the lake , where white rollers beat in miniature anger against the very roots of the edge pines and the mossy rocks . Through the rain he heard a sad sound that deepened his wretchedness  --  it was the whistle of the mail launch . Soon he could see the tan awning and the white hull and the property smokestack of the little boat as she turned smartly in toward the camp pier , facing boldly the little brass signal cannon that stood at the pier 's edge . Father Brandon , the commandant , ran down the pier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail bags of gray canvas striped with blue and dirt . Then he helped several boys from the cockpit , and they all ran back to the commandant 's lodge which stood at the edge of the forest , in sight of the whole street of tents and mess hall . The new boys were in various clothes . They stood shuddering with excitement and chill under the porch of Father Brandon 's hut , looking at the earlier tent-bound natives as speculatively as these looked back at them , the pitiful novices . Under the lightning and a stratified fall of thunder the boys could hear and see the launch as she leaned exquisitely in turning out of sight beyond the cove . And suddenly it was clear again , and the pines came smelling and golden out of their black , rain-hung mystery . The lake tossed her last whitecaps and became a mid-afternoon blue again , and all the young hearts came up from despair as the children went , sandaled , on the mud , to buy candy and root beer , to swim , to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it behind the row of privies . Father Brandon called a number of them to meet the new boys . They were introduced , everybody saying " H'lo " in the most reluctant of tones . The priest beamed from among his thick black eyelashes , which were darkened by a few moles near his eyes . " Go and play , " he said , " and anyone who can not swim must take a counselor in any boat should he choose to go out on the lake . " He disappeared into his hut , and the new boys drifted down the tent street , where they were met by the blond counselor . He shook their hands and squeezed their hacks , winning some response , sometimes distaste , sometimes pleasure from those young , clear , and skeptical faces . The air was divided into odors . The rainy breeze was letting drops fall off the trees and stinging the pine into breathing forth its heady essence . Wild flowers and tiny rubescent wild raspberries were crushed underfoot as the boys walked in the woods ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A party went up the slope of Mount Baldy . Edmund was charmed because it was his first mountain , and because the name seemed a masterpiece of description . The counselor was in the lead , four of the new boys followed , then Edmund and some stragglers , ending with a very young boy named Max . They slid on moss and shivered in the afternoon density of the forest shadows ; and when they came to clearings now and then or a sky-let of remote gold and white , they would stop and getwarm , while the counselor told a story or a joke , usually one that had an obscene and stimulating point , such as boys of twelve would ponder long over ; and telling it , the counselor would look innocent , and when they would laugh he would look surprised , then pretend to be shocked at what he called dirty minds ; and the boys would be abashed and secretly excited , ashamed because he was studying for the priesthood and knew the depths of their sinfulness . Soon one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the mountain . " Well , what do you want to do ? " " Oh , nothing . 1 ' 11 go back to camp . " " You 'll get lost . " " No , I see the blaze on the trees . It 's that double hack . I 've been in the woods a lot . " " Well , go on . What 's your name ? " asked the counselor . " Stephen Mason . " " Well , go on , Stephen , but report to Father when you get back , see ? Tell him you 're back , see ? So he 'll know . He 'll want to know . " " Oh , sure , " said Stephen . He scratched himself where his new stiff khaki shorts pricked him . Now that he was to go , he looked undecided . He was Edmund 's age , with clear blue eyes and black hair . Edmund liked him for his absentminded way of smiling and because he said what he wanted to do . Edmund thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back , but he just watched while the counselor and Stephen smiled at each other irresolutely , on the edge of the decision , and humorously agonized . " Well , are you going ? " said the counselor , Stephen looked at Edmund . He was a little sorry now about that long walk alone down through the rock-scalloped hills under the forest . Edmund wanted him to stay because they could get better acquainted . But he wanted Stephen to go because he had so boldly announced that this walk was no fun . It would be a wonderful way to start off in camp , to get fed up and do as you liked from the start . He looked back at Stephen and said nothing . They were silent , but between them there was an exchange of ideas as clear as words . Stephen knew Edmund was admiring him . He stared at Edmund for a long minute , tasting that admiration and envy to its fullest . Then he lazily turned back to the counselor , and said : " Yes , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the rock where he had been standing , and they saw him flashing down the slippery needled trail , now bright in shafts of sun , now dark in places of blue shadow where the webs were broken by the past rain and hung slack against branch and bowlder . The rest of them went on up Mount Baldy . It was not a high mountain , but it was full of the character of mountains , and it was easy to imagine bears beyond trembling thickets and Indians moving forest-wise under the rhododendron and its opulent waxy leaves . On the top of the mountain they possessed the world . Little Max jumped up and down in an agony that expressed delight and finally incontinence . The others jeered at him and saw the clouds blot their own world below and the insect life of camp , and there was the amazing pleasure of recognition when they found the mess hall and the pier and even , way across the lake , the smoke over the railroad tracks , and then the blue distance , where homes were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the wind sharpened its voice against the tall rocks behind them on Baldy 's crest , and they ran fascinated to climb and climb  --  the last aspiration and the need to triumph  --  while the sun fell immemorially and the rain seeped into the waiting darkness of the leafy forest floor . Suddenly the counselor cried : " We must hurry back , or it will begin to get dark . " At once the younger boys were terrified , and Max shivered against the counselor 's thigh , suppressing his whimpers . The boys started down the trail again , full of content over the conquest of the mountain top . A game developed in which the older boys left the trail and paralleled its course , having to surmount all obstacles like rocks and thickets without returning to the path where the brown satiny pine needles lay and shifted underfoot . The gentle rot of the leaves released a damp and rich flavor into the air , and time after time , unaware of it , they were moved by the tiny marvels observable in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birch bark , the live velvet of moss , the tall aisles of light and dark between the trees , and the invisible trail of a spider across the path  --  a thread that struck the cheek or eye with invariable shock , Through the falling sides of the mountain forest they soon began to catch glimpses of the lake . Max was comforted , for the sun was yet an hour from setting , and they would not be lost in the dark forest . They all began to run down the last slopes toward the clearing and the lake . Suddenly a pulse beat against the silent woods , and Edmund saw a mushroom of smoke explode over the lake and then heard the round dull report of the small brass cannon they had all seen on the pier  --  a ceremonial gun . The boys stopped and looked and began to laugh and say " Boom-boom , " and ran forward again , talking about naval battles . The cannon sounded again . They saw people clustered on the pier . Edmund recognized a memory , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they ran ahead , leaving the counselor and the little boys to come as quickly as they could , Edmund remembered where the memory rose from . It was from Tom Sawyer , which he had read the winter before . The scene of Tom 's supposed death in the river , the firing of a cannon over the water to bring the body to the top , and the imagined futilities of the men with grappling hooks lived like their own life now . Down on the pier Father Brandon was standing alone , wringing his hands against his breast . A green canoe lay overturned on the pier beside him , and water was still dripping out of its inside . Across the lake on the darkening shore the lowering sun made a gothic fantasy of pinetops against the pearly mauve of evening in the sky . They ran up and joined the boys who were staring at the lake , which was going black under the whitening heaven . They dreaded to ask what had happened . But Edmund finally spoke to a boy near him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canoe an hour before . He had lost his paddle overboard , and when he reached for it his canoe went over . All this had been seen from a Little way up the shore by some boys who had run down and tried to rescue him . But it was too late by the time they were swimming and diving round the placid green canoe which floated keel up . Father Brandon had come in answer to screams of terrified boys who watched . A rowboat now came round the point just beyond the camp . In it , standing in the bow , was the senior counselor , a student priest from Albany . He was in bathing trunks . While another counselor rowed , he put his long grappling hook slowly into the water , peering as he did so . In the fading light the white body making the gesture almost of scything in a slow and melancholy rhythm brought a thickness into the children 's throats and the most intense of youthful grief into Edmund 's heart . " I sent him to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp and taking it exclusively to himself . " If I had not wanted him to go back alone he would not have been drowned . Stephen did it because I thought he was smart . He thought I was so smart that he would have to show me . Now he 's dead . I killed him . " The tears came to his eyes and he felt sore-throated with misery and remorse . The rowboat went softly by ; they heard the oarlocks and saw the grapple descend into the secret water . Like some float in a pageant , the boat and its two posed figures passed beyond the other point of the cove and was lost . The lake was very quiet . The sun withdrew . Father Brandon suddenly turned to the boys and waved his arms angrily . " Go off and play till supper , " he commanded . But his voice was wretched with pity and responsibility . " You all know what happened . It is God 's will and , though very sad , we must not dwell upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered him with a gesture to his side . The boys had a new thought  --  that if anyone was responsible , the counselor was ; and obeying Father Brandon , they crept away , to roll coffee cigarettes behind the privies and imagine what would happen to the counselor for letting a boy who could n't swim go alone in a boat . The dismal bark of the brass gun echoed over them once again where they sat on the damp hillside . It was darkening rapidly now . The acetylene flares from Father Brandon 's but and the pier made white blooms in the charcoal-gray dusk . Fireflies began to show . Sounds traveled with acute and musical ring over the quiet water . It was possible to hear a cowbell from the meadow at the opposite edge of the lake , ponk-ponkle , remote and homely . Suddenly Father Brandon 's voice sang in a long note over the hush and the expectation , a sound like a ceremonial note in the singing of Mass . The boys knew he was answering a signal from the rowboat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , in a trembling whisper . " They 've found him . " In accord , they put away the coffee cigarettes and began to creep , almost on all fours , down to the pier where the white gas torches hissed and glared . Out of the dark the children came , awed by the strain of the past hour and a half and piqued by the presence of death , which they had never seen . The rowboat floated into the plane of light before the pier . The counselors looked soberly at Father Brandon , saying nothing . In the bottom , between the two cross-thwart seats , was their load . The bow of the boat bumped the pier . Father Brandon knelt down and bowed his head . The counselors passed up a rope , and he made it fast . Then , standing with their legs widely braced , they bent down and lifted the body of Stephen and handed it to Father Brandon . He took it in his arms , using all his robust strength , and walked back down the pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was white and sweating . But he walked with ease , looking across Stephen 's chest . The drowned boy was swollen and bloated . Edmund looked once and put his face down . He had seen Stephen 's face only twice in his own life , only once in his . Father Brandon walked into his but and closed the door after a moment . Then they heard him twist the bell crank on his wall ' phone , and ring for the operator . His voice rang against the unpainted pine boards of his room . He was calling for long distance , asking for Mr. Mason , at Schenectady . Then Edmund had more pictures in imagination , and so did the other boys with whom he was sitting and kneeling . They touched one another , thigh to thigh , or arm around neck , or shoulder to knee , miserable in loneliness , needing reassurance while they imagined the house of the Masons and the arrival of the news , all in terms of their own homes and parents and the mixed securities and loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could picture her weeping . She would hate him and want to have him killed for what he had done to her son . It was exactly as if he had dared Stephen to go . And he could n't swim . But how did Edmund know that ? No matter . The fact remained . Edmund suddenly jerked upright and looked round . He was looking for his counselor , that tall yellow-haired youth with the nervous eyes and the restless hands . He was nowhere to be seen , but Edmund had to see him . His heart suddenly turned to rage and he leaped to his feet and began to run up the tent street , darting into all the tents . But the counselor was not in any of them . Edmund had a burden for him that was like hatred . He must discharge it . At last Edmund found him , sitting in the dark on the mess hall porch , listless . Edmund ran up and was surprised because when he started to talk he was sobbing . " You did it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in a whisper . " You should n't have let him go . He was my friend . He could n't swim . " He began to beat the counselor on the knees , who sat up in silence . He grasped the boy 's shoulders but made no effort to stop the pummeling . " You stinker son-of-a-bitch , " Edmund said or coughed . " You did it . " The boy was feeling heroic . His burden was going away , and his heart rose in a pure sort of exaltation . He felt the counselor 's fingers clasp his upper arm . He wanted him to say something , to rebuke and so to encourage him in his fury . But the young man was silent until the boy fell silent from breathlessness . Then he spoke . " I know I did it , " he said , very sadly , and with dignity . Edmund wrenched away from his grasp and stared at him in the dark . He had always hated him and his clammy fingerings . " I am to blame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . What could Edmund do ? He tiptoed very gently away , purged of his self-accusations , and troubled by a new sympathy for the counselor , whose dignity and shame made him feel foolish for the cruelty of his actions . But he could n't apologize or say he felt sorry for him . Edmund went back across the drying mud of the clearing and in the deep dusk met Father Brandon going toward the mess hall . " Good evening , Father , " he whispered . ? . .. my boy , " he replied dimly , going by rapidly . In a moment the mess hall was illuminated and he was ringing the bell for supper . In the morning the boys were aroused at sunrise by the bugle and , shivering , went to wash in the hazy shadows made by the hills that interrupted the sun . The morning was filled with the zest of birds andclearing dew . And from the hillside sounded the chapel bell . They trudged up the trail to Mass . Father Brandon 's altar was of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet of moss for him to walk on . They had wooden benches arranged with an aisle down the center of the little cleared space before the altar . As they walked up , the children heard the reed organ behind the altar sounding a hymn . It was the blond counselor who played it . It was kept covered with a tarpaulin when Mass was not being celebrated . The boys went reluctantly to their places on the benches , looking with desperate curiosity at the bier before the altar . Stephen lay in a rudely made coffin . He was covered with a blanket into which was woven the camp insignia . The Albany novice appeared from behind the altar , garbed as acolyte , and knelt , ringing the server 's bell . The camp stood , and Father Brandon in green chasuble and biretta of black came round the end of the altar , bearing the chalice . All through the Mass the reed organ throbbed and moaned , now loud like the triumph of afterlife , and now soft , as if the counselor were brooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall pines and flashed away from the gold vessels of the Mass , the brocade on Father Brandon 's vestments , the white plane of the altar . As the air grew warmer , spirits rose ; the boys could smell the lake , and could know it again as a friendly and beautiful element , not as a dark and treacherous killer . Father Brandon always read Mass very fast . But when he was done with the ordinary of the Mass , he came down and knelt by the coffin and began to lead the boys aloud in prayers for the dead . They responded with . out stint , and their voices made a shrill and enthusiastic ascent into the upper air of the woods . Already a night had removed death from their thoughts . Without thinking of it , the children turned idly to the preoccupations of survival and prayed for Stephen at the forest altar ' like magpies . Father Brandon 's voice finally was silent . He bowed his head and knelt as if he were utterly alone . His eyes were closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking . Nothing that is past is recoverable ; we can only pay it tribute with some movement of our hearts and know some desire to grow from experience into a rich life of dignity and humanity . But while he knelt the boys waited , growing restless , wanting to run down to camp for breakfast if they were no longer to be asked to mingle their bright shallow voices in ancient supplication for the repose of a soul . The morning seemed arrested , and they lived with the hush so intensely that finally some meaning broke into their thoughts , and emotions of dread , like those they had had when they left home for camp , returned . Staring at Father Brandon by the coffin , they became hypnotized by his motionlessness , which at first had simply been embarrassing . The birds had gone , the organ was still . But at last  --  mostly a matter of minutes  --  the spell was shattered . The mail launch whistled beyond the cove ; they breathed again , smiling at one another , and sat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the pigeon-white launch , leaning into her curve toward the pier , passing across the brown reflection of the opposite hills into a space of clear blue water near the shore . The engine of the launch made a low liquid breathing , touched off rhythmically with satisfying little clicks . Her wake settled into slow outringing swells . Father Brandon crossed himself slowly with immense reverence and rose to his feet . The acolyte brought the holy water vessel , and the priest scattered blessings and reassurances upon the children and upon Stephen . Then he returned to the altar , picked up the chalice , and went to the sacristy behind the pines . The boys scrambled down the hill for their mail . A few minutes after , the two counselors bore the coffin to the launch , where it was placed under the awning aft . The blond counselor was in civilian clothes with hat and overcoat . He helped to set the coffin down and then irresolutely put his hand forward for his colleague to shake . They shook hands , and then the launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany priest jumped to the pier . The engines began to charge in reverse and the propeller chewed a slow path away from shore . The boys stood watching while the launch turned and faced the far end of the lake . Then she moved forward , smartly with sharp prow , and they saw the covered box on the afterdeck , with the motionless figure of the counselor beside it , looking back . His face soon lost distinctness and became a white oval in the shadow of the awning . Something about it spoke in appeal , which would never be answered , " Come back . " The boys watched the launch round the far point with its two passengers for Schenectady . In the middle of the morning the Albany novice led the whole camp up the lake on a canoe trip , in fleet formation . In coves where the water was warmed by the sun they swam and learned the marvels of the lake , the snapping turtles , the little copper bass that idled above the sandy bottom ; watching the weedy eels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , the beautiful exchange of color by the lake , the woods , and the sky .
