With a show of fun and frankness unusual in his stereotyped profession , a San Francisco pressagent lately wrote : " When you come right down to it , a great World 's Fair is the architect 's form of that good old American custom , the Binge . . . . He can work in the realm of pure fantasy without worrying much about his client 's idea of how a building ought to look , because he is using ( perhaps happily ) impermanent materials and because his real client is the general public , and what the general public wants is not utility , but romance and beauty and drama . For a World 's Fair is. no matter what the brochures and prospecti say about it , a big show ; it creates an illusion , and it has to be emotional , dramatic , and possibly dyed with the deep but uncertain dyes of mysticism . The walls of most World 's Fairs bear the imprint of the cloven hoof . " <P> The San Francisco pressagent might well have added that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . For as often as not World 's Fairs result in thumping deficits. * Last week , World Fair planners the world around had reason to ponder this fact , for one World 's Fair ( Paris ) closed for the winter thumpingly in the red , and two others ( New York and San Francisco ) passed milestones in careers which they expect to turn out in equally thumping profits . <P> Paris-France 's Colonial Exposition of 1931 broke even budgetwise only when the Senate Finance Commission wrote in a theoretical profit of 50 millions of francs as an " increase in values which can not be accounted for by the statistics of the Finance Ministry " -i . e. , national prestige and local business promotion . This year 's Paris International Exposition , which closed last week for the winter , will presumably also be subject to such budgetary juggling . For it cost $64,600,000 , of which an estimated $49,000,000 came as a direct Government subsidy . By last week 33,724,295 patrons had paid some $4,746,000 to see the Fair 's gaudy structures clustered along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost another $16,950,000 . In the Chamber of Deputies this week there was strong opposition to the idea from outlying provinces which dislike the thought of their trade suffering while Paris gains .
