" You 're going out ? " It seemed incredible . She gave me a bitter glance . " Work . " " F'heaven 's sake ! Call ' em up . Tell ' em you ca n't work . Tell ' em someone died  --  someone did die ! You ca n't work today ! " " There 's plenty waiting to grab a job . " She went on out . For the first time I was glad I did n't have a job . Not today , anyway . I was sorry for Miss Sands , but the pity could n't come up far through the tiredness . Mrs Halloran was still sleeping unbeautifullyin my armchair ; I thanked goodness she was n't on the studio couch , and did n't even feel ashamed of my selfishness . The house should be safe with all those policemen littering the hall . I left the double doors wide open . Every movement like a slow-motion picture 's drag , I got out the softest blanket and a pillow , took off my shoes and rolled onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was midafternoon before I woke up . Whatever went on in the house that day is still unknown to me ; I slept through it all . When I woke , though , the events of last night were right there in my mind ; I did n't have to have it spring out afresh at me at all . I looked around for Mrs Halloran . She was gone . Still heavy with sleep , I stumbled out into the hall . The house was completely quiet ; one policeman sat in the black leather chair in the hall . " Hello , miss . " He greeted me with a grin . " Have some sleep ? I seen you sleepin ' . " He was a young policeman , I saw when my eyes got focused so they could see anything as small as features ; an Irishman with blue-black eyes , lashes and hair , and very red cheeks . " Looking at defenseless girls sleep is small potatoes around here , " I said . " Are you the only policeman left ? " " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely . " If you want to bump anybody else off , all you 've got to do is bump me first . " " Oh , forget it . " I was sick of death . Policemen too . In my kitchen I drank tomato juice and discovered I was ravenous . The only time I have any use for skipping meals isp101when I 'm sick , and now I had n't eaten since dinner last night  --  nearly twenty hours ago ! When I came up for air my icebox was as bare as a strip-tease artist at the end of her act . But I felt better . It was a good thing I waited until after I 'd eaten to take a good look at my rooms . They were an awful blow . The kitchen linoleum was gray with ground-in grime and ashes ; I picked cigarette and cigar butts out of the sink , off the stove , off the floor , out of the cupboards , off the washbowl , off the toilet rim , off the buffet , the rug , the chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violently I went to work . Cleaning . That 's what my intentionswere : to clean . I pushed away to the back of my mind all wonder as to how Mrs Garr had died , naturally or otherwise , and if otherwise , who had done it and why . Questions such as that , I said to myself , were for the police . All I had to do was wait . Sooner or later all the mysteries would be solved , and I , like the rest , would know the solutions . It was n't any of my business anyway . All I had to do was keep my nose at home , and they 'd see how innocent I was , forget suspicion of me , concentrate on the real criminal . If there was a criminal . That was what I thought I thought . But you 'll notice I did n't think of getting away , of moving out of Mrs Garr 's house . I could n't have , of course ; the police would n't have let me . But I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay but let well enough alone . That shows you how a girl who thinks she is completely honest with herself can be an awful liar . Because I had n't any more than started scrubbing the kitchen floor when my mind was biting into the mystery around me as if it thought it was a steam shovel . By the time I had finished I was already so intent on digging out the answers to some of my questions that you could n't have deflected me with guns . Weeks afterward , when the whole thing was over , I began reading murders in the newspapers closely , and murder stories in books , too . The big difference I noticed was how understand-pIO2 able the work of the police was in those other stories . The reportersin the newspapers and the characters in the fiction always seemed to comprehend what the police were working toward and doing . I do n't see how they do it . From first to last , in the case of Mrs Garr , I never knew what the police were going to do or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I usually disagreed , strenuously . Every time they jumped on anyone it was a completesurprise to me . I learned a lot about the case from them , because they did all the routine work , and we usually heard the results sooner or later . On the whole , though , they did n't seem nearly as keen , as pushing , as intuitive , as right as they should have been . Not nearly as much so as detectives in stories , for instance . After all , I suppose it 's discouraging to work on a case when you have n't even a decent corpse to go on , and the details are so gruesome the papers wo n't print them and you ca n't get any publicity . By 9 P.M. of that Friday , June fourth , my rooms were shining clean again . The Irish policeman had stuck his head in a couple of times and grinned to see me go at it , but no one else had been near me . I did n't know if the Tewmans had come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd heard the Wallers move about overhead , seen Miss Sands drag herself in at six o'clock ; she must have been dead to the world by the time I finished cleaning . Mr Grant had slid quietly out at the dinner hour , and as quietly back again . Had Mr Grant killed Mrs Garr ? He alone had admitted seeingher that Friday night . Had he been quietly opening , closing things in her kitchen there below when she came in ; had he sprung at her . . . ? Blinking little old Mr Grant . Or the Wallers . They 'd been having trouble with Mrs Garr . She 'd asked them to leave . Funny , I 'd forgotten to tell that to Lieutenant Strom . Miss Sands . She had lived in the house with Mrs Garr for twelve years . You can work up a lot of hate in twelve years . Or Mr Buffingham . Bad blood . His son was already engagedpI03with criminals , was in jail . Mr Buffingham himself had been held by the police for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though mothers like Ma Barker . . . Lawyers and trials were costly , too ; he must be hard pressed for money . He might have been hunting money , the pitiful little worn bills a poor old lodging-house keeper might have hidden .. . " I do n't believe in banks .... " A ghost was whispering it in my ears . Was that why she 'd listened , was that why she 'd suspectedpeople of snooping , because she had poor little heaps of savings hidden here and there around the house ? I was practically shaking with excitement , like a dog at a gopher hole , by the time I 'd thought that out . I tried to calm myself ; after all , I did n't want to spend my time at the wrong gopher hole . I needed someone to talk it over with ; I needed to talk to someone who had been in the house longer than I had . I wished Mr Kistler were home . Mr Kistler . I was pretty sure , was n't I , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was I ? It might be well , before I allied myself with Mr Kistler , to think a little about it . Mr Kistler . He had awfully strong hands . I walked over to the west bay of my living room , where Mr Kistler had stood so much of the time during the night before . I stared out the middle window . What I saw was n't the windy June night outside , the one scraggly tree on the parking , the light of the street light ; what I saw was Mr Kistler chinning himself on the bar that first night I talked to him ; pulling himself up and up by those heavily muscled arms . He 'd held my hand , once or twice since then . His hands had calluses across the palms . From the chinning bar , he said . Fancy a printer , a publisher , with calluses on his palms ! I tried to think of those hands as the hands on my neck , choking me that night . But I could n't make myself believe it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died on Friday night , exactly a week ago . Hodge Kistler had been working that Friday night . So he 'd said . He had n't come home until after midnight , when he 'd seen the light under my door and roused the house . Nice , would n't it have been , if he 'd been the one to dump me on my kitchen floor , half strangled , just a few minutes earlier ? All right , let 's suppose he had . Mrs Halloran had made that telltale remark about banks to him too . He was hard up for money ; he 'd said that repeatedly . The city council had taken all the money he had , and all he could beg or borrow . He 'd had to overbid the Comet , with plenty of money behind it . He needed new presses badly . Maybe he wanted money to take me out . That last was a nice possibility . So when he knew Mrs Garr was going to be away he might have come to the house after train time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers in the room under the stairs , flicking through the contents . His sure fingers prodding into sugar bowls and cream pitchers in the cellar kitchen . Mrs Garr coming upon him , screaming : " Thief ! " He 'd jump to silence her . He might not have thought how strong his hands were . Then quick , to hide it , to save himself . . . The cats .. . I thought of his sick face the night before . Impossible . But go on supposing . Suppose he had . What could I find out by ? Money . If he 'd found any it might be around his rooms somewhere . He could n't put it in a bank , would n't dare , so soon . Couldn'tgive it to friends to keep ; they knew he never had any . He 'd had very little money with him on Memorial Day . The key . Mrs Garr 's key to the cellar kitchen . Where was that ? If that could be found in anyone 's room . . . My fingers itched. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand unlocking his own door on that tour of inspection a week ago . See the key in his hand . It was as like the key that opened my own double doors as two Hollywood eyebrows . My grandmother had a big old house , and I know how her inside locks were . The same skeleton key opened them all . I decided I 'd look through Hodge Kistler 's rooms . If I found anything , that would be that . If I did n't , I 'd propose that he join me in hunting down Mrs Garr 's killer . I knew that if Mr Kistler came home and caught me  --  well , I did n't intend to be caught . A look at my clock told me it still was n't much past nine o'clock . If Mr Kistler had had to work until midnight last Friday he should do so tonight too ; he seldom came home much before then . It would n't take more than twenty minutes  --  thirty at the most  --  for what I wanted to do . The Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place looked at me apathetically when I locked my double doors behind me and stood before him , jiggling my key in my hand . " Is it all right , Officer , if I go up to gossip with the Wailers ? " I asked brightly . He waved a listless hand . " Sure , go ahead . " I went up , walking as heavily as I could , knocked on the Wailers ' door . Mrs Waller answered and I went in . We talked about Mrs Garr , of course : had she been murdered or had n't she ? They were n't very communicative . They said they had n't slept much that day ; they 'd been talking instead . They seemed nervous , discouraged , uneasy . Mrs Waller once called me " ma'am . " After their friendliness before it was a change to be treated as a superior , and a superior under suspicion , at that . But I had too much else on my mind to worry about it . I said good-by inside their door , waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door softly . I stood outside their door , but I believed I had been so quiet the detective below would think I was still in the Wailers ' rooms.  |p106Lightly  I stole down the long , sparsely lit hall . If the key did n't fit Mr Kistler 's door .. . But it did fit . The lock turned as smoothly as if my key and no other had been made for it . That showed me how wise I had been to keep chairs under my doorknobs ! Rapidly I flicked down Mr Kistler 's curtains , clicked on his lights . I remembered the layout of the rooms : the big room you walked into , used as a living room , the smaller room to the left used as a bedroom . In the bedroom I opened the two doors in the back wall . The first one led to a closet , the other , bolted on the bedroom side , to a lavatory connecting with Mr Buffingham'sroom . I bolted that door again . Having to leave things as they were slowed me down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kistler 's closet and drawers were those of a masculine man : neat , uninteresting , bare of feminine clutter . Two hats on the closet shelf . A row of shoes beside them . Shoe trees to take out so I could feel in the toes . Nothing there . Suits and overcoats hanging from the rod ; I went into every pocket , patted every inch of lining . Chest of drawers next . Shirts . Underwear . I squeezed all the socks . Looked under the pillows , the mattress , the rugs . The bedroom netted me nothing . In the living room I took a look around for hiding places before I tackled the table with the typewriter and the stacks of papers that stood in the front bay . It would take a long time to go through those thoroughly . I lifted the cushion of the overstuffedchair , felt along the cracks . I shook out the books and magazines on the table by the chair . That reminded me there had been a couple of books on the table by the bed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing there . Walking back toward the living room past the chest of drawers , I stopped to look at that again : brushes , combs and bottles on its top . An ecru linen cover . I lifted the edge of the linen cover . Under that dresser cover is where it was . Mottled green paper with black printing . A railroad ticket. pI07A Memorial Day excursion ticket to Chicago on the Great Western . I just gaped at it . I did n't even have strength enough to scream when the voice spoke from the doorway . " Do n't tell me I 've lived all these years to be mistaken at my age , " it said . The words were light , but the brown eyes I whirled to see were intent . " Oh , I did n't think you 'd be home yet , " I gasped weakly , like a fool . " So I gather . " Mr Kistler walked toward me , still intent . " How 'd you get in here ? " " My key fits Keep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think . " I tried to dart past him , but he lunged and caught me by the shoulders ; I opened my mouth to scream , but his hand closed over it . He sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled me down beside him , his hand still over mymouth . " Feel that hand ? Well , I 'm going to clap it right back if you start to yell . Now talk fast , baby . You 've got some explaining to do . " He lifted his hand from my mouth , holding it ready about a foot in front of my face ; he held my left arm captive against his side ; his arm across my back held my right . " I was trying to " I opened my mouth again , to scream . he promptly clamped the hand down . " See ? It does n't work . When you 're ready to talk . and not yell , nod so I 'll know . " I nodded , gasping for air . His hand covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be killed as smothered to death . I was n't too frightened to think that out . " Well , I was looking for clues . " " I see . The lady detective . " " Yes . I thought over who it might be if she was killed . If she was murdered , I mean . And you seemed the least likely . " " I seem the least likely , so you come in my room looking for clues . " pI08 " That was to eliminate you . " " I see . " " I wanted to make sure there was n't anything against you ; that we could work together on finding out who did the murder , if she was murdered . " " Articulate , are n't you ? " " Certainly . " " Too damn much so . And what did you find ? " " I  --  nothing . " " Nothing ? " " Yes . " " Look at me . " I looked at him as innocently as it is possible for me to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , " he said , his grimness dissolving a little , " is this a nice way to behave ? " " Now may I go ? " The grimness came back . " No , you do n't . Wait a minute . What were you looking at when I came in ? " " There was n't anything . " " Under that cover on the chest you were looking . " " No . I was just going to look under there . " I was panicstrickennow , and I must have showed it . If he knew I 'd found .. . " Liar . I 'm always sticking junk under there . Okay , let 's see what 's under there now . " He carried me along with him ; one arm around my neck with its hand on my mouth . I could n't stop him . He lifted the cover with his free hand . There it was before us both . The hand dropped from my mouth . I opened my mouth for screaming . This time it was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " Whew ! " he said unextravagantly . He turned , stared at me . He began laughing , went back to the bed , sat weakly down , laughed until his face was dark red. pI09 " Oh , baby , that 's funny . Oh , God , that 's funny . The sins of the transgressor come home to roost . Oh , God ! " " I do n't think it 's funny . " It was my turn to be grim . " The police wo n't either . " He stopped in the middle of a laugh , his mouth still open . " No . I guess they wo n't , will they ? " " No , I guess they wo n't . " " Ye gods and little brass fishes . Here  --  sit down . " " No , I 'll go downstairs , I think . " " I think not . You sit right here on the bed . " He pushed me onto it , stood in front of me , his hands jammed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you .

I was n't working . " " That 'll be a big help to you . " " I 've already told Strom . He could see why I 'd twisted the truth a little Friday night , and I knew he 'd check on my alibi . I did n't expect you to . " " Oh . " " Yes . You see , the paper goes out on Thursdays . So by Friday afternoon we 're all cleaned up , and we usually celebrate .

These girls did n't go to Chicago  --  that 's where they were headed for  --  that same Memorial Day excursion . Sometime during the evening this one girl hauled a ticket out of her handbag and gave it to me . Said she wanted me to keep it in memory of a big evening . "  | " I can imagine , " I said . " So when I emptied my pockets after I finally got to bed that night , there the damn thing was . I stuck it under the dresser cover where I always stick things . I forgot it . " " And all this happened on the evening just before you came home and rescued me . " " That was it . " " How early you left your lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't interested in her any more . " " And the next day you ate my breakfast and played put-andtake. . . and danced ... " I did n't have the slightest intention of sniffling , but that was what I did . Like most women , I cry when I 'm mad . " Aw , Mist in the Mug ! " For the second time that evening a Voice Spoke from the Door . It was the policeman . " I thought I heard talken up here , " he said.  |p111MR  KISTLER settled back on his heels so fast you could hear them click down . " Why , hello , Officer , " he said agreeably . " Did n't hear you come in . Have a cigarette ? " He offered the packet , but the policeman just grunted and pushed it aside . " What 's going on here ? " That seems to be a set opening speech for policemen . Mr Kistler waved an explanatory hand at me . " Oh , you know , Officer . Just a little lovers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would . " Yeh ? " " You know how women are , Officer . I got home a little late . " I was too mad to speak for myself , and beside , what could I say ? The policeman looked at me . " I thought you was comen up to visit the Wallers . I did n't hear you come in here . " " I  --  I happened to notice Mr Kistler 's door open , when I left the Wallers . " " Awful quiet , you walk around . " He quit looking at me . He quit looking at me ; his glance began sliding around the room . My eyes slid after his , and then I froze stiff . The cover on the chest of drawers had fallen in a fold when Hodge Kistler dropped it . A corner of the ticket showed . We did n't have time to do anything about it . The policeman pounced first . " Well , I 'll be everlastingly hornswoggled , " he swore , whipped about , dropped his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " We did n't . " Which one of you  --  "  | " I 'm responsible for that ticket getting there , Officer , if that 's what you mean . " Mr Kistler spoke calmly . " Golly ! Of all the goldarn good luck ! " Enthusiasm irradiated the police officer 's lean face . " I 'm not handling this myself . I 'm sending you in . Come along . You too , lady . Go on ahead there . " He shooed us on ahead of him , made us sit on the black leather davenport in the hall while he called headquarters . The siren answered quickly . Two strange policemen came to hustle us off ; I argued that I had to have a hat , gloves and handbag ; they gave into that , but it was the only thing I had my way in for some time . We were bundled unceremoniously into a police car , one officer explaining , obviously for technical reasons only , that we were n't being arrested ; we were merely going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new evidence we had brought to light . One of those little crowds of human buzzards had collected in front of the house . Knots of people stood along the sidewalk , gaping , and I had a confused impression of more people across the street , and even clustered along the wall of Elliott House , across the corner . It was the first time I had been outside the house since the discovery of Mrs Garr 's death . I felt silly . When I looked at Mr Kistler , I saw his face had the same sort of half grin on it that I felt on mine , so I judged he felt the same way I did . I 've never been driven so fast ; we streaked through the night , with the siren a whistling scream in our ears , and swung to a stop before a building that looked , from the outside , like a fire station . Rapidly the hand under my elbow propelled me through a crowded big room , down a corridor into a bare waiting room with scarred golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another , our guides lounged near the door . I 'd gotten over feeling silly ; my heart was thudding , and I was wondering what was going to happen next . We waited quite a while . Now and then I 'd hear a door closingsomewhere else in the building , heavy feet would tramp by , or someone would come into the room , and my heart would thud louder.  |p113Finally  the door ahead of us , the door with the ground-glass top , leading to the inner office in which we waited , opened . Two people came out , a man and a woman , ushered by a police officer . The woman was Mrs Halloran . The man was .. . There was a similarity in the expressions on the faces of the man and the woman . They both looked bedraggled , worn , inexpressiblytired . Underneath was a curious elation . It was n't Mrs Halloran 's face my eyes settled on ; it was the man 's . As if he felt my gaze , his eyes traveled over Mr Kistler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elation went off his face as if it had been wiped off ; it was replaced by a furtive fright ; he dodged behind Mrs Halloran and began edging toward the exit . " Why , stop ! " I cried . " That 's the man who ran out of the cellar ! " Stupidly the man began running . The officer who had ushered him through the door made an easy reach to catch him by the arm ; he struggled and pulled like a fish on a line , but the officer had him firmly . " What 's this ? " the captor barked at me . " Why , I saw a man run out of the cellar one day at Mrs Garr 's house . He acted like a prowler . And this is the man . It 's the same haircut . I had a good look at it from the back . He even has the same cap on ! " " She 's a liar ! She 's a-lyin ' ! It 's a low-down lie ! " the prowler howled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to Mrs Halloran . Mrs Halloran favored me with a venomous look too . " That 's what she 's a-doin ' ! She 's a-lyin ' ! " " I 'm certainly not ! " " Oh , for Chrissakes ! Here , you , come along back in here ! " The police officer jerked the prowler back toward the room from which he had just come , motioned with his head at me . " You come along too . " No one had to invite Mrs Halloran . The three of us stood very quickly in the inner room . It , too , was bare , except for ap114desk and more of the armchairs ; behind the desk sat Lieutenant Strom . " What 's the idea of bringing them back in ? " The lieutenant scowled at the man holding the prowler . " This lady has a little story , sir . Says Mr Halloran here is the guy she saw hotfooting it out of Mrs Garr 's cellar one day . " So the man was Mr Halloran ; I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit mate for his wife . Lieutenant Strom swung toward me . " You say Mr Halloran is the prowler you saw ? " " Yes , I 'm sure of it . " " Wait a minute . " He thumbed rapidly through a pile of typed papers . " Here 's the description you gave me this morning . Urn . Fits , all right . " His eyes went to Mr Halloran . " What 've you got to say , Halloran ? " " She 's a-lyin ' ! " " Sure she 's a-lyin ' . I bet she was stealin ' herself ! " bleated Mrs Halloran . " Stealing , eh ? So that 's what you were doing , Halloran ? " " She 's a-lyin ' ! " Lieutenant Strom lifted himself from his chair , leaning forwardover his desk to tower above the cringing little man . " Shut up ! No one needs to tell me you 're a. thief . I know you 're a thief . How many times were you up for theft when you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookin ' for in that cellar ? " Mr Halloran cowered back . " What if I was ? " he whined . " What if I was ? I got a wife , ai n't I ? I got to feed a pack o ' chillern , do n't I ? I 'm a poor , dis-abled vet'ern , lost my health fightin ' for demo-cercy . While you guys at home was cleanin ' up big , livin ' on the fat o ' the land " " Aw , tripe . " Mr Halloran began sniveling . " That 's what they say to the soljer boys now . They did n't say that when we was  --  " " You get around to Mrs Garr 's cellar ! " " I could n't see my wife and chillern starvin ' to death before my eyes , could I ? " " Hell , your wife was at a movie . " pI15 " Our last cent , that took . So I knew the old lady had a lot of dough and she would n't give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pore out of her riches . All I wanted was one dollar . Fifty cents even , so my wife and chillern  --  " " Oh , for God 's sake , shut up . " The lieutenant fell back into his chair , weariness and disgust on his face . He turned to me . " How long ago since you saw this man come out of the cellar ? " " Quite a while . Several weeks . " " Urn . Then the question is , did he try it again when he thought the coast was clear Friday night ? " He picked up a phone on his desk , called an extension , barked , " Check those Halloran alibis again with a fine-tooth comb . Especially his . But get a man on checking if she really went to Chicago . " He brooded over the Hallorans a moment after that , made up his mind . " Lock him up for the night . Send her home to those blasted kids . They may be president someday . " The Hallorans were cleared out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were alone in the room . " Bring Kistler in , " the lieutenant ordered . Mr Kistler came in stepping as blithely as if he were here on a social call . Lieutenant Strom swung back in his swivel chair , his eyes lurking behind the heavy lids . " So you two have an excursion ticket to Chicago for Memorial Day . Well , well , is n't life interesting . I suppose the old lady gave it to you for a valentine ? " " That 's almost the story , " I said coldly . " Your story ? " " No . " " Then I 'll get it from the source , thanks . Okay , Kistler . " " Well , sir , when I told you where I was Friday night I left out a few bits . You know , unimportant . " " Yeh , unimportant . " The lieutenant lifted his receiver again to call another extension . " Any more reports on the Kistler alibi ? " He listened impassively , said , " Okay , " hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeh . So we found out . " They were checking alibis , then . I had a vision of the flurry there ' d been at the advertising department at Benson 's , with a plain-clothes man questioning Hilda Crosley and schoolma'amishMiss Caddy , the advertising manager . I 'd bet I was washed up in that office . Hodge Kistler was looking at the lieutenant with his face very red . " How about some privacy ? " Lieutenant Strom looked at me , and for an instant I saw a grin on the inside of his face . " Nope . Talk . " " Well , in general , Lieutenant Strom , it was like I told you this morning . Les Trowbridge and Brown and I got through at the Guide around five o'clock , which is late as our Fridays go . We circulate on Thursdays , you know . We all dropped in for a couple quick ones in the West Street bar , because Brown is married ; he had to go on home . " A couple of girls were putting ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we joined ' em . They said they were going on this excursion so they needed some fortifying . They took it . After a while Brown went home  --  that was about six o'clock . About seven the girls began talking about going to the station , but Trowbridge and I had a couple other ideas . " He slid a glance at me . " Yeh , " said Lieutenant Strom dryly . " Unimportant ideas . " " God , yes . Well , the girls did n't go to Chicago . They were only going there to meet a couple men anyway . We left the bar . And sometime or another during the evening this one gal dragged this ticket out and said , See what I 've given up for your sake . ' And I said Skip it . So she said she wanted me to keep it to remember her by . " Lieutenant Strom turned sober eyes on me . " You believe this story , Mrs Dacres ? " " Oh yes , I believe it . " I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me so mad . " The lieutenant leaned far back in his chair , the better to roar. pI17The other policeman helped him out . I did n't think it was so frightfully humorous . " Oh , God , why is sudden death so funny ? " The lieutenant wiped his face . " You 're a God damn good storyteller , Kistler , but you 've got to admit it looks suspicious . What was this girl 's name ? " " Uh  --  Toots . " The lieutenant chortled again . " Toots what ? " " Hell , I do n't know and I do n't want to know . " " It 's bad for your story you do n't . Where did you go after you left the bar ? " " Here . " Mr Kistler reached forward , picked up the pen on the desk , wrote briefly on a slip of paper , pushed it at the lieutenant . " We 've had a hint or two about that joint , " the lieutenant said . " Bill , take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to hold you , Kistler . " " Aw , Lieutenant , have a heart ! I 've got a date to see an importantchain-store guy about a contract tomorrow .

We 'll start checking on it right away , and if we can get any circumstantiating evidence , why , good for you . But it 's a lot more likely you were in a fracas with the old lady and grabbed that ticket off her . And you do n't need telling what happened to old Lady Garr . If we ca n't get any proof on your story you may be sitting on an awful hot seat one of these days . Think that over tonight , and see if you ca n't think up a little more embroidery for your story .

Lieutenant Strom favored me with a brooding look . " Now I get around to you , young lady . Why ' d you go into Kistler 's rooms ? "  |p118I  gave him the explanation I had given Mr Kistler . " When curiosity was being passed around you took over a God damn big piece , Mrs Dacres , or else . " " I admit the first . It is n't the or else . " " I 'm not sure about you . I suspect you of being smart . " " I do n't . Very stupid is what I feel . " I meant it , too . " Yes ? Well , do n't forget this . We 'll find out . And remember this , too .

After this I was going to find an ordinary car tame . I told my escort with elaborate politeness that it was gallant of him to take me home , but he did n't rise . He left me with , " That 's okay , lady , " and swung away into the cool June night . When I unlocked the front door of Mrs Garr 's house there were two men in the front hall , but one ducked fast into the room under the stairs . I 'd quit wondering why policemen did things . The other was the Voice That Spoke from the Door . He had the evening Comet in his hands . " You back ? " he asked . " No , " I said . " Where 's Kistler ? " " I 'm him .

" After that I had to loosen up enough to tell him what had happened to Mr Kistler . He was disappointed but still hopeful . " If it turns out he croaked her I ought a get a promotion , " he urged anxiously . " I bet he did . You take a yarn like that now  --  he ca n't prove it . "  | " I should think he 'd rather die than tell it , " I said . Sitting on the black leather davenport , I looked through the paper for some account of the happenings at Mrs Garr 's house . " There ai n't nothing except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was n't , either . The article was a miracle of inadequacy , on page fourteen . But the second paragraph opened a completelynew train of inquiry for me . MRS GARR DIESHarriet Luella Garr , 67 , resident of Gilling City since 1884 , was found dead at her residence , 593 Trent Street , on Thursday evening . Alarmed by her nonappearance , lodgers called police to search the deceased woman 's rooms . She was found there . Due to a connection with the famous Liberty case of two decades ago , Mrs Garr was at one time a well-known figure in the city 's news . It was at her residence , then on St Simon Street , that the unfortunate Rose Liberry was found , a suicide . After some years in retirement Mrs Garr moved to 593 Trent Street , where she has lived quietly . The funeral will be private . I sat there with my eyes fastened on the paper , but I was thinking , not looking . I should have known . I should have guessed . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs Garr 's eyes . Keeping a lodging house , suffering all the mean dodges of a penurious life  --  that alone could not build a face and eyes such as hers . There had been something evil in her life to leave that evil behind . But what , exactly ? At what did that last paragraph hint ? I spoke abruptly to the policeman . " What business was Mrs Garr in before she retired ? " He coughed and looked embarrassed . " I ai n't supposed to do much talken. " " lint it 's right here in the paper . It 's written as if people would know to what it referred , but did n't want to come out in ' , lain words . " " It 's a long time ago , now . The old folks would remember ; the young ones would n't . Let bygones be bygones , I say . "  | " You mean I should n't be allowed to know something I 'd know anyway if I were ten years older ? " He laughed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess there ai n't no harm tellen . Lots of people does know . We had her on the records for years . She kept a house . " " You mean she kept a  --  a house ? " I gasped . " Yep , that 's what she had , all right . Down on St Simon Street . Had it from about 1900 to 1919 , we figured . Quite a joint , too , I heard  --  all red plush . Them was the red-plush days . I was just a kid most of that time , but I can remember the stories the boys used to tell . Why , I would n't be surprised this black leather chair I 'm setten in did n't come out of that house . " I got off the black leather davenport as if it burned me . " Well , I certainly did n't know what I was getting when I took an apartment in this house ! " " Oh , you do n't have to worry about that , lady . S'far 's we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old line of business in this house . Thirteen years , too . " Fascinated , I hovered in the hall , not able to tear myself away . " The Liberry case , what was that ? " He stalled . " Well , I do n't know much about that . " " But this makes everything different ! Someone from back there  --  someone who had reason to hate Mrs Garr for something she 'd done  --  would have had a reason for murdering her . Think how many there must be ! Have you thought of that ? " " I 've heard it mentioned , " he admitted cautiously . But I could n't get another bit of information out of him . I went into my own part of the house and barricaded my doors . There went my previous ideas  --  such as they were  --  all upset ! This put a new slant on everything . Maybe the motive was n't hidden money . The Hallorans were undoubtedly mistaken as to the amount of money Mrs Garr had had . Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Mrs Garr had run a big establishment there might be scores who hated her , fathers and mothers , brothers and sisters and sweethearts of girls she 'd kept . Wives of men who 'd gone there . The girls themselves . The men themselves . You could n't tell . It might be anyone . Of course itp121was a long time ago . The reason would have to be one that kept . And the person would have to be past thirty-five , at least . Nineteen nineteen was eighteen years ago . Hodge Kistler was a little young for that , not much over thirty . But the Hallorans , in their forties . Could Mrs Garr have debauched her own niece ? It seemed impossible  --  but maybe they were n't related . Perhaps the hold the Hallorans had on Mrs Garr was other than blood . Perhapsthat was why they came to her for money . But the lectures had been very " auntly " ; she had n't sounded as if she were being blackmailed . The others . Mr Grant . Mr Grant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wallers . Mrs Tewman . They were all in their forties or early fifties . They were all the right age . It took me back to the beginning again . They could all be suspected . And again , Mr Kistler seemed the least likely . Judgingby the results I 'd had when I 'd thought that before , I was probably due to find out he had been born in Mrs Garr 's house . Or that Mrs Garr had ruined his father . The problem of who had killed Mrs Garr had seemed fairly simple before : a prowler caught in his prowling had been such an obvious explanation . But how complicated this business of Mrs Garr 's past made it ! Now the possibilities were almost endless . I 'd read enough detective stories to know it was always the least likely person who went in for murder . That made Mr Kistler it . Well , I did n't care if he was it . A man who amused himself as Mr Kistler did  --  a chaser , a sleeper-around ! And I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing . That time he .. . I quit smiling , to bite into my thoughts again . If Mr Kistler 's story about Friday night was true , then he had an alibi for the time when Mrs Garr probably came back to the house . But he was an extremely worthless character . If his story was n't true , then he must have had something to do with Mrs Garr 's death . Hiding that ticket could n't mean Much else . It would also mean that , for certain , - Mrs Garr had been murdered . I could n't think of any way her railroad ticketp122could have come into Mr Kistler 's possession if she had died a natural death . If he had murdered her , then his story about the girl was n't true  --  just a faked-up alibi , made awful to sound more convincing , and then I would n't have so much reason to think his character worthless . He might have had a lovely motive , such as revenging a sister . I caught myself hoping he had murdered Mrs Garr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided I 'd give it up forever . I gave up puzzling over Mrs Garr for the time being anyway ; I went to bed . I was glad there was a policeman in the house . Just before I dropped asleep I opened one eye . I 'd suddenly thought who the other officer must be and why he 'd ducked . He did n't want me to see him . I was being shadowed . He was it.  |p123I  woxE to the telephone 's ringing , and Mrs Tewman in the hall , yelling : " Mr Kistler , Mr Kistler ! " " He do n't answer , " she shouted into the phone . She added crossly , after an interval , " All ri ' , I 'll knock . " Probably , I thought sleepily , I was the only person in the house who knew where Mr Kistler was  --  unless the lean-faced policeman was still on duty . No , Mr Kistler would not answer the knock on his door . What did it matter who called him ? Yes , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized it was up to me to be noble . I wrapped my negligee around me in the yellow sunshine and went out into the hall . Sure enough , the policeman who knew Mr Kistler 's whereaboutswas gone . We had a new guard . This one sat on the davenport because he probably could n't get into the chair . He was a fat lump ; he did n't say a word , he was just there , staring with his round blue eyes . We were having a wonderful opportunity to look over the Gilling City police force . Mrs Tewman , upstairs , was pounding on a door . I picked up the dangling receiver . " Hello , this is Mrs Dacres . I " Oh , hello , " a young man 's voice replied cordially . " I 've heard about you . Where 's Hodge ? " " Who 're you ? " " I 'm Les Trowbridge . You know . His partner . The Guide . What 's he doing  --  celebrating the murder ? " " Wildly . In jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my  --  God . What 's he want to get himself to there for on a day like this ? " " He does n't . It was n't voluntary . " pI24 " You mean he had the nerve to go out and get drunk and bust up the town last night ? " " Oh no . It was the murder . " " Now listen , Mrs Dacres . You ca n't tell me they 've pinched Hodge for murder ! " " Oh no . They 're just holding him . For investigation or something . Because he had a ticket . A Memorial Day excursion ticket to Chicago . That 's the ticket Mrs Garr was going to use to go to Chicago on , but could n't find . It was a little hard for Mr Kistler to explain . " " Oh , for tripes sake ! Where does he say he got it ? " " Mr Kistler 's darling little story is that a girl gave it to him . One of the girls you and he were out with a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ! Maybe she did ! Say , the girl I was with had one too . They were passing ' em around the table . They said  --  say , I 'll bet that 's where he did get it ! " " I 'm hearing you , " I said . " But for gosh sake , he ca n't stay in jail loafing today ! Does n't he know we 've got that advertising manager from the P-X stores coming in today ? He 's got him half sold on a big advertisingcontract . And we need that dough . Sister , how we need it ! " " He never goes down till noon anyway , " I pointed out . " Say , woman , do you ever check on when he comes down Wednesday and Thursday mornings ? Say , sometimes he does n't have to come down  --  he is here ! " I did n't realize Mr Kistler went in so heavily for labor ; he 'd always spoken of his work as a joke . But he would . " Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your advertising manager yourself , " I said . A loud groan . " But I ca n't ! I do n't know the facts . I do n't know the figures . I 'm no salesman . Hodge handles all that . Do you realize what 'll happen if we do n't get that dough ? Do you realize we got a press right now that breaks --  Hey , wait a minute ! " A loud rumbling at the other end of the wire . " I 've got to go , " he yelled . " Do something ! Get Hodge here ! " pI25 " Do something yourself , " I retorted , but it did n't do any good . He 'd hung up . Mrs Tewman , when I replaced the receiver , was behind me , taking the conversation glumly in . " So they got him locked up now . " " Why , hello , Mrs Tewman ! Where 've you been ? " " I was over to my husband 's brother 's house . " " I suppose you 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fury was burning in her . " They kep ' me and my husband over at his brother 's house all day yesterday , askin ' and askin ' and askin ' . I never heard so much askin ' . And Jim , he had to work agin last night . Hardly one hour sleep he had . He 's downstairs sleepin ' now , so dead he might just as well of been murdered hisself . They make me sick . " It appeared , however , that after being questioned through most of the day before , the Tewmans ' story of having been at the beer party during the evening and night of the Friday in question had been substantiated ; people had noticed them because they were so seldom able to get away . Jim had hired a man to replace him at frying hamburgers that night . " So then they wanted to know why I moved out of here this week , so I told ' em . It was the smell . They said why did n't I tell somebody there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , for heaven 's sake , why did n't you tell someone ? " She shrugged . " It was n't none of my business . Who should I go tellin ' to ? Mrs Garr was n't here , was she ? I went over to my husband 's brother 's house . I stayed there . Now they told me I got ta come back and stay here . But I ai n't goin ' to stay in that cellar . I ai n't goin ' to do no cleanin ' , neither , " she ended doggedly and went to sit in Mrs Garr 's front room . Just sit , doing nothing . As Mrs Garr had so often sat . It was shuddery to see her there . I went about my own concerns , but my thoughts kept veering hack to Mr Trowbridge . I did n't , however , , get far with either my concerns or my thoughts . I 'd no sooner begun-breakfast than quick knocks sounded on my door . I opened to Mrs Halloran.  | " My , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried spitefully . " Not especially . I 'm sorry it turned out to be your husband , but of course I had to tell . " " Well , I come to tell you somethin ' ! And you can just put this in your pipe and eat it ! Mr Halloran 's out , see . He was n't nowheres around this house Friday , see ? He 's got an alibi , see ? And they ca n't prove he do n't ! " Her voice rose on every word until she had a fine scream at the end . " I 'm glad to hear it . ' Was that all ? " " No , that ai n't all ! This house is mine now , see ? I heired this prop'ty . The police read it to me in the will . I 'm a hairess . And I 'll thank you to get out of my house ! " She drew herself up grandly , her little eyes black over cheeks for once naturally red . For the first time I saw the resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , the reason for the elation I 'd glimpsed on her face and on her husband 's face the evening before when they 'd been emerging from Lieutenant Strom 's office . They 'd come into prop'ty . I thought fast . " Why , of course I 'll move . Any time you say . If the police will let me . " " Let you ! Huh ! Nobody 's going to tell me who I can keep in my house . You come here ! " She marched out to the policeman in the hall with me close at her heels . " I demand this woman get out of my house ! " She pointed a theatric finger back at me . The fat lump placidly shook his head . " You mean I ca n't tell her to get out of my house ? " she shrieked . Another shake . " I heired this prop'ty ! I 'm goin ' to live in it ! I wo n't have this woman in it ! " Another shake . She collapsed , a grounded parachute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she whined , turning to me . " Right in my own house ! " I suppressed my grin . " That 's the way it is  --  these policemen , " I sympathized. pI27 " You 'll get out as soon as they says you can , though , " she warned , trying to work herself up again . Now was the time to strike . " Of course I will , Mrs Halloran . Do you think your aunt was murdered ? " " I would n't be surprised you did it . " She kept viciously to her own track . " Oh , do n't be cross with me , " I wheedled . " I 'm just interested . Did you know the police are holding Mr Kistler ? " " I 'm glad t ' hear it . I do n't like him neither . " " But it was n't Mr Kistler who murdered Mrs Garr , if she was murdered . I 'm quite sure of that . It was n't me . And I do n't like being suspected . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're going to live here How many children did I hear youhave ? " " Seven . Seven dear little chillern . I always say being a mother is the nobles ' work of Gawd , and I do n't care who knows it .

Oh my , he wo n't either . I 'll tell ' em all to move out , right now . " " Oh , but you ca n't do that . The police , you know . . . " I waved a hand at the fat lump , who had been an interested listener to the conversation , but who had n't moved to enter it . It was like having a dictaphone in the hall . But I did n't care . The police already knew the information I wanted to worm out of Mrs Halloran , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I say is that you and I should get our heads together , " I proposed to Mrs Halloran , " and see what we can think up . " She followed like a lamb into my sitting room , the fat lump blinking after us and moving where he could hear too . Mrs Halloransat stiffly upright on the studio couch , her fingers tangling in the inevitable pearl beads around her neck . " The reason Mr Kistler was held was because he had a Memorial Day excursion ticket to Chicago , " I began . " Oh my , you mean he killed my aunt Hattie for that ? "  | " He says he got it from someone else . Now if we can prove he did or did not get it from Mrs Garr , we 'll be one step along . Where did you buy your tickets ? Railroad tickets , you know , have the time and place they were bought , stamped on the back . " " I du n no . I did n't buy ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where ? " " No ma'am . I mean , no , I did n't . I said so once . " " Do you know what day she bought them ? " " No , I du n no . " " What day did she give you yours ? " " It was a while before . Because I know I took it home and showed it to the chillern . It was on Thursday , that 's when it was . I come over here that afternoon . " " Why , that 's a wonderful help , Mrs Halloran ! If we can findout the ticket Mr Kistler has was bought after Thursday . MrsGarr must have bought both her tickets at the same time . " " I du n no . I never seen hers . " " Oh , " I said , thinking . I was thinking that to get to first base with Lieutenant Strom I 'd have to have something definite to go on . I wondered what chance there was of finding the person who had sold Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was going to have a busy day . But I still wanted more from Mrs Halloran .

Spanish , I think . I think pink stucco on the outside . Like that fourplex across the street . My , I always admired that house . " " Wo n't that be lovely . Are you going to have money , too ? " " Five hun'erd a year ! It 's a lot o ' money , ai n't it ? Five hun'erd dollars . A trust fund , she left it in , for me and the chillern .

" Yes , it must be a lot . It must be ten or twelve thousand dollars , at least . " My new knowledge of Mrs Garr 's past kept mepI29from being surprised at the amount . " It must be all the money she had . " " No , it " A , halted look came on her mouth . " Then she left something to someone else , too ? " This was what I was getting at . Who benefited by the death . " She left it to  --  " Mrs Halloran leaned forward as if she were telling an obscene story . " She left it to a home for animals . " She swallowed , with difficulty . " She left it to the dog and them there cats . Them pets o ' hers . There was a whole piece in the will , a long piece . About how they was the best friends she ever had , the only true friends , and she wanted they should have a happy home so long as they lived even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dog and your cat . " The last words I could barely make out . Her face was shaken too . Even she could n't escape the unholy irony of a thing like that.  |p130BEYOND  THAT , Mrs Halloran had little to tell me of the will . The house and five hundred a year from an already established trust to Mrs Halloran ; all the residue for the establishment of a home for animals , the honored patrons of which were to be Mrs Garr 's own four pets . I wondered what had become of those animals . And how much that residue was . One thing was proved . Except for the Hallorans , no individualstood to benefit by the will ! But I had something else to do before I went into that . As politely as possible I shooed Mrs Halloran into the parlor to tell her triumphs to Mrs Tewman . Five minutes after , I was outside the house . The curiosity seekers were gone now . Two or three men lounged around the corner ; one detached himself as I walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that ; he was a good shadower . What I was bent on doing was , if possible , to find out where and when Mrs Garr had bought her tickets . I wished I 'd taken a look at the back of the ticket Mr Kistler had then I 'd know better how good my chances were of proving Mrs Garr had n't bought it . For a moment I considered calling Lieutenant Strom 's office to ask if I might be given the important information stamped on the back of the ticket they held , but I decided against it . They 'd never tell me . The places in Gilling City where tickets were sold would turn out to be few , I hoped . I could think of only two , offhand : the regular ticket windows at the Union Station , and the branch ticket offices which the different railroads had established around town. 130p131And of those , to which would an old woman  --  inexperienced in traveling , especially in recent traveling  --  go ? She 'd go to the station . So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prides . It was built in 1918 when railroads were riding high . It 's almost the size of the state capitol , and six times as pontifical . The handfuls of passengers who trickle through it are lost in its cavernous spaces . Twenty-four ticket windows , with their numbersover them in little lights , stretch along the west wall of the huge , seatless entrance lobby . Fortunately for me , sixteen of the windows were black and barred ; I took a deep breath and tackled the other eight . Every face behind every window was masculine , tired , bored . Ticket sellers , I suppose , must develop immunity to questions . If they did n't feel like answering , they just did n't answer . " I 'm trying to find out if a woman whom we suspect was murdered "  --  Itried to be as brisk and official as possible  --  " bought an excursion ticket to Chicago here last week . You might notice that she had lovely white hair ; beautiful white hair like sleek , shining feathers on a goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turban on top of it , with withered violets in the front . " Mrs Garr had but one hat , that I 'd seen . " And she had eyes like little black coals , set deep in her head . " I tried it on windows one , two , three , four . I did n't even get an admission that the seller sold tickets . Just : " No . . . no . . . no . . . no . " The seller at window five was even more indifferent than the others , if that was possible . Bored enough to talk . " Lady , how many people do you think I sold those tickets to ? I told the police " He halted , and an almost human lookcame over his face . " What did you say she looked like ? " I eagerly repeated , adding every detail I could think of . " Say , the picture the police had did n't look like her . " " You mean the police were here asking the same thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ago . Did n't you know ? What ' re you  --  a reporter ? " " Sort of , " I lied . " I 'm on my own , though . "  | " Well , I 'm glad to give a girl a hand . The police were in with this picture , see , but I could n't remember any dame like that buying a ticket . They said she was older , had white hair , but Jeez ! I did n't remember anybody had that face . But that hair the way you say it . I lived on a farm once . We had geese on it . That 's just the same white her hair was , just like you said it ; you sure said it . I noticed hair like that . Would she have a lot of pennies and nickels ?

She says she heard it was going to be $8.00 even . And she asked was there any place she could get it for $8.00 . So I told her not unless she went a couple stations down the line , and it would cost $1.76 to get there . She hauled out a ratty black bag and begun counting out the money ; I never saw such a mess of pennies and nickels come into this window all the eight years I 've been here . " " Sixteen dollars and eighty-four cents in pennies and nickels ? " " No , lady , $8.42 . " " But she bought two tickets , did n't she ? " " Not from me . Eight dollars and forty-two cents . One ticket . " That stopped me . I stared at him , my mind whirling at the implication . " Could you possibly remember what day that was ?

" A pause . " He is n't in his office , but I think I can locate him . " Another pause . " Hello ? " " Lieutenant Strom , this is Mrs Dacres . I think I 've found something . " " That 's nice .

" It was n't five minutes before he came striding across the lobby with another officer at his heels . " Mother 's little helper , " he said wryly at me . " What window ? " " Five . " He thrust his face at window five . " Did n't one of my men ask you about selling tickets to Mrs Garr this morning ? " " Yes sir . He showed me a picture . I had n't seen anyone like that . " " Hand that picture over , " the lieutenant ordered the man at his heels . The man hauled a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I craned my neck to see it ; it was a much-handled , cracked picture of a stout , sequined woman in her forties , hard face , waved hair , sporting . Mrs Garr , twenty years before , when she had n't fallen apart with age . " This the picture you saw ? " " Yes sir . " The lieutenant turned to me . " This look much like Mrs Garr as you knew her ? "  | " Hardly at all . " I repeated my description of Mrs Garr as she had last looked . " Oh , for God 's sake ! You  --  you --  --  " He turned wrathfully on his underling . " Where ' d you get this picture ? " " The Comet , chief . It was the last one they had . You know , from when they was playin ' up the Liberry case . There was n't a single picture in the house . " " If you were n't at the bottom now I 'd have you demoted . " " Yes sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket seller again . " When didyou say you sold this old white-haired woman a ticket ? " Window five repeated his story . Not later than Wednesday . " Give me that ticket . " The flatfoot produced an envelope and from it picked the familiar Memorial Day excursion ticket . The lieutenant turned it over on its face . On the back was a square stamp in purple ink . It had been sold at the Union Station on May twenty-eighth , 3:45 P.M. ! May twenty-eighth ! Friday ! Three forty-five P.M. ! If I 'd only known that ! Then .. . " There 's another check you could make , " I offered eagerly . " Someone at the house might know where Mrs Garr was at three forty-five on Friday afternoon . Mrs Halloran . She may still be at the house ; she was there when I left . " Lieutenant Strom turned to the man in attendance . " You do that yet , Bill ? " " No sir . I was still trying to prove she did buy it , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to that yet . " " Oh , shut up ! " Lieutenant Strom , in turn , left for the phone booths . He was . gone quite a while . " That 's that , " he said when he came back . He thanked the ticket seller . " There 's one thing more , " I put in . " This man says he sold Mrs Garr only one ticket . " Lieutenant Strom had the man repeat that part of his story , then turned his hooded eyes on me.  | " By heaven , if you were n't a suspect yourself , Mrs Dacres , I 'd hire you . What else have you got on your mind ? " " Will Mr Kistler --  " " Mr Kistler is even now being removed from durance vile . " " Then Mrs Halloran did remember  --  " " Yep . She swears up and down she was with Auntie at Auntie 's house Friday afternoon from two o'clock on . Helping her get ready for the trip . And Mrs Waller backs her up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I mean , they needed Mr Kistler at his paper . " " Kistler ought to pay you a lawyer 's fee . And what , if I may ask as I asked before , are you intent on doing next ? " " That part about Mrs Garr buying only one ticket . " " Well , that may not be important . One person . One ticket . Probably Mrs Halloran bought her own . " " But she did n't . She says Mrs Garr gave her her ticket . Gave it to her on Thursday afternoon . That would mean  --  " " By God , she never meant to go to Chicago ! " " Exactly ! You ca n't think anything else . The whole thing sounds that way . She bought only one ticket . She would n't have made two trips to buy two tickets ; she was slow getting around . She was lame . And then the way she acted when she was waiting for the train with Mrs Halloran  --  she was n't used to traveling ; . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as Mrsialloran , if she 'd intended to go . No , she just meant to get Mrs Halloran off ! " He took me by the elbow . People coming up for tickets were bumping me right and left ; I 'd been too absorbed in what I was saying to notice . But I looked up now and saw stares . " Let 's go out in the car and talk this over . " He propelled me out , the uniformed officer following . The police car was parked halfway down the half-moon drive in front of the station . " Where to , sir ? " the driver asked as we got in . " Stay here awhile . " " It was n't like Mrs Garr to go to Chicago in the first place , " I began. a " Sh-sh-sh . Be quiet a minute . I want to think this over . I sec you can talk and think , but I think better not listening . " He sat quiet for a time , his hands clasped between his knees , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . It fits with everything I know so far . I 'll agree she never intended to go to Chicago . Let 's have your version of why she pulled off this Chicago hoax . " He had n't any more than asked it than I had the answer . " She wanted to catch someone prowling in her house . ProbablyMr Halloran . " " Repeat your evidence on what Mrs Garr said when you told her of the prowler incident . And what she did . " I repeated . As I looked back it seemed obvious that Mrs Garr had recognized my description of the prowler as Mr Halloran . Afterward she had had that long talk with Mrs Halloran in the parlor ; had broken with her . Then , after weeks had passed , she had suddenly phoned Mrs Halloran , had proposed this trip to Chicago . Had she done that just to catch Mr Halloran at his pilfering ? " You 're building up a strong theory in your mind , Mrs Dacres . Pretty contemptuous of Halloran , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd rather , if this was a murder , that it would turn out he did it  --  rather Halloran than anyone else ? " " Well , I " He laughed . " Just a little Sympathetic Susie . Well , I do n't admire Halloran myself . But that does n't prove to me he murderedthe old lady . There 's a second point to consider . Mrs Garr may have arranged that Chicago trip for the reason you suggest . But she may have hoped to catch someone entirely dif-ferent . " " I can see that . " " Now I 'll carry your reasoning a little farther . If Mrs Garr was so intensely afraid of pilferers , snoopers or what have you , that might argue that she was just a timorous old woman . On the other hand , it might argue she had something she did n't want found or stolen . " " That 's exactly what I 've been thinking ! She might  | " Sh-sh-sh . Do n't you know lieutenants of police are important people and should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rooms a cursory search Thursday night . The only important things we found were two safety-deposit keys . We had the box opened . In it were her will , the papers for the Halloran trust fund , the deed to her house  --  a few things like that . No stocks , no bonds , no money . So when we read the will we saw she 'd left the residue of her estate . . . " He paused to glance at me uncertainly . " Mrs Halloran told me . " " Did n't that jolt you ? " " It did , rather . " " Well , I 've come across a few things in my time , but that ... ! What a combination of circumstances ! Where was I ? " " She 'd left the residue of her estate . " " Yeh . So that sounded as if there ought to be a residue . And how did we spend Friday , while you were snoozling so peacefully ? We went over her rooms with a comb . A damn good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ? " " Yep . Five hundred and eighty-six dollars . In bills . Mostly in little bills . Stuck in the God damnedest places you ever saw . I skinned my fingers picking dollar bills from down under the strings of that doggone grand piano . Look at ' em . We found the biggest wad under the bottom drawer of that chest in the room at the top of the basement stairs . " He stopped . " It does n't sound like a lot . Not compared to the trust fund . " " No , it does n't . But if there 's any more I 'll eat it . And we ca n't locate a bank account . On the other hand , " he went on ruminatively , " it might not be money at all some guy was hunting ; the old lady was mixed up in some funny things in her day . " He stopped , became brisk . " Now , Mrs Dacres , do you believe the police can handle this ? " " Yes . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would like to know for sure . Was she murdered or did she just die ? " He became heavily jocose . " Mrs Dacres , you have hit on one of the most embarrassing spots in a long and honorable career . I have to admit it . I do n't know . She was n't shot . She was n't poisoned . " He laughed uproariously . " Lady , if you want to hear some stirring language you ought to hear a police surgeon when he has to autopsy a cat  --  with kittens ! " " Oh , so that 's " " Yeh . What did you think ? We were going to give ' em away to kids for pets ? " I shuddered . " No , I 'm glad they 're gone . Then there was n't anything to tell if it was murder or not ? " " You ca n't tell much from a mess like that . There was n't anything else out of place in the kitchen except a glass jar of dry macaroni spilled on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as abrupt as usual . " No . I 'm going home . I 'll take the streetcar . But  --  " " Another but . " " I 'd like to ask something . " He grinned . " I would n't doubt it . Ask away . " " Would you mind if I looked ? " " Hell no . You keep out of that back basement , of course . It 's sealed . But if you can get Mrs Halloran 's consent , look ahead in the rest of Mrs Garr 's rooms . Remember , you have n't any right to look through the other lodgers ' possessions , though . Here . " He wrote a few words on a sheet torn from his notebook . " Hand that to the guy in the hall . Let me know what you turn up . Good-by . " From the sidewalk beside the drive I watched him streak away . Friendly , was n't he ? The friendship of an armed truce , waiting to jump on me the minute I made a slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute something more . What of it ? I caught my streetcar and knew I was having a perfectly glorious time . I had n't had so much fun and excitement in years . Mrs Halloran , it seemed , had asked Mrs Tewman to leave her house too . When I got back the two women were sitting , each at one end of the davenport and figuratively  --  and I 'm not sure not literally  --  spitting at each other.  |p139I  told Mrs Halloran of my project for searching Mrs Garr 's house for anything that might shed light on the death , and saw excitement come into her eyes . " Oh , my goodness , here I been wasting all this time ! I got a right to look into everything there is now , do n't I ? " " Of course . And Lieutenant Strom wants me to work with you , " I carried on cheerfully my bent for lying . Craftiness crept back of her eyes . " I do n't need no help . " " Oh , I 'm sure Lieutenant Strom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I showed her the lieutenant 's note , which read : JACK , let Mrs Dacres make a further search of Mrs Garr 's rooms . But keep an eye on her . Mrs Halloran struggled ; I saw her vast dismay . She might have discovered money ! But she had to give up . " The police have already searched everything thoroughly . " I was impatient . " All I 'm interested in is clues . " With Mrs Tewman dismissed to the basement , and the lumpy policeman regarding us solemnly , we started on the parlor , Mrs Halloran jumping to snatch first anything that I moved to pick up . " Let 's start on the drawer of this table , " I said . It was the drawer in which I thought Mr Grant had been hunting , on that afternoon long ago . The drawer was full of a litter of papers . Trembling with feverish energy and suspicion , Mrs Halloran pushed me aside to paw through the papers . She found nothing save paper . " There ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sorted the papers carefully . Meager grocery lists . Bread , 8  --  , ' /2 lb. hamburger , 9  --  , ' / lb. butter , 20  --  , cornflakes , Io  --  . Added columns of figures : taxes , $138.72 , water , $6.48 , fire insurance , $19.64 , doorbell batteries , $r.00 . Laundry bills . Gas and electric bills , stamped paid . A receipt book . I picked that up , thumbed through it , from the back . Stubs of receipts to me , for $4.00 . To Mr Kistler , $6.00 . To Mr Grant , $2.00 . To Miss Sands , $5.00 . To Mr Buffingham , $9.00.  |p140My  eyes were halted , incredulous , by those last two figures . Miss Sands paid more for her one tiny room with a two-burner gas plate than I did ! And Mr Buffingham paid more than twice what I did ! Rapidly , then , I went through the book . It went back for months . One receipt to each person for each week . Each week a receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr Buffingham , $9.00 . Carefully I checked . The sums never varied . Mr Grant 's room was small and its comforts probably provided by himself ; $2.00 was about right for that . Mr Kistler had two nice front rooms and shared a private lavatory . Six dollars was about right for that . But Miss Sands , $5.00 for a room scarcely larger than Mr Grant 's ! And Mr Buffingham , $9.00 a week for a room with one window ! I could n't make it out . If it were the Wailers ' apartment , now . . . The Wailers ! Again I went through the receipt book , every last single stub . There was n't one to indicate the Wailers had ever paid any-thing !  |p141I  SAT DOWN , the better to think . Mrs Halloran grabbed the receipt book , hunted through it , looked from me to it and back again . " There ai n't nothing you can get anything out of here , " she said . " They 're all paid up . My aunt Hattie would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid up . " What would I gain by keeping my discovery about the Wailers secret ? It would be a lot easier and more natural for Mrs Halloranto tackle the Wailers about their rent than for me to do so . And anything Mrs Halloran found out I could soon know . I took the book back from her nervous hands ; she gave it to me bottom side up . The cardboard back had been scribbled over with spidery figures , some of them almost erased with handling , the others fresher . The freshest of all was a row of figures added up in a straggling column : $5 $9$ 2$6 $4$26And underneath , in Mrs Garr 's old-fashioned script , were two words : " Not enough . " That decided me . There they were , all the weekly rents for which she had given receipts . And here , too , there was no sum included for rent from the Wailers ! Mrs Garr was scarcely the person to give people free house/room  --  not for nothing . And the Wailers themselves said they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved to verify the facts . " Look , " I said to the twittering Mrs Halloran . " Does n't this seem queer to you ? Not a single receipt for rent to the Wailers ! " She grabbed the book from me again . " No , there ai n't ! That 's right , there ai n't ! Well , they 're going to pay rent to me , I can tell you that much ! " As I had expected , she did n't wait for more ; she hurried out and upstairs . I went on with the search . In turn I took each piece of furniture , going over it carefully . When I was halfway through the room Mrs Halloran was back , half subdued , one quarter suspicious , and one quarter belligerent . " They says she owed ' em money . They said my aunt Harriet owed ' em two thousand dollars , and they had a note for it . They says she let ' em live here instead of payin ' ' em interest . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't live here on me ! And I ai n't goingto pay that money , either . They can just go to law for it . They 'll see ! Before they can get any money out of me I 'll spend it . I 'll spend every penny ! " " Mmmmmmm . . . " I said . " If they can prove Mrs Garr owed them money , that ' 11 probably be paid before you get yours at all . " She immediately screamed and fell back on the davenport , kicking her heels like an overgrown four-year-old . I gathered , from her comments , that the Wailers were thieves and robbers , I was a thief and a robber , and the sooner I got out of there the better , the police were all thieves and robbers , and she 'd get the G-men , that 's who she 'd get , they 'd pertect her , they 'd shoot us all down ! There was n't anything to do but let her scream ; the lumpy fat policeman , who had wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned to the doorway , where he stood contemplating her histrionics with calm round eyes . I went on searching . Nothing . Until I got to the overstuffed armchair . That contributed nothingabove , but when I upended it I noticed that three tacks ,  |p143holding  one corner of the bottom lining , looked loose . They worked out easily ; I poked among the springs with my fingers . Mrs Halloran , smelling money , stopped screaming , dashed forward , jerked my hands away and scrambled inside with her own . Bills came out in her hands . Ones and fives . She tore madly at the upholstery with one hand , clutching the money to her bosom with the other , uttering beastly little noises to warn me off . Excelsior , horsehair , wisps of cloth scattered over the floor , but there was only the one cache . She arose from her crouch , glaring at me , breathless , at bay . The policeman placidly advanced . " I 'll have to take that in charge , ma'am . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You robber ! " As the officer advanced upon her she thrust the money into the front of her dress ; he caught her two hands easily behind her back in one fat fist , reached down with the other , drew the money forth . " You would n't rob them poor animals , would you ? " She kicked and clawed at him ; he fended her off , holding out the money to me . " Count it , lady . " I did . One hundred and twenty dollars , even . He took it back . " I call you both to witness the amount . " With that he stowed the bills away in a big wallet , strolled back to the door , Mrs Halloran shrieking after him in helpless fury . After that the searching was out of my hands . Mrs Halloran sped ruthlessly from one article to another , grabbing picture frames from the walls , ripping them apart , casting the shatteredremnants on the floor . Between the back and the photographin one frame she found two five-dollar bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room under the stairs were seven twenties . From deep down in a mess of buttons , hooks , eyes , nails and hairpins in a two-pound coffee tin she drew a neat roll of ones  --  twenty-eight of them . The search was on her like a fever ; the policeman claimed each new find ; she quarreled and sought bitterly on.  |p144The  cellar produced nothing . The furnace room had little to search ; the storage-room junk was just junk . It was after six o'clock when , dusty , disheveled and cross , she gave up . The parts of the house Mrs Garr had lived in were a rubbish-strewn wreck . And my only satisfaction , as I looked on , was in thinking of the moment when Lieutenant Strom would have to eat , as he had promised , the uncovered money . Of what I had wanted to find , of one clue that would point to why Mrs Garr had died , and how , there was n't a trace . Not one thing to link Mrs Garr to her past life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get  --  certainly the trifling sums of money would hardly be cause for murder . Hold , though . What Mrs Halloran had found , added to what Lieutenant Strom had ' found , made over a thousand dollars . Would that be enough to be tempting ? Tired of watching Mrs Halloran mess around with the contentsof the storage room , I lit the heater for a bath and went upstairs to my own apartment . From the floor just inside my door I picked up an envelope . The notice inside instructed me to be present at an inquest into the death of Harriet Luella Garr , to be held Monday afternoon , two-thirty o'clock . An inquest ! Of course there ' d be an inquest . There , at least , I should find out if Mrs Garr had been murdered or not . I bathed , dressed , went out to eat , came home again , thinkingsolidly all the while . The more I thought , the more certain I was that the Hallorans must be at the bottom of the mystery . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily on . The Hallorans were the only ones that really benefited by the death . They were the greedy kind ; they could n't wait to get their hands on money if they knew there was any to be had . The Hallorans were frightfully stupid . Yes , but it was a stupid crime , was n't it ? A sneak thief , caught . He 'd struck at her , choked her . Then rushed out , lockingthe door behind him . Run , trembling and afraid , home to his seven dear little children . But the cats ! The dog ! The kitchen door opened , they 'd have run out too . And would Mr Halloran , that sniveling littlep145coward , have dared to run about in that house , in which he ran such risks of being seen , dared to run about catching those animals one by one , thrusting them back into the kitchen ? Had he still been in the house when I came home that Friday night , lurking somewhere , hiding in the bathroom , perhaps ? Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back of the house to see the results of his work in the basement kitchen if he could , attacked me when I 'd heard him ? If so , would n't someone have seen him in the house ? Mr Buffingham ! Mr Buffingham had been on his way downstairs when one of the cats was still loose in the house ; I had talked to him . If anyone had seen Mr Halloran lurking , he would be the one . Rapidly I considered . Mr Buffingham had n't been about while I had been in Mr Kistler 's rooms the night before , I was sure ; his room had been quiet . The fat lump had been replaced by the lantern-jawed gentleman of the night before . For the second time I approached him with news of a call . " I 'd like to run up and see if Mr Buffingham 's in . That all right ? " " Have your own way ! " He waved a cordial hand . " Remember I 'm here if you turn up anything on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Buffingham 's door . There was a stir in the room , then silence . I knocked again . The door opened slowly ; as it did so a subdued whir sounded in the room somewhere . I looked my surprise up at Mr Buffingham'susual dark , intent gaze . " Why , what 's that ? " " Burglar alarm , " he replied laconically , without smiling . As a burglar alarm , it was effective ; I sensed before I saw Mr Grant 's door open and his head appear momentarily around the edge of it . Well , Mr Buffingham was n't having anyone search his room ! Then I thought of my own doors and laughed with sympathy . " Good idea ! You should see the way I barricade my own doors ! "  | " That so ? " Potatoes and hamburgers were frying in a pan on the gas plate standing on the table against his left wall ; a coffeepot covered the second flame . " I do n't want to keep you from your dinner , " I said hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That night , that Friday night you know , I came in around ten , and one of the cats ran under the bookcase . Then you came downstairs . You did n't happen to have seen a strange man around the house about that time , did you ? " He stared at me in silence awhile . " No , I did n't . " " I 've identified that prowler I saw in the house once  --  it was Mr Halloran . The husband of Mrs Garr 's niece . I thought he might have come around again that Friday . " " I know Halloran  --  seen him around . " " But not that Friday ? " " Ai n't seen him for months . Used to be around a lot . " " You did n't hear anything strange ? Going down cellar , for instance ? After all , that cat must have been put back in the cellar sometime between ten o'clock , when I saw her , and two o'clock , when the house was searched . She was n't around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't spend all my time listening around  --  I got my own business to tend to . And if I had seen anything I 'd of said so to the police , would n't I ? " " Yes , of course , " I said . " Thanks . Sorry if I 've bothered . " He slammed his door ; the buzzing stopped . That had n't been very fruitful . I 'd had my nose so close to my idea that I 'd forgotten that he , as well as everyone else in the house , had had just those questions asked by the police , not only after the discovery of Mrs Garr 's body , but on the very night , after the attack on me . That throttling business  --  it must surely have been the murderer . It would be stretching coincidence too far to have two criminals attacking in the same house on the same night . No , the murderer must have hung around . In that case he must have waited somewhere . Outside or inside ? As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodgersp147my questions , useless or not . It would serve to find out how they felt about the crime , too . I might be able to tell something from attitudes . No ahswer to my knock on Mr Kistler 's door . Mr Grant answered so quickly I suspected him of listening . " No , no one , " he answered me . " Nothing unusual . " Miss Sands , in curlers and kimono over a cheap rayon slip , was pressing a black dress ; her room was full of the etheryscent of dry-cleaning fluid . " No , I 'd of remembered it after you got choked , would n't I , dearie ? " she contributed wearily , turning the iron back on its rest and rubbing at the neck of the dress with a reeking rag . " Did you get a notice to go to that inquest ? So did I , and I 'll have to go , too , I suppose , though what Mr Tully 's going to say when I ask to get off at two o'clock , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Poor Mrs Garr , " I said . " She did n't make it pleasant for anyone , dying . Except maybe the Hallorans . " " That old leech ! I 'm glad she 's dead ! " There was hate in the words . " Now maybe I 'll " She stopped there , stamped sullenlydown with the iron . She would n't say more ; I got no bites on my casts . The Wallers , too , were uncommunicative . I got the effect , when they opened their door , that they had retired to their apartment as to a fort , to hide there until forays were past . Mrs Waller opened the door only a crack , did n't ask me in . " No , we did n't see anyone . No , we did n't hear anything , " she answered , and shut her door . I heard it lock . What was their life ? What did they do ? What did they talk about , all day behind that locked door ? Going downstairs , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects , yet what a life they lived . Mr Waller did odd jobs ; I 'd pieced that out . Yet he was a retired policeman . Appearance and apparent character would place him above an odd-job man . Was it all to be blamed on the depression , that sausage machine for turning out economic alibis ? What possible reason could Mrs Garr have had for borrowing two thousand dollars from them ? When she had ten thousandp148to invest in a trust fund for the Hallorans ? Or why was she payingthem two thousand dollars , if that was the way of it ? For the first time it struck me that this might be a link back into her past , the first one I 'd found . Two thousand dollars . The interest on two thousand dollars , even at six per cent , would be only a hundred and twenty dollars a year . That would mean she let the Wailers have one of the best apartments in the house  --  their rooms were small , but there were three of them  --  for only ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't seem like Mrs Garr at all . The policeman with the Wilsonian jaw said he was surprised to see me come down with empty hands , but I ignored that . I retired to a pencil and paper in my rooms . I think better with a pencil in my hands , and I needed support . I 'd just picked up the pencil when loud , peremptory knocks sounded on my door . It was Hodge Kistler . He closed my doors behind him and stood with his arms wide , the corners of his funny mouth almost hitting his eyes . " Aw , funny face , " he said . " So you do love me . " I wished I were the freezing unit of an electric refrigerator . " Only you could have an idea as ridiculous as that ! " I put venom into it . " Well , baby , you got me out of jail , did n't you ?

Who knows what vicious habits I might have picked up if I 'd been in longer ? " " A rather suitable place , I thought . " " Oh , now , sister ! Look , baby , you sit there on the couch , so . I 'll sit way over here , so . And I 'll tell you about the facts of life . It was facts you were out hunting , was n't it ? We 'll con/sider men first . Particularly unmarried men .

" I tried to keep up the remoteness , but my anger seemed to have evaporatedmore quickly than I had intended it should , and it was hard to whip it up again . " Not to change the subject or anything , but I do n't suppose you 've learned anything more about the murder ? " He leaned across the couch to kiss me enthusiastically but nicely . " So we do kiss and make up ? You 're a nice kid . " " You 're an insufferable advantage taker . " He retired decorously to his end of the couch . " From now on I commit all my crimes in impenetrable secret . God help me from ever having you on my trail . Relentless , you are . But no , I have heard nothing more of the murder . No , I have just tucked a stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never , never , so help you God , ever go into the Buyers ' Guide business . " " I 'll help God out on that . But I have been in the detective business . Listen . " I told him , then , everything I 'd discovered during the day , with particular emphasis on the case against the Hallorans . " Nothing new against me ? " " I 'm sorry , no . But there are a few things I wondered if you 'd find out ; they 'd be a little hard for me to dig into . " " Ah , now we get the reason for this rush of confidence . " " Exactly . I wish you 'd find out about Mr Halloran 's alibi . So we 'd know how good it really is . " " Why not wait until after the inquest ? Is n't that supposed to reveal all ? " " Even if he has to tell where he was , that 's not proof . I leave things I forget out of evidence myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a little plain and fancy lying . " " Well , an inquest 's pretty limited . What about the funeral ? " " Mrs Halloran says a cremation . She is n't even going herself . " " There 's love and gratitude . What does Halloran say he wasdoing that Friday night ? "  | " That 's virgin territory . " " Well , I 'm against territory being virgin , on principle . I 've got a proofreader who wo n't be doing anything Monday . Maybe he 'll be a good detective ; he 's a lousy proofreader . I 'll sic him on Halloran . Anything else ? " " Then there are the Tewmans . They 've been gone an awful lot . And Mrs Tewman  --  her I.Q. is just enough to get her by in a big crowd  --  admits she suspected , or knew , that something was wrong in that kitchen . That 's why she left . Mrs Garr was always snarling at Mrs Tewman , and even worms turn . How about their alibis ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police looked into Halloran 's alibi too . " " But he has a motive . I 'd rather put in the time on him . " " There 's Mrs Halloran too . What if she did n't go to Chicago ? " " That 's so easy to find out , even the police could n't muff it . Wait for the inquest on that one . " " If they do n't take it up I 'd like to check it . " " Let it ride . But say , how about Buffingham ? He 'd be mypick if I was going to pick a murderer out of this bunch . " " The only thing I have against him is that he paid nine dollars a week for his room  --  I saw it on the receipt stubs . " " Whew ! Nine dollars a week for that hole ? That 's robbery ! Mrs Garr could have been jugged for that  --  why murder her ? " " Miss Sands , too . Miss Sands pays five dollars a week . And the Wallers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of Mrs Garr 's for two thousand dollars , and she let them have the interest in rent . " " Good God ! What a ferret you turned out to be ! Who 'd have thought this old house was so seamy with mysteries ? You certainlyhave everyone in the house lined up for this job . Somebodystupid , you say . The Hallorans and the Tewmans race neck and neck for that distinction . Good old Buffingham , papa of criminals , runs third . Mr Grant , dark horse . Miss Sands , not any too bright . Wallers , ditto . Who 's left ? Only us . I am much , much too gallant to place you , my sweet . " " I hope you 're gallant enough to say good night , " I said . " I 'm tired . " q He stood up to say good night with solemnity , shaking hands . " God bless and keep you from ever falling into the hands of bachelors from groups two or three , " he said . " You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank heaven ? " I said , because it was practically irresistible . " Demonstrations on request , " he said . " Merely drop a postal card . "  |p153MRS  HALLORAN knocked me up bright and early the next morning , which was Sunday . Shc stood in my doorway with bills in one hand , a pen and Mrs Garr 's receipt book in the other . " I guess nobody ca n't take this money away from me , " she crowed triumphantly . " I 'll thank you for your rent money , Mrs Dacres . " " But I 'm paying in advance , you know . Are you sure you 'll want me to stay out my week ? " She struggled , but four dollars in hand beat getting rid of me , in the bush . " I guess I ca n't get you out of here in less ' n a week , anyhow . You go ahead and pay . " Except for two one-dollar bills , I had only a ten in my handbag ; I offered that to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ; sat down with a fine air of business to write out my receipt . I thumbed my change idly while I waited ; my little finger caught in a tear . It was in the five-dollar bill , right in the lateral crease . The bill was as familiar to me as a read newspaper . It was the bill with which I had gone down cellar to pay my rent on the day before Mrs Garr was to have gone to Chicago . I thought I had the Hallorans then . I debated with myself , wildly , whether I should call for the man in the hall , but the pleasure of facing Mrs Halloran myself was too great . I spoke softly . " So you did find some of Mrs Garr 's money . " She looked up , startled ; my words had had intensity enough to make them noticeable.  | " No , I never did . Only what I found yesterday and the policemantook . " " Oh , I suppose Mrs Garr gave you the money ! " I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not a cent she did n't give me for almost a month . Mr Hallorangive me the money to go to Chicago , except the ticket . He got his gov'ment money right on that Friday . His June money . " I was n't interested in her Chicago money ; I could n't imagine her bringing back any she 'd taken along . I laid the torn bill on the table before her ; she stared at it with bewildered , frightened eyes . " I recognize this bill . It 's the bill with which I paid my rent last week . To Mrs Garr . " " Oh my , " she whispered tremulously . " I must of got it offen somebody in the house . I did n't bring no five-dollar bills with me when I come . All I had was my car tokens , and fifty cents , and two one-dollar bills . And maybe some nickels . All the rest I got goen around and askin ' everybody for their rent . " So that was it ! Or was she lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be as frightened as this , too . And she 'd lie , of course . I tried again . " Can you remember who gave it to you ? " " Lemme think . Mr Kistler come down early wearin ' his fishin ' clo'es . A five and a one he give me . So then I waited till Miss Sands went down to light the heater ; she give me a five , even . I had to go back up with her . So then I knocked for Mr Grant , and I gave him three dollars change for his five . So then I went to the Wallers , but they said they would n't , on account of the estate owed them money , so I said I would get the G-men , and I will , too ; they ca n't do me that way . I knocked a long time for Mr Buffingham , I guess he was in bed yet , he 's got a funny alarm clock . He would n't pay me nine dollars like it said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ; I bet he owed her money ; I 'm going to look in her papers for that . All he had was a five , but I went back to the Wallers and they changed it , and I gave Mr Buffingham two dollars change . You was the last one . "  |p155After  that , how much of a story did that torn bill tell ? If it had been found by ransacking that kitchen downstairs , then any one of the people who had paid Mrs Halloran with fivedollarbills would be suspect : Mr Kistler , Miss Sands , Mr Grant , Mr Buffingham . It seemed to clear the Wallers . But I had paid that bill to Mrs Garr on Thursday . She was in the house for most of two days after that . She might have paid out the bill in change to any one of the lodgers . It was maddening . Every time I thought I had a clue it petered out like that . Anyone and everyone still suspect . I picked up the receipt book . Mr Kistler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally paid on Tuesdays , Mr Buffingham on Wednesdays . Yes , the bill was a clue . If any one of those four had paid it in , it was incriminating . " Ca n't you remember ? Think . Close your eyes . Imagine Miss Sands is paying you her rent again . She unclasps her handbag , she takes out money . She gives it to you . A five-dollar bill . You look at it . Is it whole and new , or ragged and torn ? " " Well , it might be . " Mrs Halloran was infuriatingly uncertain . I tried it for every one of the four , but all I emerged with was limpness and perspiration on the part of Mrs Halloran . I still was n't sure she was n't lying ; I tried again to suggest Mr Halloran had given her the bill sometime during the past week . Denying that was the one thing she was certain about . From then on , whenever she saw me , Mrs Halloran would shut her eyes , look blank for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in indication that no , she could n't remember about that note  --  yet . But to all intents and purposes she really did try . I spent a peaceful day and night . I remember them very well . Hodge Kistler called me up just before twelve o'clock on Monday . " Well , here 's one more Guide started on its earthward journey , " he said . " And that proofreader has come across . The lazy bum . I knew he was n't putting himself into his job . I could buyp156you some lunch if you promise not to go over thirty cents . We could inquest together . Meet me in the Wetmore Grill , one o'clock ? " The cheapest lunch in the Wetmore Grill is eighty-five cents , so I set about the question of armament . I walked in looking blank and raised around the eyebrows , which is as snooty as I can look . " If you turn into one of those cold-tar girls , " Hodge Kistler said , meeting me , " you 'll eat lunch alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beige leather seats in one of the booths ; we got a corner one . " What ' d your proofreader find out ? " " Wait until I get us something to eat , please , Mrs Holmes . " He ordered pickled pigs ' feet , which I thought was a queer choice , but when they came they were jellied , in slices , with awfully good salads , and he told me how he 'd been a reporter on a stockyards paper , once , and all the big meat men said pickled pigs ' feet were the biggest delicacy there was , in meats . He talked about stockyards for twenty minutes before he 'd come around to Mr Halloran 's alibi . " Okay , hold everything . This proofreader hits the Halloran menage bright but not early ; ten-thirty to be exact . Mr Halloran , was still recumbent . " " As I 'd expect . " " Sh-sh-sh . Am I telling this ? So the proofreader tells the little girl who opens the door that he is an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid ten thousand dollars spot cash , was he across or was n't he across , and he would like to know could he get Mr Halloran 's support . That . brought him out like a shot . " " I can imagine . " " They sits in the parlor and communes . Halloran is wearing two thirds of a pajama and bare feet . Little Hallorans scurry around the house , dashing their heads around doors , staring and sort of whinnying . Entranced , my proofreader was . " " I 've wondered how Mrs Halloran kept her house . She is n't there much . "  | " Kept , my dear lady ? No , no , unkept , I gathered . " " So then , " went on Mr Kistler blithely , " the talk sort of shifted . To the trials and tribulations poor veterans suffered . To Mr Halloran 's having been held by the police one night , and why . To how Mr Halloran knew he did n't murder Mrs Garr . Did you ever ask Mrs Halloran how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seven , she said . " " Did you ever ask Mr Halloran ditto ? " " No . " " Ah , my proofreader did . And there , as one might say , was the rub . Or not , to be exact . Sorry , could n't help it . Opportunity knocked . Anyhow , Mr Halloran , questioned , says five . " " Five ? But  --  " " And he was out Friday night getting even . " " I see . A brother of yours . " Mr Kistler shook his head sadly . " It dismays me to view my attitude toward Mr Halloran . My proofreader  --  what the hell , his name 's Anderson  --  did better . He admired . And Mr Halloran , sniggering , gave name and place . Which Anderson immediatelychecked , and sure enough , the prop says he is getting so he can answer this question in his sleep , and he is prepared to say Mr Halloran , in company with a strawberry blonde , was in his place from nine o'clock that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and that during practically all of that time he was too drunk to do murder or anything else . " " But it 's just got to be Mr Halloran ! Why would anyone else ? " " Well , the only chance is that the proprietor is squared . Anderson 's out now , hunting the strawberry and two more gents the proprietor remembers having been present . But just remember , those hands on your neck were n't drunk . " " Pooey , pooey , double pooey , and a couple of extra-super pooeys , " I said . " I 'm disgusted . " " Cheer up . Who knows what the inquest will bring forth ? And speaking of inquests , my darling , the hour is come . We 're late . It 's after two-thirty now . "  | We hurried , almost running the two blocks to the city hall where the inquest was to be held . But when we got there , breathing hard , the coroner had n't even come in . Information told us room 223 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet woolly , as if a lot of damp winter clothes had dried in there . It was barer than any schoolroom , with Teacher 's desk on a raised platform , and rows of folding chairs facing the desk . One row of chairs at right angles to the others was up by the desk ; it was filled ; the jury , I guessed . Most of the folding chairs were full too . All the residents of the Garr house . The Hallorans . The Tewmans . The ticket seller . A scattering of other people . And at the back , bedraggled hangers-on , with a reporter or two . A few policemen stood about the room . We sat down next to Mr Grant and whispered about how long we 'd have to wait . We waited a good long time . Long enough to take in the flyspecks on the light globes , and the general hopelessness of everyone who straggled past the door . I felt , as I always feel when I 've been in the courthouse , that I needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coroner came in briskly when he did come , with LieutenantStrom and a couple of more men in tow . The coroner  --  he was the florid politician to the life  --  sat down behind the desk and went through the preliminaries quickly . Lieutenant Strom sat beside him . " First witness , " the coroner said . " Mrs Halloran , please take the chair . " I sha n't give the whole inquest ; you 'd find most of it repetition . But there were a few high spots . Mrs Halloran 's testimony dealt with the Chicago trip . After her came the ticket seller . Then a Mr Banks was called ; he was new to me , a railway employee . " You examined the tickets for the Northwestern 's Chicago excursionat eight-five on Friday , May twenty-eighth , Mr Banks ? " " Yes sir . " " Do you recall any incident involving Mrs Halloran , the woman who just testified , and another woman ? " " Yes sir . "  | " Describe the other woman . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white hair . Oldfashionedhat high on her head . Violets in front . Black dress . " " What attracted your notice to her ? " " Well , sir , this crowd was milling around me . The gate was n't open yet . And these two women "  --  he pointed back at Mrs Halloran  --  " her and the older one , kept jamming up against me . This one here , Mrs Halloran , kept waving a ticket in my face and yelling , ' Ca n't we get through now ? We want a good seat . ' I get people like that all the time . When the gates opened I began punching tickets as fast as I could and letting ' em through , but these two women got in my way all the time . The old one could n't find her ticket . The younger one got hers punched but stayed back holding on to the old one . They were getting pushed around . Finally the old one said , You go on , get a good seat . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I got it right here . ' And the younger one went . " " To the best of your recollection , did the older woman find her ticket ? " " No sir . I noticed . She did n't even seem to look for it any more . Just faded in the crowd . She did n't go by me ; I was sort of looking out for her . " " You did not see her again ? " " No sir . " " Thank you . Stand down . " The next witness was a conductor , who testified he had taken up Mrs Halloran 's ticket and seen her on the train near Chicago . So she had gone , all right . " Next witness , Mrs Gwynne Dacres . " My heart beat fast . I got past Mr Kistler 's knees , up to the armchair , was sworn . Then I became so immersed in answering questions I forgot to be frightened . I was asked in. detail about coming home that Friday night , the cat in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Then I was told to stand down . It was obvious they were trying to get the facts as chronologicallyas possible . Obvious , too , as the questioning went on , that the whole thing was merely a process of law . To the police , all the evi/dence elicited was known before . Of course , it would be ; they 'd gotten the witnesses together and questioned them all before . But I heard a few things which were as useful to me , later , as keys in the hand . Mr Kistler was called after me , to tell of finding me that Friday night . Then Officer Foster was called . He turned out to be the policeman I 'd known as Jerry . He told of the search that Friday night . One after the other , Mrs Garr 's lodgers were then called , to give their testimony up to that point . Especial emphasis was laid on Mr Grant 's testimony that he had seen Mrs Garr coming home around eight-thirty . The discovery of the death was then taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Foster 's evidence . " Now , Foster , we come to the search of the basement room in which Mrs Garr 's remains were found . You assisted that search ? " " Yes sir . " " You say the remains , the clothes and the hair were scattered about the floor , but mostly near the door . " " Yes sir . " " Was there any sign of a gun having been fired in that room ? " " No sir . " " Any other implement or thing which showed signs of having been used as a weapon ? " " No sir . There were knives in the table drawer . But they were all clean . Pretty clean , I mean . Anyhow , they did n't show any . signs of havin ' been used to stab her . " " No hammers or axes ? " " We found tools in a box in the furnace room . Under test , they show they 've been used in the usual ways , nothing more . " " To sum up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen ? " " No sir . " " Was there any sign of disorder in the room ? Of a struggle , for instance ? " " Well , sir , it was n't in very nice shape , as you can imagine.  | " But there was n't any furniture overturned , nothing like that . The only sign of disturbance was that glass jar of macaroni . Dry macaroni . It was half spilled out on the table . " " The electric light was not on ? " " No sir . " " The room was tested for fingerprints ? " " Yes sir . But we did n't get any good ones , except a couple of the old lady 's on the stove and places like that . None on the glass jar . Most of the fingerprints were n't good , surfaces not right . Cement and weathered wood . " " I see . Now the location of the key , Foster . Where was it found ? " I leaned forward , intent . The key ! This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The key was lying on the kitchen table , just a little way from the jar of spilled macaroni . " " You are sure the key was there when you broke the lock ? " " Well , sir , we did n't let anyone in that room from the time we broke the lock until the time we searched it . Mr Waller and Mr Kistler went to the door and looked in , but they looked over Officer Harlan 's shoulder . I do n't think they could have thrown a key all the way across that room to the table from the door . Certainly not without Red  --  without Officer Harlan knowing it . " " You are certain the ke'y found on that table was the key to that room ? " " Yes sir . We tried it . " " Is it possible that another key could be used in that lock ? " " I do n't believe so , sir . We 'd splintered out the door to get in , but we had n't hurt the lock much . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We gave it the works . None of them even budged the lock . It was a funny old lock , hand-made , I would n't be surprised . Besides , it did n't show any signs of havingbeen tampered with . It did when we was through . " " You also aided in the search of the rest of the basement ? " " Yes sir . " " Any yield there ? " " Well , sir , in the storage room . On the rocking chair in there was a black coat , not a heavy coat , just sort of dropped there.  | And a pocketbook , a black pocketbook , under it . There was a hat dropped down behind a box alongside . " " A moment , please . " Lieutenant Strom here spoke to one of his men , who hurried out , to return with a bundle . It was opened on the desk ; the errand runner held up the contents . " These the clothes found in that storage room , Foster ? " " Yes sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloran and Mr Banks identified the clothing as having been worn by Mrs Garr at the station . Officer Foster was then recalled . " Did you also assist Lieutenant Strom in his search of the other rooms occupied by Mrs Garr ? " " Yes sir . " " Of what do they consist ? " " One parlor , one small room under the stairs and one hall , sir . " I almost squealed out loud . Mrs Halloran and I had forgotten that Mrs Garr occupied the hall . She did , of course . But it seemed so public . Bookcase . Black leather chair and davenport . Phone . Rug . Once searched by the police , could they still concealanything ? I doubted it , but I imagined Mrs Halloran would soon know for certain ! My mind went back to the coroner . " Where were the deposit-box keys found ? " " In the handbag . " " You considered your search of the rooms thorough ? " " Yes sir , " said Officer Foster fervently . " It sure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dough ! " There was laughter at this , and a general craning of necks in my direction , as if I had n't had the search taken out of my hands ; Lieutenant Strom favored me with an extremely peevish look . It was nice for him , I could see that , having his thoroughnessshown up . " Well , we ca n't all be women , " the coroner said , and there was another wave of laughter . " Now , Foster , it has been suggested that Mrs Garr believed her house had been infested by a prowler , or prowlers , searching either for money or something else of value . When you searched Mrs Garr 's possessions after the discovery of her death , which we know was almost a weekip163after she had come by her death , did you see any signs that those possessions had been previously searched ? " Officer Foster made a dramatic pause before answering . " That 's a hard question to answer , sir , me not knowing the old lady , whether she was neat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , and it 's my impression now , that someone had . "  |p164THERE  WAS a sensation in the room at this . Mrs Halloran leaped to her feet , yelling : " I knew somebody was a-robbin ' me ! You just tell me who it was and I 'll get the G-men on ' em ! " Mr Halloran , also on his feet , joined in . " We 'll get the G-men anyhow , " he screamed . " You ai n't a-goin ' to get away with stealin ' from us . The G-men ' 11 show you ! " Two policemen were called to silence them and get them back in their chairs . The coroner called coldly for order and went back to Jerry . " Now , Foster , why did you think Mrs Garr 's possessions had been searched by someone before you ? " " Well , for instance , there was a lot of pictures on the walls , and they were almost all crooked , as if someone had jerked them around to look behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewed up on one side ; that tear had been slit open with a knife , and the slit side turned down . " I 'd thought the police themselves guilty of that , Saturday . " Then the drawers in the bureau in that room under the stairs were messed around a good deal . That was where we found the biggest wad ; we took the bottom drawer clear out . " Was someone , right there in that room , being moved to fury because he , or she , had missed that wad ? I looked along the line : the Wallers , Miss Sands , Mr Buffingham , Mr Grant ; every face showed intent interest , nothing more . The Hallorans showed only thwarted greed , the Tewmans wistfulness . Mr Kistler 's funny map just looked eager and thoughtful . I was thoughtful myself . This prowling was another thing I should have suspected . Of course the murderer , . knowing Mrsp165Garr dead , had had from that Friday until the next Thursday to go on his quiet hunt . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , all that interminable afternoon , we were called and recalled , until we felt dulled and apathetic . Alibis were gone over , Mrs Halloran maintaining a straight face through the account of her husband 's Friday night . No , none of us thought Mr Waller or Mr Kistler could have thrown the key into that kitchen on Thursday evening when the door was broken in . No , we had not seen or heard anything of Mrs Garr after eightthirtyof that Friday . Yes , the attack on Mrs Dacres was discoveredshortly after midnight . On and on , over and over . I could see the jurors ' faces stiffen in an agony of weariness . It was like a breath of fresh air in the room when the coroner closed the testimony and turned to address the jury . He picked up several sheets of typed paper from the desk . Our eyes followed , then , a settled orbit from the jury to the coroner , and back again . The coroner mouthed Lieutenant Strom 's findings with effects of oratory . The jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . " Ladies and gentlemen , the purpose of this inquest is to determine whether Mrs Garr died a natural death or whether she was murdered . " In order to lift the facts of the case for you from out the welter of testimony you have just heard , I shall summarize the known activities of Mrs Garr during the time under question , drawing only those deductions which seem inevitable . " We know , then , that Mrs Garr purchased , on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon of the week preceding Memorial Day , one ticket to Chicago on a train leaving at 8:o5 P.M. on Friday , May twenty-eighth . She presented one such ticket to Mrs Halloran . Mrs Halloran and Mrs Garr left 593 Trent Street to start on this trip to Chicago at approximately 7:20 P.M. of that Friday . At the train gate Mrs Garr made an apparent search for her ticket , did not find it , sent Mrs Halloran on , saying she would follow . Instead of following , however , she left the group at the train gate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Mrs Garr did not intend to go to Chicago ; that the projected trip was only a ruse on her part , either to get Mrs Halloran out of the way or to induce in someone the belief that she , Mrs Garr , was to be absent from her house over the week end . " Strength is given this deduction by the testimony of Mrs Dacres , who tells us of Mrs Garr 's suspicions of prowlers . Mrs Halloran also admits Mrs Garr accused Mr Halloran of prowlingin her basement on a certain specified occasion . " You , ladies and gentlemen , will have to test the strength of this deduction in your minds . Against it you must place the probability that Mrs Garr did intend to go to Chicago , that she bought a second ticket , mislaid or had it stolen from her , and missed the train . A second ticket , indeed , turned up in the house , although good proof has been given that that ticket had never belonged to Mrs Garr . It has not actually been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part . " At any rate we are certain Mrs Garr did not go to Chicago . She may have been seen near the 593 Trent Street house around eight-thirty by Mr Grant . This is a likely time for her return . What happened to her from then on we can only conjecture . " We do know that at some time before ten o'clock the door of Mrs Garr 's basement kitchen was opened , and one or all of the animals shut in there escaped . If they all escaped , the dog and two of the cats may have been returned to the kitchen or held captive in some other room before Mrs Dacres returned at ten o'clock , but we have the evidence of two people that one animal , the female cat , was loose in the house at ten o'clock . We are also sure that no animals at all were loose in the house when Officer Foster searched the house shortly ' after midnight . " We know , too , that at some time Mrs Garr 's hat , coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself or some other person . Whether this was before or after the search on Friday night we can not be certain . The room was looked over at that time , but Officer Foster was looking for a person , not a few clothes on a chair . " I will now enter more closely into whether Mrs Garr was or was not murdered . Nothing , you remember , is known of herp167activities from 8:3o P.M. of that Friday . I will first consider the possibility of murder . " Here a variety of occurrences is possible . " We know , from the police surgeon 's testimony , that the body was probably placed in the room in which it was found not later than Saturday . Sometime , then , during Friday night , since such a thing would be extremely difficult to do during the day . " Could Mrs Garr have been murdered outside the house ? " This would entail bringing her to the house , carrying her either through the one front entrance door and the front hall , or through the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imagine yourself how that one tensed me ! ) " There is a door leading on stairs to the basement in Mrs Dacres ' kitchen , but that door has a rusted bolt on Mrs Dacres ' side and is nailed shut on the other . Heavy clust on those stairs was undisturbed . The body , therefore , would have to have been brought in through the front . Extremely risky , but it may have been done . Why ? We are not here entering into motives , though I may just as well interpolate here as later that motives may have been plentiful . Mrs Garr was a woman with whose infamous past you have been tersely acquainted . And she was given to secreting small sums of money around the house . Such money was found . " To return to our outside murder . If Mrs Garr was thus returned to the house , dead or alive , by her murderer , it may have been between eight-five and ten , between ten and midnight , between the finish of the search and daylight . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cat , that the kitchen door had been opened before ten o'clock and was opened again to receive the cat between ten and midnight . It is very unlikely that these activities could have been carried on by anyone not well acquainted with the house . " We shall now consider the likelier possibility of Mrs Garr 's having been murdered inside the house . " In that case she may have returned to the house by herself any time between eight-five and ten , any time between ten and midnight , any time after the search . At any rate she meets or is met by the murderer within the house , killed and locked in the kitchen with her pets . One witness in particular has shown ap168strong belief that Mrs Garr surprised a prowler at work and was killed by him wilfully or in self-defense . It is also suggested that this same prowler , since there could scarcely be two , is the one who attacked Mrs Dacres later . We know this prowler did not break into the house through Mrs Dacres ' apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her front doors when she recovered . " No evidence has shown how this possible murderer locked the animals and the remains in the kitchen , and left the one key inside . " You must also bear in mind that the fact that Mrs Garr 's possessions may have been searched in her absence does not prove that such a thief committed murder . " Nor must you be influenced by the strong belief some of the witnesses have shown that Mrs Garr was murdered . " I shall now consider the case of natural death . In that case the simple course of events would seem to be this . " Mrs Garr descended into her basement on her return to the house around eight-thirty . She may have sat in the storage room on her accustomed chair . She has left her wraps and handbag in the storage room . Sometime before ten o'clock she has opened the door of the basement kitchen , and the cat escapes . She may have been down there when Mrs Dacres returned at ten . No one in the house will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time before the search . At some time between ten and midnight Mrs Garr recaptures the cat , returns it to the kitchen with the others . She may have been listening for prowlers ; at any rate she sits in the kitchen in the dark . She is subject , to heart attacks . She suffers , then , such an attack , is overcome by apoplexy or any sudden illness . She dies . This may have been before or after the search of the house ; it may even have been the sounds of the attack on Mrs Dacres and the subsequent tumult that brought on her illness . " It is extremely regrettable that the basement kitchen was not searched with the rest of the house that night ; there is great possibility she was still living ; at any rate the cause of death could then have been easily ascertained . " The foregoing is all conjecture , I repeat . All that is known isp169that the remains of Mrs Garr were found late the next Thursday evening , in such condition that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " Circumstantiating evidence for a natural death is the key to the room in which Mrs Garr was found . The door was locked , and the key inside . Fiction to the contrary , this is very difficult to effect , for any murderer . " Ladies and gentlemen , you have been given exact accounts of the admitted activities of all persons well acquainted with the house at 593 Trent Street . If your verdict is murder you may , if you have determined by whom it was committed , name that person . " He stopped talking . The jury stood up , in a dazed , blundering way , and straggled out of the room by a side door . I looked back to the coroner . He was sitting expansively back , his hands patting his sides . Lieutenant Strom , next to him , was smiling slightly . I started  --  was he smiling at me ? I had only an instant to wonder in  --  he turned immediately to speak to the coroner . Hodge Kistler , beside me , made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer be ? " " Murder . I 'm sure it 's murder , " I whispered back . " You had your mind made up beforehand . " " Did n't you ? " " M-m-m-m . " " How long do you think it 'll take ? " " Any time , up to and including hours . " " F'heaven 's sake ! Then let 's take up our legs and walk ! " We both got up , stretched , walked around the room . The others , when they saw we were n't stopped , got up to do likewise , pausing in little groups of three and four to whisper and talk . The atmosphere around the audience was heavy with suspense ; only the policemen walked in lighter air . They huddled to talk too , though ; I waited until Lieutenant Strom was momentarily detached , and went to speak to him . Mr Kistler followed . " Excellently well reasoned , Lieutenant Strom. "  | " Why are n't you congratulating the coroner on that ? " He glinted at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . " " Nice to be appreciated . " " Oh , I did . I was thinking I could n't have done better myself . " The lieutenant howled . " Of all the conceited little minxes ! " And to Mr Kistler : " How do you ever stand a girl like that ? " " She thinks I have n't any , so she has n't started judging my mental output yet , " Mr Kistler said . " Surprised ? " the lieutenant asked me . " No . Why ? " " You mean you have n't changed your mind about anything ? " " No . Why should I ? " " How ' d you like to have me pass judgment on your mental processes ? " He laughed again . " Go ahead . " " Spare the child , " Hodge Kistler broke in . " What 's the verdict going to be ? " " Ask me , with all these powerful intellects around ? " " Do n't you know yourself ? " I put that one in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moment . " Sure , I know . But do I tell ? Just this much  --  there wo n't be any detective in your front hall tonight . You have n't had a tail all day . There . Think that one out . " He laughed at me again and went back to his coroner . " What does he mean ? " I asked Hodge Kistler excitedly . " Does he mean they have it all solved ? They have the mur-derer ? " " Maybe . " Mr Kistler 's eyes showed thinking too . " Or maybe they think the whole thing 's just a washout . Just an insignificant old woman , better dead , dying of the infirmities of age . " " It 's just got to be murder ! I know it 's murder ! " I was in a fever of impatience . We went out to get chocolate bars at the stand ; I kept running back , thinking I heard sounds of the jury returning . The others were nervous too . Mrs Halloranflounced away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without moving in his chair , his face thin/ner than it had been , curiously empty . Mr Buffingham strode back and forth along the side of the room , tapping his eternal cigarette ashes on the floor , fixing his eyes moodily downward or darting quick glances at one group or another . Miss Sands whispered to the Wailers in a corner . The Tewmans wandered to the door , looking at passers-by , standing where everyone bumped them going in or out . It was after six when the jurors went out . When seven came and they had n't returned , I asked Mr Kistler : " What 's it usually mean when the jury takes a long time ? " He shrugged . " Someone 's a holder-outer . " If there was just one holder-outer , he was a passing good one . It was nearly eight before we saw the doorknob of the door behind which the jury had retired turning , and the widening space between door and frame . We all scrambled for our scats ; the jury filed portentously into theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking in ordinary tones , asked the question . One juryman had remained standing ; he was the one that replied . " We find that Mrs Garr died a natural death , from cause or causes unknown . " I could n't believe it . I swung my eyes quickly to Lieutenant Strom . This time there was n't any doubt of it . His hooded eyes were directly on me , and his lips smiled triumphantly , sardonically . I felt as if I had been sailing away up in the sky under a parachute , and the parachute had suddenly folded . So that was the answer , so that was the end . " Do you mean to say , " I asked Mr Kistler as he hustled me out , " that that 's all there is ? The police wo n't do any more ? " " Sure . Your mystery 's exploded . Sure . There was n't any mystery . All there was was a poor old lady dying off by herself , in the wrong company . That 's what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's settled . There wo n't be anotherp172detective in that house from now until its last brick is dust in a pedestrian 's eye . " Oh , how mistaken he was about that ! But I did n't know that , then . Not knowing , I enjoyed my hamburgers very much . That 's what we had for dinner . Reversal to type , Mr Kistler said , after our fancy lunch . Mr Kistler took the inquest calmly , but I  --  there 's no second way of diagnosing my emotions  --  was furious . " To think a man is capable of handling facts and ideas as beautifully as Lieutenant Strom did in his summing up of the case , and then this is the conclusion he draws ! Of all the idiots ! " " Did the thought ever trickle into your sweet little head that Lieutenant Strom might be right ? After all , he 's had experience with murders . You have n't . All you have is a feeling for drama . You feel nothing but murder would fit the particularly nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . " " Strom ca n't be right . I know he 's wrong . " Mr Kistler waved the hand holding the current hamburger . " Let 's hear you prove it . You would n't want to send anyone to the electric chair on feelings , would you ? " I could n't prove it , of course . " All right , that laughs you down . Now forget it . This is a holiday . Any time I take you out is always a holiday . Let 's go to a movie and otherwise dissipate . Did you ever send any rum down your intellectual neck ? I thought not . Tonight sees the beginning of a new life for you . Not too literally , I hope , of course . " We had fun . I had my first rum sling and saw a movie through it , and we danced . All that has n't a lot to do with the death that lived and walked in Mrs Garr 's house , so I 'll leave it with this honorable mention . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , quiet , unpoliced hall , pausing to say good night at my door . I unlocked my door , took a swift look to see that all was well  --  I did this every time , now , knowing how many skeleton keys might unlock my door when I was gone  --  and reported all okay before Hodge Kistler went upstairs . I felt good , I was happy , the rum was still a sweet fire insidep173me . I got ready for bed happy , but not too happy to hook my chairs under the knobs as usual . I felt awfully safe in the security of those chairs ; I smiled back at the evening ; I forgot Mrs Garr entirely , and slept . I have n't any idea how much later it was when I woke . I woke thinking , how dark it is ! and lay there , puzzling about the dark . Even if the moon does n't shine , the street lamp on the corner always makes my room full of that yellow haze in which objects are perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only blackness . I moved my face slowly , just enough so I could see where the windows usually were . Blackness . But no . A thread-thin line of light . My shades were down . That was the last moment I breathed . As surely as if I saw it then with my eyes , I saw myself letting those shades up that night , as usual . There was sound and movement in the room now . Air , shaken , flowed over my stiffened face . Sound of movement , stealthy , purposeful , deadly . Death . The death that lived in Mrs Garr 's h se . Death walking slowly , quietly , surely in my room . My boy was iron , my throat was an empty tube ; I opened my mouth to scream and no sound came out of me . An inch at a time I moved my stiffened , weak right arm toward the side of the bed . The tips of my fingers touched cloth . I do n't have to guess what will go on in my rind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it end then . Somewhere in the quiet inside me my lost voice said , " Oh , God , I prepare to die . " The same instant a stunning blow came at me out of the darkness.  |p174PEOPLE  in good health sometimes take a ghoulish enjoyment out of talking about death . I 've heard them , so that means I 've listened . But from now on anyone is going to have a hard time to make me believe dying is pleasant . The place where you go when you die is black , it 's a pit , and there is n't even quiet there , no rest , there 's terrible pain ; you have to break before there 's rest , you have to break and stop being . There 's terrible pain cracking your weakness , tearing you apart , shredding you , pulling you out thinner and thinner like faint elastic , pulling you out , until the thread of your life is so tenuous it is n't there at all , you 're gone , you are n't any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit . I was almost there . I was so close that all I had to do was just that final letting go , and then I could have been quiet , because there was no more of me . It was frightful , coming back . I had to call my substance back , recreate it out of the black pit , and I was so weak . I 'd flag , and flow away from myself again , and start anew . I came back , of course . You know , or I would n't be writing this . I came back into white light , white heat , white pain . Compared to it , even the black was better . I wanted to slip back , but THEY would n't let me . THEY kept doing things to me . Peculiar things ; I could n't distinguish what . It was n't for a long while that THEY began to break down into people . A man in shirt sleeves , working so hard . Hodge Kistler . White face . Mr Waller . Lieutenant Strom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . until dust in your eye . I tried to get awayp175from them , but they would n't let me . They slapped me and stuck me with pins and poured things down my throat . I was more and more awake . Much against my will . I could locate one worst pain now . My head . Appendicitis in my head . Rum . Did rum do that to me ? No , not rum . The THING by the bed . Death . I almost went out again . But this time it was easier to come back . I looked up at the face over me . Hodge Kistler 's face . White . Sweating . " It hit me . " That was my voice . I must have left most of it back in the pit . " Take it easy , but try not to drop off again . Try . Try , will you ? " " My head . " A river of air ran back and forth across his face with the smile on it . " You 're still wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood back , and his voice from away on the other side of the room said , " How 's she doing , Doc ? " " Fine , " another ocean-going voice boomed back . " Who 's goingto be the nurse around here ? Fine . Just do n't let her drop off to sleep before noon . " It was quiet after that except for the noon whistles in my head . Sometimes Mrs Waller and sometimes Mr Kistler was besidemy bed . Every time I closed my eyes they slapped me , which did n't seem kind when I felt so badly . So I found a way to sleep with my eyes open . They did n't object to that . Finally they really let me sleep . When I woke up the light was on in the middle of my ceiling , with a paper bag tied around it . People do such ridiculous things . But I was better . My head had decided to run locomotives instead of whistles . Locomotives jar , but they 're nicer than whistles . My body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if I was loose . I reached up and turned my mind on , like a radio dial . Nice to think again , even if there was a lot of static . Hodge Kistler was sitting beside the bed , his legs stuck out in front of him and his hands in his pants pockets , looking grimmer than I 'd ever thought he could look.  | " Hello , " I said . He jumped . " Why , hello ! Look who 's back in town ! " He brought his face down close to me ; he was smiling all over it . " Who did it ? " " If you wo n't go slithering away again I 'll tell you . We do n't know . " " You mean you did n't catch it ? " " Gwynne , it 's as much a mystery as all the rest . " I was n't too weak for malice . " Do the police  --  does Lieutenant Strom say it was a natural dea  --  say I fell out of bed on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to crow , you can . You could buy two of LieutenantStrom today for one mildewed Chinese yen . " " My head  --  is it broken ? " " Say , your head ca n't be broken . " " Then why do I feel so awful ? " " Listen , Gwynne . Smell . " I smelled . " Funny . Like  --  " " Like ether ? " " Yes . " " Well , whoever it was went one better than ether . It was an ether dry cleaner . You 've got a right to feel rotten . " " I do . You do n't have to worry about that . " " Aw , Gwynne . " He took my hand . " I 'm awfully , awfully sorry . " " I should have taken you up on your invitation . " " Do n't . " " You are n't going to leave me here tonight , are you ? " " Do n't worry . I 've stayed up all night before . " That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this time I really slept . When I woke again the light was still going inside the paper bag on the ceiling , but sunlight was flowing in the windows too . Hodge Kistler was sitting fast asleep in the armchair jammed close to my couch , his head almost down to his shoulder , his feet up on another chair , his hands limp and open at his sides , with the palms outward.  |p177It  was the only time I 'd ever seen him look pathetic . Clearly I Lard a step in the hall ; startled , I turned my head . The face of the Wilson-chinned policeman appeared briefly around the door casing , turned owlish eyes on me , disappeared again . I lifted my head cautiously from the pillow ; it did n't fall apart . In fact it was quite a decent head . It was sore when I touched it , but outside of a feeling that I ought to hold on to it with my hands to keep it in place on my neck , it did n't bother me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back of Mr Kistler 's armchair . I was n't successful . At the first slide his eyes popped wide open . " Hey , what ' re you doing ? " " I 'm hungry . " I was , too . " Hungry ? " he asked incredulously . " Of course I 'm hungry . " " You ca n't be hungry . Your stomach 's upset . " " I can too be . I should know . " He stood up , yawned , shook himself . " All you get is orange juice . The doctor said so . Nothing yesterday . Orange juice today . " That was all I did get , too , all day long . We fought about whether I was to get up , too ; he called the doctor by phone and came back disgruntled . " The doc says all right , get up , if you 're so damn healthy . Go back to bed the minute you feel weak . I do n't see why you do n't feel weak ; I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . It 's Wednesday , do you know that ? Wednesday . I 'm going to tell that cop to keep an eye on you . " The first thing I did when I got on my feet was to turn off the ceiling light . I stood in the middle of my **26;5106;TOOLONG , reorienting myself . Heavens , things were in a mess . Newspapers , magazines , books strewn on the floor . The drawers of the buffet yawning , their contents tumbled and spilling over . The lower drawer was entirely out ; it stood on the floor . Dishes were pushed about in the cabinet above . I did n't get it.  | Even if the people who 'd dragged me back to life had needed to find things in a hurry they need n't have made a mess like this . It was willful , malicious ! I walked toward the passageway to my kitchen . Here , too , on the right of the little hall , drawers had been pulled out , their contents jumbled . Heartsick , I looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying in tumbled heaps on the floor ; my trunk was open and its contents thrown to right and left . The kitchen was in the same state . Mrs Garr 's closet was worst . I got it then . And stood there thinking what a fool I was . I had n't told the police about the closet Mrs Garr retained in my kitchen . I had n't even thought of it . Coming and going in that kitchen , I had n't even thought of it as a place to search . It seemed incredible , now , that I had n't . When I 'd first moved into the place I 'd been annoyed at Mrs Garr 's holding this corner of my domain . But except for one time , she had n't bothered me to get into it . I 'd forgotten it was there . I no more thought of it as existing than I did the unused basement stairs beside it . I bent ( careful , my head ) to pick up an old-fashioned , mothbally mink jacket from the floor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments . A musty hat , torn savagely . A faded , padded sachet , ripped . Boxes and small keepsakeslay together in the heap . I had it , all right , then . Someone had been ransacking my apartment . On purpose . I had proof now . There was a prowler . He had n't found what he wanted in Mrs Garr 's part of the house . So now he had searched mine . That was why I 'd been attacked . He had to get me out of the way . What was he hunting ? What , in heaven 's name , could arouse this frenzied seeking ? Had he found what he wanted ? Found it , here in this closet ? I got dizzy , standing there , and staggered back to bed . I drank more of the orange juice Hodge had left on the table there . It did n't help much . Orange juice may be full of vitamins ,  |p179but  bacon and eggs have things it has n't . My body rested on the couch but my mind kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? More money ? He must already have found some , between that Friday and the Thursday when the death was discovered ; the police , Mrs Halloran and I had found the well-hidden caches ; these were probably only part of the whole . Suddenly I knew why the macaroni had been spilled on the table below ; there had been money hidden there , deep within . I had proof some money had been found , perhaps  --  that torn five-dollar bill . Someone must want money desperately . Mr Buffingham with his son in jail , needing lawyers , needing bought witnesses . Mr Grant , living there , old , not working , liking luxury . What did he live on ? Miss Sands . Aging . Hating her job and afraid of losing it . The Wailers , living there on odd jobs , rent free . The greedy Hallorans . The poor Tewmans . And , to be consistent , Mr Kistler , struggling to keep his Guide alive . And for the matter of that , Mrs Dacres . Jobless . Who did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such desperate things , take such risks , for the sake of a few hundred dollars ? It seemed unreasonable . No , I thought . If it 's money , it must be a lot of money . Someoneknows there 's one big pile somewhere . A big pile , that Mrs Garr would hide best of all , of course . She was shrewd . The ransacker had taken what money he found . There never had been any left among the things ransacked . Did that prove it was money he was after ? No , that just showed he took what he found . What else could there be ? Some record out of Mrs Garr 's lurid past ? Some incriminating record ? Who could be seeking such a thing ? Ever since I 'd seen that rent-receipt book on Saturday afternoonI 'd suspected two Mrs Garr was probably blackmailing . Miss Sands . Why would an aging saleswoman pay blackmail ? Yet how else explain five dollars a week for that room ? Mr Buffingham . Well , some escapade of his son 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of two who were blackmailing Mrs Garr.  |p180The  Wallers . Even if they did produce a note , for what did she owe them that two thousand dollars ? No , the rent they did n't pay made them suspect . The Hallorans . It was n't unlikely Mrs Garr held notes of theirs for money she 'd given them . Was it some record of indebtedness that was being sought ? And whatever it was the hunter hunted , had the end come now ? Was the attack on me , the pillage of my rooms , the last link in the chain ? Had the prowler found there , at last , what he hunted ? The answer was right there in my living room . No , the sought-for had n't been found . No one would have been too stupid not to search Mrs Garr 's closet first . If what was hunted had been found there , the search would have ended . But it had n't . It had gone on through my entire apartment . The disorder here was no red herring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more thorough one . I knew well enough there was nothing hidden among my things . There was only one conclusion to draw . The hunter was still unsatisfied . I closed my eyes and wondered if I 'd be able to live through what was bound to come . Right there I quit the Garr case as fun . I went into it as battle : I get the murderer before he got me . Skirmishes began with the doorbell 's ring , the door 's opening , heavy feet in the hall . Lieutenant Strom , flanked by two men , stood beside my bed . " Well , coming around ? " " I 'm practically bursting with health . " " That 's one gray hair less on my head . I regret very much that this has happened , Mrs Dacres . If you want to light into me , go right ahead . " " You still think Mrs Garr 's death was n't murder ? " He sat down in the armchair and sighed . " Mrs Dacres , did you ever spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cry about murder ? After all , by and large , I 've found out that most of the people who get murderedleave the world better off for their absence . Now this is the way I look at it . One person kills another , willfully or accidentally . Society feels , naturally , that such a crime should be punished . " But look at that punishment . It usually consists , or is supposedto , of removal from society  --  complete excision  --  either by life imprisonment or death . Why ? Punishment ? Vengeance ? Retribution ? Not entirely . To cure the murderer of murdering ? We have n't found that murder is curable . To stop other people from murdering in their turn ? It does n't work that way ; new murderers spring up under the harshest laws . " No . It 's because a person who has killed once , and gotten away with it , is so likely to kill again . It 's to remove a menace from people still living . " Now you take Mrs Garr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The simplest explanation , and the one that takes in everything that happened , is that she died naturally . And if she was assisted to die , what 's the likelihood ? That she was pushed over by some surprised prowler . She had a bad heart . Now few sneak thieves intend murder . He 's out for small stuff . No gun on him ; he did n't shoot her . No poison administered . The thief 's scared , runs . We catch and punish him if we can , but if we ca n't , what ? He is n't the type to murder again . Come along with me so far ? " " I see your argument . " " That 's the way things looked up to Monday night . We meant to keep on eye on things here , sure . Officer told off to patrol this block . " " It 's nice to be so well protected . " " Have your sarcasm . Oh , what a different tale you 've made out of this ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted murder . Good , solid , tangible attempted murder , with clues . I 'm out to get someone now . Oh , yes indeed . Deliberate attack ! Now we know the guy 's dangerous . Now we know he 's the type that kills again . Now we 've got to pick him off society like a flea off a dog , and see he does n't get back . We ca n't have him killing off perfectly good , healthy young women "  --  he smiled slowly down  --  " damn nice young women , in their own peculiar way . " " Norwegians should n't kiss the blarney stone , " I said . " It is n't in character . I 'm glad to know I 'm so important . " " You 're going to have all the importance you can stand today . Because I 'm going to get every person who was or could have been under this roof for chloroforming purposes that night come in here and repeat the stories they told me yesterday . I 'll catch any discrepancies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think is significant . Fortunately we 're confined to people who could have known about Mrs Garr 's keeping things in that closet in your kitchen . By the way , is n't that another item you forgot to tell me ? " " I 'm sorry . " " You 're suffering for it yourself . Will that teach you to tell the police everything ? " " Yes sir . " " Think you can stand having me start on witnesses today ? " " Oh my , yes . " I sat up in bed , had pillows piled in back of me , and almost forgot I 'd had no food . " But I want to know what happened , first ! I have n't been told one word ! " He laughed . " I can imagine the rapacious state of your mind . Okay , here goes , as testified . You celebrated the inquest with Mr Kistler , imbibing well and on the whole wisely . Correct ? " " Correct . " " You come home at 3 A.M. or thereabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Kistler at your door , after having turned on your light , looked apartment over and reported all okay . " " Right . " " Mr Kistler 's testimony . That is all we know of you for some time . Tuesday morning comes . Six o'clock . The telephone rings . It rings and rings . It finally awakens Miss Sands , upstairs . She comes down , answers . It is for Mr Kistler . She goes up , knocks at his door until he answers . Mr Kistler , furious , comes downstairs . It turns out the call is from Mr Trowbridge , who , itp183seems , is out celebrating because the Guide has secured a big advertising contract " Oh , and Hodge did n't tell me ! That must be the one he was after Saturday ! " " Yep . Guy came through on Monday . Mr Trowbridge , it seems , celebrates neither well nor wisely , and has suddenly been . stricken with a desire to know how the inquest came out . It is the very shank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts back to bed . " A thought hits him and he stops on the first step . " How come Miss Sands to answer the phone ? " Her room is upstairs , far from the phone . Your bed , on the contrary , is right on the other side of the wall . You are in the habit of rushing out to answer . He decides it is because of the evening before , and turns to the stairs again , when something else hits him . " A smell . " He walks over to your doors , sniffs , and then sniffs under the doors . He gets it strong there  --  ether and naphtha . Why would you be dry-cleaning , coming home at 3 A.M. ? Before 6 A.M. ? He knocks softly , you do n't answer . He calls , you do n't answer . He takes a run and tries to break the doors down , but they 're reinforced by those chairs under the knobs and wo n't give an inch . " " Oh , my goodness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chairs were still under the knobs ? " " I 'll say they were . " I sat up straight and felt the blood draining out of my face . " Then how did he  --  it  --  get in ? " Lieutenant Strom shook his head at me soberly . " I 've gone over this damn apartment inch by inch . I ca n't find one way anyone could have got in . Or out . " I stared at him , horror gripping me . What had been there in that room ?  | " LISTEN , " I said , " I ca n't stand this . Not without something to eat . Ca n't I have something to eat ? " " Go call the doc , Van . " Van phoned , came back . " Nothing but fruit juice till tomorrow , miss . " I used to like orange juice , too . " I want to be shown , " I said when I 'd had it . " I want to be shown how no one got out or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up just like it was before the doors were broken down . I was going to go over that anyway . So you can just as well see it at the same time . " " First tell me the rest . " " The rest was hard labor . Kistler got Waller down , and the two of them busted the lock ; the chairs fell when the doors pushed open ; your key was still in one of the locks . They rushed in , pulled up the shades , and there you were , with a big wad of cotton batting covering your face , still sopping with the God damn dry cleaner . Kistler did a lot of work on you , young lady . If you 're glad to be alive yet you can thank him for it . " " I-1e is nice , is n't he ? " " Sure . Even men think he 's nice . " " That proves it . I 'll do a nice job of thanks . No sign of where the ether came from ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleenfine . " A picture flashed back into my mind . " Oh , my goodness ! Miss Sands ! " " What 's that ? " " Miss Sands . I was upstairs to ask her a question . She was pressing clothes . And cleaning spots off them with a dry cleaner on a rag . I saw the can . " " Kleenfine ? " " Yes . "  | " Well , I brought that out yesterday , in a way . Asked them all if they had a can . She admitted it . She and Mrs Waller both did . It 's a common home cleaner . They both showed me their cans , partially full . You ca n't base much of a case on that alone . Anyonecan buy it . " He was eyeing me narrowly . " It 's a thing a woman would think of , " I began slowly . " Urn . Before we go into that there 's something I want to go into with you . What did you go upstairs to ask Miss Sands ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail of Mr Halloran then . And I was thinking about the cat in the hall at ten o'clock . Someone caught it and put it back in the kitchen before midnight . So I went up to ask if anyone had seen or heard anyone who might have done so . " His eyes were hard on my face . " Who ' d you ask ? " " Why , Mr Buffingham first , and then Mr Grand , Miss Sands , the Wallers . Mr Kistler was n't home either time , of course . None of them had heard anything . " Lieutenant Strom sat forward impressively . " Has it penetrated your little noodle that a lot worse things happened to you night before last than were necessary to keep you out of the way of a little ransacking ? If you 'd been found two hours later than you were , probably only one hour later , you would have been dead . Whoever came here that night came with deliberate intent to murder . To murder you . " " Oh my , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It sounds awfully bloodthirsty when you put it that way . " He snorted . " That is n't what you should be saying . You should be asking a question . " " Why , you mean ? " " Exactly . " " Well , I was in the way . And then I have sort of been nosing around , you know . " He snorted again . " Do I know ! " " But it does n't do me any good to pull in my horns now , " I pointed out . " Because whatever I 've done to make someone want to murder me , I 've already done . Or if it 's something Ip186know , I already know it . I ca n't undo it or unknow it . The only thing I can do is go ahead and get him before he gets me . " " Dacres the lionhearted . You might acquaint me with a few of your hidden secrets . " " Well , of course it 's too late to tell you about the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Former comment repeated . " " Then there 's the receipt book . I found that on Saturday when you gave me permission to look through Mrs Garr 's things , and Mrs Halloran and I found the money . I have n't seen you since , you know . I do n't suppose your fat detective told you , how much time I spent looking at that receipt book ? " " No ! " I told him all about it then . He was very much interested in my theory that the high rents paid by Miss Sands and Mr Buffingham represented blackmail , and that the Wallers in turn had been blackmailing Mrs Garr . Then I told him what I 'd deduced that morning from the state my rooms were in , but he only listened with half his mind to that , and said yes , he 'd thought the same thing . He got up briskly when I ended , and said he was going to work on how my would-be murderer had . gotten in and out of my apartment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I showed him how I fixed the doors at night ; the metal lock of my double doors hung by a shred now , but when we forced the doors together and hooked the chairs under the knobs they were still tight , even without the lock . With his two flanking detectives , he spent a good half-hour on those doors , examining the hinges , the casings , the knobs . Van got on the outside to force the doors ; the chairs fell with . a clatter that would have waked me a dozen times over even if I 'd been drunk , which I was n't . " That 's the way Kistler says they fell in when he and Waller broke in here Tuesday morning , " said the lieutenant . " No one could go out through those doors , lock them , leave the key inside and hook the chairs under the knobs after himself , " I said . " That 's flat . "  | " We 'd sort of figured that too , " the lieutenant replied dryly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here when the door was broken in yesterday morning ? " " Well , the first thing Waller says he did was to look around , and Kistler saw him do it . I guess he even took some time off from you to look around himself , being a little mad . They both swear there could n't a soul have escaped ' em . After we got here we looked again , and there was n't a trace . This place is n't so big anyone could have hid out on Waller or Kistler , either . " After that he went on to the windows . I 'd had the windows open , of course . From the top . But they were screened . Well screened , being on the ground floor . One screen was new  --  the one the policemen had gone through to capture Buffingham 's son . Every screen was held on the outside by those little gadgets that turn , and on the inside by hooks . They went over those screens with magnifying glasses , for the least fresh sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had found any , it would have been impossible for anyone to come and go by any of those windows , leaving the screens fastened both inside and out . The kitchen window , the kitchen door were given thorough attention next . The kitchen door had once fitted loosely , but it had been weatherstripped ; the men figured for an hour before they gave up , to admit the bolt could n't possibly have been pulled by any contrivance from the outside , however ingenious . " Besides , " I said from my watchtower on the kitchen table , " I 've decided that whoever 's doing this is someone stupid . You have to look for something easy . " I 'll skip the answers I got . They passed on to the unused door to the unused staircase . Its bolt was rusted as stiffly as ever ; the lieutenant worked at it until the veins bulged on his forehead ; could n't budge it . They tapped the walls , took the rugs up off the floors , examined the ceilings . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at each other in gloomy defeat . Lieutenant Strom rallied . " Now , men , I do n't believe in ghosts . Not ghosts wielding hammers and anything as modern as Kleenfine . This was a human being , and maybe even a dumb one at that , if we 're going to go by Mrs Dacres . Just dumb enough to wear gloves . What I would n't give for a fingerprint on that Kleenfine can ! We 've gone over all this stuff , and there 's is n't a clue in it . All you can say for the methods used on Mrs Dacres were that they were thorough , except for a lucky chance , but not expert . Our best bet is tracking him down by how he got in or out . That 's what we 've got to do , concentrate on those two questions . How ' d he get in ? How ' d he get out ? " " He might of been in here , hiding , when Mrs Dacres came in that night , " offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , appalled . " He could n't have been ! I was all through the rooms . " " Sure of that ? " " Oh yes ! " " In the kitchen ? " " Yes . " " Lavatory ? " " Yes . " " Closet ? " " Yes . I hung my dress away . I do n't have so much in my closet anyone could hide in there . " " How about that closet of Mrs Garr 's ? " " Before all its contents got thrown out it was so full I do n't think anyone could have squeezed in . Besides , look how the lock on it was broken . I 'd certainly have noticed that . " Again the three men walked through the two rooms , looking for hiding places . My studio couch came low to the floor . My steamer trunk was tightly against the wall . There just was n't any hiding place . " Now let 's snap out of this . " The lieutenant was exasperated . " What if he did hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . There 's just one more place I can think of to give the works , and that 's those cellar stairs . We 'll get at ' em from below . Come on . " The order was to his two men , but I came too . " Why , the door 's open ! " I cried at the foot of the cellar stairs  |p189The  lieutenant turned his hooded eyes on me . " Sure , it was opened Monday afternoon , by the last cop before he left . Why not ? We were through with it . " He went on into the room in which all that was left of Mrs Garr had been found . I swallowed hard , but pattered right after . It was the first time , really , that I had been in that kitchen . Before , I 'd just seen it from the furnace room ; sometimes the door had stood open , but usually it had been closed . Now I saw it closely . All trace of the nightmare once dwelling there had been removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an unappetizingkitchen , for all that . Lavatory to the right , under mine . A door , which Van opened on a flight of stairs going upward toward my kitchen . At the left , a grimy , hooded gas stove . A dust-gray cupboard . Against the wall ahead , a table . My blood quickened . A kitchen table . One table . The only table . It stood against the back wall , midway between the two basement windows at the back ; it stood just about under where my back porch was . It stood four feet under and about three feet to the left of the basement window that was open an inch . The lieutenant had halted at the foot of the stairs . " Wait ! " I called . He turned around . " What ? " " The table . Is that the table where the key was found ? " " Sure . " " Then Mrs Garr was murdered , " a loud , clear voice was saying . Mine . " And I know how the murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The two policemen , already halfway up the stairs , came tumbling back . The three men advanced on me , almost like an army ; there was something threatening in the way they stood over me . " Okay , talk . " " It 's awfully simple . The murderer walked out the door and locked it behind him . He probably caught the animals one by one , shoved them in and locked the door behind them . "  | " Yeh , he shoved the key in and locked the door behind that , I suppose . " " Oh no . He waited until the house was quiet . Then he walked around to the back of the house , outside , and threw the key in through that partially opened window . It landed on the table . That was the sound I heard down here . Plink , ' it said . " " By God , Lieutenant , I believe she 's right ! " Van was excited , staring up at the slit the window was open . " I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and throw my keys in . " He dashed out . The lieutenant was viewing me sourly . " Do n't mind me , " he said bitterly . " Do n't tell me anything . I 'm the last person to tell things to . Did you ever tell me one word about things falling into the cellar ? " I was mournful about it myself . " I ca n't help it . I forget things . Then I see something , like the relation between that table and the window , and some remembrance flashes back . " " I wish to God they 'd flash sooner . If they had , you might have spent a more comfortable day yesterday , that 's some com fort . " He said that ; he was definitely cross . But he was abashed too ; I knew he thought he should have thought that out about the window himself . But knowing how he felt about Mrs Garr 's death , I could imagine how perfunctorily he had gone over the room , after his squad of fingerprinters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van was evidently outside , because a key sailed in . It hit the edge of the table , then fell to the floor . " Throw more to the right ! " the lieutenant called . The second key came in with a nice curve and landed on the table with a little metallic clink ; the lieutenant flourished a handkerchief over his face . " Not three inches from where that other damn key was . That 's enough , Van . " He sat down on the edge of the table to think , juggling the keys in his hands , until Van came back . " Okay . " The lieutenant 's eyes were now bright beneath their hoods . " Someone has guilty knowledge of Mrs Garr 's death . Guilty , because why , if it was n't , would he throw in the key ?  |p191And  now , Mrs Dacres , you know another little reason why you 've had your two little experiences . You are suspected of having heard that key fall , and the murderer 's suspicions on that point are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieves now over not having done a complete job on you , I could almost feel sorry for him . By heaven , if I 'd ever ' lapsed from virtue anywhere near you , I 'd want you murdered too ! " He turned to the staircase from which I 'd recalled him . " Now I 'm going back to where I was before you jerked me off it . And boy , was I in a whale of a place . " He took me by the shoulders , pulled me to the first step , played his flashlight ahead up the stairs . " See those steps ? " " Yes sir . " " Notice anything about ' em ? " " They look like ordinary steps to me . " " That all ? " " The paint 's almost worn off . " " Not that . Notice anything about ' em that should be remarked , taking in mind something that was brought out at the inquest ? " He gave me time to think ; I thought hard , too . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Okay . " There was soothed satisfaction in the word . " Well , I did n't put two and two together , either , when I looked at ' em yesterday . But the minute I stepped foot to ' em this morning it hit me . One of those flashes you talk about . Remember now ? " I could n't . The other two men were as unknowing as I was . Greater satisfaction lit the lieutenant 's voice . " Well , I 'll just repeat a few words we brought out in Jerry Foster 's evidence . This is what those words were : The dust of those stairs was undisturbed . " ' We got it then . " And now what ? " The lieutenant went on triumphantly , over our exclamations . " Those stairs have been swept ! Swept ! Who swept ' em ? Not Tewman . She beat it out of here right after the inquest . Swears she would n't stay in the house . Not Halloran . Says she has n't been near the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got her out of bed at three in the afternoon , Tuesday . Not my squad when I told ' em to clean up here . I was in here after they 'd finished and I remember thinking how like the lazy bums it was not to sweep the stairs . No , there 's only one person would have had an interest in sweeping those stairs . And that 's the guy who wanted to chloroform Mrs Dacres . He needed those stairs . He did n't want footsteps to show . He knew fresh footsteps on dust could n't get by . But there was a chance we would n't notice swept stairs . He got through that door up there somehow ! " He charged up . We followed as far as the landing . He was working at the door , playing his light on the four screws in the door casing , with their heads tight against the door . " We tested the knob for fingerprints last night . Clean . That 's suspicious too . Clean , after all the time this door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Again his flash played up and down the door by the screw heads . He gave an exclamation of delight . I could see it too . In the old gray paint of the door , a tiny , fresh scratch ! " A scratch ! See that ? A scratch ! Bolt or no bolt , I 'm taking these screws out of here and seeing what happens . " He took a knife from his pocket , worked at one screw with a flat-end blade that worked like a screwdriver . The screw turned tightly for the first four or five turns , then came with surprising ease the rest of the way . It was n't five minutes before he had all four screws out . " Golly , that was easy ! " He took the doorknob in his hand , turned it , pulled back hard . I reached out a hand to keep him from falling backward on us. - The door had come open ! It sprang open at his first touch ! As easily , as freely as anydoor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so sudden I could n't think what it meant for a while . Then I looked at the bolt . The bolt had parted neatly , right at the edge of the door.  |p193We  all stepped through to the kitchen but stood clustering around the door , the men swearing excitedly under their breaths . Both ends of the bolt were rusted solidly in their sockets ; when the door was closed again both ends met ; it was impossible to see the break with the door closed . " Sawed ! " Lieutenant Strom repeated for the tenth time , admiringly . I was considering , startled , what I could sleep through . " Would n't you think I 'd wake up ? It must have made some noise . " " You did n't get home until 3 A.M. , did you ? " The lieutenant decried my lack of imagination . " Plenty of time between midnight and 3 A.M. for anyone to saw a dozen bolts . " " You mean when I came home , he  --  it  --  was waiting down here , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's it , all right . " " I do n't think I 'll ever sleep again ! " He laughed . " Sure you will . " " How can I ? Thinking of that , that something down there , waiting for me to sleep so he could come and kill me in the dark ! " " It wo n't happen again , " the lieutenant gave reassurance . " I 'll post a man down there every night until we get this cleared up . And I 'm having a locksmith in to put good new locks on all three of your doors . That satisfy you ? " " I 'll never feel safe again ! When I think how I trusted those chairs under my doorknobs . . . " Lieutenant Strom winked at the other two men . " The only advice I can give you is , get married . Nothing 's as safe as a husband . " He laughed and turned his attention back to the door . " What a saw that took ! Who 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know of . But of course you know Butfingham 's son " I 've got that in mind . " Another thought had crossed my mind . " Would it be all right if you told me how much the Buffingham boy 's bail is set for ? "  | " You ca n't get bail if you 're a murderer . " " Any amount goes toward paying a lawyer , though . In a spot like that they 'd have to pay cash in advance , I suppose . I wonder , do lawyers ever get a man out on the chance he can rob another bank afterward , and pay them ? " " We are n't getting anywhere talking . " The lieutenant was impatient . " I 've found out how this friend of yours got out and in , that 's something . Right after we 've had lunch , Mrs Dacres , I 'm going to begin getting those people together , and you listen to what they told me . " They went out to eat ; I had orange juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallorans must have been ordered to put in an appearance , because I heard Mrs Halloran 's voice in the front of the house while I was dressing . Lieutenant Strom , returning , set up an impromptu court in my living room ; he in my armchair with the gate-leg table before him , I on the couch as both audience and jury . The Hallorans were called . Nine of them trooped in . Mr and Mrs Halloran first , completely detached from their following . Seven children ; I counted them . Six sly , snickering children as wild as rabbits , and one girl of perhaps eleven , the oldest , small , pinched , overworked , efficient , who pushed and slapped them into what semblance of order there was . Mrs Halloran 's shiftlessness was bringing an executive into the world . Mrs Halloran did the answering to the lieutenant 's questions . " Sure , I know where we was Monday night . We was celebrating , that 's where we was . Celebrating our money we come into . I 'd like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning your rights . Will you repeat where you went , and when , please . " " Right home we went from that inquest and got all our dear little chillern . " She waved a vague hand at the pack . " So then we went on down to the El Lago restaurant like I said yesterday , my , that 's a swell restaurant , and we all ordered exactly what we had a mind to , too , on account we got an advance from our lawyers . " She preened herself importantly , not loath , I could see , to tell the tale of the evening 's pleasures . So they had " got an advance from our lawyers ! " I could see Mrs Garr 's house evaporating , dirty bricks and all . " So then we et . My , that El Lago certainly has got swell food . After that , the next place we went to was the Red Bubble . " A night club ! Those children ! I gasped and , taking the commentfor admiration , Mrs Halloran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , is what chillern should get acquainted with . Some of the chillern never saw it before . My , they thought it was swell . We had tables right up to the dance floor , and me and Halloran danced ; a couple of the kids went to sleep but we woke ' em up because we had met a couple and we were going on ; we went to a beer parlor on Main Street , and then we went and had some hamburgers in a White House , and then we went to another beer parlor on Hampstead Street , and we all got in with a party of folks there , and my , we sure had a swell time . " " Was Mr Halloran in the party all along ? " I asked . She tossed a coquettish head back at Mr Halloran , who hovered on her outskirts . " Sure he was with us all the time . You do n't think he 'd run out on me , I hope . " Mr Halloran replied to this sally with a silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as long as she was an heiress . There was admiration as well as amazement in my look at the small hellions now . Whatever else they were n't , you had to say they could take it . " Yeh . " The lieutenant put a period to Mrs Halloran . " And what 's worse , we 've checked it all along the line , and it works . They got home at sunup . At 3 A.M. they were reported far too far gone to do any delicate chloroforming . I ca n't see anything more in them , can you ? " The Hallorans appeared impervious to objective insult . " No . " I hated to give them up as suspects , but surely an alibi such as this could be checked thoroughly for holes . With those children , anyone present would have kept them under observation . " That 's all now . " So Lieutenant Strom to the Hallorans . They pushed and clattered out ; we heard them in various stages of vociferation all through the house the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited , en masse , their new possession . I rather wondered that they had n't moved in . But it was less than a week , after all , since Mrs Garr 's death had becomeknown . Less than a week ! How much had happened in that time ! How much must still happen ! If the Hallorans did move in ... I shuddered . I 'd have to move out . But not before this mystery was cleared up . No one was going to nine tenths murder me , and go scot-free , if I could help it . " Call the Tewmans , Van . " Mrs Tewman and the rabbitty man came in . They , too , must have been in the hall , waiting for this . " Now , Mr Tewman , I want to ask you a question . Can you use the same saw on steel you can on wood ? " " Saw ? " " Yes , saw . " " I du n no . I guess so . " " Ever see any saws around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Saw in the toolbox . Under the wash-tubs . " " Oh hell , I 'll never get anywhere this way . You go ahead and repeat your story about where you were Monday night . " " Well , chief , I was at the inquest , see ? " The man was trembling a little . " I 'm on nights at my hamburger house , see , because my brother 's on daytimes and I 'm on nights . So my wife goes back to this house here to get our stuff , and I go right on down to my business . My brother is there , and we talk over this inquest , see , until he goes home around nine o'clock . And it 's like I said , chief , I can prove I did n't leave my business one minute because , why , the place it 's in , there would n't be one stick left in it when I came back if I 'd went away . And it 's still all there . " " That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " That story checks too . We hunted up a couple customers . Now for you , Mrs Tewman . " " I come right on back to the house . " Her sullen voice held anger . " And I was n't going to stay in it a minute I did n't havep197to , either , with that Mrs Halloran bossing around . So the minute I seen there was n't a cop in the hall , I went down and packed up quick . I took our stuff over to Jim 's brother 's house and stayed there . You ai n't going to get me back here , either . " " No , Mrs Tewman , I think we 'll let you stay away . You left your key ? " " Right on top of the bookcase in the hall . " " You see ? " To me . " The key was there . Of course it 's possible for the Tewmans or the Hallorans to have had a duplicate key made , or to have sent someone else here Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know enough about the house . " To the Tewmans he added , " You may go now . " They went with alacrity . " I called those four witnesses first for a reason , Mrs Dacres . I 'm convinced that they had nothing whatever to do with the attack on you , and therefore , since we think the two are related , with the attack on Mrs Garr . For my part , I intend to eliminate them in my further search for the criminal . But it 's different with the rest of the people I 'm interviewing . It 's mybest opinion that every one of them is strongly to be suspected ! " My mind ranged rapidly over the rest of the people who were connected with Mrs Garr 's house . " What do you mean ? " I asked flatly . " Well , look at this thing . Was it someone outside the house ? No . It was someone who had access , easy access , to the cellar . Who knew the house and the habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the residents here I 'll eat all my notes . " He gave me a side glance . " After I had to eat that money you and Mrs Halloran dug up I 'm not taking chances with any more paper diets , either . Who do we have as possibilities , then ? First , Kistler . Plenty easy for him to have sneaked downstairs again after 3 A.M. , Mrs Dacres ? " He grinned . " Somehow you do n't seem the suicide type , and it 's very difficult to bat yourself on the head first and then chloroformyourself second . "  | " By the way "  --  I was curious  --  " did you ever find what hit me ? " " Sure . Did n't I tell you ? Hammer from the toolbox downstairs . Not a print on that , either . That 's another argument it was someone in the house . Knew where the tools were . " I shuddered . " All right . Where were we ? Kistler . Buffingham . Grant . Miss Sands . The Wailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those six people I 'll eat  --  no , I guess I better quit eating . " " I do n't think it was a woman . I think it was a man . Except that Miss Sands does have that can  --  " " Sure . Except . Except . And if it was the Wallers they must both be in on it . They stick together on their story , anyhow . So that really makes just five possibilities . " " Too bad you ca n't just put all six in jail . " " You do n't know how I wish I could . Innocent till proved guilty , pooey . Let 's have Buffingham down , Van . " Van came back alone . " Gone to work . Gus in the hall here says Johnson 's tailing him . " " Hell , what 's the matter with me ? He would be . Have to wait for him , then . I 'll take Grant . " Poor old Mr Grant came in , blinking as usual . Again I thought that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something had gone out of him . He was patently nervous , looked as if he had n't slept much . The lieutenant explained the reasons for this second questioning . " As I told you yesterday , sir "  --  Mr Grant . sat well forward on his dinette chair , his hands on his knees -- 'I was upset by the inquest . I kept thinking about  --  well , thinking . I dined downtown . I walked home from town . I went up to my room and endeavored to read , but my attention wandered . That was how I spent the entire evening . " " You read all evening ? " " Well , I looked over a few old keepsakes in my trunk for a time . " " How late was it when you went out ? "  | " About eleven , I think , " apologetically . " You in the habit of walking so late at night ? " " I have been this past week . " He smiled faintly . " You should know . I have seen one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay . " " I walked down the steps to Water Street and wandered about down there . I was nervous . A great many things had come up at the inquest which disturbed me . " " Yeh ? What things ? " " The provisions of the will . Irony . A wicked woman , coming to her just deserts . " The lieutenant 's voice was low . " So you think Mrs Garr got no more than was coming to her . " Mr Grant straightened , and his words left no doubt of what he thought . " I could not have wished her a more fitting death , " he said quietly.  |p200WE  ALL STARED at Mr Grant . Meek , quiet little Mr Grant ! The lieutenant snorted , half rose , sat down again . " You did n't bring this up yesterday ! What reason , may I ask , did you have for wishing Mrs Garr any kind of death ? " Mr Grant contemplated him passively . " The inquest brought out the evil of Mrs Garr 's past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought sorrow of the most  --  the most agonizing kind . On hundreds . On mothers of innocent girls , mothers who died crying aloud  --  " He pinched his lips together , paused a moment before he continued . " Surely it is just that such a woman should meet a horrible end . " The lieutenant 's voice was as quiet . " And what does this mean to you , to you personally , Mr Grant ? " Mr Grant 's hands fell listlessly between his knees . " Oh , nothing , nothing . I merely saw in it the workings of an awful Providence . " " You did n't help Providence ? " " No , I "  --  he turned his hands outward  --  " I did n't help . " " Well ! " The lieutenant took a deep breath , settled back in his chair . There was something strange in Mr Grant 's attitude . When he said he had not helped Providence , it was almost as if he were defending himself ; as if he should have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that , then deciding to be jocose but watchful . " You do n't have to feel bad because Providence got along without you . Now go back to your walk . " " I came up the steps to Adams again . I idled down past Elliott House until a man came up from the opposite way . I recognizedMr Buffingham . He was returning from work . We came back to the house together , separated in the hall upstairs . I was awakened by the disturbance yesterday morning . "  |p20I  " Urn . You ever do any sawing , Mr Grant ? " Mr Grant looked blank surprise . " Why , as a boy on my father 's farm , I occasionally assisted with the sawing of the winter wood supply . " " What 's a steel saw look like ? " " Why , I do n't know . I never saw --  " " What do you think it would look like ? " " Why , quite a bit like a wood saw , I should think . Finer , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel could be  --  but yes , yes , I suppose it can . Even diamonds can be cut . " He peered at us over his heavy glasses , obviously at a loss over the last questions . " That ' 11 do . You can go . " " Food for thought in that guy , " the lieutenant said after Mr Grant had left . " If we could prove he had some connection with Mrs Garr in the past  --  but we ca n't . I had two men working on his past for two days last week . Did n't know I went into things that thoroughly , did you ? We ca n't find any record he was in the city until four years ago ; he turned up then in a downtown hotel . His own evidence is he came from Detroit . Retired bookkeeper . Plenty of Grants in old Detroit directories , but , my God ! we ca n't follow them all up ! Moved to this house soon after he came in town , lived here since : Lives off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I could find out if Mrs Garr ever put anything across on him . He is n't the type to murder for a few cents , but he could well enough murder to get even with an old hate . " " He does n't have an old hate against me , though , " I pointed out . " I ca n't imagine Mr Grant coming coming --  " " Do n't forget you 're the only one heard that key fall . And you 'd been upstairs asking some mighty leading questions . " " That would mean he wanted to kill me to protect himself . He looks as if he would n't much care what happened to him . Apathetic . " " You psychology fiends . " Lieutenant Strom sounded apathetic himself . " Let 's see . Kistler . Still at work , I suppose . What time 's it getting to be ? Four ? Well , we 'll have to wait for Sands , then , too . Let 's have the Wallers down . " My heart beat fast as the Wallers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " blackmail " at them ? I wondered why they had n't been down to see me before today ; I was certain that , when I first began coming back to consciousness the day before , Mrs Waller had been working over me . Mr Waller had helped break down the door , too . But if they had been back since to inquire how I was , I had n't heard of it . If they noticed me at all now as they walked in , it was only a quick glance . They stood before Lieutenant Strom ; he had chairs placed for them ; they sat . The expressions on their faces were oddly similar . Poker faces . But behind the masks was apprehension . " Waller , " the lieutenant began in a friendly way , " would you repeat everything you know of what happened Monday night , for Mrs Dacres ' benefit ? " Mr Waller told of returning from the inquest with his wife and Miss Sands , of having dinner downtown , of talking in their apartment , of sleeping until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock on Tuesday morning . He and Mrs Waller had both stayed to help the doctor . For the first time I heard some of the gorier details . I thanked them as nicely as I knew how . When they had both given their stories the lieutenant sat quiet for two ticking seconds before he spoke again . " Now , Waller , I 'm going into something that may be a purely personal matter . " He dropped politeness . " Why in hell did n't you include in your previous evidence that you held a note of Mrs Garr 's ? " Mr Waller stiffened , and I saw Mrs Waller 's fat pink hands clasp in her lap until they were white along the knuckles . She began trembling slightly ; I could see the black lace of her revers shake . Mr Waller 's eyes avoided the lieutenant 's . " It did n't have anything to do with Mrs Garr dying . It was just a private matter . " " It would have been a God damn good reason for a fight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I did n't fight with Mrs Garr . " " That 's your story . I 've heard from others that she asked you to move out of her house . Now let 's have your story on why Mrs Garr owed you money . "  | " I loaned her the money a good many years ago . " " What for ? " " What for ? " He moistened his lips . " I guess she needed some money . " " Hm . Waller , Mrs Dacres says that when Mrs Halloran came back from asking you , why you paid no rent , she said she saw the note . " Mr Waller was silent . " Why have n't you presented that note to the estate for collec-tion ? " " Why , I did n't want to be hasty . I thought I 'd wait . " His eyes were focused on a point just over the lieutenant 's head . " Thought you 'd wait until the police were out of it , eh ? " " Oh no . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem more decent . " " I see , just being considerate . Just being considerate about two thousand bucks . Mrs Halloran , you see , was impressed by the amount . " He leaned forward . " Would you mind telling me when that money was borrowed ? " Mr Waller swallowed , paused . " That  --  that has no connection . No connection at all . " The lieutenant thundered in his strongest voice . " You 've got that note on you , Waller . I ask to see it . " " It 's purely personal . I 'm not going to hand it over . " Mr Waller fought back desperately . " We 'll see about that . Van and Bill , do your stuff . " The lieutenant 's two huge henchmen advanced on Mr Waller , no doubt of their intentions and abilities in their stride . Mr Waller stared at their advance for a frozen second . " No ! Wait ! I  --  it is n't important enough to make a fuss over , Lieutenant Strom . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell back . Mr Waller got to his feet , swayinga little ; he took a wallet from his inside coat pocket , fumbled inside it , took from it a dirty piece of paper , folded once , which he laid before the lieutenant . We waited while Lieutenant Strom , his face impassive , stared at the paper , folded it carefully away in his own wallet . But his eyes when he lifted them were alight , and his voice rang.  | " You 'll get it back . It 's evidence now . Waller , that note is dated July 8 , 1919 ! July 8 , 1919 ! Will you please tell me what dealings you had with Mrs Garr in the year Mrs Garr went to jail ? " The excitement in the words was unconcealed . July 8 , 1919 , the lieutenant said , as if that date were of surpassing importance , as if the key , the start of all this mystery might have been that day , that month , that year ; as if , stumbling in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and the lamp 's light was in that date . Mr Waller backed to his chair , lowered himself into it with a careful , steadying hand on its back . His face was white , hard white . " She came to me . Came to me for money . " " Why to you ? " " I 'd been to the house . I 'd been there  --  selling . She knew I 'd made some money . " " Selling what ? " " Liquor . " " Bootlegging ? " " No . Prohibition was n't  --  was it in yet ? I sold on commission . " " I see . So she just hunted you up . Said she needed money . " " That was it . " " Ever find out why she needed money ? " " Oh yes , it came out . It was in the papers . " " You 're referring to the Liberry case ? " " I  --  yes . " " So you financed her trial . " " Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This two thousand dollars the entire sum you lent her ? " " No , there was more . Three thousand more . She paid that . " " But she did n't pay the two thousand back . She did n't pay the two thousand back , while she was what I 'd call squandering twelve thousand bucks on a trust fund for the Hallorans . That 's more generous than I 'd have said she was . Ever say why she did n't pay off this note ? "  | " She would n't . Said we could take the interest out in living here . " " Mrs Dacres testified to hearing Mrs Garr quarrel with you . She wanted you to leave the house . " " Yes , that 's true . She was getting old . Old and , I think , queer . " He was answering quickly , desperately , as if this were at once uncertain and rehearsed . " She seemed to have an idea the note was n't good any more , because it was so old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That sound reasonable to you , Mrs Dacres ? " " It sounds characteristic , " I said . " Waller , that 's absolutely all there is to this note ? " He moistened his lips again . " That 's all . " For what seemed like five minutes the lieutenant sat completelysilent , to stare at them . If it had been me he stared at so I should have wanted to break and scream ; I wanted to cry aloud to break the silence as it was , yet something held me from it . Mr Waller 's eyes were still on the spot over Lieutenant Strom 's shoulder ; Mrs Waller 's gaze stayed where it had been , on her clenched hands . " You can go . " One of the lieutenant 's abrupt dismissals . Mr Waller put out a blind hand for his wife 's elbow ; the two of them walked as if leaning on each other for support . We heard their heavy steps go up the stairs , sound over our heads in the hallway above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Lieutenant Strom leaped to his feet , to walk up and down with long , hungry strides . " By God , I 'm getting something . Did you see how scared they were ? Why should they be so scared ? There 's something there . I could feel it , even if I did n't know it . July 8 , 1919 ! " " But what could it be  --  what 's July 8 , 1919 ? Why 's that so im-portant ? " The lieutenant whirled for another trip . " Important ! What happened in July 1919 ? Why , nothing at all , nothing at all . Except that in July 1919 a girl named Rose Liberry was found dead in Mrs Garr 's house . Suicide . In Julyp2061919 , Mrs Garr 's business blew up , and it very nearly blew up the police department . By November of 1919 there was n't enough left of a police setup that had been running the town since the turn of the century to patrol a square block . Old Chief Hartigan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do know there was a smell that reached to both coasts . Protection , get me ? The voters put in a reform city government so sweepinglythe whole town was done over . It 's never been the same again . And this is an old lumber city , remember that , that ran wide open up to the last ditch , and that last ditch was July 1919 , when everything was blown to bits . " " I do n't see where it gets you a lot forwarder , though , " I put in practically . " Perfectly reasonable for Mrs Garr to run to a man she 'd been doing business with , in a pinch . That 's funny , though , about his being a liquor salesman , " I went on , rememberingsomething . " It must have been before he got on the police force . Or else after he retired . But you 'd hardly have thought he could have retired even before that . " If I 'd thrown a bomb directly at Lieutenant Strom 's wide nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaction . He 'd just simply have caught a bomb on the fly and tossed it out the window . But now he stopped dead , stared at me so stunned he almost looked weak . Then he walked toward me ; if I had n't known it was impossible I 'd have said he was quivering . " Would you say that again ? " He asked it gently . I said it again . Silence . " Do you recall where you heard that Mr Waller was ever on the police force ? " " Why , certainly . Mrs Garr told me . She said he was retired. , A retired policeman . " " Mrs Garr told you . And do you remember bringing out this interesting little fact in your evidence ? " " Why , no . Why should I ? You did n't ask me if I knew anything about anyone 's past , Miss Sands ' or Mr Kistler 's or Mr Buffingham 's . . . " " Perfectly true . Why should you ? Do you remember its havingbeen brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p207I  cast my thoughts wildly back to the inquest ; with surprising ease I could remember Mr Waller talking , Mrs Waller talking . Nothing about the period when Mr Waller had been a policeman . But why should they say so ? It was perhaps a long time ago . Perhaps for just a short time . Why should that fact have any bearing on Mrs Garr 's death ? " No , I do n't think Mr Waller brought it up either . Why should he ? But he knows it well enough . I mentioned it to him once . I said how odd it was he retired so young . " The lieutenant groaned . " I do n't see how you 've kept alive this long . As far as I can sec , you know everything that everyonedoes n't want known . As a finder-outer , Mrs Dacres , you are tops . As a putter-together , Mrs Dacres , you are bottoms . I do n't suppose "  --  his sarcasm took on an exaggerated pathos  --  " you can now recall any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably come out in time . " I said it brightly and carelessly ; he was n't going to step around on me ; he was n't my employer . " You ought to be glad I 'm here for you to find things out of . " " Oh , I am , " he said . " I 'm profoundly grateful . " He dropped me . He was n't interested in me any more . " Gad ! Waller was on the force ! He has a note signed July 8 , 1919 . Practically an entire police force retired in 1919 . If he was on the force then .. . That entire police force did n't hold notes signed by Harriet Luella Garr ! There 's something in this somewhere ! If there is n't I 'll eat my  --  I ' 11 eat a suit of winter woolen underwear ! " He shot me a defiant glance on that one ; continued to walk in high excitement , turned to me again . " Mrs Dacres ! I could use you on this . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow . You 've got the background , as I find out bit by bit . Do you want a job ? You should be well enough to tackle it by tomorrow . Tonight I 'm going to start going through the police records on the Liberry case again . It ' 11 take me a while . I 'm using a fine comb this time . And you  --  know what you can do ? You go down to the Comet office . Get their old files , beginning about May 1919 . Look through every inch until you get the reports on the Liberry case . Read every word . Copy down the headlines and the first paragraph of everyp208account for me . If there 's anything that the papers have that the court records have n't , I want to know it . The papers played it up big . We 've got pictures , but they 've got pictures we might n't have  --  social pictures . Get me ? " " I 'll get there if I have to crawl , " I said . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What ! Still alive ? " he asked . He looked a little bit worn , but he was grinning as usual . " I 've got to get back down to the paper tonight  --  we distribute tomorrow , you know . But I thought I 'd come around and count the latest corpses . " " You do n't have to worry . I 'm here , Kistler . " The lieutenant . " That 's what does worry me . " " We 've been having more excitement , " I said . " Hush , " said the lieutenant . " Secrets . " What did n't he want me to tell ? About the note ? I turned the subject by thanking Mr Kistler for saving my life , which he said was a small matter ; he did things like that every day . Then the lieutenant put Mr Kistler through his grilling . Mr Kistler told a factual story of our activities Monday eveningand until 3 A.M. , then the now-familiar tale of his rescue on Tuesday morning . " Anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had finished . " Nothing that I could hear , " " That 's a compliment , " from Mr Kistler . " Cut it , you two . I think I heard Miss Sands come in while Kistler was talking ; find out , Van . " " Want me to go ? " " Suit yourself , Kistler . It wo n't make any difference on this next one . " " Thanks . " Miss Sands came down looking rumpled , as if now , thank heaven , work was over for the day and she did n't have to be so everlastingly neat . Perhaps that was why she looked , as she walked in the door , better than I had ever seen her . It almost seemed as if her face were less lined , as if some care had slipped from her . " Sit down there , Miss Sands . I 'm having each person repeatp209his story about Monday night so Mrs Dacres can hear it . But before you begin telling yours I 'd like to have you answer one question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaned forward , thundered : " Why were you being blackmailed by Mrs Garr ? " I have seldom seen a question produce a greater change in a person . First the new peace dropped from Miss Sands , and then she crumpled . She cowered back , her eyes fixed on Strom , helpless , at bay . There was a long silence . She moved her lips to speak once . The lieutenant waited . She moved her lips again ; this time we heard a whisper . " How did you know ? " " So she was blackmailing you ! " Triumph . " No , oh no . " " Oh , she was n't ? Then how come you were paying five dollars a week for your one little room when Mrs Dacres is paying only four for these ? When you could get a better room than you 've got for three dollars a week any time ? " " I  --  I felt sorry for her . " " Sorry for her . Who ? " " Mrs Garr . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , she asked that much . She raised me . " " Miss Sands , how much do you make a week ? Remember , I can check on it . " A hesitation . " We sign a slip we are n't supposed to tell . " " Do n't let that bother you . " Another hesitation . " Well . Thirteen twenty-five . " I winced at the brutal department-store wage . " Thirteen dollars and twenty-five cents . " She nodded helplessly , her eyes fixed on him . " Five dollars from thirteen twenty-five leaves eight twentyfivea week . Eight twenty-five for twenty-one meals a week . For carfare . For doctor and dentist bills . For clothes . Have to dress pretty well in a store , too , do n't you ? Were n't you a bit overgenerous ? "  | Poor thing . She sat with her forlorn poverty naked before our eyes . Cringing . " Miss Sands , perhaps you 'd like a day or two of quiet to refresh your memory ? " " Do n't ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Lieutenant Strom gave us only black looks for our softness . A new fright came into Miss Sands 's eyes . Quiet  --  what did that mean  --  jail ? Her job lost . Her hands flew over her face , and she began sobbing into them , long , dry , accustomed sobs . I 'd had enough of it . Lieutenant Strom or no Lieutenant Strom , I stood up to walk over within touching distance . " Whatever it is , it 's over now , " I said . " She 's dead . Mrs Garr 's dead . And whatever it was , I do n't think you killed her . " Miss Sands let her hands fall as quickly as she 'd lifted them ; the face they 'd hidden was bitter with hate . " She 's dead ! She 's dead ! I 'm glad she 's dead ! " Her words rang defiantly in the room . " She 's dead , but she goes right on living for me . Oh , I might have known it ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I kept on fooling myself . Maybe , I told myself . Maybe . That 's how big a fool I was . She 's got me , living or dead . She 's got me until I kill myself . She 's got me , ever since she first got me into  --  that house . " There was n't any mistaking the meaning of those last two words . Miss Sands did n't mean this house . Not 593 Trent Street . Before her meaning I was aghast , and even the lieutenantlooked startled . I tightened my grip on her shoulder , but she jerked away from me . " Sure ! Now you know . Now one of you can start blackmailing me . Now you can all blackmail me ! Well , see if I care . I 'm not so fond of working in that store . I 'm not so fond of living any more . Seventeen I was when I came to this town . Out of the country . I got a job in a store . And a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited me to a party a friend of his was giving . Mrs Garr 's house , that 's where he took me . It was two years before -I could get out of there . Broke , she kept us . One night a soldier boy going away to war slipped me twenty dollars . I got out . I hid . I did housework . I got a job in a store again . And then one day she came along . I heard you wasp211working here , dearie , ' she said , purring like a cat . I wonder how the nice people running this store would feel if they knew what kind of a girl was working for ' em ? I 've got a new house , ' she said , a nice respectable rooming house . Why do n't you come and see one of my rooms you might like to live in ? ' What could I do ? What could I do ? The store ' d let me go like a shot if they knew . Debutantes from our best families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I went . I came here . She showed me the room upstairs and said I could live there for five dollars a week . What could I do ? I could n't save up money enough to go away and keep me until I could get a new job , on six dollars a week  --  that 's what I used to get before N.R.A .  --  eleven dollars a week . Twelve years . What could I do ? " Abruptly her stormy sobbing began again . Hodge Kistler was swearing , steady and low , his face almost dark blue . The two detectives sat stony , their eyes on the lieutenant . His voice was gentle when he spoke . " Miss Sands . " " Yes . " " Did you kill Mrs Garr ? " " No , I did n't . I often wished I would have , though . Long ago . " " just the same , we 're glad you did n't . " There was silence in the room for a time , except for Miss Sands 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking deeply . " Miss Sands , did you know a girl named Rose Liberry at Mrs Garr 's house ? " " No , that was soon after I got out . I saw about it in the papers . " The lieutenant seemed to shake his thought off , return to briskness . " Now , Miss Sands , what you have just told us is over . You may be certain no one here will let a word of this escape him or her . If anyone ever tries to blackmail you again , and you let me know , I can promise you you wo n't be bothered long . Nor will it become public . " She again dropped her hands from her ravaged face . " I do n't trust nobody , " she said wearily . " Okay , what 's the difference ? I 've stood plenty before . "  |p2I2  " You can go in a moment , Miss Sands . I wonder if you 'd repeat your story of events this last Monday night , before you go . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ate before we came home . We talked awhile in their rooms . Then I went to bed , early . I was still sleeping when I began to hear a ringing somewhere . It was the phone . I answered it , then went up to wake Mr Kistler . I went back to bed , but I did n't get to sleep again before I heard Mr Kistler yelling for Mr Waller . I was along helping work on her for a while . Then I had to leave for the store . " " Do n't think I do n't appreciate your helping me , " I said warmly . " I wo n't forget it if I can ever do anything for you . " " The best you can do about me is not know me . Can I go now ? " " Thank you , Miss Sands . That 's all I wanted . " Mr Kistler was on his feet , pacing back and forth . " If you find out she killed Mrs Garr I hope you get her a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that concerning the attack on Mrs Dacres , too ? " Mr Kistler stopped short . " No , I would n't . Hell , I 'd forgotten . I suppose we 've got to get your murderer , baby , even if we 're sorry for her . " " You 're leaping too far ahead , " I said . " We 've had other things turn up this afternoon more incriminating than this . Miss Sands ' story does n't prove she 's a murderer . It proves she 's weak . A stronger person would have escaped from Mrs Garr long ago . " " Remember about the can of Kleenfine she was using ? Or have you decided to ignore that ? " " No , I 'm not forgetting . But her whole story , if it 's true , is n't the story of a person who would make a planned attack on me or anyone else . She has n't acted on life ; she 's let life act on her . Look at what she said . She was enticed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ways in which a girl forced into such a house could have escaped , run away , reached the police and slapped Mrs Garr 's ears with her dirtyp213business . But she does n't . She just stays there until chance lets her out . And even then she does n't try retribution . " " Your story 's all right for this year , " argued the lieutenant , " but her story is n't this year 's . It 's 1917 or 1918 , maybe . And public opinion toward a girl leading that life is n't very lenient even yet . Then , it was taken for granted she would n't be leading it if her character was all it should be . Mrs Garr 's business was n't so unusual in those days . " " What Lieutenant Strom so carefully avoids . saying , " Mr Kistler put in blandly , " is that Mrs Garr was undoubtedly protected . Miss Sands could have wept at the official doors until the gas lights were drowned , but all she 'd have gotten for her pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a reputation that would n't let her get a job in the whole town . " " Far be it from me to hint the police of this city were ever corrupt . " Lieutenant Strom said it lightly . " Just the same "  --  I stuck to my line  --  " think of this attack on me . That was a planned attack . Someone swept those stairs , provided himself with a saw ; they must be fairly difficult to get , too . Someone timed the job for the first night we were without a guard . Someone provided himself with a hammer and a can of Kleenfine . Oh , it was all thought out beforehand . " " Different from the murder of Mrs Garr , was n't it ? " LieutenantStrom brought out the analogy . " That has all the earmarksof being unpremeditated . " " Yes , but it does n't necessarily alter the psychology of the murderer . That first crime may have just happened . It was a sort of self-defense , maybe , if you can call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Sands might have committedthat kind of crime . But I do n't think she 'd have had the brains  --  I do n't think she 'd have had the character to think up the attack on me . " They all laughed ; men can be so infuriating . I was being perfectlylogical , too . " Well , even worms turn ; remember that . " The platitude was from Lieutenant Strom . " You can rule Miss Sands out if you want to , but she 's still a good strong suspect to me . Remember ,  |p214we  said Mrs Garr 's murder was as likely to have its roots in her past as in any small sums of money she might have hidden around . All right , now we 've found someone linked to that past . And one with a good strong motive , too . Miss Sands was n't trying to hide her hatred . And besides that , she had a present reason , too . How 'd you feel , if you made thirteen twenty-five a week , and were blackmailed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exactly . " I thought it over . " I 'd have watched until I knew where some of the little piles of money were . Then I 'd have grabbed my chance to get my own back , and left for sunnier climes . " " She admits she 's an honest girl . " " I do n't mind being a stooge for a laugh . " " Laugh nothing . Do n't you realize that 's exactly what Miss Sands may have done ? She was caught hunting Mrs Garr 's money , and killed her . "  |p215THERE  WAS STILL one more interview that Wednesday : Buffingham 's . The lieutenant had Van call the Elite Drugstore where Mr Buffingham worked , and order him to return to the house during his supper hour . He came to the house shortly after six ; the lieutenant called him in impatiently . Strom was all keyed up by that time , anxious to get at the Liberry case records , anxious to go over them completely , now there was the possibilitybetween Mr Waller and Miss Sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slouched in , haggard as he always was ; his eyes traveled aloofly from one to the other of us , as unfriendly and as unexpecting of friendliness as if he were of one kind , we of another ; as if there never was and never would be much kinship in his life , never anything except the world 's hand against him . He had a son . I suppose there is n't any tragedy in the world more heartrending , I thought , looking at him , than being the father of a baby that turns out wrong . Of waiting and thinking about the baby that 's coming , afraid and secret and proud ; of having the baby be born and going in to see it with its mother , glad and tender ; of wondering all the years as the baby grew whether he should say yes , he could go to all the movies he wanted to , or no , no more movies , too exciting ; or yes , an allowance , or no , learn to earn ; or yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you would n't play with the Smith boy . Mr Buffingham , worn with the grief of having made the wrong decisions . The lieutenant was looking at him too . As if idly , while he told the reason for this second questioning . Mr Buffingham 's story was simple . Worked until midnight . Walked home . Car in garage for repairs . Met Mr Grant near Elliott House . Walked in with him . Wakened by racket Tuesdaymorning . " A new bit of information has come to hand , " said the lieutenant as Mr Buffingham finished . There was bite under his carelessness . " Enjoy being blackmailed , Buffingham ? " Mr Buffingham 's dark eyes made a quick swing from face to face , but his mouth was imperturbable . " Who , me ? " - " Yes , you . " " What ' re you talking about ? " " You , Buffingham , paying blackmail . " " You 're kidding . " " Oh no , I 'm not . " " What 've I done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very careful . " That 's what I want to know . " I saw it , we all saw it . It could n't be concealed . Relief . Mr Buffingham was relieved when the lieutenant said he 'd like to know what for . He was still worn , still harried , but the new fear that had crept back of his eyes when the lieutenant first said " blackmail " had crept away again . " What could anybody blackmail me for ? " he demanded now , truculently . " I ai n't done nothin ' . Just because my boy got in a little trouble , here , you 're going to try to hang something on me too , huh ? " " How much you getting at the Elite , Buffingham ? " " Eighteen per . It 's a lousy joint . " " Eighteen dollars a week ? " " That 's it . " " You insist on that ? " " Sure , that 's what I 'm getting . Ask the old man if you do n't believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week is a lot for your room upstairs , Buffingham . " Again Mr Buffingham 's eyes made their darting round . " Yeh , " he said . " Oh , you mean what I been paying old lady Garr recently ? " He threw back his head to laugh loudly . " Sop217that 's where you got your blackmail , huh ? She would leave the receipt stubs around , would n't she ? Old lady Garr ! That 's good ! " He stopped laughing as if it were turned off by a spigot . " I owed her some back rent , see . No job for a while . And the old lady staked me to the room , see ? But Jeez , blackmail was n't so far off , at that . I been paying three times over for that room ever since I got a job again . I 'll bet she had me set to pay three times till the walls fell in . Me , I was thinking about moving to get out from under . " If he was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if there were no judgment at stake , no trial , no life . The lieutenant tried the methods he had used on Miss Sands . " Nine from eighteen leaves nine dollars a week . And you drive a car . " Mr Buffingham waved a weary , careless hand . " Oh , I 've got a couple little sidelines on . You know , Lieutenant . It ai n't so hard in a drugstore . You can sec why I got to . You would n't crack down on me for that , would you ? " He was doing better than Miss Sands . The lieutenant tried another tack . " So your boy 's going to try a break , eh ? " " Huh ? " " You heard me . " " I do n't know what you 're trying to put over on me , but  --  " " Oh yes , you do . That 's how you happened to have that saw . " " Saw ? " " Acting dumb , eh ? " " I ai n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increasingly sardonicas he became more sure of his ability to parry the thrusts of his questioner . " Wisecracker , huh ? Where ' d you get that saw ? " " I ai n't had any saw . " " Must have quite a little tool kit . What ' d you use on the screws ? " " I ai n't got no screws to turn . " " Oh , so you 're thinking about turning screws . So you were turning screws on that cellar door ! "  | " Cellar door ? There ai n't any cellar door . " It was , undoubtedly , the answer anyone in the house would have made  --  anyone who was not thinking of the door in my kitchen . Because there was no door at the top of the main cellar stairs . How crafty was Mr Buffingham ? If he were guilty , did he have brains enough to make that subtly innocent answer ? I could see the possibilities being weighed in the lieutenant 's mind . Then he veered again . " You ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You heard me this time too . " " Rose , you said ? Liberry ? Ca n't say I have . Who 's she ? " " No one . Now . " The lieutenant let him go . He was thoughtful as Mr Buffingham hurried out . " Why do n't you turn on your psychology now , Mrs Dacres ? " " On Mr Buffingham , you mean ? " " On Mr Buffingham . God ! What a name ! " " Well . . . " " Does n't it come on ? " " Yes , " I said . " Yes , I think he might have done it , psychologically . But why should he ? We ca n't know for sure about Mrs Garr , but why should he attack me ? I have n't anything on him . " " Sure of that ? " " Of course I am . I know him less than anyone else in the house . " Mr Kistler stood up to stretch . " Yes , he 's sort of past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . " I can see where Kistler here would have greater charms , " he said . They both stood grinning at me like a couple of apes . " I thought you were intent only on finding out who started me on that long dark journey from which there is no returning , hardly , " I said witheringly . " Reproof received and contents noted , " the lieutenant returned . He stretched too . " Well , Buffingham takes a neat placep219in the list of suspects , too . He 's crooked : Admits it . Crooked in little , crooked in big . I certainly am bright today . Boy in trouble . Needs dough . Tells a good tale to explain the nine bucks a week , but is it good enough ? No connection with Mrs Garr in the past as far as we know . But he moved in here right after Mrs Garr took the house  --  did you get that ? His testimony at the inquest said he 'd lived here twelve years . Looks like Mrs Garr might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sands . He pays heavier too  --  get that . If she was blackmailing him she had him good . " " It might have been for some of his sideline rackets , the ones he admitted , " Mr Kistler said . " Yeh , it might . But I 'm not letting that guy out of my mind . Not by a long shot . Come on , you two , I 'm hungry . Do n't forget your little job tomorrow , Mrs Dacres . " He waved his cohorts to him , left . Mr Kistler and I were alone . I was dazed with listening , inexpressiblytired . " I 'm hungry too , " I said . " Oh , the poor baby . She 's tired . She 's hungry . Papa fix the orange juice ? All I need is a bottle and a nipple . " Mr Kistler went kitchenward to fix my supper . I pined for tomorrow . The doctor said I could have toast , eggs , milk , mashed potatoes and fruit tomorrow . I intended to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operation , and I have n't even had the operation to talk about , " I moaned over the orange juice . " What we 've got to do is prevent you from being operated on twice . " Mr Kistler viewed the future . " What the hell are we goingto do with you tonight ? " " Do n't tell me you 're going to repeat the perennial ? " " To a poor little sick girl ? Think I rob hospitals ? " " I 'm not sick . " " In that case  --  " " No , thanks . I 'll sleep with the policeman . " " You mean you prefer a policeman to me ? " " Absolutely . I 'll sleep here , the policeman in the chair . " " You 'd trust the policeman to sleep in the chair ? " " They should be domesticated by this time . "  | " Trust me to sleep in the chair ? " " Certainly not . " " I 'd think you were a witnit if you did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going out to dine . On steak , mediumrare , smothered in onions . New peas . Lettuce with Roquefortdressing . Hot biscuits  --  " I moaned into my pillow , and he went out laughing like a Boucicault villain at the end of the second act . The night passed without a hitch . I slept , the policeman slept , and all was serene in the morning , except that I was so weak I could hardly get my clothes on . I tiptoed past the policeman ; he woke with a jump , which I was glad to see , because what is the use of having a guard if he sleeps through having someone tiptoe past him ? He wiped his hand across his face and went out into the hall , so I had a free hand for dressing . My clock said six-fifteen , which was the earliest I 'd been up for years . I managed to get the coffee on , made toast , cooked three eggs . After I 'd eaten that I started over on three more eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spine , your character and your intelligence . I wondered for a bit if I had overdone things , but my interior settled down after another bit . I started putting things back into drawers ; I knew I could n't make much headway , but I jumbled Mrs Garr 's things back into her closet ; I had hung my clothes before going to bed the night before . I was out of the house about seven ; I did n't want an argumentwith Hodge Kistler about Friday will do as well as Thursdayfor going to the Comet office . It was one of those **32;5134;TOOLONG days , but I had to take a streetcar ; my legs had n't solidified enough for a long walk . I picked up a newspaper on the corner before I got on the car . There was n't a word in it about me , and I wondered - if there had been in yesterday 's paper . The Comet Building is down on the river front , a decrepit hag of a building that holds up mainly , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven knows what it 's made from , under the crust . The crust on the outside is reddish ; thep221crust on the inside is black and looks , if anything , thicker . I 'm fairly familiar with the Comet offices ; in pinches , I 'd acted as office boy and taken layouts and copy there from Tellier 's . To get to the offices you go in a side door opening on a flight of steps for all the world like those flights of steps you see down by the gateway , with boards hanging out saying , " Lodgingsfor Transients , Io  --  , 15  --  , 250 . " The board over the Comet doorway says : GILLING CITY COMETTHE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER OF ITS SIZE IN THE WORLDNo one much was around at that hour , but I hunted out a lanky , sleepy youngster sweeping papers back and forth in a big room full of tumble-down desks and typewriters . After long thought he said sure , he did n't know why not , and led me past hundreds of cubbyholes to a dark inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankly around at the overflowingfiles , and left . I thought it was hopeless trying to figure out where the 1919 files would be . I poked through some huge tomes , full newspapersize , on the open-front shelves that covered the entire back wall of the library , but the rubbed white letters on the back of one volume would say Aug. 17 to Nov. 3 , 1924 , the one under it Feb. 22 to Apr. 9 , 1907 , the one above it Jan. 27 to Mar. 25 , 1913 . A wizened little man came in around eight . He poked around as helplessly as I did , seemingly , but I caught him slipping a pictureinto a file . " How do you do ? I 've been waiting for the librarian , " I explained to him . " I 'm the librarian , " he admitted sadly , as if he hated to be found out . " Lieutenant Strom of the police force suggested I come to you . He 'd like to have me go over the papers for May , June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see them ? " " That 's a lot of papers , miss . " " I wo n't mind . " " It 's probable someone has ' em out . "  | " Someone in the building ? " " Well , I do n't know . They might be out or they might be here . " " Would you tell me where they 'd be if they were here ? " " They 'd be there if they are n't anywhere else . " He waved a gloomy hand at the stacks . I gathered it was useless waiting for help from him ; I tackled the stacks in earnest myself . My hands were soon as black as a coal deliverer 's ; when I shook my skirt after kneeling to look at the bottom shelf the dust flew out in puffs . The librarian stood behind me peering helplessly at the shelves through thick glasses ; it 's my idea he could n't even see the white markings . Halfway through I found my volume : May 2 to Jul. 28 , 1919 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retired with my find to a corner desk , where I leveled off the piles of newspapers it held enough to let the book lie flat . I was elatedly expectant ; hunting those stacks and finding what you wanted there was something like coming on a long-sought treasure island in an uncharted sea . Beginning with May 2 , 1919 , I went through the papers item by item . If minutes and hours ticked by , I did n't know it . But it was n't before I reached the Comet for May 24 , 1919 , that I came on my first news of Rose Liberry . That was a small item on page three . An item so insignificantly placed near the bottom of a column that I almost skipped over it . AUNT REPORTS GIRL MISSING OVERNIGHTMiss Rachel Staines , 1128 Cleveland Avenue , called police at eleven o'clock yesterday evening to report the unexplained absence of her niece , Miss Rose Liberry , of Cincinnati , who has been visiting Miss Staines for the past week . According to Miss Staines , the missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday afternoon for a little shopping . When the girl did not return for dinner Miss Staines was not alarmed , as Miss Liberry had said she might call an acquaintance of hers and visit a moving picture theater . When Miss Liberry had not returned by ten o'clock , however , Miss Staines became anxious . She waited for some time longer before calling the residence of Missp223Liberry 's friend , where it was reported that Miss Liberry had not called and that the friend had been at home the entire evening . Miss Staines then called the police . No trace has yet been found of the missing girl . It was easy not to miss the account of the mystery on the following day . It was on page one , in the middle of the page . GIRL STILL MISSINGNo TRACE OF YOUNG VISITOR YET UNEARTHED BY POLICEThe whereabouts of Miss Rose Liberry , who left the home of her aunt , Miss Rachel Staines , at II28 Cleveland Avenue on the afternoon of May 23 , are still a mystery to police and Miss Staines . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , has notified the girl 's parents of the continued absence . The parents , Mr and Mrs J. G. Liberry , of Cincinnati , have telegraphed that they will be in the city this evening to continue the search . No news whatever has come from the missing girl . Miss Liberry is reported by her aunt to have left the house at3 P.M. . . . I skimmed over the rest of it , but it was all repetition of the previous day 's item . I took out my notebook , copied down the two items I 'd found so far . Lieutenant Strom knew what he was doing when he 'd said it would do if I copied down the headlines and first paragraphs . On the Comet for May twenty-sixth the story I sought was plastered all over the front page . It held first place , with a page headline , the right-hand column  --  and a picture . I looked at that picture a long time . I looked at the picture and thought with anger that the girl was dead . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls the heartstringsmost : a child , and so grave . She was sixteen perhaps ; she wore a dark taffeta dress with georgette sleeves ; a fashion I could just recall , the fashion of 1919 . Her hair was dark , brushed simply back from her face ; the widely spaced dark eyes looked levelly from the picture into yours , inquiring , hold- ing back a smile of friendliness . It was the mouth I liked best , the lips held so seriously , so wonderingly , so consideringly . Sixteen , wondering what life had for her . That was when the Liberry case stopped being something dead , something past . It was n't dead , could n't be dead ; this was n't a girl who could die foully and no ripples remain , no anger be held , no deep hatred stirred . This girl , dying , would leave grief ; the hinted way of her dying would leave bitter hate . Excitement quickened me ; my eyes leaped to the day 's report . PARENTS BELIEVE GIRL KIDNAPEDFATHER ARRIVES TO HUNT MISSING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clues FoundThe theory that his daughter had been kidnaped was offered to reporters today by John G. Liberry , of Cincinnati , who arrived in Gilling City today to direct the hunt for his missing daughter , Miss Rose Liberry . Miss Liberry , who is sixteen , disappeared on the afternoon of May 23 from the home of her aunt , Miss Rachel Staines , I128 Cleveland Avenue . Mr Liberry , who is a prominent Cincinnati accountant , is hourly expecting that the kidnapers will approach him for ransom payments , he said today . Police Chief Hartigan counters this theory with a belief that the girl left of her own accord ; has perhaps married and left the city . Anxiety over the girl 's absence was first aroused when .. . There was a long recapitulation of the previous facts ; the account ended with a description of the missing girl , and asked anyone seeing her to call police . On May twenty-seventh the Liberry case took up even more of page one . A two-deck headline flared across the page : GIRL IN HANDS OF WHITE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pictures of Rose Liberry at fifteen , at eleven at three ; Rose Liberry , dark-eyed and serious at three as she was at sixteen . Pictures ofp225the girl 's father and mother , snapped leaving Chief Hartigan 's office , the mother short , plump , shielding her face with her handbag ; the father short , slight , staring straight at the camera with ravaged eyes . A picture of Chief Hartigan was captioned , " Girl Will Turn Up , Says Police Chief Hartigan . " Chief Hartigan , well fed , thinking more of his dinner ; it was n't his daughter . A picture , a camera study , of Miss Rachel Staines , forty , blonde and fairly worldly . Captioned , " Aunt Fears White Slavers . " Father , mother , aunt . I looked at the pictured faces carefully . I thought over the people concerned in Mrs Garr 's death . I could n't see any trace of resemblance anywhere . But 1919 was eighteen years ago . Father , mother , aunt  --  was one of them living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story had two columns on the right . ROSE LIBERRY NOW MISSING FOUR DAYSMOTHER IN STATE OF COLLAPSE ; FATHER PUSHES HUNT FOR DAUGHTER ; ATTACKS POLICEMiss Rachel Staines , 1128 Cleveland Avenue , aunt of the missing Rose Liberry , created a sensation in Police Chief Hartigan 's office today when , in ringing tones , she stated her belief that her niece was being held in some house of vice for immoral purposes . Chief Hartigan , holding to his theory that the girl left her aunt 's residence for purposes of her own , pointed out the greater likelihood of his elopement theory . " Gilling City is a clean city , " Chief Hartigan declared to reporters during the interview . " Statistics show that a certain number of girls are always reported missing each year . Great numbers of those girls are quietly found . Usually it is discovered that some man is involved . Miss Liberry is sixteen , a romantic age , and I think it will be found the usual thing has happened . " On hearing this statement , John G. Liberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is like Chief Hartigan to cast reflections on my daughter 's character , " he said . " I have found the police of this city not only incompetent but curiously unwilling to make any but the most routine search . The police force of this city is rotten from the heart out , and you 're the heart , Chief Hartigan . " CHIEF REPLIES TO ATTACKChief Hartigan greeted Mr Liberry 's attack with a tolerant laugh . " Just like a father , " he said . " Parents always know their own childrenless than anyone else . I can stand having my administration maligned ; every citizen of this city knows how well policed Gilling City has been under my rule . I respect order , but I also respect liberty . In Gilling City we have both . You may quote me . " " Uh-huh . Exactly as I thought ! " A voice , a living voice , said loudly in my ear . I jumped and turned . Hodge Kistler . " What 're you doing here ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expected Chief Hartigan to appear beside me than Hodge Kistler . " Me ? I 'm the good Samaritan ; you just do n't recognize me in this snappy American getup . Have you , might I ask , had enough regard for your own well-being to get yourself a little lunch ? " " Lunch ? My goodness , it is n't  --  " " Just as I thought again . It is one-thirty . Perhaps a bit after . It is also Thursday noon , and another Guide is now interred , requiescat in pace , de mortuis nil nisi bonum or something . You come with me . " " But she 's lost . Rose Liberry 's missing , and I have n't found out yet what  --  " " She 'll keep . Come on along . " I went , resisting , my mind still hitched to the past . " You 're too dirty to eat with me or anyone else . Here , go in here and wash up . I 'll wait . " I was turned neatly into a washroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to become perceptive again , under the influence of water and soap . " You certainly know your way around ! " I commented , rejoiningMr Kistler in the corridor outside . " Did n't I serve my term of purgatory in this joint ? Let 's go to the Dutch Moon . "  |p227Tucked  into a corner booth  --  Hodge always picks out corners  --  Ifound I was trembling with weakness and excitement . Hot soup helped the first ; I allayed the second by pouring out the morning 's discoveries . Mr Kistler listened soberly . " One thing you can certainly say for this case , " he said . " The more you look into it , the worse it smells . Well , I have a little incident to relate , myself . " " Do n't tell me anything more has happened ! " " Nothing much , but I noticed it . Me , you understand , not the detective in the hall . Though of course , what with his being so occupied with you --  " " Do n't meander . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just a bit more of the same . It seems that , after you , I was the third one up this morning , I having to foregather with the carriers for a few last parting instructions . Mr B. was in our joint possession , so I toddled down the hall to the bathroom . During my occupancy it strikes me I am slightly dizzy . Looking into the matter , I find I am not dizzy , but the floor is . You know how the floor is  --  black-and-white tile pattern , half the tiles loose . Probably was saving money when she had it done . I investigate , on my knees , and it is immediately apparent that someone has taken out the loose tiles and then not got them back in the right pattern . What do you think of that for sleuthing ? " " You 're wonderful . " " Thank you . The gentleman in the hall below was not so honest , but he whistled and phoned Strom . " " I wonder if he 's found it now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he 'd been out but could n't make anything of it . " " What 're you talking about ? " " Why , Strom . He went out to look at the bathroom  --  " " Silly , I was n't thinking about him . I mean the prowler . Did he find what he was after under the tiles , do you think ? " " Not if I 'm a good guesser . Nothing under ' em but the old worn-out board flooring and crumbly cement . " " Then he does n't have it yet . He 'll still be hunting . Wouldn'tp228you think , when there 's a detective in the house all the time , that he 'd sometime get caught at it ? " " God help us every one , " Hodge prayed cheerfully . " I think I 'll petition for a cop in every room . " " I know what I 'm going to do . Go back to those newspaper accounts . And if there 's anything in ' em to find , I 'll find it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . I work faster and better alone . " He took me back to the Comet Building.  |p229IN  THE Comet library I found , as I should have known , that my book had disappeared . I had to hunt for it all over again . I found it , finally , on a chair under a pile of papers . The librarian was so startled by my finding it again that he stood blinking at me in admiration for as long as I noticed him . I went back to where I 'd left off : May twenty-eighth . So far the news accounts had been burgeoning ; now they shrank . The May twenty-eighth Comet relegated the story to column one on the left , though it was still a big story . MOTHER FEARSMISSING GIRL DEADROSE LIBERRY Now MISSING FIVE DAYS ; HUNT CONTINUESThe account below was one of continued , hopeless searching , the parents anguished , the police indifferent , but taking all the publicity they could get . The story stayed that way . For two entire weeks the Liberry missing girl mystery held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of page one ; going back to column one again at a reportthe girl had been found in a carnival . Then it slipped to page two , to page five . It was going the way of all mysteries , the accounts becoming more and more meager , the refrain unchanging : Rose Liberry still missing . The Comet for June twenty-first was the first one to hold no news of the story . During that whole ensuing week the paper was bare of the references I sought . I stood up to ease the cricks in my back . Ruefully I looked at my hands ; they were blacker than ever . The librarian behind me wandered aimlessly to and fro ; occasionally a lanky boy came in with a pile of pictures or clippings . But I was too hungry for what I sought to pay attention to thep230workings of the library . Quickly I thumbed through the papers for the remaining days of June 1919 . My excitement grew as I took up the paper for July 1 , 1919 . July . That was the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had aroused Lieutenant Strom . Swiftly but carefullyI went over the pages . Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . One complete paper after another . Daily editions . Sunday editions with the same comics as today . Then at the bottom of a column on a first page my eye caught a tiny item . GIRL KILLS SELFMiss Ethel Smith , residing at 417 St Simon Street , was found dead in her room this morning by a fellow lodger . It was reported to police that Miss Smith had committed suicide by hanging . Was that nothing , too ? I looked to the date at the top of the page . July 8 , 1919 . The day for which Mr Waller 's note was dated ! Hands trembling , I lifted over that entire paper to expose the Comet for July ninth . I 'd been expecting it ; I 'd known it . But even then it came at me with some of the sick shock the residents of Gilling City , of the state , of the country must have felt eighteen years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face looked out at me from the page ; the picture was thrice the size it had been in the Comet of May twenty-sixth . The headline flared , black and heavy : FATHER IDENTIFIES SUICIDE AS MISSING ROSE LIBERRYGIRL DEAD UNDERMYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCESPolice Push InvestigationMr John G. Liberry , of Cincinnati , has found his daughter Rose , for whom he has been searching ever since she disappeared onMay 23 . He found her this morning in the city morgue . She was dead . A suicide . Ever since that fateful day when she disappeared , seven weeksp231ago , Mr Liberry has sought relentlessly . Every day he has visited the hospitals , the jails , the hotels , the morgue . Detectives in his pay have fine-combed the city . This morning word came to him that the body of a dark-haired young girl had been brought into the morgue . In pursuance of his search , now a hopeless routine , he went to see her face . It was his Rose at last . His long-lost Rose . Dead . A suicide . FATHER BREAKS DOWNFor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters in the morgue office , sobbing incoherently , crying for his Rose . Word was immediately taken to Miss Rachel Staines , aunt of the unfortunate girl . She appeared stunned . It was from her home , I128 Cleveland Avenue , that the girl disappeared . It was not possible to inform the mother , who has been confined to a hospital for the past three weeks , as a result of the prolonged anxiety over her missing daughter . Hospital attendants say the mother 's condition is serious . HARTIGAN TENDERS SYMPATHYOn being informed of the identification , Chief of Police Hartigan expressed to reporters his great surprise at the turn events have taken . " My sympathy goes out to the grief-stricken father and mother of Rose Liberry , " he said . " I realize what a heavy additional grief the manner and circumstances of her death must be to them . " INVESTIGATION PROMISEDChief Hartigan then outlined plans for investigating the suicide . " Every effort will be made , " he said , " and you may quote my exact words , to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , or whether any person or circumstances induced her to do so . An investigation will be made of the lodgings at 417 St Simon Street , in which Miss Liberry 's body was found . I understand Miss Liberry has been living there as Miss Ethel Smith , though her reason for taking the alias is not known . I understand the proprietress of this lodging house is a Mrs Garr . You may rest assured charges will be brought against anyone whom we find culpable in the matter . " REPORTER VISITS SUICIDE SCENEWith only thirty minutes to go before press time , a Comet reporterwas hurried to 417 St Simon Street . There he was met by Mrs Harriet Garr , proprietress , who stated that the house was a respectable lodging house , which she had maintained for the past twenty years . She says that the girl came to the house three weeks ago , carrying a small suitcase , and applied for a room , which she rented to her . She said the girl was quiet , kept to her room , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's resemblance to pictures of Rose Liberry recently appearing in the Comet , Mrs Garr stated that she had not noticed the girl particularly ; she had so many people coming and going . She was completely at sea , she indicated , as to why the girl had taken her life . At the end of the column were three blackface lines : WATCH TOMORROW 'S COMET FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS THRILLING REAL-LIFE TRAGEDY ! In the Comet for July tenth the Rose Liberry case took up every inch of the front page . The three-line headline screamed ' across the top of the page , in the biggest type any newspaper owns : LIBERRY ACCUSES POLICEOF PROTECTING WHITESLAVERING IN CITY ! SUICIDE SCENE OFROSE LIBERRY FOUNDTO BE VICE PALACEGovernor Takes Hand ; OrdersInvestigation of City Policeand Vice Conditions HereMr John G. Liberry , father of the Rose Liberry whose disappearancecaused a sensation here seven weeks ago , and whose dead body was found at 417 St Simon Street on July 8 in circumstances suggestingsuicide , today went before Governor David Lamson to bring explicit charges of protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest scandals in the history of Gilling City and of the state , and are based on the work of a Comet reporter , who today gained entrance to the house at 417 St Simon Street , where the girl 's body was found . Disguised as a city water-meter repair man , the Comet reporter was admitted at the rear entrance of 417 St Simon Street by a frightened Negro cook and housemaid . From them he wrung thep233admission that the house , under the proprietorship of a Mrs Harriet Garr , was being run , wide open , as a palace of vice . POLICE CHIEF ACCUSED OF FREQUENTING VICE PALACELeaving the servants in the kitchen under promises of silence as to his entry , the Comet reporter proceeded to the second floor , where he succeeded in entering one of the rooms . In this room were two young girls , also badly frightened , who readily admitted the character of the place . The house was crowded with men nightly , the girls declared . Liquor flowed freely . One of the girls stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added particularsof her own intimacy with Chief Hartigan , who visited the house often , she said , and whom she had seen receive money from Mrs Garr . GAMING TABLES SEENDazed and unbelieving , the Comet reporter paid the girls to conduct him to the third floor of the establishment , where he saw with his own eyes a luxurious gambling salon , with tables for roulette , dicing , Canfield , chemin de fer . The entire third story was in one room , richly furnished with deep leather chairs and davenports , oriental rugs , fine tables and lamps ; at one end was a completebar , handsomely appointed . LIBERRY TOLD OFCHARACTER OF HOUSEAt the time of the reporter 's visit Mrs Garr was absent from the house . It was later learned that she was being interviewed at police headquarters , but was released without charge , the police not knowingat the time the discoveries made by the Comet reporter . Having assembled his evidence , the reporter hastened to 1128 Cleveland Avenue , residence of Miss Rachel Staines , aunt of the unfortunate Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , and informed him of the discoveries . Greatly excited , Mr Liberry immediatelytelephoned for an audience with the governor , whose aid he had several times attempted to attain during his search for the missing girl . The governor granted the interview at once . GOVERNOR PROMISES AIDGovernor Lamson was deeply moved by the evidence presented to him . " If this evidence is true , and you may quote me , " he said , " I promise Gilling City a political shake-up such as no city has seen before . It is a blot on the fair escutcheon of this state , that a lovely young visitor from a sister state should be here inducted , whether willingly or unwillingly , into a house of vice . It is a crime that such conditions should exist . " HARTIGAN TO Go BEFORE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEEThe governor immediately set in motion machinery for investigating the conduct of the police department under Chief Hartigan . First witness before the committee , the governor indicated , would be Police Chief Hartigan himself . Mrs Garr , proprietress of the house at 417 St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny , he indicated . My eyes flew over the other headlines on the page . They were blazingly sensational . One : I FOUND HER DEADSHE SPEAKS  --  THE GIRL WHOFOUND ROSE LIBERRY ! This is the story of the girl , the woman , who found Rose Liberry dead . She prefers to be unnamed except for her first name , Leah . " It was eight o'clock in the morning . " Leah 's tear-wet brown eyes closed with pain as she haltingly told her story to a Comet reporter . " I woke up . There was a girl in the next room to mine . A funny kid . She did n't seem very chummy . But I just thought I 'd slip in for a minute and talk while I waited for the bathroom . So I knocked at her door but she did n't answer . I opened her door . None of our doors have keys . Mrs Garr does n't care at all if we visit . Only the outside doors are locked because she does n't like we should slip out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame her , because where would she be if she had a lot of business and all the girls gone to a movie ? So , as I said , I opened the door and walked in . WALKS IN ON DEATH SCENE " I walked in , and there was that poor kid hanging to a hook on the inside of the closet door . With a torn-up bed sheet . I run out of there and downstairs because the first thing I thought was we ought to have a cop , and I screamed at Fancy  --  that 's the housemaid  --  that there was a girl killed herself and we had to have a cop . Thep235cops were always awful nice whenever we had anything go wrong at our place . So she unlocked the doors . She has keys too . She 's colored . I pushed right past her and out into the street in my sleeping clothes if you can imagine how excited I was , and there I ran into a cop , a young fella . " He came right back with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I guess the racket of us running upstairs must of woke Mrs Garr because she came out into the hall yelling , What 's going on here ? ' And she went into the room and slammed the door . That 's all I know .

A two-line streamer at the bottom of the page ran : LIFE STORY OF ROSE LIBERRY FROM BABYHOOD TO HER APPALLING END IN A DEN OF VICE ; STORY ON PAGE 2My fingers ached . I 'd thought of Lieutenant Strom 's request for headlines and first paragraphs as modest , but I 'd found out differently . My pothooks began to look as if I 'd never decipher them . But I got everything on the page . I ran through the rest of the paper , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for on page one . Then I turned back to page one to check for anything I 'd missed . The pictures . I studied them . Mr Liberry and the governor , snapped together , the governor smiling genially , the father 's face deeply furrowed with tragedy . Another picture of Rose Liberry . A studio photograph of the mother , serene and happy ; grim irony now . A snapshot of the aunt behind a flowering rosebush , another grim reminder of unharroweddays . A smiling picture of Chief Hartigan , " Chief Called to Questioning . " A picture of a young policeman , PatrolmanWalters , " Called by Screaming Girl to Discover Scene of Tragedy in Vice Palace . " My eyes slid over that last picture , and then , as if recalled by intuition , returned . Intent , now , I bent over the pictured face . Young . But add eighteen years to it . Add creases in the forehead , blur the clean chin line with fat . Noses do n't change much . Add a lost look to the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  |p237I  WAS QUIVERING with excitement . Mr Waller ! Mr Waller ! How sure could I be ? No , I could n't be sure . If only Mr Kistler were here ! If only Lieutenant Strom were here ! I whirled on the librarian . " Where can I find a phone ? Do n't let anyone touch that book . It 's important . It 's important in a case of murder ! Do n't let anyonecome near it ! Where 's the nearest phone ? " The librarian , who had backed into the nearest corner , pointed down the other side of the room , to a laden desk . I dashed at it . " Police headquarters , please , " to the girl at the switchboard . " Lieutenant Strom , please . . . . Yes , it 's important . The Garr case . . . . Mrs Dacres . . . . Oh , Lieutenant Strom , I think I 've found something ! " - " What ? " " I 'm not sure . I 'm not even sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if it is so , it may be frightfully important . Can you come over ? " " Where ? " " The Comet library . " " Five minutes . " He hung up . The librarian stayed in his corner ; he was still there when Lieutenant Strom stalked in , the omnipresent Van in tow . " Hello , Mrs Dacres , let 's see what you 've got . " My shaking finger pointed out the picture . I did n't say anything ; if he did n't get it by himself I was just all wet . Lieutenant Strom bent over the picture . Then he straightened to stare at me.  | " Waller , by God ! " I felt almost faint . While I was driving to the station with Lieutenant Strom there was n't a doubt in my mind that the case was settled . Together we 'd run quickly through the multitudinous publicitythe Liberry case had had in the Comet through the rest of July , through August and September of 1919 . The investigation of the police department . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mrs Garr 's Palace of Vice , at least forty per cent of which was certainly fiction . The writhings of the ministry . The shrieks to heaven of the women 's clubs . The beginnings of Mrs Garr 's trial . The sobs of the sob sisters . The continuous attempts of Rose Liberry 's father to bring out evidencethat his daughter had been forcibly held in Mrs Garr 's house , that she was forced to suicide as her only escape . The success of Mrs Garr 's attorneys in upholding Mrs Garr 's contentionthat Rose Liberry had come to the house with a young man for a party , and that she had stayed because she enjoyed the excitement and did not want to go back to her parents . Not even a suicide note had been found . Again and again the Liberry attorneys had grilled the girl named Leah , Patrolman Walters and Mrs Garr . No suicide note . Then the Comet headlines carried the news that Mrs Garr had been sentenced to five years at Waterford . An article in a Sunday Comet sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIFE AT WATERFORDThe Liberry case , as far as the Comet was concerned , had been drained to its last drop . It had been drained to its last drop for Lieutenant Strom , too . We left the library to the librarian . Van was dispatched to bring the Wallers in for questioning . The lieutenant let me wander restlessly around his office while he waited for them to come . " Can you prove it  --  can you prove from this that they murderedMrs Garr ? " I asked , with variations.  |p239The  lieutenant merely grunted . He was sitting quietly at his desk , gazing thoughtfully down at the pencil in his hands . He stayed that way until Van brought the Wallers in . They had been frightened yesterday ; they were twice as frightened now . They looked as if they had long seen catastrophecoming , and now it had come . " Sit down , " the lieutenant ordered . He looked at the two , then , with level eyes ; let silence frighten them still further . " Waller , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpingme today by looking over the Comet files of the Liberry case . On July to , 1919 , the Comet ran the picture of a young patrolman . On the morning of July eighth that patrolman had been called into a house at 417 St Simon Street by a woman who came out in her nightclothes screaming that a girl had hung herself in a bedroom upstairs . The name of that patrolman was Walters . " Silence . " Mrs Dacres has a quick eye . But she did n't trust it . She called me . I looked too . " Silence . " Waller , why did n't you tell me you were once on the force ? " Mr Waller was n't looking at him . He was looking at me . Withtired eyes . Mrs Waller was looking at me too . With hating eyes . " I knew she 'd bring it up sooner or later . " He talked as if hespoke in a vacuum . " Ever since she told me Mrs Garr told her . " " Yes , you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You knew , all right ! And you tried to kill her to quiet her ! " Mr Waller , still leaden , shook his head . " No . " " Your wife got you the Kleenfine ! " " No . " " She used it ! " " For cleaning . Only for cleaning . " " You went home from the inquest . You waited until the house was quiet . You went into the basement . You swept the back cellar stairs . You took out the screws and sawed the bolt of the door going into Mrs Dacres ' kitchen . You lurked there in the dark stairway , waiting until Mrs Dacres came home , waited while she undressed and went to bed and slept , waited like the coward you are until it was safe for you to do your beastly work . Until you could come out in the dark  --  in the dark  --  and kill her ! " The Wallers were trembling . I was shaking myself . The lieutenant 's voice dropped then , and he spoke in cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in that closet ? " " I was n't , I swear to God I was n't . " " Then what were you doing there ? " " Nothing . I was n't there . " Silence . The lieutenant whispered . " Waller , I 'm going to have your rooms searched . " Silence . " No objection ? " Silence . " So it is n't there , eh ? Well , Waller , maybe there 's more than one road to town . Waller , I have a note in my safe . That note is dated July 8 , 1919 . On July eight Patrolman Walters  --  that was you , Waller  --  went into a house at 417 St Simon Street . You found something there . Something Mrs Garr paid you two thousand dollars for ! " Walters , there is only one thing you could have found in that room , only one thing you could have done in that room , that Mrs Garr would have paid you that much money for . No amount of money could have saved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one thing could have made hex trouble a lot worse . " Walters , all during the Liberry trial the Liberry attorneys tried to get evidence of a suicide note . They tried to get it from Mrs Garr . They tried to ' get it from the girl who found the body . They tried to get it from you , Walters , from the policemanwho was really the first person to examine the room . " But they did n't get it . You were lying , Walters . You were lying your soul to hell , and they could n't prove it . " But I know something those attorneys did n't know . Some/thing that girl 's father would have paid  --  God , I wonder how much  --  to know . " I know about that note you hold , dated July 8 , 1919 . " Nothing in the room , except the vibration of two people trembling in the silence . " Walters , what became of that suicide note ? " A simple question , simply asked . Dully Mr Waller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this were not an answer withheld through eighteen years , he spoke : " Mrs Garr burned it . " Softly , on an expended breath , " She burned it . " Mr Waller nodded silently . Mrs Waller 's head moved , the faint echo of a nod . I felt like crying . The lieutenant 's voice was so still and small it sounded in the small room as if he spoke in a great hall . " You found the suicide note . " " Yes , I found it . " " Mrs Garr paid you two thousand dollars to keep silence about it . " " Yes . " " Only the two of you knew . " " Yes . " " Walters , did you read that note ? " The man he was questioning made a sound like a sigh . He did n't answer directly ; he said , whispering : " Paper . " Lieutenant Strom pushed paper and pencil across the desk . Mr Waller stared at the pencil and the paper at the edge of the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , staggering as if he were drunk . He walked to the desk , bent above it , picked up the pencil . His fingers were shaking , I saw , but the shaking fingers began making penciled marks on the paper , almost automatically , as if this were an exercise performed many times before . For minutes he wrote ; then he pushed the paper across the desk toward the lieutenant , and stood , staring at the floor . Hardness swept into Lieutenant Strom 's face . I moved to read over his shoulder .   Odd handwriting to be a man 's . It was n't a man 's writing ; it was almost a woman 's writing ; a writing remembered so exactly in a man 's mind that he could almost reproduce it . FATHER , MOTHER , I 've tried and tried to get out . I ca n't , the house is locked . The things they make me do are horrible , horrible . Oh Father and Mother , forgive me . I love you , and I know you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes on that paper . I would not , I could not look at the Wallers . But my ears heard Mr Waller saying woodenly : " Now maybe I can forget it . I was new on the force . I owed a lot . We were going to have a baby . It died . That note 's eaten the heart out of me ever since . " The lieutenant said , still quietly , " Two thousand dollars was your entire payment for surrendering this note ? " Mr Waller answered as if now his shame were full , there could be no more . " She gave me all the money she had in the house , too . That was about three thousand dollars . " " God , Waller ! " Suddenly Mr Waller stumbled backward to his chair ; his head dropped to his hands and he began sobbing , the broken , wrenching way a man sobs . I did n't look , but I could feel Mrs Waller patting his shoulder . " Did you kill Mrs Garr , Waller ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been asking about the weather . " Before God , no . " " Did you make the attack on Mrs Dacres Monday night ? " " No . " The lieutenant shrugged weary shoulders , turned to me . " Why do n't you go on along home , Mrs Dacres ? The rest of this is just going to be the same reel , over and over until he breaks the rest of the way . I think I might get along better without you . I 'll let you know when I get where I 'm going . Thanks for what you did . " I went out , down the corridor , past the desk . Out . Into June sunshine . I was tense with excitement . But I was glad to go . I'dP243had enough of seeing the Wallers bludgeoned . Questions . They were worse than knives . Worse than clubs . Questions carefully hunting out the vital spot . Then strike ! Strike ! Strike ! Odd that I should feel any pity at all for the Wallers . Incomprehensiblethat I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and mother suffer more terribly because the world was made to think their daughter vicious . Vicious at sixteen . Girls were vicious , sometimes , at sixteen . But not their daughter . Not Rose . Not Rose with the grave eyes . I called Hodge Kistler from a corner drugstore ; over dinner I told him what the afternoon had brought out . " It is awful , " Hodge agreed soberly when I had finished . " The whole thing 's awful . That nice kid , getting into that sort of thing . And then letting her parents think she was rotten . Lettingthat God-awful old ish-bitch off with five years . Waller ought to be shot . " " That 's the trouble , " I said . " I think he wishes he was . He looks as if he would n't mind if he were shot . I ca n't hate him as I should . " " Hate him ? Why should you ? Hate 's personal . " " Is it ? Then what about Mr Grant ? He hated Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons he gave were impersonal . You do n't know what his real reasons were  --  or are . " " No , that 's true . Well , whatever they were , it does n't look now as if they had anything to do with what we 're interested in . The lieutenant is sure Waller is the one . They have personal enough reasons for wanting to bump Mrs Garr off , goodness knows . I 'd hate anyone who 'd led me into doing anything that nasty . " " Mean to say you 'd let yourself be led ? " " How do I know ? I 'm feeling very humble tonight . I only know I was there in the room when Mr Waller told . And I could feel what he was feeling . I ca n't get away from it . He was feeling exactly as I would have if it had been me . " " Honesty session . Now me , I 'm certain I should have run from the house , waving the note on high . Heck , think how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1919 ! Even 1920 ! The only thing that could have made that story bigger than it was , and that was big enough . Well , Rose Liberry died to give Gilling City a clean government ; she accomplished that much . Lots of men have lived longer and done less . " " Now , that note would n't mean anything , would it ? " " Not to anyone who did n't know the girl . Oh , a few oldtimersmight remember the case well enough to be mildly interested . But the lieutenant ought to make an effort to find the girl 's relatives , if there are any , and let them know . " " It 's meaning something to Mr Waller , " I said grimly . We went to my apartment then ; if the lieutenant called , he would call there . I thought about the Wallers as we waited ; I could n't get them out of my mind . Mr Kistler was restless and uncommunicative too . I thought about Mr Waller , young , in debt . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to cost . Mr Waller , young , walking along his beat and thinking about his wife crying over where they 'd get the money for the baby . A girl running to him in her nightgown , screaming . I thought about Mr Waller running into the red-plush house and up the richly carpeted stairs , accustomed to the feet of Gilling City 's Prominent Men . Waller running , forgetting his crying wife now , running quickly down a hall and into a bedroom where a girl hung by a sheet . Mr Waller working fast , taking the girl down and laying her on the bed , but knowing she was dead . Grabbing up the note and reading it . I thought about how Mrs Garr would run in screaming , offering him money , a thousand dollars , two thousand , three thousand , five  --  anything , to help keep her out of bad trouble ; it was n't any of her fault , and the law would get her ; the law would get her , and she had plenty of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coming back , " money , money , money ! " She would give him all this , her hands full , she would give him more , she would pay him money the rest of his life . The girl was dead . Not taking money would n't make her live again . I thought about Mr Waller testifying in the court , with Mrs Garr 's frantic little black eyes on him , promising , promising . I thought about Mrs Garr 's hair whitening in prison to that lovely , pure white . And of Mr Waller , thrown out with the restp245of his fellows , to destroy himself on his own slow poison of memory . We talked fitfully , expecting every moment to hear the phone ring and the lieutenant 's triumphant voice announcing a confession . Hours went by . Then slow feet came into the hall ; heavy , laden feet that lifted someone slowly up the stairs . Just one pair of feet . " I 'm sure that was Mrs Waller , " I whispered . " Alone . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We heard him return . We grew even more restless as the evening wore on . Hodge began making out a time sheet to keep his mind busy , a time sheet covering the Friday Mrs Garr must have died . Excursion train due to leave . .. 8:05Mrs Garr leaves station . 8:o7Mrs Garr seen by Mr Grant . . 8:25Mrs Garr waits in storage room . 8:27 to 9:10Mr Waller goes to cellar kitchen . 9:08Mrs Garr confronts him 9:10Murder 9:12Mr Waller searches kitchen , puts dog and two cats back in 9:13 to 10 Mrs Dacres returns , sees one cat still out . to Waller returns cat to kitchen . . . . 10:55 W. throws key in cellar window . . . . 11:00Waller attacks Mrs Dacres 11:02 " It 's lovely , and very logical , I 'm sure , " I said . " But it does n't prove anything . " " Pooey to you , always yelping about proof . " " You ca n't electrocute Mr Waller for making way with a suicide note . " " Bigger crimes have been committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Strom would call up . Anyway , what was Waller hunting for in that basement kitchen ? " " Maybe Mrs Garr did n't destroy that note as she said . How did he know she burned it ? Maybe she was holding it over him . "   " But why would he want it ? " " Maybe Mrs Garr was threatening to make it public . " " But what could she do with it after all these years ? And anyway , it would be more dangerous to her than to him . Of course , maybe he thought that if she did n't have it , he could force her to pay that two-thousand-dollar note  --  " " Exactly , my friend . " " Anyway , I wish we 'd get that call . " The doorbell rang then ; we stopped talking to listen . The man on duty in the hall answered . The voice in the hall was Lieutenant Strom 's . I ran for my doors . " Has he confessed ? Do you know now for sure ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair as if starch had left his muscles forever . " He 's sitting as tight as a wood tick , " he said disgustedly . " Ica n't get another thing out of him . " " What does that mean ? Does that mean he is n't guilty ? " " Hell , I do n't know . " I made coffee and sandwiches ; the lieutenant revived somewhaton those , but he was still thoroughly out of sorts . " If he did it he 's doing a damn good job of holding out . " " I take it few hold out on you ? " asked Hodge . " Damn few , " replied the lieutenant arrogantly . " I get ' cm . ' He told us , then , about other cases he 'd handled . About a man who 'd been picked up by a roadside , riddled by bullets . About how he 'd gone out himself and picked up hitchhikers : one , two , three . And how he 'd turned on the fourth with , " How much " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you shot him ? " And the boy had screamed with telltale fear . jOne triumphant case followed another in his recital ; past success poured confidence into him as he talked . " I tell you frankly , I 'm good at getting confessions . I know I 'm good . I 'm not too good , though . I don't.make ' em confess crimes they did n't do . If this Waller croaked Mrs Garr and tried to croak you , Mrs Dacres , he 's good . The trouble is , I 've got to get a confession or else . I have n't enough evidence to pin the thing on him  --  or on anyone else . "   " Good motives for Waller , though , " Hodge said . " Mrs Garr refusing to pay that note and threatening to turn them out . And I understand he admits Mrs Dacres told him she knew he 'd been on the force . One thing awfully dangerous for him to have come out . " " God , do n't think I have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is n't any ground I have n't been over . " " If you tip back any farther in that chair , " I told Hodge , " you 're going to have to put in a new buffet door for Mrs Garr 's estate . You know what I think we should do ? Take our minds off Mr Waller for a minute . And see what else we see . " " So what ? " Hodge . " No , wait a minute . Not a bad idea . " The lieutenant . " Where ' d you begin ? " " Begin where you began with those hitchhikers . How did you know it was the fourth one ? Something that came out when you talked , probably . " " Okay , lady . Who would you say it was , forgetting Waller but taking into consideration everything else we know up to now ? " " I ca n't help it , " I said . " When I begin to ask myself who killed Mrs Garr , I forget the Rose Liberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to prove that old case is actually concerned in the death . Nothing that counts , except that Mrs Garr was a principal figure in both . I go right back to where I started . Who benefited by the death ? The Hallorans . " The lieutenant and Hodge groaned in unison . " Now look here , " the lieutenant instructed me . " Does an alibi mean anything to you ? The Hallorans are n't bright enough to fake alibis like theirs . They could n't have made that pass at you Monday night . " " What proof have you that was the same person who killed Mrs Garr ? " They groaned again . " Did n't we have that all argued out once ? " " Yes , but there 's nothing has as many holes as an argument . " " Well , I 'll be cremated and eat my own ashes before I 'll startagain that far back . You , Kistler , is your idea as bright as hers ? " " Not unlikely . "   " Shoot it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've quietly ridden fromthe beginning . Buffingham . " " Buffingham ? " " That 's my pick of the lot . " " Aw , a guy with a name like that could n't commit murder . " " He did n't do it with his name . Name did n't keep his son from robbing banks and doing a little shooting . " " Reasons  --  any new ones ? " " Just the old ones . Plus my feeling when I have the whole household in one room , which has happened on divers occasions lately , Lieutenant . I look about me and say to myself , Who done it ? ' And my forefinger practically lifts of itself to point out Buffingham . ' ' " Hm . " " Desperate for money , too . " " A couple of Cs would n't do his boy any good . " " He looks grief-stricken , too , " I put in . " Mrs Sorry-for-the-Underdog speaks up from her corner . She 's sorriest of all when the underdog chloroforms her . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you never heard of anyone being ethered , did you ? Or dry-cleanered , did you ? There is n't any verb for that . It does n't sound lethal enough . " " Cut it out , " from the lieutenant . " Now , if you 'd ask me , I 'd say this murderer has to be one of two things . Either he 's smarter than anyone else I 've ever come up against , so smart he can hide what he 's feeling and thinking . Or else he 's so dumb and tough he does n't have anything to show . I 've had that kindbefore . " " The first description fits Mr Kistler perfectly . " " Okay , baby , the second fits you . " " Does it ? What I was really thinking was that it might besomeone who kept his mind fastened so tightly on something else that it completely covers up what you 're trying to get at . " " Say , that would do for Buffingham , would n't it ? Nice work ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke in again .   " Well , I 'm going to have Buffingham down here and take anothercrack at him . " He ordered the detective in the hall to bring Mr Buffingham down . Mr Buffingham returned with him immediately . " Something 's come up that makes me have another go at you , Buffingham . " The lieutenant 's manner held its usual smooth threat . " I 've been going into the records of the Liberry case . You did n't come into that case directly , Buffingham , but I 'll stake plenty that you were connected with Mrs Garr in that old business some way . What were you  --  a come-on ? " " I never saw Mrs Garr before I came to this house . " " How about knowing the Wallers ? " " Know ' em ? Sure . They been here a long time . Seen ' em around . " " Ever know Waller was once on the force ? " Buffingham hesitated . " I do n't know . Had a sort of idea he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ? " " No . " " Oh , you 're sure . So you know when the Liberry case was ? " " I got an idea . I remember the story in the papers . Big story . " " Yeh . Big story . What were you doing in those days ? " " Oh , I was workin ' , I guess . " " Where ? " " Drugstore , it must of been . That 's all the jobs I ever had . Mostly jerking sodas . " Lieutenant Strom paused before his next question . The only movement in the room was the flicker of Mr Buffingham 's restlessdark eyes . " Did you ever work in the Stacy Drugstore at the corner of Cleveland and St Simon Street ? " Again , as on Wednesday , something came and went in back of Mr Buffingham 's eyes . " Yeh , I worked there once . " He laughed . " I worked in half the drugstores in town . " " When did you work there ? " sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Twelve years . Fifteen years . I do n't know . Hell , I worked in too many places .   You know . You get took on for a rush season . Christmas . Or summer at the fountain . Then you get laid off . " " Stacy 's still running that drugstore , Buffingham . I can find out . " Mr Buffingham 's shoulders shrugged . " Sure you were n't working there the summer of 1919 ? " " Might of . I would n't know . " " There 's something to make you remember . Cleveland at St Simon Street is only two blocks below 417 St Simon . And there was plenty of hell popping at 417 St Simon Street that summer . " " It did n't have nothing to do with me . I would n't know . " Was he tense , answering carefully ? Or were his answers as casual as they sounded on the surface ? The lieutenant appeared to have gone as far as he could see to go up that alley . He switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Monday night , when Mrs Dacres had this party we 've heard so much about . You came in with Mr Grant just after midnight . You go upstairs . You sleep . Now , Buffingham , you know doggone well there were noises going on in this house that night . It 's impossible to go downstairs , even carpeted stairs in a house this age , without making some creaks . Mrs Dacres heard ' em , the night Mrs Garr was done in . You ca n't  --  " He turned abruptly , called : " You , Jones out there , steal silently upstairs , will you ? " . " Say , what is this ? " from Jones . " Do what you 're told ! " " Okay . " Jones stealing upstairs was so evident I giggled . " Swell burglar Jones ' d make , " the lieutenant interrupted himselffurther before going back to Buffingham . " Hear that , Buffingham ? We know that kind of noise was going on in this house Monday night . Not as loud as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a bolt without a whine . Not quick , the way this guy had to do it . Little Quick Ears here was out . So was Kistler . Sands and the Wallers said they had been in bed a long time ; they might have been sleeping hard , if it was n't one of them that was up and about . But , by God , I 'd like to hear your reason forP251not hearing things . Your room 's right at the head of the stairs . You 'd just got in . If you did n't hear anything , Buffingham , it sounds doggone suspicious to me . " Mr Buffingham had n't smoked this time . But now he took out a cigarette and began revolving it rapidly with both hands , his eyes fixed on it . " I would n't want to get nobody in trouble , " he said at last . " Let me worry about that . You ca n't get anyone in trouble he did n't get himself into . What ' d you hear ? " " Creaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . Like them he made . Jones . Only not so loud . " " Where ' d they start  --  other end of the hall ? ' The cigarette revolved more slowly . " I guess not . My end . I guess they went past my door . " " Past your door . From Grant 's or Kistler 's rooms ? " " He "  --  Mr Buffingham motioned with his head toward Hodge  --  " he was n't in yet . I do n't think . I had n't gone to sleep yet . " " Grant then ! " No reply. - " Grant ! " said Hodge . " Baloney . " " Or someone hiding in your rooms , Hodge , " I said . " Grant ! " the lieutenant repeated briskly , his eyes alight . " I 'm always getting around to that guy . He hated her too . Said he did . I 'm going to have him down . No , Buffingham , you stay here . Grant ! " P252THE OBLIGING JONES went upstairs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timetablehe had worked out . The lieutenant , not laughing , added the paper to a bunch from his pocket . " Nice evidence if it turns out you did it , " he said . When he came in Mr Grant looked so old and frail that Hodge automatically offered him a chair . Mr Buffingham , withoutbeing asked , dropped into one too . The lieutenant opened fire at once . " Walk in your sleep , Mr Grant ? " " I ? No , certainly not . " " Sure ? " " I am certain . " " Mr Buffingham here has had one of those sudden memory attacks always affecting people in this case . Did n't bring it up before out of not wanting to get anyone in trouble . Says he heard someone walking Monday night , the night Mrs Dacres was attacked . Someone who started at your door , walked down the hall and down the stairs . " Mr Grant turned his mild proud eyes on Mr Buffingham ; he appeared to ponder his answer before making it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quiedy . The lieutenant made a starded exclamation ; whatever he 'd expected , it could n't have been that quiet admission . I was dumbfounded , and I could see Hodge was the same . Mr Grant talked on . " I did walk down the hall . I walked along the upstairs hall , down the stairs , and then on down the cellar stairs . I did not say so the other day because it was entirely irrelevant . Nothing came of it . " " You could have let me judge that , " barked the lieutenant . " Mind letting me in on why you took this trip ? "  | " Not at all . It was something I heard . " " So you heard things too ! " " Well , I thought I did . Something rather peculiar . You 'll be amused , I know . I could n't imagine why anyone should be doing so at that time of night . " He spread his hands . " It was an extremely odd sound for that time of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to is  --  sweeping . " " Oh , so you heard sweeping . " The lieutenant 's voice bristled with withheld meanings . " Impossible , of course , but that is the best description I can give . " " You heard sweeping , and you did n't say one word Tuesday , you did n't say a word Wednesday ! " Mr Grant blinked , " But it could n't have been important . " " Could n't have been  --  could n't have been ! When we know the person who attacked Mrs Dacres swept the back cellar stairs that night ! " Surprise flitted across Mr Grant 's face , and , I though ' , mild gratification . " Someone was sweeping ? Then I was right ! " " Right ? I 'll say you were right ! Why , I ask again , did n't you say so before ? " " This is the first time I have heard of back stairs being swept , " Mr Grant pointed out , . still mildly . He had Lieutenant Strom . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  opened our mouths to speak  --  and then shut them . What , after all , was the use ? There was every likelihood that Mr Grant had n't heard . Certainly it had n't been brought out at his questioning yesterday , and Mr Grant was n't given to gossipingwith the others . Mr Buffingham just looked blank . He had n't looked surprised when the lieutenant had outlined the noises there must have been in the house Monday night  --  had he known before ? And Mr Waller . My mind sped back to the afternoon . He had n't shown surprise at the lieutenant 's reconstruction of the attack , either ! " I 'll be fried for an oyster , " the lieutenant said helplessly , T while he got himself together . Step by step , then , he explained his theory of my attacker 's probable movements . Mr Grant nodded . " That fits in very nicely . I heard , as I say , this brushing sound . My interest , in view of the strange happeningsin the house lately , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter . So I investigated . I walked to the cellar , very quietly , but could see nothing out of the way in the furnace room or in Mrs Garr 's kitchen beyond , although I did not turn on the light there . As soon as I had left my room there was absolute stillness in the house . I then returned upstairs , thinkingI must have been mistaken . " " You did n't think it your duty to warn the other inhabitants  --  MrsDacres , for example ? " " Why , no . I  --  I thought her adequately protected . Chairs under doorknobs are excellent  --  " " How do you know about the chairs under the doorknobs ? " " Why , I heard it . " " You heard it ! " " Yes . I have neglected to state , perhaps , that it was while I was in the cellars that Mrs Dacres and one other person  --  Mr Kistler , of course  --  returned to the house . I heard the good-bys in the hall , and her report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . I heard the doors being locked , chairs being dragged and hooked under the knobs . Not concealed actions at all . " He blinked at me , and I blushed for the rum , but he smiled kindly . " Very evident . Very evident . Very normal , too . Naturally I did not wish to be seen . I waited a few minutes before returningupstairs . " He looked at the lieutenant 's suspicion as if he did not sense it . The lieutenant stared from Mr Grant to Hodge , and then to me and around again , trying to form some judgment on this bewilderingevidence . " Sounds screwy to me , " he said ; then strongly , as if he took his cue from himself , " Yes , and it is screwy , too ! You 'll have to do a lot more explaining to get out of this , Grant . So you were around at three o'clock , eh ? "   " I had no idea of the time . " " But that 's when these folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't square with your story that you 'd just come in. , " I only said what it seemed like to me , " Mr Buffingham repliedthoughtfully . " I might have been reading a little longer . I might of laid awake a little longer . I would n't know . " " Nobody knows anything in this case , " the lieutenant snorted . " Grant , you did n't go into that cellar because you heard a noise . You made that noise . That was you , sweeping those cellar stairs . " I began to wonder if the lieutenant had n't left out a little in his story of the murdering hitchhiker . I began to guess he had accused the first three hitchhikers , too , and struck pay dirt in the fourth . Certainly his methods in this case had depended strongly on accusation of everyone who came under suspicion . He did n't strike pay dirt in Mr Grant . He threatened , he cajoled , he made the same accusations over and over ; Mr Grant was firm . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less firm . It was the lieutenant who cried quits . " Oh , for God 's sake , " he cried as a finale . " I 'm God damned sick of the whole case ! You can all get murdered for all I care . I 'm going home to bed . " He flung out , growled something at the detective in the passage , slammed the door after himself . The four of us left in my living room looked bleakly at each other . We 'd been pretty well drained of emotion . I know I 'd been wrung by pity for Mr Grant . I said so . I 'm glad I did . I said , " I do n't think it was you that attacked me , Mr Grant . I 'd never in the world believe it . " " You 'd be right , " he said gently . " To hell with the police , " Mr Buffingham said . " I 'm going to bed . " He lurched wearily out and upstairs . Mr Grant and Hodge stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must you go so soon ? ' " I said , trying to be light . " I know you 're desperately tired . I am . " I walked forward to be at the door when they left , walked past the chair where the lieutenant had sat . Automatically I stooped to pick up a sheet of paper fallen to the floor . " I hope you both get a good night 's sleep ; I feel I can sleep safely with that detective  --  Why , look , Hodge , this is the copy Mr Waller wrote out , of Rose Liberry 's suicide note ! Lieutenant Strom must have dropped it when he put your timetableaway ! " Hodge leaned over me to read . Mr Grant grew interested too ; when I looked up he stood beside me , reading . Without a word or a sign he slipped to the floor . " He 's fainted ! " cried Hodge . " Here , let me get him on the couch . " He was curiously light when we lifted him . The detective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to bring Mr Grant back to consciousness . He came back quickly , lay quiet for a while , his face sunken and white but his eyes bright . " So many questions , " he murmured . He closed his eyes , seemed to doze a little . " I knew Lieutenant Strom was being too hard on him . " I felt indignant at the lieutenant . " Let him stay here awhile . There 's no hurry for him to get upstairs . " The detective , instead of going back to the hall , hovered near the windows , watching . I sat by the couch . Presently Mr Grant 's eyes opened ; he smiled at me faintly . " What was I looking at ? Oh yes . The paper . What was it you called it ? " " It was something we turned up this morning . I do n't suppose you 'd remember , but there was a big scandal in Gilling City years ago . A girl named Rose Liberry committed suicide . Her suicide note was very dangerous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man living who saw it remembered it very clearly . That was his copy . " To my surprise he nodded .   " I remember . The Liberry case . A great scandal . I remember very well . I  --  knew the family . But there was n't any suicide note . I remember very well . No note . " " We just found out about it today , " I repeated . I hesitated , but he was obviously interested , waiting . There was no one else who could hear except Hodge and the detective . Why should n't I tell him ? Here was someone who at least remembered . A friend of the family . One of those who ought to know . But I did n't want to bring Mr Waller in . " We traced down the policeman who was the first official at the scene of the suicide . We were able to prove Mrs Garr-had been paying him money . So Lieutenant Strom forced him to confess he had found a suicide note and that the money was a bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Destroy ? But the note --  " " Mr  --  the policeman remembered it perfectly . He could n't forget . It had been eating at his mind ever since . He wrote it down for Lieutenant Strom just as it was , just as he found it . " Mr Grant closed his eyes ; he was so pale I called out to Hodge , but he had n't fainted again . He opened his eyes after a few minutes . " Very interesting . Very interesting , " he murmured . He sat up in another few moments ; Hodge and the detective moved to help him upstairs . When he was on his feet he turned to me absently , as if his thoughts were far away . " Very interesting . I remember the case well . The girl 's parents  --  I remember them well . Great blow , the girl 's death was . The  --  the circumstances . This makes such a change . The note  --  would you mind if I studied it ? I would return it to  --  the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hesitated again . Lieutenant Strom might be furious . But it was n't an original ; if the note were lost , could n't Mr Waller be forced to make another copy ? I looked at Mr Grant . A faint pink was coming into his face now ; he looked , somehow , like a lost , pathetic old child , asking a favor . " I do n't see why you ca n't have it , " I said gently and gave it to him . He took it in his right hand , carefully ; I did n't think he'd lose it . I heard the three pairs of feet slowly going upstairs ; Hodge and the detective stayed awhile in Mr Grant 's room before they came down again . " Something funny about that . " Jones followed Hodge into my living room . " I think he had the wind up about that note . " " It was strange how interested he was , was n't it ? He was worn out before , though ; it must have been the strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still puzzling over the request to study the note that night . What did he mean , " study " ? " I disagree with you , " Hodge said thoughtfully . " I was thinkinghow well he stood up under the questioning . The lieutenant'sbarbs did n't seem to penetrate . He beat Strom out . No , I think Jones here is right . It was the note that knocked him cold . " " But what could that mean ? " " A lot or nothing , " Hodge said . " He said he knew the family . To friends of the family that scandal must have been a worldshaker . They 'd remember . Then this note : It 's so obvious it makes the girl all right . A victim . It was probably the surprise , coming on top of all the questioning . " " The questioning tonight  --  Mr Grant 's I mean  --  did n't go into the Liberry case at all , did it ? It was when he was talking to Mr Buffingham that Lieutenant Strom went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the chief , " Jones offered . " But you saw the way he slammed out of here . He ought to be asleep by now . I 'd get my head bitten off at the neck . " " Tomorrow 's another day , " Hodge agreed . " Especially with you on guard in the hall , " I reminded Mr Jones . " Mr Grant will still be here in the morning , with you to keep him here . " So Lieutenant Strom was n't called . I wonder if it would have made any difference if he had been . In the end , I am sure , there would have been no difference . I was restless that night . It was hard to pin my restlessness down to any one thing . P259Mr Waller did n't come home . He was still being held , then . We were safe from him , if he was the marauder . If he was not , then there was the detective in the hall to keep us safe from whoever it was . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the rattle of Jones 's paper , and his movements as he twisted in his chair . I finally pinned my restlessness to Mr Grant . I could n't figure out his attitude . " Very interesting . Very . I remember the case well . I was a friend of the family . " His voice murmured in my ears as I tried vainly to sleep . I tried to make my mind Mr Grant 's , to see and feel as . he would . Mr Grant twenty years younger . Fifty , perhaps . A friend of Mr Liberry . An acquaintanceof Miss Rachel Staines , the aunt . Of course they would have friends . There must be others , still living . The first thing I must do in the morning must be to hurry Lieutenant Strom into finding the friends , the relatives of Rose Liberry , if he had n't already started doing so . They would like to know . The girl 's father and mother . They might still live out of town . But the aunt had lived in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rachel , 1128 Cleveland Avenue . Would the name still be there ? " Miss Staines , this is Mrs Dacres . You wo n't know me , but I have good news for you . . . . Your niece , Rose Liberry  --  the one that died so sadly  --  her suicide note has been found at last . " I 'd never sleep , thinking this . Mr Grant , a friend of the family . Worried and kindly when the first news of the disappearancecame . Helping with money , perhaps . Horrified when the end came . A friend of the family . I slept at last , but I had nightmares in which Rose Liberry 's family cried to me : " Hurry , hurry , hurry ! " When I woke it was bright morning , but I was still heavily tired . I dragged myself out of bed and yawned my breakfast ready ; funny , day before yesterday I 'd been starving on orange juice , and now I 'd already forgotten that hunger . The top of my head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday 's attack . It was Friday . About time , I thought sardonically , for me to have another , they 'd been coming along so fast . P260After I 'd eaten I wandered out into the hall . Mr Grant was back on my mind . Jones was still there , sleepy and cross . " Good morning ! " " Morning . " " Everything normal ? No murders ? " " Naw . " " Seen Mr Grant this morning ? " " He ai n't been down yet . " " Poor old man , " I said . " He 's probably all in . I think I 'll make fresh coffee and take him a cup . " " Okay , sister . I could use one myself . " So I made coffee , left a cup with the grateful Jones , and went upstairs with the other . The hall upstairs was dark and silent . Hodge was probably gone . Mr Bufiingham would still be sleeping , Miss Sands at work . Mrs Waller  --  Mrs Waller would be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought about their life , knit so closely by shared shame . For better , for worse . Mrs Waller had taken her full share of the shame . It was really the Wallers I was thinking . of as I knocked softly on Mr Grant 's door . There was n't any answer . I knocked again . The door gave a little as I knocked . Mr Grant , then , as I had , had left his door unlocked last night . He had n't even caught the lock . Probably he had been afraid he might be sick in the night and need help . He was an old man . Surely he would n't mind if I came in to see how he was . I swung the door open . He slept on the bed , his face turned to the open window . The light fell strongly on his sleeping face ; he looked rested , serene , all the weariness of last night gone . The room was very bright . I looked upward . The electric light in the ceiling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set the cup and saucer on the dresser top . Lightly I touched the man 's arm.  |p261Dead  . I knew , too , what to look for . On the table by the bed were two slips of paper , one laid neatly over the other . The top one was familiar . Rose Liberry 's suicide note . Under it was a shorter note . I am John Grant Liberry . I am very happy tonight ; I can not wait to go to her . P262I WENT QUIETLY downstairs to tell Jones . He woke up thoroughly then , gave a startled exclamation , ran upstairs , came charging back . I sat down on the black leather davenport to cry ; Jones called Strom and paced the floor , anxious . " Gosh , what 'll he say ? With me right here ! " was his refrain . Lieutenant Strom appeared with his usual promptness ; if he left abruptly he came abruptly , too . It did n't seem five minutes before he was there in the hall , Van and Bill behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me before he spoke to Jones . " I 'm so glad he saw the note , " I sobbed . " What note ? " " You dropped Rose Liberry 's suicide note . He 's her father . " " For crying out loud ! Come along , Jones ! " They tramped upstairs , all four . Within a few minutes I was continually interrupted by new arrivals . Men , officers , I did n't know who they were . Police officers , coroner 's men , probably . They came in officiously , asked , " Where is it ? " and went upstairs . After a while Mrs Waller came down , her face mottled and red , her eyes anxious and frightened . " What is it ? " she asked hoarsely . " It 's Mr Grant . He 's dead . " " Dead ? He 's dead ? " " Yes . I found him . I went up with some coffee for him , and he was  --  gone . " " What did he die from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . But he  --  he did it himself . He left a note . "  |p263I  had n't yet thought what the implications might be . Then I did , with a shock , as I watched hope burst into Mrs Waller 's face . I knew immediately what she meant when she cried : " Did he confess he 'd done it ? " " Oh no . No . It does n't mean he had anything to do with Mrs Garr 's death . It was something entirely different . It wasThe realization of how directly the Wallers were concerned in Mr Grant 's life and his death hit me . The realization of the eighteen years of agony they had built him . I turned my eyes away . " When Lieutenant Strom was here last night he dropped on the floor the copy of Rose Liberry 's suicide note , the one your husband wrote . Mr Grant saw it . " I paused . Culpable as I felt the Wallers to be , I could hardly tell her the rest . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was compulsion in it too . Compulsion to tell . I went on . " Mr Grant saw the note after Lieutenant Strom had left . He fainted . He  --  his name was n't Grant . It was John Grant Liberry . He was her father . " Mrs Waller held her breath so long I was frightened intolooking at her . Then she began sobbing horribly . She was n't an imaginative woman . I think that was the first time she really felt what their withholding of the note had meant . I could n't be sympathetic , but you have to do what you can for another human being . I went into my kitchen , reheated the second batch of coffee and made her drink a cup . Mr Buffinghamcame down while she was drinking it . " What 's going on now ? " I explained shortly . " Jeez ! " he exclaimed excitedly . " You mean he 's murdered ? " " No . He left a note . " " Cripes ! Suicide ! " " It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall with long , fast steps . It was curious : Mrs Garr 's death had left him imperturbable , as had , so far as I could see , the attacks on me . But Mr Grant's death excited him wildly . He ran upstairs after a bit ; I heard his voice now and again talking to the men upstairs . Lieutenant Strom came down to tell Mrs Waller and me to go into my apartment and shut the door . We did ; there was a shuffling of feet on the stairs , then comparativequiet . Lieutenant Strom knocked on my door ; came in alone . He was genially elated . " God , what a finale ! This beats anything I ever had ! " I caught at one word with blank amazement . " Finale ? What do you mean , finale ? " " Well , everything 's answered now , is n't it ? " I just stared at him , my lower jaw hanging . He laughed at me . " Do n't tell me your supercolossal mind has n't tumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it ? Why , it 's as plain as the ' nose on Kistler 's face ! John Grant Liberry ! Gosh , what a melodrama ! Girl 's father waits until the woman who brought about his daughter 's downfall is out of jail . He never believed the willing-victim business . He knew the girl . He considers Mrs . Garr her murderer . So when she gets out he comes here to find her . Changes his name , breaks loose from his past . That alone shows he was out for her . We do n't know when he begins his hunt , but he finds her eventually , and luck 's with him . She 's running a rooming house . He takes a room with her . He probablyhas that suicide note on the brain ; he hunts in the house for that or some other clue to Mrs Garr 's guilt . He can afford to take his time . Maybe he finds something , maybe he does n't . I think he does n't . But she comes back from that Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's some kind of a scrap , and she hits the floor . Everything fits . Why , he even said he 'd seen her that night ! Golly , I should have caught on , right there . That slipped out , that did . So he tries to pass it off by saying he 'd seen her out the window . And who was it raised the hue and cry about Mrs Garr being gone ? Mr Grant ! The girl 's father ! Boy , here 's one place this story can hit the papers , any-way . " He stopped , insufferably satisfied .   " But the attacks on me , " I objected . " Do you think he did those too ? " " Sure , why not ? Why , I almost had him last night on one of them ! He actually admitted he 'd been in the cellar that night . Had to cook up a story to meet Buffingham 's evidence that he 'd heard ' him prowling around . Admitted he 'd heard you hooking your chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing with his ear to your kitchen door , that 's where he was . Why , I must have been off my feed , not hanging it on him last night . I knew it the first thing I woke up this morning . I was just going to start for here when Jones called . Oh , he knew I had him , all right . Well , he saved the city the expense of a trial . " . I stared at his cocksure face . If he was as sure as that he must be right . He had experience of murderers ; I had n't . " What did he  --  " " Sleeping powders . Nice quiet way . I do n't blame him . He knew he was through . I do n't blame him for much of the rest of it , either , except that he was a little hard on you . Probably did n't realize how hard he was being . The girl 's father ! Golly , what a story ! " I looked away from his self-satisfaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was drinking hope . I asked the question she trembled to ask . " I suppose Mr Waller will be home soon , now . " " Oh , sure . Sure . " He paused , thought . " God , that was a dirty deal , but I do n't see what I can do about it after all these years . Mrs Garr dead too . As far as I can see the whole thing 's washed up . " If you make a Roman holiday for the newspapers out of this I 'll be mad at you forever . Poor Mr Grant , " I said . His manner took on more reserve after that . He went out into the hall where five or six men were still buzzing around . They turned out to be reporters ; some of them , at least . Strom talked to them a long time . Mrs Waller escaped through them with her apron over her head ; I had men knocking on my door to ask me questions , too , but I was careful   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
