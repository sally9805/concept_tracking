From vast , subterranean Michigan streams Dow Chemical Co. pumps brackish water , produces aspirin , phenol , ammonia , chlorine . From the vast Pacific , Great Western Electro-Chemical Co. dredges salt , manufactures liquid chlorine , caustic soda , caustic potash . In a corporate chemical reaction last month these two companies decided to combine . Last week their stockholders approved the process . Catalyst of the consolidation was Willard Henry Dow , elder son of the late , great Chemist Herbert Henry Dow . No chemical genius but an efficient business executive , Willard Dow graduated from University of Michigan in 1919 , went to work for his father as a department head , succeeded him as president eight years ago . A chemical putterer since he was ten , good-looking , even-tempered Willard Dow is extremely popular with his employes , most of whom call him by his first name . <P> Although Dow Chemical has branches elsewhere , the root of its business is still in Midland , Mich. , where in 1890 Founder Herbert Dow , two years out of Case School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumbing 1,200 feet to a huge salt pool , he began refining the brine into everything from patented laxatives to synthetic indigo dyes . <P> Midland 's brine deposits have brought stockholders dividends as regularly as Epsom salt brings relief . Last year ( ending May 31 , 1938 ) the company netted $3,895,269 , approximate average for 1934-38 . Never before in a merger , Dow has a good reason for this one : it wants a West Coast branch , * and Great Western offers that as well as exclusive rights to cheap processes of making chloroform , carbon tetrachloride , hexachloroethane . <P> Great Western is situated in Pittsburg , Calif. , 50 miles northeast of San Francisco . In 1920 , when the four-year-old company was ailing , Banker-Chairman Mortimer Fleishhacker installed able , ambitious Jacob F. C. Hagens as president . The company promptly made its first profit-$100,000 ; last year it cleared $531,852 . <P> To clinch the deal , which will cost his company almost $12,000,000 in stock , President Dow dangled an attractive proposition before Great Western 's stockholders . For each preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of Dow common ; for each common share ( whose price zoomed from $60 to $132 on news of the merger ) , one share of Dow common ( about $134 ) . The merger will make Great Western a Dow division with Jacob Hagens its manager . <P> <P> *Io-Dow Chemical Co. , a Long Beach , Calif , subsidiary , manufactures only iodine from oil-well bittern ( brine waste ) .
