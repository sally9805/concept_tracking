txt One hundred and thirty-five , thousand members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America will receive a wage increase of 12 per cent , or $30,000,000 annually , under the terms of a three-year contract approved yesterday by the Amalgamated and by a committee of men 's clothing manufacturers , representing 85 per cent of the national industry , with a retail production volume of more than 51,000,000,000 . Between 35,000 and 40,000 workers in the metropolitan district will benefit from the contract , which becomes effective May 15 . Continuation of the thirty-six-hour work week is provided in the agreement , the first negotiated on a national scale in the history of the industry . Hillman Hails Agreement Sidney Hillman , president of the union , an affiliate of the Committee for Industrial Organization , hailed the agreement as a victory for the C. I. 0 . principle of industrial organization in the mass production industries . " In the negotiations for a general increase in wages , " Mr. Hillman said , " the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America represented all the workers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the workers to the organized employers in the industry . " Those who are associated with this industry realize that no effective organization of labor would be possible if workers in this industry were divided into craft organizations , each representing a small group of skilled mechanics . Nor could a national agreement have been negotiated for the whole industry without an industrial organization of labor , speaking for all the workers in the industry . " Mr. Hillman disclosed that the union , which had originally asked a 15 per cent increase in pay , had rejected the thesis that the amount of wages should be determined by fluctuations in the cost of living . " An increase of wages was asked for and gained on the basis that the workers in the industry are entitled to a larger share of the fruits of their industry , " the union head declared , " a share that will enable the workers to live on a higher standard of life . It was not just a question of meeting the increased cost of living . " In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the purchasing power of each worker . Unless all industry does the same the improvement in business can not continue . The employers with whom we are in contractual relations have shown the economic intelligence to recognize this also . " He estimated that the increase in " real wages " under the new scale would be 7 or 8 per cent . This figure was obtained by comparing the 12 per cent pay increase with rising living costs . Unorganized Workers Aided The new agreement will cover some 20,000 unorganized workers . It will apply to workers paid by the week and to those employed on a piece-work basis . The amount of the increase to be given cutters will be decided by a special committee of the union and the manufacturers . Mr. Hillman predicted that the cutter scale in this city would jump from $50 a week to $55 . He said that the three-year contract gave either party the right at the end of each year to call for new negotiations on the question of wages . All other considerations remain static . A joint statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuppenheimer &; Co. , Chicago , chairman of the manufacturers ' committee , declared that all the conferences between the two groups had been conducted in " a spirit of harmony . " It was this aspect of the negotiations that Mr. Hillman stressed in his personal comment on the contract . He pointed out that the industry 's record of amicable collective bargaining dated from 1911 , when the union negotiated an agreement with Hart , Schaffner &; Marx . Since then there had never been a strike in any plant where an agreement was in force , he said . " In the midst of industrial strife , " Mr. Hillman declared , " here is an industry which amicably negotiates on an questions . Through-the month or more of our current discussions there were no scare headlines of a strike . We knew that some basis of settlement would be found . " The committee of manufacturers that Mr. Cahn headed included Morris Greenberg of Hart Schaffner &; Marx , Chicago ; Max Holtz , president of the Rochester Clothing Exchange ; Henry J. Ettelson , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alco Zander Company , Philadelphia ; Louis Goldsmith of Philadelphia , Charles D. Jaffee , president of the New . York Clothing Manufacturers Exchange ; J. H. Levy , Boris Maruchess and Mark Trivison , also of the exchange ; Victor S. Riesenfeld of Cohen , Goldman &; Co. ; N. Schwartz of Julius Schwartz Sons ; Morris Friedman of J. Friedman Company , Raymond H. Reiss of the International Tailoring Company and David Drecheler , counsel .

Rosenblum and Samuel Levin of Chicago and Abraham Chatman of Rochester . PLANS BIG GIFT TO C. I. 0 . Amalgamated Clothing Workers to Contribute $500,000 The executive board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America has informally decided to recommend " in the very near future " a contribution of $500,000 by the union to the organizing fund of the Committee for Industrial Organization , Sidney Hillman , president of the Amalgamated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . The union head will devote himself in the capital to questions involving the C. I. 0. , labor legislation and the future of Labor 's NonPartisan League . He said that he would support unequivocally President Roosevelt 's program for reform of the judiciary . He also will promote legislation on hours and wages . Discussing the outlook for the C. I. 0. , to which the Amalgamated has already contributed $100,000 , Mr. Hillman said : " The Committee for Industrial Organization is spreading faster than its friends dared jaope . Its activities in the future will not be limited to five or six industries , for it has struck the core of the massproduction industries and it will proceed constantly on a broader base . The victory in the major engagement with General Motors will act to speed up the drive on all fronts . "
