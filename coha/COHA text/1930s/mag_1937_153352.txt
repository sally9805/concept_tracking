The two busiest times of a President 's year are the week Congress convenes and the week it adjourns . Last week Franklin Roosevelt had three messages to Congress to prepare . On the evening of the official Cabinet dinner at the White House-after midnight when the guests had departed- his wife and his secretaries joined him in his study to hear the final rehearsal of his message on the State of the Union ( see col. 3 ) . <P> The President held a special cramming session for newshawks to instruct them in the intricacies of his budget message 24 hours before he sent it to the Capitol ( see p. 16 ) . His third message , on Government Reorganization , which goes to Congress this week , required two preliminary sessions . Sunday afternoon he spent an hour and a half priming Vice President Garner , Senators Joe Robinson and Pat Harrison , Speaker Bankhead , Representatives Rayburn , Buchanan and Doughton on the Re-organization Plan so that they would be prepared to defend it from the first moment that opposition reared its ugly head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was probably the most important of his week 's business , for although his other messages might escape serious criticism , any Reorganization Plan was certain to provoke opposition . <P> In a big way , President Roosevelt had labor trouble on his hands . It came to him in the form of a delegation of hosiery workers bearing a somewhat questionable piece of persuasion , an unexploded gas bomb used in a recent Reading , Pa. strike . <P> Secretary Mclntyre substituted for the President in receiving this object . But no one could substitute for the President when Myron Charles Taylor , chairman of the board of U. S. Steel , asked permission to call . Obviously Mr. Taylor came to discuss his company 's side of C. I. O. 's drive on the steel and motor industries ( see p. 17 ) , but Mr. Taylor told the press : " This is not the time for talking . " <P> The President sent a letter to the governors and governors-elect of 19 States whose legislatures are meeting or about to meet . He wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Child Labor Amendment by the remaining 12 States whose action is necessary to place it in the Constitution is the obvious way to early achievement of our objective ? I hope that you will feel that this can be made one of the major items in the legislative program of your State this year . " Ordinarily Franklin Roosevelt does not look for endorsement of his sentiments from the quarter whence these were presently endorsed . <P> " The President is right . The Child Labor Constitutional Amendment should be passed now . It has already been ratified by States covering a majority of the country 's population . . . . <P> " The major reason for its ratification is the rights of children to health and a fair chance . But it is also important that we have orderly constitutional change instead of pressure on the independence of the Supreme Court . " This statement was issued to the press at Palo Alto by Herbert Hoover , his first formal statement since last election . <P> Son Franklin Jr . arrived at the White House from Boston to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
