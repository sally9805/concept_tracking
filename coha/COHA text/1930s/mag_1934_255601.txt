Last week Manhattan 's Whitney Museum of American Art opened a " regional " showing of Philadelphia artists . The exhibition seemed to prove that there is no such thing as a Philadelphia " school . " A bleak hospital room with red door ajar was called The Gate of Heaven by Artist Wayne Martin . Henry Cooper had a stooped oldster wheeling a cart through a narrow Paris street . A gingerbread corner store with bright green shades by Grace Thorp Gomberling was typical of Philadelphia 's outskirts . Leon Kelly 's Interior of a Slaughter House showed two men dwarfed by a large gory carcass . <P> Critics looked with special interest at the work of the three Pinto brothers-Angelo , Biagio , Salvatore-because they are protgs of Philadelphia 's Dr. Albert C. Barnes and are included with his Cezannes , Matisses and Picassos in his big private museum. * Angelo was showing a blue-trousered dart thrower leaning against an amusement park counter tended by a pretty girl in red uniform ( $300 ) . Biagio , youngest of the three brothers , had a red-nosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sprawling bathers at a public beach was priced at $650 . <P> Yalemen recall the 1921 Yale-Princeton football game in which Right End Justin Sturm stopped Princeton 's Gilroy from getting away for a touchdown , helped his team win 13 to 7 . Since then Justin Sturm has been a minor investigator for Montgomery Ward , a laborer in a glass factory , a gang foreman with a Chicago construction company . In 1926 Harper Bros , published his first novel ( The Bad Samaritan ) . Last week Yalemen and others were able to see Justin Sturm 's latest accomplishment-an exhibition of sculpture at Manhattan 's Ferargil Galleries . <P> Competent and strong , Footballer Sturm 's portrait heads revealed more finish than would be expected from a man who studied only a few weeks at Yale School of Fine Arts , served a brief apprenticeship in drawing under John Sloan . Most appealing piece was a solemn Kewpie-like head of a child called Marnie . That Mr. Sturm was already developing a fashionable following was indicated by some of his other subjects : Washington 's Mrs. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitchcock Jr. , Hope Williams , Gene Tunney . Strongest of the lot was his deeply creased portrait of William McFee . <P> At the " daylight gallery " of the English Book Shop in Manhattan went on exhibition a group of etchings never before shown east of California . Californians remember John Kelly as an advertising man who gave up his job eight years ago , went to Honolulu , won honorable mention at last year 's International Exhibit in Los Angeles . A shy Irishman , Kelly and his sculptress wife live year round in Hawaii , prefer natives to tourists . He dislikes exhibiting , does so only when his wife argues him into it . <P> Some of his aquatints of Hawaiian girls last week immediately reminded critics of Gauguin 's sultry Tahiti wood carvings and oils . Unforced and simple , John Kelly 's etchings proved him an able draughtsman . Hawaii visitors saw in his pictures a pleasing , accurate record of the island 's scenery , water , natives and customs . <P>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
