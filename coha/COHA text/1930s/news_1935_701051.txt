txt A charge was made today before the Board of Tax Appeals that during the 1932 bank crisis , while he was still Secretary of the Treasury , Andrew W. Mellon intervened personally to put the financial institutions owned by bis family on a preferential basis . ? The full story of the part the former Cabinet officer played in that troubled phase of the " Iron City 's " history was not disclosed , however . Ernest H. Van Fossan , presiding member of the board , ruled that it had nothing to do with the issue being tried , which is whether Mr. Mellon owes the government $3,000,000 in taxes and penalties or is entitled to a $139 , - 000 refund . Earlier in the day Robert N. Jackson , government counsel in this case , which has high finance for its basis and politics for overtones , ran into another open switch when he tried to have spread upon the record the names of all those persons in whose names are registered certificates owned by Mr. Mellon . Defense Blocks One Phase . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mellon 's fight for vindication , quickly objected to the proposed revelation of all the secrets contained in the little black , leathercovered book which Mr. Howard M. Johnson , the capitalist 's financial secretary , held in his trembling hands . Mr. Jackson withdrew the question , but not until he had said it was his purpose to show that some of the stocks listed in the names of others were bought from J. P. Morgan &; Co. ' s preferred list which was brought to light in a Senatel inquiry since President Roosevelt took office . He promised to return to that matter after laying a better , groundwork . Thwarted in this direction , Mr. Jackson drew from Mr. Johnson , occupying the witness chair for the fifth court day , testimony that I some $30,000,000 in securities which Mr. Mellon gave his children , Paul and Ailsa , found their way onto the books of the Coalesced Corporation as " contributions to surplus . " It was this company , all the dividends of which have thus far been paid to the former Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company the 123 , - 000 shares of Pittsburgh Coal Company stock at the same price at which Mr. Mellon sold it to the trust company when he claimed a loss on his 1931 income-tax return of $5,677,956 . New Security Sale Traced . Delving into some of the more remote pastures of the rich and farflung Mellon financial demesne just before adjournment of the hearing until tomorrow , with Mr. Johnson still on the wiliness stand , Mr. Jackson unearthed a 1933 transaction similar in many ways to the one in 1931 which the government contends was " only a shadow sale : " This transaction , hitherto unknown to government counsel , concerned the sale of several stocks and bonds by Mr. Mellon to his brokers , Moore , Leonard &; Lynch , at a loss of about $61,000 which he reported on his income tax return for that year . Minute books and Mr. Johnson 's testimony revealed that they were snapped up by Coalesced the very day Mr. Mellon sold them and the following day turned over to Smithfield Securities , that company 's subsidiary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the issues of the hearing or not , Mr. Johnson 's testimony about his employer 's actions in the bank crisis was easily the most interesting evidence brought forth today . Aid to Banks Is Related . Government counsel contended that Mr. Hogan himself had opened the door to this line of inquiry by having the financial secretary testify on direct examination that the Coalesced Company contributed several million dollars to the Smithfield Company to assist banks in the Pittsburgh area . To the first questions of Mr. Jackson , Mr. Hogan made no objection . Mr. Johnson was permitted to testify that after the bank holiday with which Mr. Roosevelt ushered in his administration , all the Mellon banks , except four which were already in receivership , were relicensed immediately . Their surpluses , Mr. Johnson said , were deposited with the Mellon National Bank . Mr. Johnson also testified that Smithfield Securities Company , formed by Paul Mellon as a subsidiary of Coalesced with $8,000,000 in bank stock his father had given him , had purchased a half interest ' in Melbank Corporation , which his uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holding company for a group of banks in the Pittsburgh area . Melbank Interest Is Alleged . Thus , since half the earnings of Melbank were payable to Smithfield , which in turn was a subsidiary of Coalesced , and since Mr. Mellon 's $2,000,000 worth of preferred stock in the latter company entitled him to all its net earnings , the government maintains he had an interest in the Melbank company . Mr. Johnson went on to testify under Mr. Jackson 's questioning that late in 1931 or early in 1932 , A. W. Mellon and R. B. Mellon formed the Melbank Surety Company with 2,500 shares of capital stock which they divided equally between them . The purpose of this company , Mr. Johnson testified , was to provide surety bonds for banks which , without them , would have suffered withdrawals of public funds . As his part in starting the surety company on its way , Mr. Johnson testified , A. W. Mellon put up giltedged bonds to the amount of about $165,000 , which were taken from his personal account and entered on the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ultimately , the government will seek later to show , another $5,000 , - 000 found its way from the joint account to the surety company books . The government lawyer asked if it was not true that the law required that banks used as depositories for public funds be bonded , 1 " and that in the time of which we are speaking it was impossible to get those surety bonds . " Mr. Johnson said he understood that to have been the case , but asserted that he could not answer when Mr. Jackson asked him if the purpose of Melbank Surety Company was not to place the facilities of an insurance company at the disposal of the Mellon-owned banks and thus give them an advantage in the competition for deposits of public moneys . " Other banks which did not have the benefit of the Mellons ' insurance company did lose those deposits and did fail , did n't they ? " demanded Mr. Jackson . " Banks were failing all over the United States , Mr. Jackson , " the Iwitness answered softly . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Melbank Company was interested ? " asked Mr. Jackson . " I do n't recall any , " replied the witness . It was the next question asked by Mr. Jackson which brought the objection from Mr. Hogan , the government attorney asking : " And on each of these bank stocks held by Melbank , in the event of failure there was a liability to assessment , was there not ? " Attorney Defends Question . To Mr. Hogan 's objection that the question was entirely irrelevant , Mr. Jackson replied : " Why , if Your Honor please , it has everything in the world to do with it . Here is the Coalesced Company , in which they would I have or did have no interest but domination . " Here is its subsidiary , the Smithfield Company , interested in the bank stocks formerly owned by Andrew W. Mellon , " Here is the Melbank operating those banks . " And who comes to the aid of those institutions ? A. W , Mellon and R. B. Mellon personally , showing , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen in these securities , just exactly as though they never had been transferred . " Mr. Jackson went on to say that he challenged the " accuracy " of Mr. Johnson 's statement that vast borrowings were made to protect certain banks , the names of which were kept off the record by agreement on both aides . The truth of the matter , Mr. Jackson asserted , was that whatever borrowings were made were to protect the Mellons ' own interests . General Trend Not Affected . " I am trying to show , " he continued , " that there was no money paid for anything except where it protected the interest of Melbank and precluded the liability to assessment , and having opened the door by this sweeping testimony , as inaccurate as it is sweeping , to the effect that they were engaged in supporting banks in Pittsburgh and vicinity , I have a right to find out just what was done from the same witness who gave that testimony , as bearing on his credibility and the accuracy of his statement . " Mr. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hogan 's objection was directed to the specific question rather than to Mr. Jackson 's general trend . After the noon recess Mr. Jackson resumed his inquiry into the activities of Coalesced and the other companies which the government contends were merely corporate aliases for Mr. Mellon 's interests . The other clash between opposing counsel also occurred at the morning session , soon after Mr. Johnson , with apparent reluctance , produced the fat little book which contained the list of all the securities owned by the former Secretary of the Treasury , whose lawyers say he is worth more than $200,000,000 . ' Morgan List ' Is Brought In . Reading from the report of the internal revenue agent who I investigated Mr. Mellon 's tax return for 1931 , Mr. Jackson asked about ! losses claimed on sales of Standard Brands , Niagara Hudson Light and Power , and United Corporation . " Do you know that these stocks were all purchased from the preferred list of J. P. Morgan ? " de-manded Mr. Jackson , but before the witness answered Mr. Hogan interposed an objection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the certificates for those stocks ever issued in the name of A. W. Mellon ? " was the next question . Mr. Johnson said he did not know . Neither did he know whether the stocks were carried in other names " so as not to disclose A. W. Mellon as their owner . " In June , 1933 , the Senate Banking Committee found that R. B. Mellon had purchased 1,000 shares of Niagara Hudson and 5,000 shares of Standard Brands , but it was not until today that there was any hint that the former Secretary of the Treasury got any stock from the preferred list . Proceeding with the examination of Mr. Johnson , Mr. Jackson asked the witness to read from the little black book the names of all securities owned by Andrew W. Mellon but not registered in his name , together with the names of the nominees . Mr. Johnson looked helplessly at Mr. Hogan , who arose with an objection to " disclosure of all the assets " of his client and other business secrets which could have no bearing on ' the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jackson withdrew the question and said he would return to it by a different route at some later time . The fuse he had lit sputtered and went out , however , for after the noon recess Mr. Johnson testified that all the shares of Aluminum preferred held by Mr. Mellon were in the capitalist 's own name until he gave them to his children . At the opening of the day 's session Mr. Hogan asked and received the court 's permission to withdraw subpoenas issued at his request for Attorney General Cummings and other government officials .
