Twenty miles out from Manhattan on the wooded , hilly North Shore of Long Island , inland from Manhasset , lies a great and famed 225-acre estate , on a road locally called ' ' The Irish Channel " from the origin of several large landowners along it . Behind massive iron gates , looming almost as large as the late Otto Kahn 's huge chateau down near Huntington , stands a rambling , many-chimneyed Tudor house whose four stories and So rooms contain $2,000,000 worth of the world 's greatest paintings , tapestries , porcelains and a large , handsome private chapel . Last week the public learned that next May it may pay admission-for charity-to inspect the house , the wooded walks , the unsurpassed rose gardens of " Inisfada. " home of the late great Roman Catholic Utilities Tycoon , Nicholas Frederic Brady . After the contents of the mansion are sold at auction , " Inisfada " will become the property of the Society of Jesus , to be used as a " house of studies " for young men of that order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Catholic fathers are at home in the drawing rooms of the rich and great , the acquisition of " Inisfada " was almost routine .

S. To them both , their wealth became a means by which to serve their Church . In 1920 a Cardinal , His Eminence Giovanni Bonzano , Apostolic Delegate to the U. S. , dedicated " Inisfada .
