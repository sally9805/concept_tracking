txt Mayor La Guardia and Maurice P. Davidson Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , left New York late last night for Washington , where they have an appointment at noon today with President Roosevelt to discuss utility rates and Federal loam to municipalities . With the Mayor determined to fight any application for increased utility rates here , it was thought likely that he might advance a plan for construction of a municipal power plant to be built through Federal loans . Alderman Elias H. Jacobs introduced a resolution providing for the municipal plant in the Board of Aldermen last October and said last night that the city could produce electricity for 1 cent a kilowatt hour , compared with the 7-cent rate charged by commercial companies . At 10:30 tomorrow morning the Mayor and other members of the United States Conference of Mayors will discuss Federal loans to municipalities with Henry Morgenthau Jr. , Secretary of the Treasury . Mayor La Guardia has urged that Federal money be lent at one-eighth of 1 per cent interest . The Mayor and his party expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out Maltbie . Democratic members of the Board of Aldermen blocked an attempt by Alderman Thomas Curran yesterday to force the removal of Chairman Milo R. Maltbie of the Public Service Commission . Mr. Curran , Republican minority leader of the board , said Chairman Maltbie had destroyed his usefulness by saying weeks ago that the utility companies would be entitled to higher rates as a result of new city taxes . The Democrats made it clear that their attitude reflected no sympathy for Mr. Maltbie . They said they were unwilling to have Governor Lehman placed in the position of acting upon a " request resolution . " The Curran resolution was lost by a vote of 31 to 24 . " This is nothing more than an attempt to put the Governor of this State on the spot , " said Alderman William P. Sullivan . " I have no use for Maltbie and dislike him very much , but I am against all these request resolutions that are given to the press first and then are presented here . We wo n't be stampeded into voting for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Maitbie 's Official conduct , the resolutions said he had placed himself on the side of the utilities ; that he had permitted the New York Edison Company to levy a minimum charge that was --  " a tax upon the entire population levied for the benefit of a private corporation ; " that he had " acted as volunteer counsel for the utilities in practically advising them to start an action for increased rates because of passage of the sales tax ; " and that he had taken the viewpoint of private rather than public interests . Maitbie Silent on Criticism . Mr. Maltbie was silent yesterday on the criticism expressed against him . The Public Service Commission made no decision yesterday on the new schedules filed by utilities that seek an " adjustment " of $14 , - 000,000 in their rates . The commission will continue its study of the applications today . Unless the commission acts within two weeks the rates go into effect thirty days from last Saturday , the date when they were filed . Utility consumers got their first taste of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city sales tax of 2 per cent figured from Dec. 10 last . As an example , a bill rendered for the month ending on Dec. 12 in the amount of $7.20 carried a tax of 2 cents . The full tax for a month would be 15 cents , and the 2-cent tax was reached by dividing 15 cents by one-tenth of a month . The tax was thus one cent and a half , which was figured as 2 cents by the Edison Company . Each bill carries a notation that the sales tax is for relief purposes . The city could save $250,000 a year on its street lighting costs if it would agree to forego nightly inspections and consent to the use of a longer-lived lamp , the Consolidated Gas Company said yesterday in a letter to Maurice P. Davidson , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity . Mr. Davidson threw out bids for street lighting on Monday on the ground that they were excessive . Explaining the addition of an item covering new taxes with their bids , the companies said they considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds to a separate tax reserve . This would make refunds to consumers easy if the taxes should be invalidated , the letter said . The Utility Consumers League and other Bronx organizations asked the Public Service Commission yesterday to inform them of the dates of hearings on applications for increased utility rates .
