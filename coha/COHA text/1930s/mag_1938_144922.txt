" The Bing " or " Klondike " is what convicts in Philadelphia 's County Prison at suburban Holmesburg , Pa. call it : a narrow , thick-walled little brick cell block where fractious inmates are put for " treatment . " It holds nine cells , each 8 ft. long , 4 ft. wide , 10 ft. high . In each cell are a small sink with one spigot , a " hopper " ( toilet ) and six bolts in the wall for cots . Walls &; floor are rough concrete , doors sheet steel , with small ventilating holes at the bottom . Three windows and several small roof outlets comprise the ventilation of the building . Across a two-foot corridor from the cells the wall is lined with steal radiators , which can provide several times the amount of radiation necessary to warm such a small building in winter . <P> One day last fortnight , after 650 of the prison 's 1,414 prisoners had yammered , clamored and " hunger-struck " against the prison food and discipline , six ringleaders were thrust into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after that another six were thrust in , so that the men were jammed in two and three to a cell . Someone shut the windows . Someone turned off the water from the spigots . Someone turned on the steam heat . <P> " The Klondike 's " temperature rose to more than 150 F. in the " treatment cells , bedlam raged . Tearing their clothes off , gasping for breath , the tortured men roared and screamed for hours . When guards came with breakfast the third day , they found 21 of the prisoners unconscious , four ( two in each of two cells ) dead on the floor-bruised , gouged , discolored , parboiled . <P> Despite officious interference from Philadelphia 's jowly Mayor Samuel Davis Wilson , whose homicide squad reported " nothing suspicious " in the deaths , scythe-nose Coroner Charles H. Hersch took charge . His investigators compared " The Klondike " with the Black Hole of Calcutta. -* The scene they reconstructed was as horrid as anything ever written in the dingy annals of U. S. prisons : Stifled , maddened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get water from the " hoppers , " air through the tiny ventilating holes . They had stuffed clothing into the " hoppers " to flood the floors , lain down in the water , which got so hot it scalded them . If they touched the metal doors , their naked bodies were scorched . The dead men 's feet were puffed , their flesh dehydrated until it turned to powder . <P> Warden William ( " Bill " ) Mills , one-time footballer for Temple University , onetime superintendent ( 1920-33 ) of Philadelphia 's none too savory police force , denied all knowledge of how it could have happened . He declared he had been out for a jog in the woods the morning the bodies were found , could not have been more surprised . He shut himself up in his house and tried to wash his hands of the whole horrid affair . Two guards-Alfred Brough and Francis Smith-were held on homicide charges by the Coroner , who promised eight arrests of guards and " higher-ups " after the inquest this week . <P>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
