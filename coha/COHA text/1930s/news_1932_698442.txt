txt Alfred E. Smith asked the Democrats of Massachusetts tonight to join in a united endeavor to restore their party to power in the nation by abandoning their traditional custom of finding fault with the Republican party and launching a constructive program of their own . If he plans to be a candidate for the party 's nomination for President he took pains to conceal his intentions from the capacity audience of 2,000 to which he spoke in the ballroom of the Hotel Statler . To an assembly vibrant with enthusiasm for him and the cause he represented in 1928 , he made no mention of candidacies or specific issues . The route he recommended for success in the election would-be an open declaration in the party platform for resubmission of the prohibition issue to the several States , advocacy of a gigantic Federal bond issue for the expansion and improvement of public works and a consolidation of the forces of the party throughout the nation on an all-the-year working basis . He condemned the party for its past vacillation in taking an extended vacation of three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timidity on the subject of prohibition . Told He Would Be Nominated . In spite of his complete silence in relation to his future plans , it was learned that the 1928 standard bearer will not make any objection to the use of his name in State Presidential primaries throuzhout the country . The prediction was freely made tonight that his name will be used in the Massachusetts Presidential 1 primary next Spring . When this suggestion was placed before him he refused to discuss it . An indication of this feeling was seen when Daniel A. Gallagher , for , mer United States Attroney , obtaining permission from the chairman i to speak after Mr. Smith had ended his address , astounded the gathering Ilwith the blunt declaration that the Democratic party would draft the New Yorker as its Presidential candidate . Apparently without pre-arrangement , Mr. Gallagher climbed upon a chair in front of Mr. Smith , and in a voice audible to all in the hushed auditorium , shouted : " It has been said here tonight that we should not ask you what your plans are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the party is going to draft you . Do n't throw away that brown derby . You 'll need it again and it wo n't look bad at all when you hang it up down in Washington . " Amid tremendous applause Mr. Smith arose , bowed and then joined in the ilandclapping , but he made no reply . Speeches were also made by Governor Ely , Mayor Curley , John F. Fitzgerald , Mrs. Jessie Woodrow Sayre , Representative William N. Rogers of New Hampshire , Leopold M. Goulston , chairman of the victory dinner , and General Charles H. Cole . Makes Plea for Wet Stand . " Now is the time when the Democrats must come forward with a clean-cut , straightforward and honest declaration of its party principles , " Mr. Smith said . ' In the past the party platform has been 90 per cent devoted to fault finding . " We condemn this and we condemn that . We do n't have to do that this year . Let us get away from our past evasion and do something constructive . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a frank , open and honest declaration about what we intend to do on prohibition . The country is looking to us for relief . The President is not in accord with the recommendations of his own commission and he does not propose to do anything . " " Ducking , dodging and doubledealing " should be abandoned and an honest attempt made to resubmit prohibition to the voters . Tax revenues formerly collected from the sale of distilled liquors were now sorely needed to aid in the country 's finances . The tariff produced no votes and the practice of condemning Republican tariff measures should be abandoned . He would substitute a. clearly written party doctrine on the tariff and take it to the voters . Relief for the unemployed could be found in the Federal bond issue , he suggested , The country Is not on a peace time basis . A state of war existed against unemployment , malnutrition , misery and , suffering . " We gave the credit of the country freely for the destruction of property and of life . Let us now employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures that will aid the American people in their struggle to keep the wolf from the door . " " Give us leadership , " was the climax of his plea . In the earlier addressee every mention . of the former Governor ' , name recetved generous aIngeUseg Hie introduction and the climax of his speech produced ovations . Telegrams were read from Newton D. Baker , Governor Roosevelt and Governor Ritchie . Each was generously received , long applause following the reading of the Roosevelt message . Welcomed as Favorite Son . That Al Smith is still the favorite son of Massachusetts Democrats was demonstrated by the welcome given him at every turn following his arrival here this afternoon , Thirty-six policemen , two sergeants and a group of plainclothes men were none too many to handle the enthusiastic throngs which blocked . his pathway from the railroad station to the automobile of Governor Ely , who headed the welcoming delegation . Mayor Curley , who is an ardent supporter of the Roosevelt Presidential boom , was ' ? not in the official greeting party , which included , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Attorney ; William F. Foley , General Charles H. Cole , Leopold M. Goulston , Adjt . Gen. John H. Agnew and Representative Leo M. Birmingham . Before the dinner Mr. Smith told reporters he would have nothing to say while here in relation to the possibility of his candidacy for the Presidential nomination . " If the Democrats , " he said , " take advantage of their opportunity in the next election they can not lose the Presidency . I 'll give you the old wheeze that what the country needs most of all is another ex-President . The best way to accomplish that end I shall enunciate tonight . Beyond that , do not press me for details . " The Brown Derby Missing . Discarding his custom of other years , he wore a black derby . Asked to explain why he was not wearing the famous brown derby , he queried : " Do n't you think I 've got two hats ? I wore the black one because I never gave the brown derby a thought . " Then , as he mused over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have worn the brown one . " He denied that he would engage in any political conferences . " I 'm here for the victory campaign drive and for no other reason , " he explained . " Tomorrow I have two objectives . I intwid to pay a visit to Mrs. Daniel Lynch , an old Albany friend who is in the Massachusetts General Hospital for treatment , and I shall visit Frank Donahue , your National Committeeman , at the hospital where be is confined . I hope he 'll get well quick . The party needs his services . " He said ' he would not consider returning to New York tonight because of the unseasonable heat . He plans to leave Boston at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon . The eft Governor 's train was met by a group of 200 at New London and he went to the platform , shook hands with some pf his admirers and received a bouquet from a girl of 9 . A crowd of 300 gathered when the train stopped at Providence . Former Senator Peter G. Gerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were among the leaders who I had a brief chat with Mr. Smith . Cheers followed him as he departed .
