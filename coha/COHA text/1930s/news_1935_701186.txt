txt Industrial leaders on the Business Advisory and Planning Council of the Department of Commerce rallied to the support of President Roosevelt 's program this afternoon within a few hours after the convention of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States had ridden rough-shod over it . The Advisory Council did not figure on the President 's appointment list issued at 10 A. M. , but when the trend of the chamber 's convention became apparent , council members met to reassure the President personally of their support of his program , Henry I. Harriman , retiring president of the chamber ; Gerard Swope , Winthrop W. Aldrich , James H. Rand and a score of other business and industrial leaders visited the White House , in company with Secretary Roper , to present to the President two reports . One report approved in a general way the social security program condemned this morning in a chamber resolution , and the other , contrary to the chamber 's action , recommended a two-year extension of the National Recovery Administration in modified form . Report Sent to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent by the President to Secretary Perkins without being made public , The report advocating extension of the NRA consisted of two resolutions previously adopted by the council and reaffirmed at the White House today . The report was given out at the White House after members of the council , with the exception of H. P. Kendall , chairman of the executive committee of the council , had said good-bye to the President . Other members of the council who attended the meeting at the White House included the following : W. A. Harriman , E. T. Stannard , F. B. Davis Jr. , James D. Francis , Delancey Kountze , Morris D. Leeds , Robert L. Lund , Sidney J. Weinberg , Charles A. Cannon , R. R. Deupree , Gano Dunn , R. G. Elbert , Lincoln Filene , A. P. Greensfelder , Lew Hahn , Henry H. Heimann , William A. Julian and George H. Mead . Mr. Kendall , who acted as spokesman for the council , made a brief , statement , as follows : " The committee submitted certain reports to the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here to uphold his hand in the fight against depression . Certain of our members are also members of the United States Chamber of Commerce , but we are not spokesmen of the chamber or of any other organization . " Memorandum on the NRA . The council 's memorandum on the NRA given to the President was made public at the White House as follows : The Business Advisory Council today reaffirmed the resolution passed by it on March 13 , 1935 , recommending the continuance of NIRA with the necessary changes outlined in that resolution , as an emergency measure , for a further trial period of two years . The Business Advisory Council believes that any briefer extension with changes less adequate than those outlined in the resoJution will lead to a period of non-compliance , uncertainty and confusion . The resolution follows : " The National Industrial Recovery Act has not been in effect long enough to demonstrate whether or not it will be effective for its purpose . Its accomplishments in connection with child labor , maximum hours , minimum wages and collective bargaining are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about by its continuance for a further period of two years , rather than the enactment of different and alternate legislation . " It is recommended , therefore , that Federal legislation on these subjects during the present session of Congress should be limited to the extension of the present act along lines suggested in the resolution approved by this Council on January 17 , 1935 , copy of which is attached , for a further trial period of two years . Such legislation as the Black 30-hour Bill ( S 87 ) , the Wagner Labor Disputes Bill ( S 1958 ) , and the Connery Equal Representation Bill , ( HR 4884 ) , should not be enacted . " For Two-Year Extension . Attached to this report was that of January 17 , which read : REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY ACT . We recommend that the act be continued as an emergency measure for a further trial period of two years with the following modifications : NEGOTIATION OF CODES . It should be made clear that the approval of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutual agreement between the industry and the President , the primary responsibility for formulating and presenting a code to rest with the industry . The President should have the power to withhold such a code unless he is satisfied that its provisions are in the public interest . On the other hand , he should have no power to impose fair trade practice provisions against the wishes of an industry , with the exception of those of Section 7 . Industry should have the right , by petition of a trade association or group truly representative , to withdraw from any code provisions which it may have voluntarily accepted . Provision should be made to permit codified industries to continue under agreements and codes approved under NIRA if the industry so desires . The President should have the right to cancel outright an entire code where it appears that provisions of such code are working to the detriment of the public interest , but he should have no authority to modify existing codes without the consent of the industry . Section 3d of the present act , which empowers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE LABOR PROVISIONS . All codes should contain provisions against child labor and should provide for minimum wages and maximum hours , either to be negotiated under Section 7b or imposed by the President under Section 7c . Under the authority of Section 7 the President should impose codes only if he finds that conditions in a particular industry make such imposition desirable in the public interest . In the formulation of such imposed codes , the setting of wages and hour provisions should be for the protection of labor and industry against unsocial practices . PENALTIES . The act should be written as involving civil rather than criminal liabilities . Violations of code provisions should preferably receive injunctive relief only . Criminal proceedings should be confined only to those offenders who knowingly falsify statistical data or statements with intent to mislead the government . While the report on the social security program was not made public , the tenor of its contents was indicated by Secretary Roper .                  @ @ @
