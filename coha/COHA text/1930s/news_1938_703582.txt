Spread between figures for correspondint , months of 1938 and 1937 has been narrowing rapidly in most cases since the latter part of June , with many lines for the two years converging and due to meet some time in November . Continuation of the present trend throughout the fourth quarter would lift business generally to considerably above the 1937 level by the year-end and approaching corresponding figures for 1936. 1937 Comparisons Spread between the figures for last year and this is being squeezed not only by current and prospective gains but by the precipitate decline of the indices in the last three or four months of 1937 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country .

It is hardly reasonable to expect continued acceleration at this pace , but a rise in the next two months to the November , 1937 , figure of 86.5 is certainly within the bounds of possibility and a. somewhat slower gain to the December , 1937 , figure of 85.8 in the next three months is even . more likely .
