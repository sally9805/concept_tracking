The new Benito Mussolini , the Duce who has mastered Italian politics so thoroughly that his main interest now lies in turning the state into a business run efficiently by businessmen , pushed preparations last week to cut out what he has come to think of as Italy 's political appendix , the Chamber of Deputies . <P> Whanging a big dinner bell , the Premier rang to order in Rome the National Council of Corporations , destined , most Italians assume , to supplant the Chamber . In Italy corporazioni ( " corporations " ) are the higher groups which represent the basic Fascist syndicates of employers and employes . Every Italian , whatever his business , trade or profession , is represented by and must pay dues to the local syndicate of his occupation . He need not belong to the syndicate but he is bound by the bargains it makes respecting his wages and working hours or-if he is an employer-respecting the wages he must pay and the terms on which he must hire help ( as are U. S. industrialists whether or not they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Italian law , punished by heavy jail sentences on the theory that syndicates , like gentlemen , can and should adjust their differences without strife . <P> In adjusting differences and planning progress representatives of employer and employe syndicates which are organized in local and national federations sit with representatives of the state in the corporazioni which in turn are represented in the National Council of Corporations rung to order last week by Minister of Corporations Benito Mussolini with his dinner bell . <P> Promptly up popped that fiery Roman Syndicalist President Arturo di Marsanich of the National Confederation of Fascist Syndicates of Commerce . While Il Duce sat expressionless as stone , Signor Marsanich cried : " There is only one logical consequence of Fascist corporative policy : the Council of Corporations should absorb the Chamber of Deputies and become the sole legislative assembly . . . . Italy will then have an assembly of men qualified to legislate on economic matters as well as those qualified to legislate in the fields of ethics and politics !

Il Duce encouraged all to spout their ideas , only ringing his bell when the clamor grew too great . ' ' This meeting , " said one of the Dictator 's aides , " is the first of a series at which will be worked out the final economic organization of the Corporative State . " <P> What this finality will mean to Italy , Signor Marsanich ( who seemed to be sending up trial balloons last week for Premier Mussolini ) stated thus : " In industry the corporations will have to assume economic functions-even to taking the place of private initiative and writing finis to the capitalistic regime as now conceived-creating the best conditions and the most work possible . . . . It is not necessary to confuse private initiative with private ownership ! Private property can not and should not be abolished ! But in the great industries . . . I regard the corporazione as the organ which will control . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
