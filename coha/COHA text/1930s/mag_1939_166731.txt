In a headline huff , Lewis Douglas walked out on the job of director of the Budget when he decided that the New Deal would be no economy administration . That was in August 1934 . Franklin Roosevelt , who perhaps did not care for another such troublesome officer , did not bother to refill the post . So Daniel W. Bell , a pudgy , self-effacing Treasury careerist , became Acting Budget Director and remained so until last week when his successor was named . <P> Danny Bell 's stepping down will mean just one thing : he still thinks of himself as the graduate of the Gem City Business College ( Quincy , Ill. ) who came to Washington , aged 20 , and went to work in the Treasury in 1911 ; he wants to keep his civil-service status ; he 's content with $10,000 a year as assistant to Secretary Morgenthau ; he does n't want the fleeting glory of being director of the Budget ; he just wants to keep on working for the Government after another Administration comes in . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Dewey Smith , budget director for the Little New Deal in Michigan of Attorney General Frank Murphy , who recommended Mr. Smith as a man " of great personal integrity , very able and very sound . " Born in 1898 and middlenamed for the hero of Manila Bay , patriotic Harold Dewey Smith served in both Army and Navy , worked with the University of Chicago 's reforming Professor Charles Edward Merriam before joining the Murphy brain trust . When he is not working with figures , he plays hard at riding and bowling , likes to practice barbering on his three children , aged 3 to 9 . <P> Newshawks asked new Director Smith one thing &; another about Federal financing . " The Budget Director , " said the Budget Director , " does not make policy-and should not be popping off . "
