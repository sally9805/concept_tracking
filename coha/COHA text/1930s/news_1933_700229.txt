txt The question whether the Irish Free State is to be in or out of the British Commonwealth of Nations is once more raised in acute form as the result of a statement made in the House of Commons'here yesterday by Mr. J. H. Thomas . Secretary for Dominion Affairs , and the midnight reply from Dublin by Mr. Eamon de Valera , President of the Free State 's Executive Council . The issue arose from a question by Mr. P. J. H. Hannon , Member of Parliament , as to the position of the British Government regarding passage of a bill through the Irish Parliament denying Free State citizens the- right of appeal to the Privy Council at London . Mr. Thomas replied that it was looked upon as " a further repudiation of the obligation entered into by the Irish Free State " under the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 . The Dominions Secretary added : " Ty its own actions the Free State is tending to lose " advantages conferred upon it by membership in the British Commonwealth of Nations , namely " the privileges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Empire and the opportunity of powerful influence in international affairs in concert with other members of the Commonwealth in the cause of world peace . " Loose Association Oppoaed Mr. Thomas reiterated that formation of an Irish republic " with some form Of association with the British Commonwealth in some circumstances and for some reason and recognition of the King as head of the association " would be " totally unacceptable " to the British Government . Mr. de Valera 's answer within the space of a few hours was to ask the British Government to say definitely that " the declaration of a republic would not be made the excuse for aggressive hostility . " " Will the British Government say , " he went on , " that their form of government  --  republic or monarchy  --  is a matter exclusively for the Irish people to decide ; that the British Government will not quarrel with them over their choice , whatever it may be , but that the Irish people will understand that if they choose a republic , they can not be a member ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advantages ? " Consequences of Separation It is not considered likely here that the British Government will accept Mr. de Valera 's invitation . There is no indication of any intention to use military force to compel the Free State to remain in the Commonwealth . At the same time the British Government is now prepared ' to make it easy for the Free State to get out . Moreover it is thought quite possible that Mr. de Valera might regard as " aggressive hostility " the normal consequences of separation , such , for instance , as kiss of citizenship  --  and perhaps jobs  --  by Irish residents in British territory where there are scarcely fewer Irishmen than in the Emerald Isle itself . In the British view , therefore , it is for the Free State to make the , hrst move since after all it is the Free State which seeks to change the status quo , whereas Britain is anx ( sliest , Science Monitor Bureau icus to maintain  --  or rather to re-s tore-r-it . A frank request from Mr , de Valera to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a ready response . Will Abide by Results In a statement yesterday Mr. de Valera said he had no doubt what the answer of the Irish people would be if the choice of a Republic or membership in the British Commonwealth should be put unequivocally before them . In any case , he added , " I am prepared to abide loyally by the result . " I know it is the desire of the Irish people to live in terms of friendship with their neighbors , and in matters of common concern to cooperate with their neighbors , " he said . Here in London , however , there is less certainty as to the result of such plebiscite . The United Ireland Party . which is . uncompromisingly opposed to Mr. de Valera and is prepared to accept membership in the Common-'Wealth as " good business , " is believed to have made . considerable headway the past few months . And with every day that passes it is believed opposition to  --  Mr. de Valera is likely to increase in intensity .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
