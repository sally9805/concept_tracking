the seals and birds and shy Virginia foxes , and from down the beach where Ovide took pistol postures and pot shots at the baby seals sunning on the coral . A toy Tonquin lay awaiting us , far out . We must be back aboard her in a few more hours . The last water kegs would go out to her in the whaleboat . Ours , three quarters up the pebbles and tipsy in the sunlight , was the smallboat . From here I could see the chill mess of shot-torn , dead birds which the hunters had brought in last night and mounded between the thwarts , and the parade of scolding penguins in the radius of their stench . A few more hours , then . I had already struck our tent . I could sit idle or read . . . though my book stayed shut , forgotten ... and pleasure myself with the novelty of solid rock and homely grass under my heels and haunches , of my fingers in the sand , of solitude and grateful thoughtlessnessin the bleak , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must do . I had promised myself to do it before we 'd row away . I had borrowed a jackknife from the ship 's store yesterday to do it with . Between the old whalebone hut and the sea two graves were wasting : there was a driftwood cross toppled over the head of one of them , and I could make out the letters FRAN  --  for Frank , perhaps , for Francois ?  --  wind-rubbed , erased by many years ' spray and flying sand . Over both graves the salt had formed stiff ripples , and in the raw groove between them penguins hatched and squabbled over an old pair of sealskin moccasins . I cut a second cross out of barrel-wood , tied stave on stave with a string of water weed , and set the first straight again with the letters newly scratched into its arms . FRAN  --  and that was all I could do , the best I could do , for either of them . Who had they been , of what ship , what land , what time ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cortege ofP101funeral-coated penguins . . . of hunger or murder or in the glittering , thundering surf ? . . . Four letters of an uncertainname was the fullness of the history they had left behind . All else belonged to the wind . " What are you doing there ? " It was Perrault , ' come upon me from around the hut . I held up my book . I did not want her to know what a maudlin thing I had really been engaged on . . . and then , too , I did not want her to see the dead . Instinctively , I could not have explained why , but such young , gamingayeyes as hers were not to be darkened . . . and then of course I was immediately cranky with myself and her for this necessity to shield her . " Reading , " I said . " Oh . What are you reading ? " " The AEneid . " " The ? , , " Virgil 's AEneid . " She was unenlightened . " Oh , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she smiled and looked far down the beach as she said it , as though she knew he 'd soon come marching hither who would show us how little wisdom counts in women 's eyes . I stood up and started with her down the beach to meet him . She trotted to keep pace with my long legs . She would not slow us up for all the world . At the far tip of the long white scythe of sand Ovide was firing out at the seal rock . He had not seen us yet . " Aeneas was another famous wanderer , like you and me , " I said . " He adventured everywhere , over the water " " He was tall ? " " Oh , undoubtedly . " " And brave ? "  | " Very " " And --  --  " " And handsome , too , of course . " " Of course .

" Mother penguins flapped stumpy wings and gossiped indignantly about us as we passed their nests in the rugged grass ; and where the waves flattened to leaf-thin spume upon the beach the larger king penguins waded behind us , waddling , upbraiding , prodding us with their strong bills , a company of constables in court dress arrayed against these two strange , pink-faced trespassers on their field of stranded fish-bones and the small , scuttling things of the salt and rocks and sand . " This EEn  --  pronounce him for me , Lewis . " I pronounced him . " He . . . had his ladies ? " " Certainly . All brave men have . " " Yes , certainly . " A rich color , freer than a flush , glowed under her sea tan . It could have been no natural modesty which made her hesitate : " But . . . he loved them .. . faithfully ? He " Was an adventurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . " She jogged along with her little fists lost in the tarry pockets of her overalls . Her eyes stayed fast on the far curve of the beach . She stumbled over a gray tussock , paid no heed to a penguin 's lecture and sharp nip . " Then , I suppose . . . he was always wandering away ? Yes ? " " Always . That was his fate . " " His fate ? It had to be ? " She added something in a slipshod , impetuous language of her own . Neapolitan , Ip103guessed . There was an operatic gibberish she always used when English proved too cool . Then : " You mean , he could not help it when he grew . . . tired of them , and was .. . and went away ? " I had no clue to the kindliest answer , so I made none . Our scrunching heels took up the pause , and her too large boy 's clothes flapped noisily . They made her look more slight than ever . From the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts of musket fire . The doughty hunters must be bagging their last prey . I looked away to the Tonquin . The whaleboat had reached her a quarter hour ago , and the kegs were probably all hoisted . We 'd best be rowing out to her soon . " See ! " Sure enough , from the ship 's side a ball of white cotton shot suddenly and spread into the wind . We did not hear the sound of it until a second later , and then only distantly , and I wondered whether the partners could have heard it at all against the breeze and the strong surf on their side . " The signal , " I said . " Let 's go find the gentlemen . They may reward us with a musket ball , but there 'd be the devil to pay if they kept the captain .... " " Ah , wait . " She did not turn about , but stopped short , and I saw how she gauged her lover 's leisurely approach . Ile must notice us by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , now I remember your IEneas . And Dido , that was her name . She was a large , fat prima donna , and the maestro 's mistress , and she died on a flame-colored couch , surrounded by cunning steam pots , in a beautiful new white satin gown of the directoire style which showed her breasts as full as Roman wine skins . " " What in the name of " The opera , silly , the opera I sang in . All about Queen Dido and your brave but bored IEneas . I was only the queen 's confidante , but I had a lovely song to sing , and a beautiful new gown , too . . . well , almost new , but not satin , of course , or so . . . so directoire . " " Whose opera ? " " What do you mean , whose ? A famous opera . The tenor " " Who composed it ? " She shrugged her young shoulders . " I shall sing you things from it some time . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , in Vienna , it must have been in Vienna , because I remember the little margrave with such an embonpoint who gave me a gold bracelet which I . . " She held up her narrow wrist , so close to me that I could not help but see the exquisite monogram of blue lines under its tan , and how they seemed to throb . . . . " While in Venice the maestro himself was my adorer and would certainly have let no one but me sing the prima donna 's part . But , oh , no , it was never a question of my voice , you know . " Why did she laugh so excitedly ? Ovide was within fifty feet of us now . I echoed her . " Yes , I know , " I told the penguins and the baby seals and the climbing white sails of the distant Tonquin . " I know . " " It was only that I was so young , and in Vienna they prefer their primedonne to be grandmammas with full wine skins for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me halt with her . Her dark boy 's head was thrown well back , and my eyes strove to avoid the enigmatic merriment of hers and the youth of her throat and shoulder when she tore her collar open . " See for yourself , good Lewis . I could never be such a fat Dido , could I , Lewis ? " She pulled the loose blouse top wide apart with a pretty shrillness . " See , I " Ovide was upon us , between us , with his next swiftp105stride . He grabbed her hands and bent them back upon her throat , closing the shabby blouse they had been opening , quilting her saucy flesh with his bright , unbraided hair . Angry , he laughed at her . Sulky , he held her so pressed to him that he could not see the triumph which flooded her upraised face . Her vulgar little trick had worked . He held her wholly off the ground . " Bien , " he said , " but you must not corrupt our old stork . He is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " And , laughing , they loved . And laughed more than ever when he set her down and they saw how the bird which was dangling at his belt had left a sticky bloodstain on her shirt , a mark which soaked and stayed tenacious to her heart . So they stood a moment and forgot me and all else . Now I could turn away . Awkwardly away , unnoticed . The ragged sound of a second gun from the far-off Tonquin . Her sails were up and filled , and she was moving out before the wind . Moving , leaving us . I could not realize with the first instant what it meant . My shout came out of sheer dismay . It made a futile dissonancewith her shout , and his , and with the shouts which blew down to us from the bleak hill above the beach where the partners were returning , puffing , grwsly laden with carcasses and vainglory , from their regal sport . We ran . We all met at the small-boat . The lovers and I had run without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two wind-bare , salt-white mounds and the two poor crosses . We rowed for three and a half hours . Blistering , heartbreakinghours , with the treeless island soon out of sight behind us , and the Tonquin calmly widening the waves between us in the fore . " I 'll never forgive the villain , " gasped the scarlet " You 'll never have a chance to , " sobbed sweaty Davie Stuart . They might have saved their breath for the oars . They spent it on ridiculous shouts , threats , commands to the far-off ship to stop and put about for us , prayers for some miracle to strike that wretch dead before he could wreak his diabolical malice and leave us stranded on those dead rocks astern . They made fat , useless rowers . They doubled their bellies noisily and almost upset us in the gray swells beyond the surf . Ovide and I swung away without words . If we could not reach the Tonquin , we could at least keep within sight of her a little while . They would see us aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damn them , how contritely ... . Perrault crouched between the thwarts , parceled with muskets and a canvas roll and as many of the hunters ' birds as they 'd insisted we must bring back to prove their zeal and diplomatic generosity . The small-boat was only twenty feet of keel , but they 'd insisted . We 'd never have gotten them into the boat if we had not agreed to the seal , too . They 'd been all for standing and shivering boot-deep in the surf and bawling gory nonsense at the Tonquin 's dwindling poop for hours and hours . That rascal Thorn had planned it to keep us eating salt beef instead of fresh duck , that was it , that was all ... and could n't abide the idea that they 'd captured the first fine sealskin . . . and they 'd nie come along with us a-chasin ' o ' him without we 'd agree and take the seal . So there it sat in the stern , an absurdly propped carcass , with its flappers at rest above the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snouty head andp107mustaches cocked away : it had just the look of a plump old gentleman at a banquet 's end , his best white waistcoat dribbled with port wine . And there it stayed until we were out of the spume , away from the ledges and grunting through deep water . Then , rowing closest to the load , Ovide swung his oar in a circle clear of Perrault , caught the old corpse a crunching smack and toppled it into the sea . The lightened stern leaped and spun away to the next wave . The precious partners bellowed . Perrault laughed . . . and adored . Behind us , in a gray-green marble trough , the old seal tipped slowly , slept with its flappers at peace and its mustaches up and bright , while under it , each oar stroke away from it , an oily red wadding spread upon the sea and signaled the gulls screaming from the sky . It was better rowing now , almost decent headway . The wind was with us , even if it was with the Tonquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waist , and his wet back 's muscles threw sleek , playful loops up to the level of my eyes as I rowed behind him . This was heroic of him . Everything he did with his body he did so well , so rejoicing . Over the white leapfrog of the bunched strength of his shoulders I watched little Perrault watching him , too . There were times when even the partners kept still , when the sense of a tiny boat sick-keeled and slithering in such an irreconcilable sea , on such an extravagant chase , silenced The M'Dougall 's Biblical lamentations and all lie elder Stuart 's Athabascan wrath . Towards evening the Tonquin sailed out of sight , and there was neither ship nor land riding on the slow gallop of the black , sunsaddledwaves . Night would come , and cold and terror . It was Perrault who first saw the Tonquin when she turned and came back into the wind to pick us up . Then the partners saw her and broke loose again into both sacredp108and profane rage . They were safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and their raw palms and splinterladenseats and simmering cheeks .. . We boarded a sour , glum ship , greeted of none , none reaching across the rail to help us up , to explain , even to scold us . Things were evidently grown too hostile for any further bawling . A sailor hustled me down at once into the captain 's stateroom . He sat there , a burly shadow , mounted on the shine of the long twilight and the shine of stiff horsehair of his couch . He took his time surveying me . " Back aboard , aye , Lewis ? " " Yes , sir . " " All o ' ye ? " " Yes , sir . " " Y 've pen ' n ' inkwell ? " " Why , no , sir , I 'm only just . . . I 'm to get some , sir ? " " Get some , man , get some . ' N ' the notes f'r my letter to Mr. Astor .

' N ' how , by God , I certainly expected to leave ' em there f'r good riddance ' n ' f'rever . " " Did you , sir ? " " I did indeed . " He did indeed . And the cream of his jest was this , though he brought not the dimmest smile to it : that one of the persons he had certainly expected to leave there , thousands of miles from bearable life on a dreary , birdspatteredrock , would have to stand respectfully before him now taking notes on the malicious righteousness of his intentions . I could have thrown the inkwell in his face , as Luther had done to the Devil . But this one was not yet a full/grown devil . He suffered . . . from humorlessness , from dogged loyalty and righteous indignation he suffered , and was only neat and dutiful and irascibly small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' December eleventh , ' n ' I 'm obliged to report to Mr. Astor ' t one o ' the passengers , Mr. Robert Stuart , objectin ' to the departure o ' the Tonquin without awaitin ' f'r his uncle , Mr. Stuart , had the mutinous impudence to pull a pistol from his frock coat ' n ' place it at the captain 's head , sayin ' he 'd blow his , the captain 's , head . . . aye , my head , the son of a buggerly bo'sun , he 'd blow my head off if I failed to turn around ' n ' stand toward the small-boat ' n ' pick the party up again . " " Oh , sir , so it ' " So it was . High seas mutiny , ' n ' that 's what it was . I want Mr. Astor to know it all , to be warned o ' the worst of ' em . . . .

Here , what 's the matter with y'r hand , Lewis ? " " Sir ? " " Y'r hand , man . Y ' ca n't write properly with a lump o ' skinned meat like that . " " I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm not used to such rowing races . I pulled all afternoon . " " So you did . Aye . . . . Let me see it . " I put down notes and prettifying instruments and held out both my hands . They were swollen out of their usual boniness , hot and aching , running with the stuff of many red raws . I thought he could not see the painfulness of them through this shiny dusk . He said nothing . But at length he twitched himself higher on his couch , and a curious chuckle rattled around his little stateroom 's walls , a sound so pitilessly enthusiastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his strict , wind-planed face . He had not been the least bit sorry for me . He had forgotten for once to tell me to be careful not to spill an ink blot on his polished wood when he 'd seen the red soreness of my split knuckle pads . He had actually liked the sight of my smashed blisters . Maybe the Devil was in him after all . Overtired , I lay awake interminably that night . My hands were on fire under their grease and rags , and my head swung and bobbed in comic , loose fashion , in rhythmlessanswer to the mustaches and small , snouty head of a blood-dribbled seal at which the captain chuckled , hoarsely , humorlessly chuckled . And out of the heaving marble of the waves floated such trivial theorems as this : the presence of Ovide in his hammock next mine throughoutall the night , asleep like an indifferent baby and never once waking to go on tiptoe down the cabin darkness to the chart closet and the adoring little slut who waited there . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partners quarreled about his cure . Our salt fare and stinginess of water got the blame . It would be quite two months before we 'd drop anchor again in Owhyhee . The Patagonian coast was so much nearer . Why could n't we make . . . it was landsmen 's fear of sickness and no frivolous whim for pleasure jaunts or hunting parties , they told me to assure him . . . but we could n't , he growled , ' n ' we would n't , ' n ' t ' hell with ' em . The man with the scurvy grew well again . On the fifteenthwe saw the high mountains of Terra del Fuego . It was lucky we had not had to put in anywhere along this awful shore , I confided to Jeremie and Laframboise inp111the voyageurs ' circle , since Patagonia is all iron deserts and volcanoes and inhabited only by tremendous giants who drink fire from the craters . I was horrified that they believed me . I wanted to shout apologies down the round holes which their open mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for confessing it a fable . Ovide yawned and sulked . High above him in the ropes a quaint doll clung dangerously and watched the brown toss of the coast , the keen wind upon her clothes ; but he did not look up at her until he caught me doing so . " You are very bold . . . at fables , old stork , " he said . " I can tell some , too , but all true ones . That 's the differencebetween . . . romancers . Mine would all be true , of ... well , of war and the woods , and Paris and its beautiful , hospitable women , and women everywhere , all colors and stations , strumpets , comtesses , squaws . But yes , squaws , too . They have their own charms , yes , mes freres ? " He appealed to the voyageurs . He took their assents and grins for granted . They idolized him , and he knew it . Ile was not trying to convince me , only to tease me . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to me . He 'd punish me for my fairy tale . " One time in the Hudson 's Bay country an old chief 's squaw , with blubber and pemmican crumbs all over her mouth . . . she was surprisingly good at it , if you know what I mean , dear Lewis . . . though I 'm afraid you do n't , do you ? " I turned and walked slowly away . He should not see how he had distressed me , or that I heard the general sniggering I left behind . A sailor , Verbel , bumped against me , swore , went on working . The crew took its attitude towards us h%dsmen from the captain . Me ship 's bell told the time . I collected my nerves and came back to the circle.  | Mr. M'Kay was talking now . He so rarely talked . Someone had evidently asked him about the overland expedition , Wilson Price Hunt 's procession to meet us at the Columbia , and the route it was probably taking . He used the deck seams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face over a miniature land . His pipe stem pointed the Missouri , the Platte , the Rocky Mountains house , the Arctic Unjighah , and there were a thousand miles of forest no white man had yet explored , and here was a traverse of the Black Hills , and here the Mandans dwelt , and here the Shiennes fled the Sioux .. . and wherever he showed us an Indian tribe it seemed to me as though his lowered pipe bit lingered an instant and sent a thin wisp of smoke up from the boards . On this river they 'd paddle , Mr. Hunt and his party , and up this one , too , and come on horseback across here , on foot when the horses grew into lamed skeletons or disappeared into some thieving village . . . and here , starving , bewildered , taking to canoes again in the white , desperate snake twists of great rapids .. . I remembered Mr. Hunt 's gentle ways , and the cheery casualness of the " Au ' voir " we had given each other when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring afternoon . And how happy he had been that we should be Christ 's witnesses to the heathen , we wealthbringing , civilized Americans . A musical note threaded the sunny breeze along the deck . The ship 's bell again . An hour was gone by since Mr. M'Kay had begun to talk . Fables ... his had been the best of them , by far . They would stagger under flights of arrows as black as swarms of gnats . They would eat horse and cur and moccasin , and maybe each other , and be lost so many times , betrayed and crazed , completely lost , before they 'd finally find us in our riverside fort . P113Fables . The finest of them , this , and our pleasantest hour on the sea . So probably none of us wholly believed it . Not then. 8Thickened weather , a fuming storm , drove us towards the Horn . All the long days before Christmas our bow was in and out of water . Green , glassy masses rolled down upon us out of cloud and rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge waves assaulting , retreating , smothering all our screeching wood , flinging our boxes everywhere around the slick-wet boards below hammocks and berths , seemed a racket invented for our special torture . No doubt there have been worse passages around the Horn , but never worse passengers . Captain and crew being now too busy to bother with us , we managed a few ugly moods among ourselves . Those murderously yellow bulkheads of our clerks ' quarters , the seesaw and the drip , the airless , soggy pressure of this sight of the same few yellow faces in the churlish light of the Antarctic midnight . . . and the ever dark Smell of tar . Ovide had grown languid beyond bearing . He avoided errault . At me he snapped and , when I 'd give him a all-minute 's chance , jeered for the benefit of all our ( lows . Was he yet jealous of me ? He had no reason to . I wanted to tell him so . . . when I saw the hurt and mb confusion in her eyes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a scoundrel , too . . . but that uld have brought on another sulky scene , more taunts d theatricals , and another of those brave plays of hismeans of which he always dazzled himself out of bore-o-morrow the world would wear a blue sky again , our shuttling masts would stitch bright fleeces to theP114azure , and the sun be golden again upon young hearts . ... Lord , was I these lovers ' keeper ? Instead , to-morrow was destined to be a day of dead gray calm , the sails hanging idle , as loose as a spaniel 's jowls , and only the current carrying us within dim sight of the cape , five or six leagues distant . A sullen day for everyone , of worry and incapable drifting in a flow three miles an hour strong , of bawling and barking from the foggy quarter-deck and watches against the slow suction which gripped us towards the cloud-slung rocks . We were not to see the cape entire . Even when a land breeze gained us fair offing and a free view , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy mutable and gusty high in the gray air . I remember how I stared at it from behind a rain-grained port , and how long I watched the wind carving this pendent moisture into new and huger faces , and how one face lingered for a full , baleful minute above the sun-torn remnants of the fog . It was the face of someone I must recognize , must hail , challenge . . . yet someone I had never seen . I laughed aloud when I finally knew . That broad , translucent , philosophicbrow across the sky , a cumulus upon a core of cape rock , and the hot , narrowed brightness of the rifts which were his eyes , and especially the thin lips of contortedstone scoffing , epigrammatizing down upon a waste of noisy gales and sloven mists ... I had learned his strange features by heart only a few nights ago while trying to read him in the pearly evening light on deck . There was that odd volume of him which I had along , and there was all the babble and chaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I had not really been able to read , but only to stare at M. Voltaire 's face , at the engraving on the soggy frontispiece which made him soP115dim and prodigious . . . as this vast enlargement made him now upon the sky . It was he , for quite a minute it was his gigantic self in nebulous grotesque upon the sky , with sunken old cheeks already in slight dissolve as they recited me that paragraph of his , that unforgettable paragraph which a drunken monologue of my New York days had made peculiarly mine : something about a fly , the destiny of a fly . If I ... how had he written it ? . . . if I could disturb the destiny of .. . He was a shapeless , unacknowledgeable dump of cloud and rock knob when I looked again . To the very bottom of the world I had come sailing to meet this monstrous effigy . Old doubter , flouter , truth impaler , melting weakly in the wind . Our breeze changed to the southwest and we beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego Ramirez we saw a large schooner helpless , her sails like a moth 's torn wings in the cold , late sunset , but never could hail her . For a week we fought the contrary weather , and the captain ruled and ran us with no amen excepting an occasionalbelch from The M'Dougall 's tortured stomach . Then , at length , the wind hauled round to the south , and we swept westward , all allowed on deck in the genial Christmas morning to bear witness to our passage into the new ocean . Perrault , too : a silent and confounded little Perrault who stood next to me at the rail , as instinctively ar away as she could from the moody temper of thatastiW in the manger , Ovide de Montigny , and who , hiding under the stoop of my shoulder , never minded thatI saw her sob , saw how her silly tears went down in in-6nitesimal sparkle when she leaned far out and giggled to disguise them , and how they were our first libation spilled to the Pacific .   I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the lookout call his sight of land . I made for the bow and stood behind Mate Fox 's lumpy back . A great pink flower hung on the horizon , its lower petals floating open on the sea . Midair , when the first sunlight found it , its stamen burned with white dazzle ; and this , Mr. Fox informed me against the wind , was the summit of Mona-Roah , mountain of Ohehy , signal to all comers to the Sandwich Isles . We watched the wonder of it ripen , the petals grow flushed and heavy with the day and drop slowly down . Then the hills were uncovered , and their tints of dawn and lessening distance wove into upland greens , the quenching green of mountain sides turbulent with swift verdure , jungles of palm and cane and tropic vine . " Wait a bit , " said Mate Fox , " you 'll smell the peppers ' n ' all . " I could have sworn I smelled them already . Out of the chalky blue trough to starboard a bird rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of our approach . " Ohehy . " I kept trying to pronounce it in the seamen'sway which Mate Fox used . " You 've been here be-fore ? " " Aye , time , ' n ' time . " " And the captain  --  has he , too ? " " Well  --  " cautiously , with all of a sailor 's glum respect  --  " Icould n't say for sure . " " Last night , " I explained , " Captain Thorn told me he may have to distribute small-arms amongst us when we go ashore . He said all savages are . . . savages . " " Maybe . " And then , with his pink , shy cheek turnedP117half away from me and chubbier than ever in this morning light : " But ... " And straightway launched into another of his long , sentimentalstammerings concerning all the world he 'd seen , the many far , lonely ports he 'd put into where some folks might 've thought the people savages . . . pagans they certainly were , sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some bad ones among them on the waterfronts , loose ones , as there always are whereeveridle sailors are . . . but he 'd always found the world and all people of every color in it somehow satisfactorily good and kind and . . . and decent . I said , " Of course . " Many others had joined us on the deck . He brought his voice down to a mild , bashful drone . The purple flower of the dawn was dying in a blaze of gold , a peak with an exotic name blew scarfs of birds and tingling scents to greet us , and the good mate went on droning me meek , rueful platitudes on the universal goodness of the decent life . There was that uncle of his , for instance , who 'd been drowned on the bars at the mouth of the Columbia , he 'd been a fine family man , like all the Foxes .. . I leaned a little back from him , so that only a quarter of what he said should reach me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superciliousness . I saw my young monkey , Perrault , scrambling into the foreriggingwith her overalls ballooning and a white , tight face . " Now , there 's that young son of mine , Mr. Lewis , no bigger than Perrault , there ... my son 's no pretty one , though , for he 's mine , got a fat little face like mine When I was that young , eats hearty and fast like I used to , has n't got the least idea how much I love him , but . . Lord , what else does anyone live for , Mr. Lewis ? To love and to die . Decent love , I mean , of course . "   " Of course . " How many more times should I have to say , " Of course " ? " The last time I came in from round the world he 'd just found a bit of broken mirror , and there he sat at the window flashing it at me as I came up the walk , just sitting there young and naughty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trod all over my own feet and into the rosebush . . . he had n't meant harm , of course , the young imp , just . . . and when his mother made me spread-eagle him I just snapped my belt in the air and made a lot of noise , not really touching him with it , you know . " I assured him I knew . And I did know . Apple-cheeked faces of little Dutch school children against the schoolyardsnow . This side of the funny man must always touch me . I listened with a knowing tolerance to his protest that what had hurt him most was when he had had to take the boy 's bit of glass away from him , but that he 'd give it back to him , he 'd secretly promised it , some day soon ... perhaps when he was back in Boston from this very voyage . Ahead of us the land formed silently , and the interveningsea was overlaid with the fresh hush of a harbor still too far away for any stir or noises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy sayings ? " That 's all that death amounts to , Mr. Lewis . Somethin ' to serve love like that . . . decent love , of course . There 's only love and death in all .... " Of course . Of course . Of course . But I had not the least idea what death could look like , nor ever had known love ... of course . Out of the mouths of fools and dullards . . . To windward , where the shrouds were taut in the rigging directly above us , we heard the sudden bowstringtwang of the rope to which Perrault had beenP119clinging , and then at once the streaming terror of her cry as she shot out and down into the sea . IOSo quickly , so surprisingly , it happened . The stunned deck raced past the frothing spot where she had sunk , and when she rose again we 'd left her far behind . I tried to cry out and cried nothing . I stood crushed against the rail , watching the dwindling bobbing of her inflated canvas clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower half of her afloat in the soapy green swirl of our wake . Stupefaction had exploded into uproar . Cries came from all parts of the deck . Cries for a man overboard , for the ship to heave to , for a rush to the boats , for us to hurl things , anything , everything , at hand into the lather 's groove astern . Cries of the wood and canvas as our wheel ground around and our sails rebelled . All the cries and impulses of pandemonium . . . my own cry dead in my mouth , and my own immediate impulse dead before it could be born , drowned already in the plumbless seething of the water into which I stared when I had swung one foot across the rail . " The lad 's head down , he 'll smother , " someone yelled past me . The lad . Perrault . Perrault out there in the green-blue churning , smothering , drowning . Chairs , barrels , benches , hen coops streaked down , splashed and swirled behind us n a torpid spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pully other foot across , to leap without this necessity of ) king , to avoid the sight of this boiling nothingness of he face of death in the water below me . . . but I looked nd looked . Someone came rushing up the hatch behind me , slammed me back again flat upon the deck as he vaulted , and , with supple swiftness and his shining hair undone , sprang down into the wave . Now I , too , could cry out . Cry to the wretched , traitorouscoward who was ever resident in me , and whose shocked nerves fired and shamed and agonized me whileI lay in a faint of fright and released my sickness all around me on the deck . The lowered quarter-boat , from which men had thrust me away as a nuisance , rescued the two of them out of the wash of spinning debris . Ovide had reached her long before the boat could , righted her , held her pinned high to the hen coop 's spewingslats . He had laughed  --  Farnham and Matthews told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wave-lax little body upon their oars and grabbing hands , laughed to their cheers as he seized the listing gunwale and heaved himself in beside her . And to our cheers , the gruff applause of the whole ship when they returned the boat alongside . Muscle-moulded , dripping , he climbed back aboard , holding her dripping to his moulded chest , one arm in careless spread across the risky secret of her sex , the other thrusting his way through all the arms which would have shared his burden . " Rum , idiot , rum ! " He shouted it at me as he smashed by me to the hatch without even noticing the open blanket I was holding . Under his soaked locks his eyes burned with personal triumph , with impatience at any possible hitch in the perfectionof his play . I stumbled in the blanket , stumbled down behind him . . . in the puddles they left on the steep hatchway and across the cabin floor . He laid her , white wet face upwards , on the closetP121berth . He paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin store with the bottle spattering upon my hands : he only grabbed it , put it to the blue twist of her lips , poured , lifted it , and swigged from it himself . . . straddling and leaking sea water in huge rivulets across the maps there , laughing at me when I closed the door and said that none must see how we revived her . She stirred , coughed ; water ran pitifully from her mouth and nose . The plaster of soaked clothes gave a queer sob as he wrenched it up from her breasts . He was tearing the blouse collar back from her throat . . . white , whiter than ever I had imagined . " Here , you , James Lewis , or Lewis James , or whatever . . .  --  He wanted me to help him . Me . Me , with my eyes suddenly bloodshot and averted , my fingers hooking back into my own wrists to suppress their helpless shaking , all my native awkwardness become a flushing misery as I turned away towards the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . have you never undressed a woman in your life ? " His play was over . He was wet and tired and beginning to be drunk . All his exultance in our cheers above had given way to savage exasperation and contempt . A low moan of reviving senses swelled the slim throat on the bunk below us , pressing him to flagrant rage . " Afraid . . . of a woman 's nakedness , or what ? Of drowningin a woman 's navel . . . Get out , out ! " He flung the door open and me out . He kicked me out , and I sprawled on the cabin floor , abject and stunned , my spine shrieking from the impact of his kick , my head cracked hard against one of the partner 's berth boards and sunk in ignominious stupor next The M'Dougall 's china night-pot . From far away I heard him slam the door .   Over the Karaka-koua bay where we had anchored the moonlight lay in seamless luster , the molten stuff of shining and unstinting magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sleeping lightning , solid upon the sea , liquid to the land , all the escarpments , clefts , and coral surfs surrendering their daytime substance to its heatless alchemy , and all the stars raked out of the palm trees ' lofty fermentation , away into white engulfment by the moon . I watched from the bow . Franchere had found me churlish company and left me alone . Alone I was pleased to be . . . if anything could please me after this long day . Fair ahead of our bowsprit a silver cliff flung its fourhundredfeet of sheerness up to the exquisite fret of a solitarycocoa tree . From the amphitheatrical , profuse land around us the spicy scents of curious foliage and swiftripenedfruit poured down upon us in a heady blend the bouquet of the white liquor of the moon . The huts were dark , drenched in the splotching palm shadows on the low lava arms of the bay ; but sometimes I heard singing . . . above the grating swish and squeak of the sailors ' brooms and squilgees tidying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange song from the shore . All afternoon , while we slapped past the coast , they had been around us : brown , audacious bodies , flowerslungand glistening with the watery reflection of the sun ; high gabble of their eagerness to barter with us as their paddles brought their dragonfly pirogues up close to us in buoyant chase ; the brazen clamor of them on the deck where , for the first time , we set up shop and traded . . . needles , beads , iron rings , anything in chor-P123Cling trade for the fruits and clucking poultry they had brought along . That was my afternoon 's chore , my singular knack , I found : to count the exchanges , balance them quickly , correctly , in the ledger in their midst . For an inch-blade chisel a whole hillock of cabbages and yams . For a rusty , broken-toothed saw , long since discarded by Koaster , a heaping thanks of watermelons , breadfruit , taro , and bananas . For no more than a cock of the head and an uncertain grin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool of the mountain slopes in their morning green , still glowing of the copper bodies on which they 'd been awaiting us . Some of the sailors had been saving their grog rations for this sly time . Smashed gourds and trodden garlands lay kicked into the scuppers , and around the forecastle afterwards , and a drunken girl 's tapa girdle had jumbled itself , crisp and thin as a snake 's last year 's skin , down the deck and flat against the taffrail . They came around us still when we were inside the harbor , diving with fuddled glee for the ha'pennies and tinny buttons some of the voyageurs were throwing out , followingour anchor down to the coral bottom in fourteen fathoms of water , climbing our chains in flaunting clustersuntil the cathead above them grunted with the strain . The M'Dougall had been shocked . . . piously , to be sure , and with great dignity , but with his plump tongue licking the excitement from the air . The elder Stuart had dedaredwe should have got out the boarding netting . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fronds of the leaning palms above the silver beach , and the singing fragrance of white flowers opening upon the banded hills in answer to the moon . All my senses mingled into this one sense of silver shameless and earning everywhere , naked upon the night , until it was almost my nostrils that sucked in the song , my ears that breathed the peppery , sweet redolence of the land , while my eyes turned upwards in the arc of the white flight of a dream . But even as I looked , a cloud which was greenish as putrescence fawned on the perfect ripeness of the moon , swarming and violating it , bloating it into the lopsidednessof execrable , lewd burlesque . And behind me the brooms and squilgees scraped at the malodorous remains of the deck 's holiday , and sailors ground their chilblains into the squashed flowers . I grew aware of the throbbing ignominy of my soreness where Ovide had kicked me . . . kicked me out , as though ... and had slammed the door . I felt the sweet cleansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . In front of me , a startling , splitting sound , the abused cathead cracked . I jumped back . Someone came running up the deck . Mate Mumforditwas his watch . What 's happened ? What now ? He rammed his face into mine to see who I was . " The cathead , sir . They were all over it this afternoon . I was just " All right , do n't get frightened  --  " damn him  --  " it 's nothing serious . Cap'n wants you , Lewis . Cursin ' after you all night . " " Me ? " He was amused at me . Maybe whimsically sorry for me after my morning 's exhibition . " Aye , you . You 're to luff down to the powder run and check kegs for old Weeks in the morning . We 'll be distributin ' small-arms --  " The powder run . Black and quiet as the core of hell , " I 'll go right now , sir . " " Now ? Why , you . . . how can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " A crazy nostalgia beset me ,  |p125a  haste for the dense , bitter airlessness and black discomfortof that secret place where I should be unseen , unsensed . I could not wait to reach there . " But " " Oh , there 'll be plenty of light from the cabin , sir . Moonlight , if nothing else . . . look at it . " I would not look at it any more , myself . I 'd give them a lifetime of full moons for one night in that sulphurous , stifling burrow , the one sure refuge which my swart mood wanted . An Astor would have snapped at such a trade . " You 're a queer one , Lewis . Well . . . but do n't try any tricks with flint ' n ' steel too near the powder . " That was an excellent joke . I enjoyed it as much as he did . More . Mr. Mumford had seldom inspected the run , had no idea that , long before we left New York , Weeks had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height above the kegs against God alone knew what emergency . I went straightway below . I lay there . In the cramming narrowness , beside the stowage of the powder casks in their bung-up and bilgefreeorder , I lay with my nostrils flattened on the filthy boards and my lips stretched back to avoid the taste of black , gritty powder flakes in the tar seams of the floor . For an hour or two the window over the ladder had worn the grimy pallor of something less than light which came from the cabin lamp . Then that , too , extinguished . I lay in the evil-smelling , still , compressing stomach of a whale , in the acrid core of hell where there is darkness more burning than fire , nothingness beyond all torment , and gradually I relaxed my lips and let them feast upon the sour black dust of the floor.  | My reverences to you , M.

I swore it . I . . . the fly . There was shore leave for most of us the next evening . We were bound for the native feast . Aye , we c 'd go ' n ' be damned t ' us . We went . The partners in special state , of course . Laird M'Dougall in such plaids as shamed the sunset all around him .

The captain had been berating him again all afternoon  --  Lord knows what about , this time  --  and Anderson would keep quiet enough to suit me out of sheer moroseness . Or so I had expected . But once we were clear of theship and sweeping inshore to the broad , wet whisper of thepaddles , he began to whine and confide me his grievances . He had a lout 's face , small and weak and awfully complectedunder his seaman 's beard ; I had to watch it for the next ten minutes over the magnificent backs of our native paddlers . . . watch the pink scabs and pistules showing in the roots of his hair while he went on complainingof his under-dog days , his rotten luck , Thorn 's stinginessand meanness and stinking temper . It was as good a time as any to stop feeling sorry for such people . There 'd be no surer way to stop feeling sorry for one 's own self .

" One of the antennae of long twigs which the canoe 's end dragged behind for equilibrium whipped out of water with the suddenness of his alarm . " Sit still , you bloody fool !

Besides , he must assure me of more sterling motives.  | " It 's not that , Lewis . It 's the captain . You 've heard him , how he 's treated me . I would n't ever ' ve thought on it if he  --  he ' n ' all those fatheaded redcoats he 's always . . . Jesus , why does he have to take it all out on me ? " " On you ?

" I felt suddenly immensely tolerant of him , of his squeaky little face and pink scabs . " Do n't worry , though , I 'll not tattle . " He breathed again . " Funny finding what a good one you are , " he said , " like this . . . at the last . . . . I wish I 'd known you better aboard . Maybe then it wouldn ' ' ve been so stinkin ' hard .

The paddles were lashing us clear of a low spit where turquoise water turned a milky green and spilled across the gleaming burls of coral . I leaned back in the bottom of the canoe , enjoying the final few yards of calm before the surf began , and the picture of crowds and big holiday cooking-fires between the surf and the voluptuous woods . A triangular fish with a drowned rainbow on his scales darted back from the shadow of our furled lateen.  | " Maybe . " I replied to John Anderson . It was no sort of reply , but it was enough for him . I was already one man 's master . We were the white men , the haoles , and they were our servants and worshipers . We were the strangers , the malihinis , and they our hosts , our friends forever around the cooking-fires ' twirl of orange sparks , our lovers under the full moon . We gorged ourselves and grew drunk . We watched them dancing under the great kamani trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay bare and panting upon every palm leaf , expectant of the greedy reach of the firelight'sblaze up every tree trunk . The arms of the dancers had the slow , glowing sway of melting copper . Jack Anderson and I sat a little apart , our backs cushionedagainst the slatternly , springy refuse of a giant fern . His eyes kept turning leerily for a look from mine , like a tipsy dog 's will when he gathers the sight of one familiar human face above him through the fumes . But when he watched the dancers his whole little face became red , crawling fire . The partners , groggy and drowsy , propelling their heavy guts before them as dignifiedly as they could , had retired with one of the priests and the village headman into a grass hut . It was hogs they wanted , thank ye .. . forty ' r fifty live hogs as fat and succulent and ready for roasting as these they 'd had served up to-night . . . and laws or no laws , King Tamehameha or no Tamehameha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn ye , and hogs they 'd ... they were in small danger of being understoodbefore they would give in to their stupor . The voices of the mele so gravely sung outside , the strange notes of the nose flute , the damp rustle of the dancers ' warm feetp131in the warm , damp jungle shrubbery , would only send them fast asleep . There were nineteen women and one man who danced . They sang as they danced , and the hundreds of others who sprawled around us , munching , drinking , watching us with soft , friendly , fire-starred eyes , joined in the song at vagrant intervals . There was a young girl among the dancers with white flowers trembling in her hair . Across the savory smoke I caught a glimpse of Perrault and Ovide sitting close together , amused , carelessly happy , his arm in frank possession of her waist . Their shore manners . . . a bridal night such as they 'd never yet enjoyed , with the quicksilver shadows of the koa tree to hide them from the jealous moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor any need of it . . . nor use for jealousy ... . I swigged of the gourd of ava they had given me . I could not learn the color of the stuff in this light . It was warm and sweet-smelling and , after the glut of food we 'd had , it had a creamy , earthy taste . What was it made from ? I did not care . . . the effect of it was what I wanted : the self-satisfied , nepenthal stupor that is the prize of middle age and is untroubled by resentments or bereftmentsor its own burning loins . . . or by anything except the wherewithal of fifty fresh hogs . Anderson , at my side , made queer noises with his terrierlips . I looked where he was looking  --  at the young girl among the dancers . Her tapa cloth had fallen free and swayed in dark folds around her thighs . Loosened petals flaked her wet , metallic skin . They rained upon her face , in the fire-tipped black of her long hair when it raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzied petticoat to the ground . They were red in this light , silver in that . . . and she and the flowers she wore were so much of the moon and the flame ,  |p132these  petals seemed but large drops of the very warmth and life of her wild , swaying being . " I 'd a nice little chat with that wench afore , " said Jack Anderson . He wiped his beard with the back of his hand . " I hope she understood you . " " Aye , well enough . They all know what y ' mean . " I looked around the clump of clerks . Their eyes were glued on the dancers . . . on this same one , probably . Matthews had had the night of his life , nor finished it yet . Farnham , Franchere , Ross , a prim , insignificant-looking lot , trying to appear at home , to hide from each other the beads of uneasy light which shifted and snapped behind their eyes . They 'd hide them from their diaries , anyhow . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French voyageurs rolled unrestrained among the guava and the ferns , dragging the gleefully shrieking women down with them in mock wrestling matches . Nadeau had given his deerskin shirt to a fat young mother to wrap her baby in . He had the woman up against his hairy chest , his grasp already wrist-deep under her pau , whilst all three of them , even the babe in arms , must howl for joy and vigor . The song had changed from a mele to a hula . The measured wail grew swift , flailing , crazing . The dancers gave their limbs to freedom . Torches of wax nuts sputteredin the excited hands of those around them and coloredtheir seething and grave lasciviousness all anew . The women 's breasts were like those I 'd seen on a statue of the wolf which suckled Romulus and Remus . . . God damn me and my pedantry ! These breasts were of hot , hungry flesh and torch-red skin . And under them , like wells of fire , like eyes of the moon , the women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p133Look  at them ... there , James Lewis , look . . . and break at once all thralldom to cold ink and colder statuary . You that had been afraid of drowning even in a woman 's navel ... any woman 's . You that are so different now , laughing , jerking little Jack Anderson 's gourd of ava away from him when your own is empty ... . He let me have it with one of his regretful squeaks . " Oh , aye , friend . . . take it , take it . But you 'll help me ' s you 've promised . Y ' promised it , friend , remember ! " " Aye , friend , I promised it . " I said it so solemnly , he had no idea why I finished with a chuckle . " Help you how ? " " The girl . . . that girl there . Well , all the young bastards'llbe after her , from what their looks say . But I 've already said things to ' er . . . sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywheres in port . An ' maybe , when I get ' er ' n ' know ' s I 'm a man again , not just a captain 's bilge roach , I 'll feel all different about . . . you know .. . what you guessed about . " There was something good about him , then , in his way . Good . . . and pitiful and silly . He did not want to desert . A girl in his arms , a pair of child 's eyes looking up at him in merry wonder , admiration , while he went on boasting and bolstering his self-esteem , emptying his clogged , tired little heart ... maybe ... . The fires had been allowed to sink . They were smooth mounds of embers that held together in their glow . Little flames raced under their surfaces and left unquiet veins of darkness . . . as in the hot red breasts of the native women . The dancing was nearly done . Only the strongest of the young ones stayed on under the resuming , flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped away . . . where . . . Yes , Jack Anderson , poor little wretch , I knew what you had meant.  |p134I  drank his gourd empty . The rich , earthy stuff tasted better than ever . Yes , Jack Anderson , with your terrier 's face all moist and sore with a new desire , newly audacious to balance all your life hereafter on the wriggling of a woman 's collar-bones . . . and expecting pimp 's charity ofine .... " ' Ere she comes , friend ! " Panting , she had left the dance . She stood a moment leaning for breath against a palm , and wore the same disheveled luster that lay over its abandoned leaves . She did not think to rearrange her tapa cloth as she walked our way . The loose folds of it over her full , strong thighs were snowy with petals . Jack Anderson jumped up , plucking at me to do likewise . Come along . . . here 's where I could help him . Matthews was already skirting the embers and making towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at one and all , and the moon gave her lips a patina of hot good-nature and desirability . She was hot copper , half bare . I cut in across Matthews , Anderson behind me . She smiled at me . Her eyes were large under her heavy , wet hair . Her arm was warm and yielding when I grabbed it . With my other arm I pushed the lot of them away . Jack Anderson trotted , yelping his thanks , by my side . Under high , humid palm fronds , torn into the white sky , we climbed a short hill behind the fires and the sea . We staggered , laughing , breathing coarsely in our drunkenness , halted knee-deep in the low vines of a burning white flower which swept the crest . Down the other slope the thin plumes of wild sugar cane glittered and hummed . Beyond them a narrow , moon-blue band of the jungle 's night shadow . . . and then the jungle itself , a black , unlimited , inseparable mass of upflung wilderness . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so grateful . And excited and untroubled and triumphant . I looked at the girl . Her large , unconcerned eyes had the dark drench of foliage in them . She did not understand or care . Her ripe breasts parted when she breathed , and a flower of moonlight trembled between them . She smiled at him , at me , dumbly , good-naturedly . As I let go her arm her skin seemed to spring to hold my fingers . " Y ' promised . . . y ' can go now like y ' promised . . . . " At least I did not taunt him . I gave him no chance to prolong the anxiety that retched him at last . As soon as he thrust his suddenly worried and puckered little face at me , I slapped out at it . I hit it with the side of my hand , and felt the small bones give and smart as they clove his beard and smashed the sticky chin beneath . He fell and rolled a few feet down the inland dip . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stomach to fire it . He stood staring up at us on our palm-wreathed crown of the hill . He had the weariest , most hopeless expression on his little face that I had ever seen . Everything had gone out of it excepting pimply weakness . A wordless rebuke started coming from under his tongue ; a sob , perhaps a hiccup , tweaked it short . He turned and fled , stumbling , floundering down the slope , in among the cane , where he gave us one last sight of his stricken face over his shoulder ... . The shadow of the jungle rippled over him , drowned him in black silence . I never saw him again . The girl 's low croon , the language that is half speech , half song , of a high-breasted dove , brought back my brooding to the hilltop . She laughed when I laughed . She stood with her hands in her hair , her cheek to the moon 's , her whole torso restive and twitching softly . I felt the life of her strong thighs under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away this zone of bark all the white petals it had hoarded in its folds leaped free and raced us to the flower-mad earth . This , too , I remember : how the dawn closed the flowers among which we lay and raised the heads of others that would scent the new day through the tangled grass . And how , waking and stretching her arms , she tried to teach me to pronounce her name , but drew me down and drowsed again while laughing at my slowness , and with the silver shoe buckle I 'd given her for a keepsake clasped tightly in her large brown hand . This , also : how the sunlight hurt my eyes as I came down to the shore , leaving her behind me deep asleep , her body sagging in final and oblivious contentment over the low vines . How the sea had a sound for men 's ears , and carried a hard , scornful brightness across the beach , the overturned boats , the foreground of heaped , dead ashes and heaped , drunken sleepers all around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tree ferns were freighted with brown decay , and the ground was a swamp of brown , inert nakedness and smashed gourds . This , especially : how , while we waited lazily to be paddled back to the ship , we watched an old pair with stripes of quicklime in their hair manufacturing a new supply of the ava they 'd given us to drink the night before . How they chewed the roots patiently between their old brown teeth and spat out the rich , earth-colored spittle into a bowl to decay under the strong sun . And how one of them was a white and sightless creature whom they called a leper . And how that did not matter , either . . . any more than that she had not even tried to learn my name ... .  | Five gentle days we cruised among the islands , coasting from Tohehigh by order of its celebrated Governor Young , the king 's white admiral and counselor , to the royal bay of Ohetity . All we had had from Young were four black sucklings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy tale of his seaman 's luck and his native wife , in exchange for some tea and coffee and Madeira wine . None other than Tamehameha himself , the mighty Eri Tamehameha , lord and master of all the Sandwich Isles , could give us the fifty hogs , the good water , and the flock of brown men we wanted for our sojourn in the North . We made for Wahoo in a golden weather , past Mowhee and Tahooraha , where the green hills had neither beginningnor ending in the sea , but seemed each to ride upon the sky for no brisker reason than to hang a garland there of cocoanut and breadfruit trees . Green , too , the bar across the Ohetity bay : the tender , ever-tossing green of palms above the coral and the spray . There we anchored on the twenty-first , with Captain Thorn damned if he 'd take her inside the reef . The canoes came out to us , were soon many around us . The long , leaf-like paddles flashed across the sunlight as they came ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propelling them . . . so lightly and brightly they flecked the sunny water . White men , too : a pair of Americans , a young Bordeaux Frenchman who told us he was the king 's sons ' tutor , and who struck up an immediate camaraderie with Ovide over the rail . Then came the king 's prime minister , Kraimoku , longnosed , exceedingly statesmanlike , with a blue hussar 's coat moulting under his maro , and a **25;1271;TOOLONG on his head , bearing His Majesty 's invitation to the captain and equally important personages to disembark . Those equally important personages , the partners , were not to be outshone . On The M'Dougall 's advice they had all arrayed themselves in their Scotch kilts and plaids . I fear that Captain Thorn , clinging gruffly to his old , storm-worn sea jacket , must have cut a plain figure among them in the cannon-strung palace square where even the sentries sweated under great coats of blue and yellow braid ; and that he must have got a certain plain satisfactionout of doing just that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared behind the reef , a small , bobbing flotilla , the tail of which , I was quite sure , was a pair of pink , sunny rumps of someone trying to juggle himself on the slender canoe seat when the wind and surf grew disrespectful of the kilts of Clan M'Dougall . Mate Fox was in charge of the little trading we 'd do now . I had private work of the captain 's to perform . I lingered on the inactive deck , unwilling to begin it . Captain 's orders seemed always to suck me down the hatch . Through the bay 's gate I caught a glimpse of the little town , a hundred or so houses of yellow matting among the hillside trees , and the occasionally larger white buildings . . . the public store , perhaps , or the palace itself , a temple , a little wharf , a few old schooners idling in the blazing sun . . . . The two miles ' distance between all this and us laid its little parody of cannonry and prime ministersand palace guards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . A native had smuggled some home-made brandy to the voyageurs . Ovide went sauntering back and forth between them and the rail , impatient , snipping the awfulp139French of their jests with sulky monosyllables , as though he could not wait to be ashore and away from us all . Perrault crouched near him , watching him with the intentness of a forlorn understanding . She looked humbled . Something was wrong again . . . anything . . . nothing to me , I told myself . I went below . The captain 's stateroom had the stale smell of little things in their right places . I knew precisely and immediatelywhere to find the notes he had hidden for me . I must finish his letter to Mr. Astor . We should leave it here at Wahoo for the next ship New York bound . That might be months . . . but Mr. Astor would ultimately receiveit , read it , and know . His handwriting was Jonathan Thorn 's whole life on paper . A slow , excruciatingly exact handwriting , a chart of rigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temper bore his thick fingers down upon the lines in a fury of black illegibility . He could have written his final draft himself , but he wanted it worded and engrossed as impressively as a congressional declaration . . . and they 'd given him a schoolmaster for his chief clerk . ... Contrary to orders , out of all rule , endangering of the ship 's insurance , they had endeavored to make him break up the cargo and distribute articles of clothing unnecessarilyamong the Canadians from certain sealed bales ... . Oh , very well , he was the author , not I.He had served them the best possible fresh and smoked meats in the cabin . Puddings , too . With what thanks ? They had declared it . . . " damned hard they could not live as they pleased upon their own property , being on board their own ship , freighted with their own merchandise . . . and these the fine fellows who had boasted they could eat dogs ! "  | Leave that in , too , his very words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black bile his honest writing used here . His latest notes were hastily added : " Red coats . . . frantic gambols , foolish promises , wastefulgifts of wine , etc. , to natives who can not furnish us a single hog . . Taking clerks and men on shore to spot where Captain Cook was killed , and each fetching off piece of rock or tree touched by the shot . . . collecting ridiculously contemptible lot of curiosities and histories from natives and loafers , etc. . . . impossible to enumerate their thousand instances of ignorance , silliness , filth , etc. , daily practised .... " God save us from stout men with justice on their side ! To hell with him and his righteous itch . . . his little stateroomstank of neatness . I finished him up : long , curling , learned sentences and elaborate calligraphy , through which his wind-stitched , wrathy face still flared with honest Yankee indignation . Let him be right . Let him bore his great shipowner to death . Let me be present in imagination when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin-stocked state below his prize beaver skin , snorted at the length and methodical complexity of my transcription . Here , through all of these golden days among the islands so softly green that they seemed but the print of dreams on lovers ' sleep . . . notes , complaints , the sputter of a plain , just man against red coats and gambols ... . God have mercy on his rigid little soul and all who 'd dare offend its suicidal rightness ! Cheers called me to the deck again , and then the deafeningcrash of the four guns we fired for salute . The shore party was returning . A large state craft accompanied them , a double pirogue with two dozen paddlers . The water was winy with an afternoon splendor as they came acrossp141it , and their mighty paddles moved with a vigor and precisionwhich were the envy of our voyageurs . As it neared , we could see that a great chest full of firearmshad been lashed over the center of the two canoes which formed this pirogue . And that a large brown man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword at his side , took his ease on a once gilded chair among the muskets . Bravo , the great Eri Tamehameha , Supreme One of the Sandwich Isles . . . he had removed his boots and carried them on his gold-buttoned paunch , while he trailed his plump brown feet in the water that ran high and foamy under him . When he came aboard , his toe prints shone as big as dollars on the deck . And after him came his three royal consorts with breasts like coconut pods , and hips as broad as bays , and the smiles of little children . Partners and captain were back aboard , too , to give him a ceremonial reception . He tugged at his uniform collar , and his sweaty neck bulged up out of its restraint . He treated the plaid of the Clan M'Dougall to the honors of an only slightly inferior potentate . He followed the partners slowly around the ship , stopping a while with greedy interest in front of the old water-still attached to our caboose . Useless contraption , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rich , imperious voice . I le had called us his friends , his bringers of fresh wonders and improvements . I had a chance to look long at him as he stood there . His big , hot body , drenching his old uniform below his arms and just above his belly , had fattened untidily with age . He must always have been stocky , bullish . . . his face showed it , and his neck . . . . But it was not until I heard the captain behind me that my sense of complete familiarity with him was clear . I heard the captain growling at Mate Fox about the un- successful bargaining on shore , and that the old black savage , crown or no crown , was craftier ' n ' grubbier after Spanish gold than any white man , Jew or German , he 'd ever .. . I began to laugh . How could his old operetta costume , his royal sword , and his blowsy harem disguise him when his neck grew out of his shoulders like that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pigmentation blot out the bluntness of his brow and the sunken pits of his little humorless , indomitable eyes below it ? " All peoples , " said Kraimoku , the lean , long-nosed prime minister , " are made happy in the power and riches of one man among them . All peoples attain their strength of life through the strength of their tyrant . Without the tyrant the people could not live . Before the coming of Eri Tamehameha to the throne there was not a single schooner in the islands , and Owhyhee knew not Wahoo nor Wahoo Tahooraha . Now , under the glorious rule of Eri Tamehameha , whose fleet is of forty schooners , and whose sails bring him yearly tribute from all the bays and littlest villages as far as distant Atooay , all the islands are as one nation , and all are Tamehameha 's . " We sat in the sun-bathed palace yard , Kraimoku , the French tutor , and I.I had been sent ashore with the articles of enlistment I had prepared for the twenty-four islanders we were hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must vise these , must have His Majesty 's seal upon this and all our other , more important contracts concerning the purchase of live hogs and such . We waited while His Majesty held court of justice behind the sentried gate . " And are the islands happier because they are allp143one nation now ? " I asked the suave Kraimoku through the tutor 's courteous tongue . " Ah , they must be , " replied the prime minister . " Eri Tamehameha insists upon it . They must love him because he is mightiest among them . They must rejoice in him because he has conquered their lesser kings and been called cousin by the Eri George of England himself . They must delight in his grandeur because he is master of all their lands and keeper of all their waters , owner of each taro root they pull from his soil , each little fish they scoop from his waves . They must relish his riches because he uses them to buy more schooners to collect more riches . That is his rule . " I bowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and power and fat warehouses and imperial ambitionsmight well remember . " So loving a father to all his people is the Eri Tamehameha , " continued his statesman , " that he once led his army across a great crater and surprised and slew his enemies by hundreds . Another time he fought a famous battle among the sacred needles of the lao valley , so steep , so wild that no man in history had ever dared set foot there . Still another time he slew beside the sea , so that the blood of the kings he conquered ran on the wet sand as freely as the ink would run on the papers you are now clutching so nervously in your hand if you held them under yonder spring . . . . When one has gained the name of Little Buonaparte , " he added , smiling at the white palace doors , " and has for one 's prime minister a man of such admirable diplomatic qualities as to be called a Billy Pitt , one 's people would be foolish if they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n'est-ce pas ? " added the dapper Frenchman of his own accord . Ile had caught a glimpse of Ovide coming up from the wharf , swaggering , immensely gay , a company of naked brown children trailing admiringly behind his yellow braids . They would be off somewhere together , these two Gauls . " Oui , c'est tout . " Where was Perrault ? As usual , that was no concern of mine . " Merci , monsieur .... " But His Excellency had one more piece of wisdom up his long , heinous sleeve . " Among all peoples  --  " ah , the leathery old cosmopolite of the South Seas , he was back where he had started  --  " among all peoples there are three classes only . First , there is the Eri , he who commands and hoards and is happy in grand style . Second , there are the many , the countless ones . . . they might as well pronounce themselveshappy , too . But , third , there are always a few who can neither lead nor serve nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lean bodies and long noses . . . like you , my young friend , and like ... prime ministers of happy . . . " He did not finish it . I caught the curious twinkle of his eye as the sentries grunted up their muskets to a present arms and His Majesty came waddling out into the yard . " From the Eri John Jacob Astor , richest of Americans , whose own scribe I am , I bring special greetings to the Eri Tamehameha , as of cousin to cousin , ruler to ruler , splendor to splendor .... " And when they translated it to him , he gave me a slow , complacent , utterly serious nod of his bullish head , and he and his three wives sweated with pride . A black-turbaned Hindu from Bombay , sitting in the face of the sun , weaving a rope of grass fibers for a hawser ,  |p145answered  me in stealthy English as I neared the morai , the native graveyard , up the lane of huge banana trees beyond the town . That was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of platforms and cane ladders and old mattings drooping in the glare . But it was taboo . An old priest was coming slowly past . He was bent and senile , and his face was like a withered coconut , his body above its kirtle a crumple of the black designs that had been sown there when his skin was young and brave . " Ask him , " I said , " if I may look upon his gods . " The Hindu smiled into his long , dusty beard . " His gods are poor idols with rotted vegetables at their feet and the decaying flesh of slain goats and hogs around them . Could true gods live in such a stench ? " " Nevertheless ... " The priest stopped before us , leaning on his staff , peering at us out of near-sighted , dark old eyes , making sure that we were malihini . . . and that that was why we did not prostrate ourselves in the spurting ground beside his gnarled old feet . The Hindu asked for me . The ancient shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of the face of Etoway was taboo . White men had once seen his face , and they had swiftly died , and Etoway had drunk their blood and eaten their flesh . I took my cue from the Hindu 's smile . " Ask him , " I said angrily , " what sort of god is this who has to take his strength from the flesh and blood of men . " " Ask him , " the priest returned , " what sort of men are the white men that they have to take their virtue , so I have heard , from the blood and flesh of their God . " I turned away and would have gone . The dusty Hindu went on contemptuously translating for him . . . for us both . " God is many names in as many lands . God is Etowayp146and many minor gods , bearing rain across the sun and fruit to the tree boughs . God 's mouth is red with the fire of volcanoes , his brow is white with milk from the breasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black of thunder , the silver of the sea , the dawn-color of the juicy watermelon , the hues and shapes and images of things that all men most fear , most bind their lives upon , most seek in hunger and in love . " He waited a moment for my reply . I had none . " Is your god then so different from ours ? Look around you . . . . God , above all else , is of the mystery of death . In your land , ours , all lands , God must be the goal of that sunless journey from the grave . " " Some of us have to go to the Devil instead , " I answeredgrimly . " The Devil ? The Evil One ? But he too is a god . . . whom men must sometimes worship . . . . 0 , pale , foolish , quivering young man , is not your god great enough to be evil as well as good ? " I stared back into his old , half-blind eyes . How deeply could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he too is a god . I did not dare ask him , was there an idol of the Evil One up there behind the mattingand the sacrificial putrefactions , or what it looked like . But I knew the very face of it ... the forceful , unkind , beefy face . . . of the god I worshiped now . I knew that he , too , was the same in every land . The old fellow went back among his graves . He might have come out of one of them . The Hindu returned to his weaving in the dust . I wandered down under the green , heavy-laden banana trees , past the irregular , sweetsmellinggrass huts of the sprawling town , with the sun sucking moisture from the back of my neck and . . . good ... scorching it red , toughening it . . . . There was little Perrault wandering around , too , lookingp147for someone so lonelily , humbly . Damn him for breaking her spirit like that . . . and her , too , for letting him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask me where he was . . . if I knew . She followed me down to the wharf , to the empty quarter-boat tied there with a few natives dozing around it in the shade of the mangos on the shore . All its rowers had come up into the town for a drink . We climbed in and waited . The noon rebounded from the water like white fire . " Sing while we 're waiting , " I said to Perrault . She pressed her hand to her throat . " I ... " " Never mind , sing ! When I want you to ! " " What do you want me to sing ? " she asked listlessly . She had raised her hand over her eyes , ostensibly to shade them from the sun . She could not fool me . " Oh , anything . " " Mozart ? " " Yes  --  anything . " But when she raised her slim throat to begin , I burst out laughing , shrieking , devilish with merriment . It was the last day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty head of hogs ( for which His Majesty insisted on receiving nothing less solid than minted gold in his system of gracious exchange ) , some goats , two sheep , two boatloads of sugar cane to feed the hogs , as many more of yams and taro , fresh water snugly casked . . . and incidentally the two dozen Sandwich Islanders , too . The deck was even more difficult and cluttered than when we had left New York . The live animals had had to he penned in the gangways , with boardings over them forh the crew 's work , and their refuse and noises were a constantaffront to the captain 's bridling sense of order.  | Jonathan Thorn was in his prime , that morning . His compliments to the Eri , the sordid old son-of-a-blackbitch , but he 'd encumbered us with the wormiest , foulest specimens of animal and vegetable in his whole damned kingdom . Particularly those natives for the crew . Look at ' em , now ... . They were tall men and strong , and would make great sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , they clung together in a mute and almost tragic stupefaction , understanding nothing that the mates or coxswain bawled at them , seeing nothing but the green land beyond the bay , knowing only that it would so soon slip down behind the rim of a watery , blowing world and be lost to them for an eternity of three years . Three years . . . some of them , most of them , might come back fabulously wealthy with a hundred dollars ' worth of merchandise at the end of that time , but now .. . The pirogues thinned out around us . The captain had to threaten one of them that tried to smuggle some last liquor to the voyageurs . Its paddlers were like little children . As they darted their canoe away they sang and pelted him with flowers . We waited for a last load of sugar cane , brought up in our own longboat which had been grounded by the ebb . A sailor was still missing when it did arrive and lashed alongside . . . Aymes , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not until the captain had missed him and reached a climax of his rage . The captain ordered him into the longboat , climbed down into it , too . I remember nothing of the sailor . I remember only the broad , thewy shoulders of Captain Thorn as we saw them from the rail above , and as he reached into the sunny pile of cane for a stick which whistled and sprang and glistened like glass as he began to whip the fellow . And the sharp dry cracks of the wood splitting on a man 's headp149and upflung , unprotecting fingers . Fingers and cane grew bloody . I remember how I kept seeing under the captain 's arm , as it rose and fell in precise and terrible method , a distant palm , a little green emerald with the sunlight behind it , and how it sank each time a little further into the sea . The sailor cried with pain . " Tiens ! " shouted Ovide from beside me at the rail . That was brave of him . . . oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain stopped and looked up . His face was scarlet . The stitches of it glittered with passionate moisture . There were little red flecks on his hands and chin . He was breathing deep and was happy . I had never seen him smile so before . And , horrified , taut , trembling , I made myself say something under my breath . " Bravo ! " I said . . . as the sailor went overboard , splashing , crying , imploring of the nearest pirogue . The Devil 's disciple could say no less . Slowly the green shores paled and died . The creak of the rising canvas was our only song . Ginger and hibiscus and all sense of the voluptuously growing land thinned from the air , and left only the keen smell of the sterile sea above , the smell of the ship and tar-stained hold below . For two days , while we doubled the extremity of the island , we saw a silver peak upon the sky . Then , this , too , was gone , and with it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riggings and looked back , seeing nothing , saying nothing , but remembering the shadows of tall palms shimmering on silver beaches , moonlight in a scented flood across the cereus clusters and the humming cane , hulas of bright arms and excited thighs beside the cooking-fires where the girls threw off their tapas and had no names , except the name of earth itself . . . happy , unstinting , ever-springing earth for men to wander , to riot on knee-deep among the vines , to lie in when sleep came in a golden dawning . . . earth hurled miraculously heavenward out of the sea , out of the hot red lips of Etoway the omnipotent , the god so strong that he could be both good and evil . " Bravo ! " I had made myself say , almost as though to the Evil One ... for he also is a god . We sailed northing into storms.  |p153THROUGH  storms , with the bronze sky quivering like a gong , and sleety winds clawing our rigging , while the spray on our taffrail piled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to the cold deck now . We juniors stayed gladly below when the partners would let us , or in our sour place abaft the forecastle , hearing through a constant quarreling of wooden walls and sudden winter the shrill bewilderment of half-dead pigs and the bawling of orders against the gale . The cannon grew white beards . The portholes wore new windows of opaque , roughly toughened brine which left us dark and sightless , only the swing of our stomachs in the swinging pipesmoke telling us which way the ship rolled at the moment , and how badly . Once , when I had been sent for to bring some inventory and settle another argument between M'Kay and M'Dougallin the cabin , I saw one of the islanders crossing to the mainmast like a cat on snow . They had given him an old oilcloth , and he would wear nothing else . His brown legs and bare feet came comically out below the blown swirl of it , and he howled with white teeth at the quick downhillthrow of the sea . Behind him the deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes . From the quarterdeck the captain was calling for a double reef in our foresail . We had already struck our topgallant masts and topsails . The canvas would be like jagged iron .   Two weeks ' imprisonment turned all tempers rotten . Under the clamped hatch the air became a soupy poison . On their plans for the Oregon fort M'Dougall and his crony , the elder Stuart , vented much scratching , pompous ruling , and blot-letting and architectural argument . Out , twenty times out , came Mr. Astor 's old letter of appointmentof The M'Dougall as the expedition 's chief on land . Twenty times Mr. M'Kay , hunching sardonic and taciturnof his full knowledge of the Indian wilds , could only let a mouthful of smoke at this cursed letter through the gap in his tightly clamped , tobacco-browned teeth , and watch the smoke mushroom against the paper and fatly glove his partner 's fat hand . The M'Dougall was most furious of all at him for saying nothing . Another time it was a matter of blankets . They sent for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hold . Mr. Astor had had them stowed aboard for West Coast trading , and each scarlet-striped blanket would reap so and so many beaver skins among the Columbia Indians and up Vancouver Strait . But it was beastly cold sleeping aboard , now . Some of the pet clerks had complained , and the partners themselves were only too ready to receive petitions to rifle the bales for blankets . They were passengers , they wanted their due comforts ; each of them probably wanted a new grudge against Mr. Thorn , too . They knew they 'd have to apply to the captain . I could tell from the way they talked of it how much they enjoyed the prospect of his refusal , the growls he 'd surely give them instead , the ease with which they could thereupontease him into hasty , outraging courses . Blankets , by Jesus . . . break the seals on Mr. Astor'sP155cargo to keep those buggerly lairds from catching a bit of gooseflesh ! It was plain baiting . He was worried  --  and we all knew it  --  over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorties , and which he must wait for decent weather to regather . He was worried about the long storm , the constant batter of bow and sides , the new fright and squalor of our freezing livestock , the crew all numbed and bruised and with mean sleet crisping in their beards and nostrils . Worried but proud . Something heroic belonged to him at last . Heroic and incontestable , for he was master now . When he came below for his few hours ' sleep his face wore the mottled blue and red of a steadily fanned and intense fire ; the cold of his wet , rime-chipped clothes would make the partners draw their plaids closer about their shoulders as he stomped by . They had left the unregeneratesea for him to deal with . Let them not bother him with their goddamned little chills and blankets business . They 'd know he was master now . His hard , light little eyes , tiny icicles already melting on their lashes , looked over the table and the untidy papers and the gentlemen hugging their pipes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open hatchway as he passed through , tired but glowing , to his stateroom . He would say nothing . Ile would not need to . From the noisy way he walked , from his look alone , they knew the virtue of his hate for them , the triumph and the new , wind-fed strength of his scorn . God rest his poor , torn soul to-day . And save all living men from the thousand little villainies of long days indoors . It was one of the young clerks  --  M'Gillis or Wallace or one like them from Montreal , I can not remember  --  whoP156first began methodically to goad him . The partners , yawningover their toddies , sick of their amateur drawings and of wrangling among themselves for the next few days , soon took it up . Whenever Captain Thorn went by they managed to switch their talk immediately to Gaelic . They would speak it in stage whispers , mock-mysteriously , with large nods and nudges and weighty , suspicious silences as he passed . Rare sport , a manly revenge . And grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind the shut door all his new self-satisfaction became a stripped , tired spite . He lay back on his horsehair couch and mumbled himself into a fast belief that they were actually planning mutiny against him . They 'd only to start , by God , and he 'd have every Tory bastard of ' em chained ' n ' spread ' n ' cat-o ' - ninetailed . Warm , they wanted to be ? He 'd warm ' em . He 'd teach ' em to go struttin ' around with Mr. Astor 's sidearms , chucklin ' their gibberish of how to steal Mr. Astor 's own ship . Aye , the bloody British liked doin ' things o ' this sort . . . look at the celebrated mutiny of the Bounty , for instance . He was sure of it . He knew . Weather like this , and they 'd the livers to want to toil open the hold and pretend to bother about blankets . . . when it was really powder and knives they were after , of course , and he goddamned well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . That was a waste of time . In his bottomless lack of humor a red wish grew and raged , a wish to believe , and he went suddenly to sleep believing . The man could sleep believing in a mutiny against his life . Melted weather ran down the little brook beds of his face , and when he breathed he sputtered wetness like a baby whale.  |p157Perrault  fell sick and kept to her chart-closet berth . I had excuses enough to visit her there by day , but would not use them . Most often I sent Ovide in to her , instead . I had every right to order my assistants on such errands . Ovide was surly about going , and I thought at first that he merely resented my giving him commands . I was still green at practising authority , and my voice squeaked . I looked for him , one blowing evening , in the sailors ' quarters beyond ours . He and two or three of the restless voyageurs had formed a new habit of trespassing there when they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dice , and Roussel and De Montigny had still some ribands and beads or a few Canadian coppers they could lose . All hands were on deck except one . A seaman  --  a big , dense scapegallows named Adam Fisher , I think  --  had sprained his wrist and was trying to snatch some off-duty sleep behind their noisy game . " Ovide , " I said . I had to say it twice before he looked up . The dice had gathered some tar stain in their travel across the planks , and he was busy polishing them off against his knee . " Ovide ! " This time he did look up , amused . " Ah , M. le Professeur ? " " Since when have you had Captain Thorn 's permission to make a gambling room out " Since storks took to lecturing on morals . " I could let him call me anything he pleased . That sport would soon end . " The captain has asked for the California coast chart , Ovide . You put it away this morning and know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , better 91 " Perhaps , but please get it . " That " please " was my mistake . He stayed squatting over the dice , his fingers resting lightly on the floor against the unruly swinging of the ship . A man of his frame might have sprung at me with ease from this position . There was none of our officers around . The voyageurs were his friends , not mine . " Send Franchere or Matthews or some little someone like that , " he said . " Or get it yourself . " " Franchere and Matthews are attached to the partners . They have plenty to His great , unbraided mane had come up , and his face grew full of mischief . " Or send Adam Fisher . He 'll enjoy what he finds there . " At the sound of his name the bulky sailor started lumberingout of his berth , grinning back without knowing what to grin about , nursing his wrapped wrist . His huge blanched feet were bare , and his clothes had the reek of continual dampness next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleepily down into the dice game , reaching across Ovide for his boots . " Why do n't you frog-eating gamecocks let me sleep ? Send me where ? Where 'll I go ? Tell me that ! " Ovide de Montigny leaned back from him , his eyes catching and then avoiding mine across the seaman 's stupid lurch , and telling me , in spite of all the hostility there was still in them , how immediately he had grown ashamed of himself again , annoyed that he had let such a companion into his game of teasing . The ship threw Adam Fisher hard against him . Both crouching , they both went completely down . For a moment they stayed down , grappling . Ovide was the first up , quick at once to smash his heel into the sailor 's bare instep.  |p161He  began complacently to ask her health , and to give her playful wagers she 'd be as good as new again as soon as the storm receded , and never to mind , she was his  --  always his -- 'I could not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hollow of her throat when he leaned down . His best audience , that was what she really was , I rememberthinking . His best beloved audience . . . call her what he liked , with all the graces of his condescension , but he 'd never have honest insight enough to call her that . I found the California map . This time I needed neither a shove from him nor any sly meaning from her eyes to leave them alone . I shut myself methodically out into the mounting loudness of the cabin crowd . The captain had come below . They stood around him , shouting , affronted , puffed , their cheeks a multiple mirror of his own blown red cheeks . They knew nothing of what they were bellowing about . And he had only the sailor 's side of it . They were all down to calling each other every ugly name in blackguardmanship 's dictionary . " Here , you , Lewis ! " I started to hand Mr. Thorn his chart . He paid no attention to that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell ' emThey did not want to be told . And I had no great ambition to crack my voice against their howling . But I tried . The noise brought Ovide himself out . He was in a heaven of his own , the cause and center of a battle royal , the handsomeblade that would cut our feudists forever and further apart . He struck a gallant attitude , conscious of his tallnessabove them all . " Oh , it was a private matter between me and the seaman , " he said , smiling . " By all " " Then let ' em fight it out atween ' em , " shouted the captain .   They all shouted back . All but Mr. M'Kay . The old explorer waited for quiet to make the one quiet remark of all the uproar . And because he said it so quietly , it took on a grimness , a black finality of threat and ultimatumwhich I doubt he intended : " If you say fight , fight it is ! " said Mr. M'Kay . Captain Thorn was past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had heard what he had been waiting to hear from any one of the partners for months . This meant open mutiny to him . . . and the justification for all his autocratic malice and uprighteous spleen , past and future and forever more . His eyes came straight to mine . His were gray ice and glittering with private victory . Had he not told me ? Had he not dictated as much to me in his letter to Mr. Astor ? My own eyes attempted to protest that he was taking Mr. M'Kay 's remark too literally and strongly , that mutiny was furthest . . . but my eyes went down . They saw the thick red jaw atop his open pea-jacket as they went down . Ovide had had his little play and was already tired of it . He turned back toward the chart room , fingered its door latch for a few luxurious seconds , then yawned , shrugged , sauntered away in the opposite direction , up the hatch . All in one minute 's spin he had been applauded , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living runs to little plays like these , the brave Ovides . But it probably never even occurred to him that he had been the cause  --  and could , with a little less pose , less temper , and supercilious smile , have been the end , instead  --  of a feud which would henceforth admit no truces , no simplest decencies , and would go on widening , stiffening , blasting the very last of us . . . . How could he know what he had done ? Or know even now , for he still lives . . . and the living never know , nor the dead instruct the living.  |p163Leaden  skies pressed the storm down upon the waves and watched me perfecting my new duties of Devil 's disciple . In my own secret council chamber , my black refuge of the powder run , I had had it out with myself for sure , had decided ... and did not need to tell any other man among us my decision . Nor tell myself it , either , many times over . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he took it for granted . . . as well as all of them , partners , voyageurs , young clerks , now took it for granted , too . The captain 's man and messenger , his suspected spy in the forecastle , his shadow up and down the hatchway whenever he had any business to do with the cabin . Perrault , his cabin boy , and I. Until Perrault was well again , back on sea legs and able to run some lesser errands , I alone . Captain Thorn 'd have no further personal dealings with the partners , nor they with him . His way past them to and from his stateroom was invariably prickly with Gaelic or , worse still , with silence in the shadows . They sent him curt messages through me , and insisted on writtenanswers which must be kept and filed for Mr. Astor 's possible inquiry . Their factions sat apart at the cabin mess , Captain Thorn motioning his officers close about him and munching his pork rolls with thick , dry jaws through the testy quiet . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was ordered to go sit from then on among his friends the landlubbers . Official notes flew to enlarge that incident . Even here , with only a few feet of chipped crockery separatingthem , Mr. Thorn must send little Perrault down the pine board with a proper salute to Mr. M'Dougall . No other intercourse . An ' no sniggering , damn you ' n ' your little yeller girl 's face . . . get down there quick ' n '   deliver ' em this without tryin ' to be so funny about it . " The days grew a little warmer again , and black rains burdened the wind . March 16th , Captain Thorn , Lieut . U. S. N. , CornmandingMr . John Jacob Astor 's Tonquin , Columbia River bound , informs Mr. Duncan M'Dougall , senior partner on board , that we stand at latitude 35  --  11 ' north , longitude 138  --  16 ' west , wind shifting to S.S.W. and landing probablewithin the week , all passengers herewith duly notified for disembarkation at earliest convenience . March 19th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity to lay to for a second successive night , and the inability to take observations in such headway weather . Captain Thorn insists on excusing himself from any further questions , and refers all passengers hereafter to his clerk , Mr. Lewis , for such information as can be properly given out . March 22nd , Captain Jonathan Thorn , etc. , complimentsMr . Duncan M'Dougall on having such remarkable eyes in his head and perceiving at three miles ' distance the Oregon shoreline which Second Mate Mumford 's glass had already picked up at twelve miles in the early morningwhile the passengers still slept . Mr. Alex . M'Kay 's concern over the launching of the whaleboat to sound the channel ahead is uncalled for and against all proper discipline , and persistence in it will only force Captain Thorn to prove how prepared he is for any last-minute evidences of mutiny on the part of those who can not mind their own business . . . . I managed at least to leave out the goddamned from in front of that final word . The rainy wind shrieked fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild along a wild , tall coast . To our journey 's end the storm kept after us , snapping , wolfing , unappeasable until we flung it our first sacrifices.  |p165Landsmen  were not allowed on deck while the whaleboat was preparing . Through the cabin ports we saw the swinging land , a great , shaggy head of forest grayness , pre-historic and incalculable , snow-scaled , knobby with harsh wilderness and capricious rock . We saw its long tongue of shallows lapping greedily in the combers just ahead ; and , as we tacked away , saw the mist-dripping tail of many cold mountains far behind . Land , land , the river , Oregon . . . Mr. Astor 's land , and the high woods swarming with peltry and black rain . My head was out of a cannon port as we circled toward deep water again , and the weather assailed my eyes , filled them for one anguished moment with the foolish daub of a different seashore , all sunlight and crumbling temples among the poppies by a turquoise bay , lovely as a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stubborn creak of the loosening whaleboat , shouts tattered and unintelligiblein the wind , the curious cries of the Sandwich Islanderswhen gray birds came about them in the rigging . Chief Mate Fox had the whaleboat in charge , and with him went Nadeau , two of the Lapensees , Ignace and Basile , and the sailmaker , John Martin . Not one genuinely able seaman would the quarterdeck spare them . I had a few hasty words with Mate Fox before he went . He was in the galley , cramming his jersey pockets with biscuits and dried beef . His face was a green moon , blank and mild but filmed with the moisture of excitement which fat men 's faces suffer . Captain 's orders and he had to go . but look at that chalky sea , that bar ahead , and not one honest-to-codfish sailor along with him.  | Captain 's orders , in spite of all the partners ' remonstrancesand Mate Fox 's own earnest , stuttering protest . It was Fate and that was all . Mate knew it . Mate 's uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drowned on just such a stormy bar along this very coast ten years ago . . . he 'd told me that story time and time again . But he could n't blubber it now to Captain Thorn . He knew Captain Thorn thought him a stuffed good-fornothing . And that Captain Thorn would only order him to hurry up when the partners ' petition for delay till better weather was presented . Mild , simple-minded , trying hard to keep up some fairdayjollity , he went on cramming his pockets with food , mumbling and mopping . . . while Nadeau came by with the pair of old sheets which The M'Dougall had noisily insisted they take along for emergency sails , and the two Lapensees stood whittling down their oar handles , laughing , jabbering heathenish au ' voirs and guttural bets with the other voyageurs . Here was white water with a vengeance , the boastful French canoemen 's turn to prove themselves at last . In went their canoe paddles , too , and their blankets , a pistol , and a cooking-pot , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounding plumb , and then themselves , an uncertain , gangly few , clinging hard to thwarts and oarlocks as the whaleboat sank down our side . She passed my port . Her wood screeched on the Tonquirt'swet wood , gave me the exaggerating closeness of her little keel , then the dark profiles of shoulders and faces . . . that round , rueful moon-face of Fox . . . as she splashed and untied upon the sea . We watched her throw away towards shore , towards the four-mile stretch of foam across the river 's mouth . She climbed from the trough astern , righted herself , sagged down again . The waves lifted her for little instantsp167into our sight , each time further and smaller , her five people unrecognizable at their oars and rudder , then **27;1298;TOOLONG in the gray seething of the maddened shoreline and the rain . . . and each time less personal , less ours or part of us , until all cheerfulness about her died away , all indignation . . . and all question , too . When evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , of winds as tired as we were , and of all of us proving ourselves famous prophets ; now we had all known from the first that the whaleboat could not succeed , would never return . The M'Dougall had known it more positively than anyone else , of course . The captain did not come below at all . Night long , he stayed staring into the squalls , at the silver particles of the peculiarly frozen Oregon mist which danced upon the dark , and at the gash of white , softly thunderous water across the blackness a-bow . . . stared and searched until a serene dawn gloated over the tinting peninsula head and clearly showed him the shore again , the sea , and the apparently unchanneled river mouth , and no trace of boat or man whatever . I sent Perrault up to him , a little past eight bells , with a cup of hot rum . He sent her sharply back with it . She said his voice had been icier than the air . He had told her merely to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailmaker 's things for auction , and to seal Mate Fox 's effects for stowage in the hold . The hope we had of a calmer morning was soon forgot . All that next day we fought a riled and sand-choked sea , hauling off again and again into far , glum water , returning ever with the current close the coast . Ovide had come in to me in the officers ' quarters with some crazy scheme of his . He would go overboard alone the next time we were nearest to the shore . What did I think of that , eh ? A couple of tied slats from the gangway sties were all he needed to keep him afloat , and a paddle to steer him leeward of the bar . He could do what no brittle boat could . Reconnoiter , no doubt meet up with Indians . . . Indians were Indians , and did any man among us know them better than he did ? . . . he could parley and learn , perhaps , the native passageway , signal us from shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at him dully . He had slept well , damn him . He was the only neat and lusty one among us to-day . He had taken time to rebraid his hair . That fact alone , had I never had two words with him before , would have told me how much he really meant of what he now proposed . So handsomely , though , he proposed it . " Ask Captain Thorn yourself , " I said . " It sounds extraordinarilybold to me . " He gave me a quick , gratified glance . " The captain 's no special friend of mine , as he is of yours , Lewis . I 'm sure , you 've only to ask him on my L zhalf- - " " Since when do you need any man 's permission to throw yourself overboard and drown ? " I was going through the first mate 's bunk box . My hands were deep in the sour , damp old clothes which Mr. Fox had left behind him . Ovide eyed me again , leaning back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Whose permission did I ask when I jumped in after Julie Perrault ? Yours , perhaps . . . oh , yes , yours ? " " Hush ! " The cabin was by no means empty , anyone might have heard what he called her . He began to laugh . " Hush ! " he mimicked me , inevitablymistaking what I meant . " Never mind , my poor Lewis , P169nobody expects you to come with me . I go alone . . . I always go alone on such . . . " His hands were brilliantly expressive . " Are you serious ? Or mad , or what ? " I had wanted to say , " Or only play-acting ? " But that would have stung instead of flattered him , as every other exclamation flattered him . And what was the use of quarreling in this already raging gloom ? Besides , how could I be sure ? He would fool me , impress me , keep me worrying for him , admiring him secretly , begrudgingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shrugged his splendid shoulders now ... . I got up and pointed out the shorescape to him through a rain-stippled porthole . We could see from here a funnel of the sky , all mountain-rimmed and bubbly with gray cloud , as hostile as the confused , sand-gorging ocean which boiled in the river 's black-toothed mouth . " A raft of pigsty boards and one self-appointed hero in that great dragon 's jaw " Ah , Lewis , there you are , a great dragon 's jaw ! You beat me there . I could never have said it as classically as that . I must always leave it to you to be our romancer  --  in words . " I let him have his smile . I went back to the dead mate 's bunk . Another moment , and he would have been telling me , without the least misgiving , how he was our romancer in deeds , instead . . . that that was the difference between us , was n't I aware ? That I had one of those imaginations born of books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles hardened in the forest , eyes trained to nothing except whirlpools and gunfire and the frank glances of Parisiennes , ears only for the crude songs of vivandieres and yowling squaws . He would have put it like that to give himself a coat of modesty as well .   Another moment after that , and I could probably have goaded him with one or two words of incredulity and mock into hurling himself actually overboard , a hotheadedand preposterous nuisance , impossible to turn and rescue in our present plight . I knew that much about him by now . He would do anything to amaze any audience , one or a thousand strong . He would do more than anything to prove his pose . Another moment . . . But I let him have his smile . I had found a piece of paper in one of the pockets of the old jacket I was packing , and had recognized my own handwriting . It was Captain Thorn 's most recent reprimandto Mr. Fox for indolence and laxity of conduct among the partners , a threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated to me only three or four days ago . I did not show it to Ovide . He had lounged away , promptly all content that he had silenced me , awed and put me back in my place in the theater pit before the romancer in deeds . Quite as promptly , I knew , he would forget that he had ever proposed to rescue us so singularly from my dragon 's maw . He was right enough about me . Cape Horn like an old philosopher 's beetling forehead , Ohehy a giant flower floatingfrom the sky , Oregon a beast of fable with its tongue thrust into the sea and its tail of snow spikes . . . similes , similes out of schoolbooks and silly operas . Similes as tuppenny and tawdry as the bad daubs of Naples Bay and ... and ... I could not remember at the moment what that other painting had been in the Broadway peepshow . Never mind , as cheap as all that , anyhow , as untrue and unavailing . Romance in word and thought , dragging trite imageries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its long since shriveled navel cord . Meeting arctic cold and tropicP171blaze with the same old arias and allusions , accosting every sudden living situation with the same old deferences and self-disciplinings , fearing yet always hungering dryly for all the actualities that were everywhere along our way , for all the swanking and bullying and muscular gallantry of my self-sufficient Ovide . This was no season for rages and stale regrets . I had had all that out with myself long ago in the ship 's black bowels . Noisome and bitter as that night had been , it had given me my new life , the life of the lean , necessitous Me who had punched a mean , pimply little man away and lain gladly with his savage wench all night , emptying my loins of envy and despair . I had no further reason to be jealous of Ovide . Perrault was a young idiot , smeared with vulgarity and self-conceit . She deserved the treatment he gave her . Time was when I had thought her throat a song of Mozart 's . Now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And the old man , Mozart 's librettist , telling tales all the summer night long to the tune of a deserted fountain and ripe apples falling in the dark , while we sang and made the night a respite from all reality , from all time , a night when time had faded from my fears as gently as his old face faded into summer dusk , and there was only his old voice from some strange , sweet nothingness where time was nothing , too . . . . Where was my old charlatan now ? The cranky weather screamed against us . The tide and the untamed wind fought over us as greedily as before , mauled and spun and periled us all afternoon against the river 's entrance . This was my now , here was my whole life in time , my completest , most pressing and real time , I told myself . This was my turn to smile . . . at Ovide and them all . I went on with my work . Deep at the bottom of Mate Fox 's box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirting , a cracked little looking glass . I sat a short while with it cupped in my hand , gazing hard into it , unable to see myself and blaming this fact on the unlighted cabin , but seeing well enough a young , chubby boy 's face instead , pink cheeked , simple eyed , and full of mischief . I tore up the captain 's note . The devil 's disciple could do him no shrewder favor . And , when I had sealed the box and seen it stowed , I grit my teeth and gave the little mirror to Perrault for her closet wall . She never asked whence it came . The sea alone cried out all night to ask me why I had not at least hurled it after its dead owner . Or so I imagined  --  and that was my final indulgence in imagery . Five men were already lost . We 'd lose three more before we crossed into the river . We lay a little north of Cape Disappointment , anchored against the current in thirteen brown , sand-curdled fathoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many reefs . For two days we had nipped and scurried , pushed our nose in , backed , fled , circled , pushed , and fled again . Misty noon or stone-gray midnight , the bar was a wall of yellowish violence we knew no way to pass . First , early of the twenty-fourth , we launched the pinnace , Mate Mumford growling things into his longgrown , blowing beard as he monkeyed aboard her . Mate Mumford was back by noon , his beard now dripping like seaweed fresh from the breakers . The captain could go try his own luck against that sort o ' sea . In the three o'clock calm the Messrs . Davie Stuart andP173M'Kay volunteered . They offered Ovide an oar with them , but Ovide had a distaste for partnerships in glory . They , too , came back soon enough , drenched and spent , puffing a fine yarn about savages on the cape rocks and motioning them to pull around . But not a word of a possible passage . Towards evening , though , with the breeze from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash for it . A last employment for the pinnace : to slap ahead of us , sounding our way , signaling us through the charges of spume and the half-drowned bars all burning with the sundown . No mate could be spared her , now . With the Tonquin close behind , her rowers need fear nothing worse than a wetting . Two Sandwich Islanders were in her , and our three oldestmechanics  --  Job Aitken , the Scotch rigger and caulker , John Coles , our other sailmaker , and my gruff , deaf friend , the armorer , Stephen Weeks  --  three ancients out of a nursery rhyme . I was one of those detailed to push them off . Their white hair whipped foolishly across rheumy eyes as they stumbleddown between the thwarts . The Islanders ' brown faces glittered like copper idols ' . They were unused to our clumsy American oars . My hook was pure flame from the sunset as I held them from stoving against the ship 's side . A little pity for a cockleshell  --  I already had one foot over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce a jump at all . But before I could get my other foot over I heard a girl scream out behind me . Then it was too late again . The boat was splashing free , the captain roaring me back to the deck , and Perrault turning fast away , refusing to meet my gaze , with her face the one white spot in the evening 's windy color . P174We followed under easy sail . Six fathoms , four fathoms .. . danger there , then a safe six again . Then four once more , and the breakers dancing up our bow to the hard tune of our bottom scraping over rock . Six , they signaled . . . as the breeze strengthened with the shadows and shoved us clear , almost abreast of them , a pistol shot to larboard of them across the darkening spite of the ebb tide . Then four fathoms again , scant three , they signaled us wildly as the breeze must carry us past . We were the wind 's game , they the tide 's , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We struck twice , more violently than before . Deck and masts shuddered , our bow flung up snorting each time with a sudden mane of water . A great stone , high as our poop , rose against us in the dusk , barely dodged our onrush , fought us off from its steamy girdle of waves . We shouted to the people in the pinnace to come back aboard . We were leaving her behind . The gray air was slashed with combers ' spray , and the spray cut our cries . Even if the pinnace heard us , she could not pull against that tide any more than we could linger for her in this gray sport of shallows , lurching rock , and surf as high as geysers . We struck again , all our beams shocked and protestant . We pressed to the quivering rail , as out of reach as possible of the masts when they might snap and topple , and shouted , shouted . . . valedictory to the damned . Six times our bottom slammed . Below decks the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . Something heavy had broken loose in the hold . Ropes parted in the rigging with a piercing report . P175Six times we slid forward in the breakers , with two men clinging to our wheel and uprooting our smashed figureheadfrom the river mouth 's deafening tangle . Distance had been transmuted into an immeasurable roar . Time was a throe of protests , a blind shouting into spray against all this concert of inevitabilities and convulsions , against all the unblended and unrhythmic noises of a little wooden world upheaving , chuting , careening on . . . a shouting for shouting 's sake , a shouting against time itself . In the pinnace far behind us they were waving arms . We could see nothing else of them than these tiny half arms waving above the water , as though she had capsized . We could hear no cry when she did actually capsize . Some of us saw the little white belly she gave to the dark as she spilled her crew . . . or thought we saw , and could shout no more . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , waiting the night wind and the flood tide . It grew wholly dark . Sight was taken from us . The cape lost all shape and whereabouts , the waves still ran at us from out of nowhere , and only the harsh straining of our wheel told us how much our anchors tugged and our bow was being swung back seaward in the black , wet air . We had let our best bower go . Over there , beyond the horror of the bar , in the dense suggestion of long , low land which must be the night 's sightless shadow of Point Adams , the pinnace floated overturned . . . or had they righted her ? And which of them . . . the dark alone could tell which of them , of any of their foolish , Mother Goose crew . . . but the dark had larger things to tell . For the dark brought a new night tide , a broad , grandiose , invisible benevolence of the singing flood , a new wind choral with power , a tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sea to distant mountains . P176The dark had no voice small enough to tell of three old men spilled from a cockleshell , or of two Sandwich Islanderskicking naked in the cold . We set free again . We rode the flood to shelter around Disappointment 's coil , to good anchorage behind a long sand spit in Baker 's Bay . We were officially on the river . Midnight , we slept among the several empty bunks and hammocks , too weary to remark them , too sorry and numbed to talk ... except when someone would shout out in his sleep , sob , shiver , and shout , shout . No , not I. I slept . Officially on the river , midnight , March 25th , 1811 , in Mr. Astor 's name , his will be done , his commerce increased , his empire consummated and eternally secured , the while the wind marches sentry-wise between his seas and his forest uplands , and his good , obedient , tired servants sleep . Old Weeks we found ashore , when our landing party searched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naked and livid , his few old teeth churning with the early morning cold . He alone , of the white men in both boatloads , could be left alive . He thought one of the Islanders still lived , though ; but he had lost him in the starless forest last night , in the maze of black cedars through the further blackness , and had heard him whimpering piteously behind him as the frost writhed in his own puffed legs and his bitter , saltsoakedbruises . The other Islander was surely dead . He had frozen to death in the half-filled pinnace . All night the little boat had joggled on the bar , after the three of them , stripped of their soaked clothes and fighting for her overturned gunwale in the foam , had managed to right her , jerk someP177water out of her , scramble up and in , bailing , drifting , bumping , bailing . . . until feet and faces , their naked bellies wet and fiery cold , the very water in their choked lungs , all froze . When one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , lying naked on his companion 's lifeless nakedness in the puddled torture of the bottom of the boat , speechless and exhausted as the dead , his freezing arms around the frozen corpse , his shrunken lips striving desperately to breathe life back again into the crisping mouth and nostrils . Washed ashore , Weeks had stumbled on ahead , screamingwith the pain  --  and the relief  --  of making his legs move again in the forest quandary . He thought he had heard the living Islander sometimes , but only sometimes . He had heard him dragging his friend 's body towards the trees . It was many hours before we found him . He had pulled himself under some rocks , lay there with legs gashed and horribly swollen , his glazing eyes turned straight up towards the branches of a tree where , climbing somehow , he had managed to hang his dead companion 's body away from the wild beasts and the little desecrations of the ground . That evening the captain ordered Franchere and me to accompany the rest of the Sandwich Islanders on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuit , lard , and tobacco . They dug a pit scant inland from the surf , where the cedars started and the shadows of the forest ran gladly to the river edge . While they worked I saw another and stranger shadow on the sand ; and , looking up , I saw the birch tree all cold gold in the sunset , with the frost still stubborn in some of its forks , and then the brown , glisteningcontortion of body and face which hung there . P178The sun was strong upon him . It made a burnished ghost of him . I had never known him well . These Islanders stayed strangers to us aboard ship . I could certainly not recognize him now . A brown man , one of two dozen , assorted sizes . I remembered a hot , lazy day in King Tamehameha 's courtyard , when I had waited with long-nosed , cynical Kraimoku and the bored French tutor for His Fat-Necked Majesty to arrive and sanction his twenty-four subjects ' departure , and to take his accustomed percentage of their enlistment sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowsing over the road to the old morai , where this poor devil might have been buried in his own kindly ground . What did that matter ? Any ground , anywhere . Death is not at all particular . Why should the dead be ? I looked down . Franchere , sitting apart squat-legged as a Hindu , was busy taking notes . The Islanders had finished the grave . They laid the dead man beside it on the sand . They placed their food beneath his arms . Under his chin and his genitals they stuffed little rolls of tobacco . He was provenderedfor whatever other world . . . whatever other world . Silently , with religiously closed eyes , they transferredhim to the pit . As they lifted him a little sand beetle scuttled across his chest . As if that mattered , either . . . . I think I was the only one to notice it . Franchere continued taking notes . They put stones and sand upon the corpse . The last cold sunlight colored the heap they made . Then they knelt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all turning their faces like lonely children 's to the east . One of them must play priest . He went to the water 's edge , scupped water into his hat , came back and sprinkled all his countrymen . He was reciting something now , and they all gave wild , low moaning answers , the universal , P179melancholy dialogue of litany over the dead . I thought I could make out the name of Etoway , their god . . . but the god 's name never matters . When they were through , they went quickly back to the shore , looking neither this way nor that , nor ever behind them . Franchere rolled his journal , tied it , stuck his crayon neatly into the knot of the string , and got up , dusted himself off , to follow them . I followed slowly , too . I saw some little buds of flowers starting under the old black leaves around me . The rich woods ' soil ran moist to the strand . This man 's body would bloom quickly anew , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of great cedars . Far from the palms and warm , rioting ground of his youth . . . but far , too , equally far from the sterile , sea-bleached mounds with toppled headstoneswhich are sailors ' luxuries , or from the sea 's own green and monstrous depths . I could not pity him . His Etoway was both good and evil , and in such a strong god 's scheme it would not matter where his body lay , or when the beetles found it . The ship stood small across the cove , drying her sails . The boat had returned to her since bringing us ashore , and was now grating up the beach again to row us back . She carried a new load . The Islanders waited , huddled and pathetic , while she spilled it . It was . the first lot of pigs from our gangway . Koaster , the Russian carpenter , was with them , with nails and tools to build them a temporary sty . He shouted joyfully , the pigs squealed , the sailors roared with laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted grunts from snouts guzzling deep among the ferns , the trample of fouling hoofs , the cheery , promising sound of an ax on wood . P183APRIL 'S first week was all of rain , a soft , slouching rain which curtained the mountains from us and gave the river around our keel a gray , monotonous jigging . But the deck grew clean , the spars glistened freshly ; and when we saw the near shore we saw how the last of winter had been washed from its gruff rock and dripping tree boughs , and that the sun would have plentiful moisture of young stems and ferns and berry blooms to drink up through this dramatic soil . Over there , beyond the rain , the village of Chinook Indian houses sent up smudges of squashed smoke against their shell heaps and the towering , wet hill behind . On the south side of the river , on Point Adams 's long spit , the houses of the Clatsops stood close to sea , bare cedar boxes , so bare , so low to the horizon , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mate Mumford was sure he had caught some Chinooks through his glass , but his glass was rain washed and he could furnish few details . He saw the houses were all square and windowless , all enormous in comparison with the moving figures , and that strange things were cut into their fronts and on the tall poles along the strand . The Indians waited , too . Across the rain , the bay , the gray , jigging river , they must have waited as we did , wondering were we humans , and whether it was we who had hid the spring sun from them . . . we , who , after all these months , should see spring again ourselves , smell spring again upon the hills and in the suddenly starry   thickets under transformed cottonwoods and cedars .. . and for all the sun 's sweet goods and healing charities be thankful . Then it cleared , and out from the Chinook village a canoe rode towards us in the green , bright noon . In circles , far at first , then each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must have been sixty feet long , a great , carved , multi-colored creature meant for war or fierce seafaring or some most special ceremony , and there were fully fifty or sixty men in her . Her long , lanceolate paddles sang to the sun whenever they came up . Her adzed flanks were red . The intricate and majestic sculpture of her projecting prow , the scarlet and orange and white of so many painted bodies which leaned to her paddling , threw down reflections as gaudy and uneasy as torches ' into the river . They brought her ever closer . We could hear the shrill , nasal chatter aboard her . She was examining us at her leisure . We could see what her little men looked like , and how they looked up at us from the rhythm of their ochred and striped shoulders . We could not see their whole faces . All except one of them wore bonnets of woven bark . That one was doubtless the chief , standing high in the perpendicularstern , who wore the scalp of a slain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But over this grisly headdress , and over his body smeared with colored fish oil , he was sprinkled with bits of white down . This , then , was their sign of peace . We should have peace if we wanted it . We should have brothers among the Chinooks . This was what it must have meant , for Mr. M'Kay was ripping hastily into an old pillow he had found and fillingP185the air around us with feathers in reply . We should be brothers , white men and red , and our love be baptized gravely in goose feathers . Their chief was a thick , crook-legged little old man . He had only one eye . Slowly , as we cheered him , he gave us their final sign of trust : opened his bare , greasy , limechalkedbreast to whatever spears or arrows we carried . His other , closed eye seemed the climax of a solemn wink . But , even as he raised his arms , one of his tribesmen yelped with fright . A few days ago we had already moved our cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of the cannon , when the sun was just overhead , ran straight upon the water like the shadows of the wings of a gigantic bird . The canoe had come so close to us , its bow flamed in and out among these shadows . Fear of what . . . even Mr. M'Kay could not explain it to us afterwards . . . whether they thought themselves about to be crushed by these black , overhanging bones of thunder , or whether it was rash sacrilege they were committingagainst some immemorial myth , or some more recent scandal of ships which spit fire from under their wings . . . but suddenly they all yelped along , lashed their fantastic craft away again , and fled for their huts across the bay . I did not laugh with Ovide and the rest , or bawl cranky curses after them like the captain . It was my guess , they would be back again before long , still shy of our guns , of course , and down to littler , less impressive shovel-nosed canoes , but as anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaver skins and sea otters ' , shaking their wares high for us to notice , shrieking and counting excitedly on their fingers , begging to trade , to wrangle and profit and cheat . . . to trade as only friends and brothers do . Our squall of feathers had subsided . I kept seeing one placidly shut eye , one open , shrewd , intensely black and Asiatic , in the fat little face of hideous stripes and fishoiledsleekness underneath a slain foe 's scalp . Dignity , that last refuge of lazy minds , made all the partners ' plans mysterious . They knew how , having brought them to the land , Captain Thorn was only too frankly anxious to be rid of them and up the Vancouver coast on his own little exploring fling . It seemed to give them a special satisfaction to stay aboard , to call the Tonquintheir temporary quarters , to use her deck as a trading table , to take their own sweet time and , now that we were theoretically ashore , to nip at him with unwarranted orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so . They asked for anchor down . Down it went . Now they 'd have it up again , and up it came for two or three miles of listless floating on the flood , of staring into the foggy woods for a point which would suit all their fine ideals of a home site . Ross and Pillet had been sent rowing south . They came back with no news except of the oddly white earth of Point Adams , and how handsome this would be to whitewashour inner walls when we had built the fort , and of how poor and ugly and in awe of them the Clatsop villagers had been , all filthy with rancid oil over their misshapen faces . Mr. M'Kay , Ovide , Matthews , Farnham , rowed north at the same time , up through the jerky weather , rain in the core of the mist , gray sunlight gnawing at the rain . There was Perrault with them , too . The little fool had let her hair grow long again , as though all danger of discovery . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sickly , pouting prima donna . For an instant before theP187fog reduced them to a splash of unseen oars , I saw how thin she had grown , and how her enlarged eyes , strangely fixed on Ovide across the boatload , now carried a look which would make it impossible to hide much longer the fact that she was a woman . Ovide was smiling out at his oar blade . He knew she was watching him . Then they all belonged to the mist . They had left stupid work for those of us who stayed behind . Sure enough , trading had already begun . All yesterdaythe shovel-nosed canoes , heaped with wet beaver skins , had been poling out to us . Little red faces , bulgeeyedfrom the horrible misshapings of their heads , squashed between rain mantles and conical hats of reed , had screamed incessantly up at us , gibbered with satisfaction over the penny nails , jackknives , and worthless empty bottles we had tossed them in exchange . Their pelts lay stinking in the forecastle , waiting the drying of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , note the rips , the arrow holes and trap marks , the sizes , ages , lusters . It must all go down into the book . Pelts are merchandise ; merchandise is wealth ; wealth must be counted . I had Wallace and Franchere helping me . They had not served warehouse terms , as I had , and had to be taught how to stretch a skin and use their finger nails against the fur in search of thicket sores and lice eggs . This bending and scratching bored them . I gave them no rest from it . They had not served , as I had , a whole year in the snuffy dust and menial back-breaking of the roadwayto wealth . Well , let them start now . Once , when I looked up , I saw the captain in the doorway . He gave me a quick , sarcastic glance , but there was approbation in it  --  the only time I ever recognized it there  --  and then he motioned me outside . Those two famous companions in diplomacy , the Messrs.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our small-boats for a mission of their own . They were returning the other day 's state visit of the one-eyed Chinook chieftainand his huge canoeful of savages . They were marvels to behold . They wore their scarlet regimental coats , their clan kilts , shrieking tarlatans tight across their bellies . They must have seen us goggling at them from the rail . They rowed off with difficulty  --  but also with infinite composure . " Do you remember those Christmas sausages in the meat shops , sir , " I said , " so fat and kingly in their colored paper frills ? . . . " I had known this would burst his temper . He began to chase my little sentence with a pack of hoarse , humorlessrages . Yes , Christ Almighty , what a pair they looked like , and how he hoped the Indians ' d let the air out of ' em , and would slice ' em and broil ' em before M'Dougall would have a chance to pull out that British flag that the captain knew he was carrying hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausages , by God , I 'd said it , like ... as pompous as . . . as .. . I watched his own broad face puff and redden in its run after words . His old green pea-jacket was no match for their masquerade finery , but he wore it with the same stout pride . And the same faces . . . it would have given him a fatal stroke to know how much the same as theirs . I went back into the forecastle . The smell of damp pelts was even stronger than that of tar . Wallace was idling . He stood holding a jagged patch of fur . Even he could know it was a beauty . The daylight stroked it with golden fingers . A perfect pelt . A good pelt . I took it and gave it a place of honor on the pile . Mr. Astor would be pleased to know we had had to pay only three nails and a sixpenny chisel for it here . P189I kept hearing that thick , crushing speech of his while we worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a million-aire . " A thousand thousand things happen in a lifetime . Time is never long enough to recall them all , the little things said without meaning and yet meaning all our future years , the careless things done and undone in the craze of complete disregard , the million million things which swarm upon our eyes , are seen , released , forgotten utterly until . . . until now . I remembered so perfectly how he had said that . His gross , powerful accent was in my ears again . And over my eyes , as though it were dust that must fly by sheer habit out of any furs I handled , a speckling picture of New York in the neat summer , the old beaux sweltering under their heavy beaver hats , the young girls riding beside them in carriages Battery-bound . And a young , dark hoyden laughing down at me across the horses ' lowered heads and the sweetly clipped grass . To-morrow I must cut her hair . I must speak to her . Something actually , bodily wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must ask her . To hell with her ! Was I her keeper ? I snapped at Wallace . " You , there , get back to work . " The mist oozed thick through the bulkhead , and the reek of our booty grew as acrid and choking as hot smoke . Our proud ambassadors were gone three squally days . They were returned to us on the tenth in two large Chinook canoes , Mr. Stuart sitting cross-legged and placid in the high stern of one , The M'Dougall nothing less than a god of gracious plumpness in the other . Their relation of experienceslasted all that afternoon . P190Scorning a heavy sea and full of their sense of duty to find us a proper site for the fort , they had set out across the bay against all the Indians ' advice . A wave had upsetthem before they were fifty yards from the village strand . They had been followed and rescued and pulled cordiallyashore again by the slacks of their kilts . Since neither of them knew how to swim , they owed their lives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged the debt and pressed cotton tassels and penny nails into the hands of the dumb Indians who had brought them back aboard the Tonquin , we might be celebrating a nation-wide Te Deum . Captain Thorn marched back and forth on the edge of our crowd , pretending not to listen . But around a large fire , where their clothes had hung , steaming dry , they had been regaled with all the delicacies of the cedar hut , dried salmon flakes , berry blocks , and toasted , oil-steeped halibut skin , and with the grave silence of strangers who have no syllables in common , nor even a single mutual gesture to cope with the risk of misunderstanding . The Indian men had been naked in the huge , dark , firestrungindoors . So had they , too , been naked , dissolving in pudginess and embarrassment , striving to hold to their superiority of white skin and Scotch baronial poise in the hectic nude , benignly permitting the mirthless , inquisitive squaws to pinch their legs and find them flesh and bone . A daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her little black eyes were set awry in the crevices between her squashed forehead and her high , oily cheeks . She had greased herself plentifully in the white men 's honor , and had dusted her chin with mica and bright sea sand . The M'Dougall had had to see how young she was , and how her short red legs burnedP191through the chinks of her bark apron , and his own nakednesshad troubled him sorely then . He loved this part of his tale . He would have told it four times over if he had found fresh audiences . He was full of moral indignation against the little red Jezebel . He had given her a proper lecture , he assured us . I could see him reaching for his still wet kilts to quell his old bachelor belly , and how he must have turned his head away like a true British gentleman from the solemn insinuationof Chief Comcomly 's closed eye . Then , their own tobacco ruined , they had had to take some from the Indians ' kinik-kinik patch ; but none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be crammed in the mouth and chewed with sticks of clamshell lime . . . it had raised white blisters on their tongues . They had had priceless bear rugs and mountain goats ' wool to sleep on , and food and fire and ever more oily food , while they drowsed like gods among strange , obsequiouslittle people who would not dare try to match languages with them . Their first night there , the chief had stayed awake for hours to supervise the fire tending by the slaves . He could not have been more kind . Once , deep towards dawn , The M'Dougall said he had awakened and seen Father Comcomly squatting in a ring of olachen oil lamps , sucking his lime stick , devoting his tireless open eye to a stack of best quality assorted pelts and copper shields . Another time he had Mr. Stuart 's discarded plaids spread out before him while he counted the colors wonderingly , counted , counted , and grunted softly back to his women nodding in their terraced quartersbehind him , in their loose little aprons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mica-daubed cheeks and fire-stained legs . When the canoes which brought them back to us at the three days ' end were finally gone  --  and with them fiftyP192silly little things their paddlers had wheedled or pilfered from the deck  --  The M'Dougall insisted on showing us all over again how much his mouth had been burned by their tobacco powder . He was sure of boils on his gums and a blister far back in his throat . He stretched his fat lips open . The pink roof of his mouth , the plump , purplish tongue , appeared . I looked away , impatient . But a chuckle from Ovide recalled me . It would be Ovide who 'd notice that the stout old moralist 's double chin was unexplainably slick with fish oil , still rubbed to a gross fiery shine with mica and bright sand . They established the permanent fort site at last , fifteen miles distant from our present anchorage on the south side of the river . The place was called Point George . The wind stitches in the captain 's face flared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twelve men , mechanics , voyageurs , their favorite Montreal clerks , food for a week , and a full lot of tools , and made up the river ponderously ahead of us . When we followed on the late day 's tide they were already encamped at the bottom of a small bay . We anchored outside , a few hundred yards off shore . Great half-burnt logs were rolling down the bank . There was a running shock of many axes hacking at thick trunks . Voices came over the water with all the strength of spring and new , hopeful tasks in them . Smoke rose from the underbrush , pressing through the tree tops ' sieve to join the smoky sky . They were burning the hill clear . Our second small-boat was ferrying some more passengersashore . Ovide had gone with the morning 's first batch . Perrault was with this one , carrying a formal invoice for blankets . . . now , goddamn them , they were welcome top193all the blankets and side-arms they wanted , and the sooner the better , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Thorn , Lieutenant , U.S.N. , on their choice of a name for their fort site . But they had n't necessarily chosen the name , I chuckled back to the captain . They could n't precisely help it if some earlier expedition of benighted Britishers had dubbed the little peninsula after their King George . We could make out the flames pale yellow and tiny in the daylight , and the smoke spurting after them from the feet of the straight , sunny trees . Mr. Thorn reached over the rail as though to toast his temper on those little bonfires . " Mark the date , Lewis . . . ' n ' what I promise , too . Mr. Astor 'll be betrayed before a single log in their first building 's halfway seasoned . " " Aye , sir . " Plots , plots , plots . I gave up grinning . For all I knew , he might be right . Or an utter fool , a bigger fool than any of them . It was only when I suspected that , that I hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 181I . . . you 'll see . " " If I 'm still alive , sir . " I remember saying that . " They 're a pack of Bible-bred sneaks ' n ' blackguards , they are . " " Yes , sir , they 're " Tory traitors , Lewis . " " I suppose they are , sir . " The devil they were , but if the devil said they were . . . so long as he played the devil , not the barking fool . We stood in the stern , watching the small-boat shove her lane through an already bothersome cluster of visiting Indian canoes . The ship wore a deserted air . Her deck was suddenly large with emptiness . Half her humans had been gradually sucked shoreward .   " Damn glad to be rid of ' em , Lewis . Lazy , haughty , filthy lot . " " Yes , sir . " " Little clerks ' n ' landlubbers . " I nodded most gravely . " So they are , sir . " The fool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled only to the magnificent position of fool 's assistant ? " Well , we 'll unload ' em properly ' n ' give ' em all their goods . . . . I 'm not the one to skimp Mr. Astor 's orders . But I 'm off up the coast as soon as I can , I tell you that , Lewis . I 'll take you with me , of course . " The small-boat had landed in the cove . That must be Perrault climbing out of her now . So slight a figure under the huge trees . A great trunk , bare and crisped by lightning , swayed and toppled with slow arc down the sky . We heard the crash and the cheers from here . On the nearer cliff , brightshirtedagainst the blackening shrubs , two of the voyageurswere singing as they stamped the embers down . " You will , sir . . . take me with you , of course ? " " I will . " A gleam came into his little cold eyes , as though he had recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , almost as though he enjoyed the irony I could not erase from my words . " I will , indeed . " He must have known how my lean toes , sick of gripping at a slippery , tilting deck , tired of swinging higher than my head in the storming night , ached for brown ground , for the soft crunch of ferns and old acorns brittle underfoot , for all the cheerfulness and sweet-smelling commonplacesof a strong , fecund earth . He had not lugged in that reference to clerks and landlubbers for nothing . ' His manservant was no mystery to him . " Indeed I will . D' you think I 'd let you waste your time whittlin ' Maypoles ' n ' composin ' spring poems for theseP195gourd-headed savages around here ? You 've grown too useful to me , Lewis . " Play his game . I gave him a smart salute . " You 're my most useful of the whole damned lot , Lewis . D' you know why ? " That gleam in his little ice-gray eyes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . It was when he was thrashingthe tardy sailor , Aymes , and there had been red flecks on the cane and up his stocky forearm , and he had looked up drunkenly happy at Ovide 's loud " Tiens ! " from the rail . " D' you know why B'cause I know it . B'cause you 'll have to go on hatin ' me but followin ' me ... ' n ' you know that , too , in return . B'cause you 're a pedant , ' n ' think you 're a poet , ' n ' have long fingers that 'll never even learn how to tie a decent sailor 's knot , ' n ' that 'll have to go on writin ' things for me . . . whatever I dictate , faithfully , smartly . . .

B'cause you know Latin ' n ' philosophy ' n ' other stuff of the land like that , ' n ' I hate you  --  Christ , of them all I hate you worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible betweensuch as you ' n ' me . " I stood looking down into the icy pleasure of his eyes . We were alone on the idling deck . A canoe of Chinooks , squaws , and silent children with tightly bound foreheads , passed below our poop . We scarce heard them go by . We kept looking into each other . " B'cause , God knows how , you 've changed , Lewis , you 've grown from everybody 's joke butt into my man . My man . . . but a man . B'cause the man in you goes on hatin ' me but being more ' n ' more useful to me , to my own hate that I would n't squander on anything less than a man . " Had he stammered or grown the least red from the perplexity of such unusual talk , I should have let him have full blast all the curses which were puckering my mouth . But he stayed encased in his cold , strict malice , and only his eyes in their nets of hard stitches betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was no fool . " Hate 's held worse men than you ' n ' me together , Lewis . You 'll stay with me , just because .. " My heart bounded . No , he was no fool . The gruff fangs of the Devil himself had stroked and emblazoned my brow . " Now , get to land , man , ' n ' spend the fortnight spyin ' on those goddamned traitors for Mr .. Astor 's next report . " It was Farnham who finally asked it aloud : where , all this while , were Mr. Wilson Price Hunt and his party of overlanders whom we should have found waiting for us here on the Columbia ? We had all been wondering this , when evening came and the axes rested and the woods stopped hurling back the new echo of mallets and anvil . . . all grumbled it sleepily to ourselves , or , if a little bolder , whispered it to those next us around the smudge fires . Our idle talk died , and a silence deeper than the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest above us , replaced it when Farnham finally asked that question aloud . Mr. M'Kay did not answer him . Mr. M'Kay sat crosslegged , watching our amateur sentinels beyond the fire-. light . He smoked his long Cree pipe , with the red stone bowl in the cup of his hand on the charred ground before him . He was far away in thought , probably not listening at all to Farnham 's young worry . P197Far away in thought . . . a thousand miles away , maybe , beyond these coastal greens and great churchly cedars , inland in some steep pass he had himself encountered , where the mountain pines flatten to winds from a glacier ice , and the trail is venomous with arrows of hostile tribes shooting from the heights , and where white men with black tongues must stagger through the snow ... away upon plains he knew , where the hoofs of the Blackfeet 's horses drum upon the drumming of the hoofs of a buffalo herd . . . away where the little rivers betray white men 's canoes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a thin nag or a sick dog or the mere exercise of a swatch of old moccasin leather between a man 's dry , shrieking teeth can save him from starvation , madness , and the last unspeakable resort ... . So far away in thought , for all we knew , was the great explorer M'Kay . He smoked his long Bush Cree pipe , he baked his tough gnome 's fingers on its red stone bowl . He did not answer Farnham . The silence and constraint lasted a little while . It was as though we had all grown lonely . " Pardon me , sir , possibly you did not hear me . I only Ovide roared . " Stop it , give me some wine . " So we could laugh along , forgetting all except ourselves in the ruddy companionship of the woods . . . our own good selves , good friends all , laughing and drinking and falling asleep among the grimed clumps of our clearing , while the fires died and our guards stood off to the dark . The partners had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of us lay with our faces to the stars and the cut-paper tree tops .   Restless , I woke just before daybreak . I leaned up on my elbows , listening to the first birds resuming their dismay and rage over the black havoc we had made of their woods . Their sounds were ironically sweet . It is the business of conquerors to enjoy  --  and never to understand  --  what their victims are singing . The voyageurs had made a camp of their own below us at the river 's edge . Their smudge was cold , and they slept in a sumptuous sprawl , pistols and paddles strewn around them , a thin oratorio of insects over their heads . Ovide de Montigny lay among them . I could not see him , but I knew that he lay with his mouth open and his yellow hair soiling in ashes . He had been very drunk last night . A turkey buzzard set out on its day 's hunt across the hills : I could tell it by the fat , lazy flapping of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagle spiraled among the paling stars , putting them out one by one . Near me , next Koaster , the dumb Russian carpenter , Perrault slept with her head thrown rakishly against his thick , unsensing arm . The new day , creeping through the cedars , touched her small face with the soft unrest of mother-of-pearl . A twig 's crackle woke her as I rose . She lay looking up at me with strange , smiling eyes , sleepily aware that we two were the only ones awake in all the camp . Even the guard we had posted over our arms-stack was drowsing with his back against the muskets and his chin slanting deep in weariness . He had had a plaid scarf on , but during the night , no doubt , some humorous Indian had lifted it deftly off and away while he dozed . I smiled back at Perrault , pursed my lips and held my finger up in pantomime of secrecy , as one does to a child . Like a child , too , she had closed her eyes again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoed down the crooked lane which all these prostrate bodies left , into the cool , beaded green and jubilant clamor of the morning woods . Here was the forge of Roussil , our blacksmith . A bear cub waddled in front of it , heaving up its little diamondbrightsnout to wonder what that rigid iron effigy of itself could be which stood on a great block close by the chain and bellows . Across the clearing , against the river mists and the far emerging peaks behind Tongue Point 's green lowland , rose the stripes of our first rafters for a storehouse , and , equally silhouetted , two wild pigeons walking gingerly along a beam . I had not gone far before I heard someone running after me . Heels made crisp reports upon the cinders of our camp ground . I turned , saw that it was only Perrault , kept on strolling . Confound her . . . I tried to be cross . She was all breath-shorn when she caught up with me . " I thought you were taking me along , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big for her , made her droll . I had cut her hair for her yesterday , so short that her scalp shone through like a sea shell . She looked a scrawny boy again . That was all the more necessary now on land , unless Ovide .. . " I thought you had dropped back to sleep , " I retorted . " Where are you going ? " " Nowhere , of course . Where could I possibly " Oh , but in your pocket , there ! " She pointed to the bulge . " A book , that 's all . Ca n't a man ever find peace to read ? " " A book  --  what book , Lewis ? About the ancient wandereryou told me of  --  you remember his name ? The one who sailed so many seas , and was so cruel to the lady whose role I almost sang ? " " AEneas , " I informed her . I bridled at her smile . " No ,   not that book . Another  --  well , now , am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . " " Lewis , it is no book at all . Please , Lewis . . . it is a pistol . I watched you take it . Why ? " " Oh , I see . You silly ! " Heaven only knew what desperatepicture was puffing through her featherweight brain . I made a rough effort to hide how suddenly pleased I was with her idiotic anxiety . " Do you think Ovide de Montigny is the only man in camp who can pull a trigger without shooting his finger off ? " Ovide . As though one must always think of humans in welded pairs . Ovide and Perrault again and again . As though my knowledge of their coupling would never let me look at her without thinking of him , too . Of his bright , masculine mane tumbling across her throat when he bent down to her . Ovide . His picture across my brain , and his name poisonous on my lips whenever I looked at her or heard her low , boyish voice . " I happen to be strolling nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely nothing , and wanting no company . " " Very well , then , I am strolling with you , and do-ing " Oh , are you ? I have not invited you . " She stood with her absurdly trousered legs planted apart . " I have come on longer adventures than this withoutwaiting for an invitation from you , Lewis . " " Keep quiet ! Why not wake up the whole company ? Is everyone to know " No , do n't scold me , Lewis , please do n't . " Her eyes grew heavy . " Go along your way , then , and I shall go mine . " " You 'll do nothing of the sort . Do you think this is the fashionable Bowery ? These woods are full . . . of mischief . Go back . " " Back ? Back to what , Lewis ? To ? " P201Damn her and her cuteness for sympathy . She all but bowed her head . I had made a savage job of that haircut . It gave her face a startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my college classmates , a Papist from Maryland , I had seen an engraving of an arrowriddledSt . Sebastian with just such young , drawn cheeks and sorrowing brow . " Back to him with my compliments . " She a saint .. . the little trollop , trying her stage tricks to tease me . I laughed without humor , without mercy . The jaggedness of my voice scraped my own nerves . I heard myself snarlingon : " Back where you belong , in the sag of his big , drunken , satisfied body in the ashes . Back to your brave one , your hero , your husband-to-be . " There were two things she might have done : by her look she was on the verge of those stupid tears of hers ; either that or she might have been about to break into the rapid , high-pitched polyglot of Latin wrath she had used on me once or twice before . But this time she neither cried nor cursed . She was studying me patiently , almost shyly . She gave me a hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea tan above her lips , into her eyelids , her forehead , and , while she smiled , pricked hotly in her scalp . I could see the waves of it meeting in her short , rigid hair . I stood as tall as that above her . She was the one living being among them all with whom I was , and always would be , still conscious of my old gangliness and sorry address . And , as of old , I would still defend myself by upbraiding her . Her unaccountable flush sped . We stood saying nothing , knee-deep in the pink of salaal blossoms . There was everywherethe wild smell of high , wet ferns which stormed the vast tree trunks around us . Down the slope the river was already taking on theP202olive brown of its daytime dress . Thin seams of yellow lather drifted towards the channel under the hills of the north shore , telling the end of the tide rip twelve miles seaward . Far out , a lone gull tilted on the silver breeze and dipped among the poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , dagger straight , the perpendicularbeat of its swift wings almost chipping the hard crinkle of the current . This deep , liltless music might have been the shoreward water 's , or the evergreens ' above . While we stood silent it grew upon us in sound too broad for any sure origins or distinguishable notes , from below , from aloft , from the camel 's hump of a mountain directly behind us , from the river itself and the brightening combs of the hills across the river , from out of the brook cleft which led to the little bay on our camp 's left , where birches , taller than I had ever dreamed birches could be , glittered and clattered upon the darker sound-surf of cedars grappling with strong boughs and spruces shaking the last mists from their mighty heads . It was the sound of the new sun charging upon woods and water , the sum of all the fresh , unbargainablesounds which sing up the quiet of these North Pacific days . " I did not mean to be surly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood with eyes downcast upon the ferns , and I pretended not to have noticed the sudden impulse of her hands towards mine . I turned on my heel in the shaggy turf and started off by myself , diagonally up the hill from the river bank . But when a sprawl of fallen tree trunks slowed me , I saw that she still followed me , stumbling doggedly behind me among the brambles and flowering tangles , saying nothing in suddenly meek expectation that I might otherwise chase her back again . I halted to blaze a tree . I made a pretentious matter ofP203waiting until she could catch up with me . But this time she halted , too , and stood looking up at me from the rusty , windy fringes of a little cliff over the cove . She was twenty yards or so downhill . Under the great trees , whose tops topped even the rise on which I waited , she was insectsmall , a perky , incommunicable , fly-like thing . The destiny of a fly . . . but her destiny was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . It would profit me nothing to stand so high above her , to stare down the chute of restless branches into the bright speck of her face , at her wind-blown blouse and her odd , theatrical stance among the blowing fronds . I stood wonderingdully what she was doing , standing there aping , looking up , laughing , perhaps . . . no , not laughing , either . The black speck of her mouth in the bright speck of her face meant something else than laughter . And the way her arms put handles to her boyish hips : I had seen her use that pose before . But when , where , on what specially brave occasion ? As I watched down , I could see the tiny flicker of sun and windy fern shadows across her lifted throat . There was something lunatic about her inexplicably open mouth , her footlight manner , something embarrassing which made me look away . Down the other wing of the bay a few renegade Chinooks had already settled themselves and their squaws as our most faithful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of squinting tasks among them , counting their dugout boats in the white lapping of the strand , the number of women squatting shapelessly before a little fresh waterfall and kneading berry biscuits , the gusts of smoke from their camas ovens , the horse clams a little naked boy was digging as he waded in the ruffle of brown shallows . Mean curiosity brought me back to Perrault . The tug of a temptation to glance again at something self-forbidden . To her , to that little insect of stiff , voiceless antics and open mouth down there , my gaze gave back . . . my halfcontemptuous , half-pitying conjecture of what the devil she could be doing , and why , and for whose benefit . For she was still at it . Was she trying to say something ? Was she wanting to shout some stagy plea at me uphill against the wind , against this whole downpour of tree boughs swinging and clashing in their gianthood 's music ? Then at length I knew . Then I saw her instantly as though she were in Cherubino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels ; recognized my memory of her pose with young gallant 's arms akimbo and a page 's lace wristlet dangling debonairly over her toy sword hilt , and her sleek , impertinent , merry boy 's face thrown back to lift her song past the pit 's ears to the circle of faces in the lighted boxes . . . to the round red faces smiling over satin stocks , in tune with the lightness and loveliness of what she sang . It was for me , this impromptu concert . She went on with it , on and on in absurd fiasco , as if to bring me a great gift , as if she had recollected what I wanted most in all the world to hear , and she must carry me it with all the frills and knee-knicks and sweet pleasantries that such a song required . Only her gestures told me when she was finally done with it . Her arms came up and out , her quaint head bobbed , she managed half a curtsey in the underbrush . I came down to her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wondering , should I risk it , should I guess what she 'd been singing ? But when I was close enough , I could see by her clear smile that she took it entirely for granted that I knew . I need not blunder into any error . I had only to nod gratefully back when she put out her hand to steady me after my rushing descent.  | " There , " she said , " that was my return for all your bad temper to-day . By your favorite composer . . . all of it , every word of it in my best before-breakfast voice and my finest Milanese style . And all . . . " I should never tell her that I had not been able to hear a single one of all those words . " There is no music as dear to me as Mozart 's , " I assured her gravely . " I am certain of it now . " But even as I said it the wind struck its thousand green harps and poured my pretty speech away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way I took her hand . Or may have known that I was going to be hopelessly awkward again about my bending over her poor , toughened fingers . She withdrew them slowly , turned away . For the second time in these few minutes she had flushed again : the creeping , irresolute , dark flush of a woman troubled and shamed . Single file , we thrashed through , out upon the open rocks above the river . There was a murmur of sunlight over all the stone , a reflection as watery as the little waves from which it came . We faced each other in a craze of white radiance . It was over our feet and up our thighs , a sweet , fiery enfoldment in the blaze of full morning from the water crests . " You are a good , beloved man , Lewis , " she said slowly . " What should I have done without you ? . . . and now ... " I completed the sentence for her with a strange boundingof my heart . " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had walked by accident into one of the cliff burial places of the Clatsops . Even with the first of our words we had begun to be aware of the vile stench around us , the broken , decomposing bodies folded into their carved boxes and canoes beneath the gaudy , horrible grotesques of their memorial posts.  | We had several interpreters among the Indians . There were those of the Chinooks who knew sufficient Nootka and Chihalis words to match the few which some of our own sailors knew . Come to the worst , they had all the trick , learned inland , of making themselves understood by grunt and thumb signs and a jingling of the little white haiqua shells which were their currency markers . But their jargon was spattered , too , with the Missouri patois , with the unholy bits of English they had remembered from our own American Messrs . Lewis and Clarke 's stay here five years ago , and already with a little of the thick Canadian French . Our voyageurs would add to that end of the vocabulary , no fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Comcomly as with a tilikum , a kinsman , a friend among friends . They would mind Mr. M'Kay and his mouth as lean , his lips as leathery , his sense of the woods as curt and yet as sharp as theirs , when they would listen to no one else among us . For them he was the tilikumpapa , the the ahnkuttie tilikum himself , of our tribe . Sacrilege against John Jacob Astor , I remember thinking ... and grinning . And I remember The M'Dougall 's pink snout alive with jealousy and the moisture of offended pride as he tried to impress on Comcomly of the One Eye the seriousness of such an error . The Chinook brethren and children came continually visiting us now . They brought us the bluish , limy sand of which we made our foundations , the olachen oil we must use in our lamps , huge salmon still quivering from ' the first spring catches , skins and bracken roots and gray whales ' blubber  --  a chieftain 's delicacy , this , all garlanded with feathers and iridescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us , too , fresh from theirP207year behind the screen , plump and giggling from the noisy potlatches in honor of their puberty , squat , sooty , and rancid ; their breasts ruby-red with blistering oil , their heads squeezed into gross and comical misshapes . Ovide roared at his first sight of them . But , even so , I noticed how his big knuckles tightened on the mallet he was swinging at the moment , and how much sudden shoulder strength he threw into his blow when he felt their black , childish eyes on him , and the way his own eyes fluttered up in command of admiration as he split the mallet head in twain . It is one of the best pictures I have of him : astride a rafter , leaning back as in a saddle to wave his broken stick at the giggling , flat-faced little virgins under his imaginary stirrups , to roar and laugh and be boisterously pleased with the feel of his quick muscles rippling under his embroidereddeerskin and returning him to equilibrium . The sunlight gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshal 's baton . He began to recite some ribald verses from the Parisian revolution . That was how Perrault and I saw him when we came back into camp that morning . The day 's work had already started on the storehouse . . . and there he was , riding his rafter high , swaying , still fumy from his last night 's drunkenness , hallooing the sunshine and the little red girls and his own young handsomeness gayly ... . " Bebe ! " he 'd shout , and throw his kisses far . Until he caught sight of us standing close down here . His recitation ended . His face became a fury of jealousy , of long teeth biting at his laugh . He raised the thick remnantof stick , flung it at us wildly  --  at which of us , or both of us , we never did know  --  but it struck Perrault upon the throat , its splintered end like claws across her cry . Before I could rush for the rafter , he had already unseatedhimself with that drunken throw . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached him I heard the snap of the arm that was under him , and I almost hit him in spite of it . He was very sorry about that poor little boy , Perrault . He was very brave about his own broken arm . In the Chinook jargon forever after the word for a kiss will be " bebe . " One other word we learned from their constant dinning of it at us . The word " mahkook , " the Nootka word for trade , for bargaining , for all the shrill war of cunning and flattery , coaxing and pretended exasperation , the jingling of haiqua shells and the grudging , suspicious weighing of penknives and tobacco twists over their stacks of pelts , all the interminable game of exchange of goods which they were willing to play with us for rainy hours on end . Mahkook ... a bargain , a great bargain . A twilled cedarbarkbasket , three beaver skins , a digging stick carved out of horn , and a sardine rake blessed with special mightinessand good fortune by the magician of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilikum 's blankets and a few of those bright iron nails . And , very well , if the foolish white men insisted on such a common thing as an otter skin , here was a purplebrownotter skin shining like the hills behind the sunset . A Pekin mandarin might poison his emperor or forswear his ancestors to possess that otter skin in years to come . But the Chinooks had had it , and a hundred like it , from their neighbors of the Northern bays : the kelp was full of , these cheap , gentle creatures whose own gas carried them helplessly up to the hunter 's waiting spear . They were nothing compared with these pouches of spruce root , these copper shields embossed with the design of the hornedP209owl and the legend of Semmelth , the wolf-child , which we could have so reasonably , instead . We made the partners ' fortunes in these first few weeks . Even after the Chinooks realized that it was skins we wanted , and how recklessly we wanted them , and had begun a systematic business of loitering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given them the most , the trade was preposterously all in our favor . Tenas mahkook , so cheap , so very cheap . They came in their dome-shaped hats and their soaked coats of rushes when it rained . The wet weather peppered their red , plucked chins and dissolved the orange clay marks ornamenting their mouths . The raindrops stayed in little gray balls where they had greased themselves most thickly . Their feet , the short , fat , close-toed feet of a waterside people , were invariably bare . We could hear them grating like clam shells up the sand whenever they stepped out of their canoes , and the clank of the squaws ' anklets over their shiny heels . In the woods it was a different thing . There  --  as thousands of years of seasonal migrations to the hills had taught them  --  they had the paws of cougars , cautious and secretive and alive to each leaf they walked on . Fair days again , and they flocked through our encampmentin freer numbers than ever . They had come to please the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived under the little brook and beaver pool above our cove ; and Father Comcomly was going to get her special promise to be generous with her trout eggs in our honor . His open eye glistened beautifully as he explained this  --  and his other marked the climax of a solemn , endless wink . It cost The M'Dougall four twists of tobacco and a bolt of red flannel to impress him that day . They swarmed around the new pigsty . They squatted whole hours in the hot , trampled copse , the men stark naked , the women 's cedar aprons dragging the ferns , while they listened gravely , excitedly , to the squealing inside and waited  --  Mr. M'Kay corroborated this for me , later  --  for the pigs to resume their human forms . Not that the superstition would interfere with a successfulambition to kidnap a couple of specimens , of course . But I think it was seventy beaver skins they had to pay for each young porker we suspected they 'd stolen . The M'Dougall insisted on it loudly , to no avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comcomly sealed it immediately with his one eye . Tenas mahkook . Wake hyas mahkook . So very cheap . Such a bargain of bargains . Next day he came back accompanied by his split-nosed magician , by his favorite son and all his womenkind . They were carrying some silver salmon , and they made an endlessceremony of presenting them to us . Only two little requests went with the gift . We must take care never to cut the fish open lengthwise with our foreign metal knives , lest we offend the salmon people and their mighty master , the killer whale . Secondly , we should have the whole mess for just one of our muskets , one horn of powder and a few lead balls . When Mr. M'Kay refused him these , the black veins swelled in the chief 's neck  --  I noticed for the first time how short and inevitably thick a neck it was  --  but his face stayed sly and imperturbable under the blue-andwhitediagonals of paint he used for a formal visit . His magician , waving a long head scratcher , chittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat sucking his hot lime stick . His eye slid from lean M'Kay to the puffed , importantly hemming and hawing M'Dougall . A plaid of the Clan M'Dougall rewarded his tact . HeP211paid for this , in turn , with a bag-shaped net , stuffed with olachen . He called up his women to render the oil . We heated rocks in our forge fire for them , they dropped the rocks hissing into a canoe full of water , boiled the thousand little fish until the oil rose and spat and thickened in a golden scum . While Comcomly 's old wives squatted and howled the song of the oil try , his daughters must squeeze the hot olachen dry , pressing them ceremoniously against their squat young bodies until all were coated in a crimson rage of the heavy-smelling , lustering oil . This took hours on end . It went on while we worked , while we toted and carpentered and finished the sixty-foot storehouse , while we rested and gaped in the noon sun . Ovide , his broken arm boxed with a cedar slab and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voyageurs ' gayest ceintures , was enjoying the performance in his own sporting way . He had taken the chief 's son back into the woods and given him a stiff cup of rum . he young boy lay sick and stupefied in the salaal , pulling at his upper lip as though it were no longer part of him , as though the glazed and reeling blossoms across his mouth were as huge as the huge trees whirling with the sky . I found them like that when I went behind for a load of alder for our charcoal . Ovide stood chuckling down , halfashamedto meet and give any explanation to the wretched , slanting eyes which sought his from the ground . " Another of your celebrated jokes , M. de Montigny , " I said . He flew into his braggadocio , constant refuge when anyone found him out . " I did not play it for your benefit , old bones . Must I prove it to you ? It is only my left arm that 's broken . " I did not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face out of the hot sun .   " Well , what the devil , is it such a crime to teach him his liquor ? When you know as much about the Indians as I do , and how they love it . . . Hey , Laframbroise , Lapierre ! Here , Belleau , here ! " His cronies , the voyageurs , came running to join his laugh . And then , in the midst of their loud , good-natured circle , the Indian magician , screeching rebukes , and Father Comcomly himself . The old chief pretended to take no notice of his drunken son . He stood stock still , saying something interminably which none of us could understand , softly , in woolly gutturalsand the gentle , clacking consonants of a polite speech , without outward resentment or any whine , until we had helped carry the boy down to the shore and sobered him with a slash of water . Then Comcomly of the One Eye actually thanked us for our humor . There was that necklace of black veins standing out from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said soft , courteous goodbyesto The M'Dougall . But whenever he or any of his male villagers visited our camp thereafter they wore their war clothes , their armor of heavy skins or close-bound sticks . Now they had always freshly purified themselves , scorched and scraped the bottoms of their canoes anew in some clamorous ritual on their beach ; and , when we let them , they now came among us carrying carved whale ribs , sharp pickaxes of jade and bloodstone , and the heavy clubs which they called slave killers . Below our camp , circling the hill behind it , ran the tributarywhich we called Young 's River . In the sunset , when the world was all amber and wine and a single star , some of us were drifting back to the Columbia in boats of the friendly Clatsops . P213There were Farnham and Matthews in the canoe with Perrault and me , and a slave whom the Clatsop chief had brought yesterday to Captain Thorn as a guide , as a bodyguard , as an offering to the Thunderbird . The Tonquinlay close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller stream to see a meadow where they told us the Messrs . Lewis and Clark and their famous American party had camped throughout the winter of i8o6 . The log house was still standing in the high , wild grass . Still standing , but overgrown with parasite creepers , and long since broken-faced , mouldering , the doors in soggy strips upon the ground . Five years . . . the green , impatient wilderness and its allies , the rain and the coast wind , were fast blotting out all concrete memory of these celebrated overlanders and their journey to the sea . We paddled in silence . From the canoe in front of us , manned by some of the voyageurs , floated their song : " Le bruit court clans la ville , Le bruit court clans la ville , Que demain vous mourrez , Faluron , dondaine , Que demain vous mourrez , Faluron , donde . " The shadows of the spruces from both banks met in great chevrons across the river 's dusk . The woods were motionless . Some rose-hips glimmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neared the confluence , a clump of water-weed shone with the claret of the evening . Perrault , in front of me , shivered for the gone sun . I could not see her face , but I knew how sad the afternoonhad left her . I had watched her standing staring at the caterpillars crawling and sliming in hundreds between the logs of the deserted cabin . I had known well enough what was passing through her chilled , unphilosophical little brain . The Indians had shown us , too , their treasure of broken beeswax candles with the gilded monogram of the Church still decipherable on them , remnants thrown up from a shipwreck in Nehalem Bay half a century ago , the only souvenirs of all the castaways with strange black beards ... and when we asked the Spaniards ' final fate the Indians refused to understand . They had rambled on about other shipwrecks , other rare foreigners who talked a huloima wawa and taught them to pop corn , and of others and others , like their good tilikums , Lewis and Clark , whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had guarded against the sons of the Ravens and the paddleside serpent canoes of the hostile Tillamooks and Clatskanies . And in more tentative , nervous tones they had told us of the others who had come sailing , like ourselves , far up into the river mouth on the backs of great Thunderbirds ... of those who , like ourselves , could command the godlikecarrier to spread his huge white wings cloudwards , to fill the sunniest noonday suddenly with black anger , thunder , and the red lightning of destruction . They had seen it once when the Chinooks from across the river had pushed too near the shadows of the wings of another great bird , almost as big as the Tonquin  --  Broughton 's , perhaps , but we never could learn for sure  --  but it had dealt the lesson of death which , I now remembered , had chased the Chinooks from the mere reflections of the black bone-tips of our guns . To the master of the Thunderbird , to the Thunderbird itself , they had given this slave . Their houseposts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was white people 's blood , the blood of the men with beeswax and strange black beards , in the abject man . P215His father 's father had taught him to speak the huloima wawa . Aboard the Tonquin  --  I had happened to row out to her yesterday afternoon with another of The M'Dougall'sdemands on Captain Thorn for tar pots and what not  --  the slave had squatted in the lonely forecastle , too frightened to talk or eat or take a hand at anything . " Here , try some of your uppity Latin on him , Lewis . Get two words out of the dirty devil ' n ' I 'll give him to you outright . Tell him to get t ' hell off my ship . Tell him to go wash his rumps , ' n ' that I 'm no damned nigger snatcher . Take him ashore ' n ' let him sleep with the SandwichIslanders . Christ 's sake , tell him he 's a free man . " That was the one thing I knew I never could tell him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother had not been allowed to squeeze his brow under the tight , torturing cedar strips when he lay in his cradle . His skull was the skull of ignominy . He would be a slave and a cleaner of fish until he reached the end of his stick of life . He was the bow paddle , now , of our canoe . We were coming back into the low cup of Young 's Bay . When we passed the Tonquin her night lanterns were already lit and plunging talons in the water . The slave turned , looked at me with terror in his eyes . The tide was low , the water calm , and islands of dark reeds and sand were giants ' footprints towards the breakersand the sea outside . The big , saddle-backed mountain which had come to be peculiarly ours was tissue-thin behind us in the gloaming . The mute , desperate supplication of the slave as he rested his paddle . . . and the Tonquin 's shadow bristling along her side , like the shadow of the wings of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Clatsop village far down the bay , then back to the waiting slave . P216I nodded . I only half knew what he wanted , or whether he was waiting my permission at all . I warned the others to keep quiet , to balance the canoe . He slid noiselessly overboard on the shore side , away from the Tonquin , away from all white men , and began to swim swiftly downstream . I knocked up Farnham 's paddle . " Let him go , " I ordered . I was telling myself what a weak-lunged , lazy sot we might have made of him around our camp . At first we saw the glitter of his arms when they cut the colored water . When he reached the nearest of the sand bars we thought we could still see him running in its surf , plunging to swim again beyond it , to reach the Clatsop colony where he had been a lifelong slave . Away , somehow , anyhow , away from the white men who spoke the huloima wawa of his father 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unpressed heads of servitude , and who lived like lice on the body of the Thunderbird . Back , somehow , anyhow , back to the masters who would know how to beat his disobedience out of him , how to slay him riotously in the boasts of the next potlatch and fling his inconsiderable body under a house post or out into the woods without a box or any belongings or even a canoe for the final journey on the rivers shining undergroundand far away . . . when the forest beaks would find his bones , and the teeth and claws would split his shameful forehead into dry white splinters . The stars were springing everywhere . Over the fires of our own camp they hung like checked sparks . We pushed homeward . The voyageurs in the canoe ahead had exchanged their song for cheery hollering to the shore . We could see the stalwart outline of the big log house among the trees , and the camp fire echoed in the brandnewsills and windows.  | " Five years will be nothing in this fort 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " It will outlive us all . " " Perhaps , " she replied . And then , in the voice of one who must go on hoping against hope and all belief , " Us all . . . and our sons and our sons ' sons .... " Captain Thorn sat shaving the loose fibers from a splice he had been making to while away time and temper . He had a heavy jackknife . Its blade was shilling-broad , and he kept it always sharp and rustless . His compliments to Dunkie M'Dougall , commander of the British forces now occupying Mr. Astor 's fort at Mr. Astor 's own expense  --  Captain Thorn 's sarcasms could be as heavy as his jackknife , if nowhere near as neat  --  ' n ' how long in hell did they think they were going to keep the Tonquin hanging around here ? I had come aboard carrying him the partners ' invitation to spend the night ashore and drink hearty with them over the christening of the Astoria mahkook house and the laying of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bade me be sure to promise him that bygones would be bygones and that they 'd dine in gold braid and all the possible state of the Nor'westers , as they 'd used to dine in their great club on Beaver Hall Hill in Montreal . To save my stanch Yankee from a fit and Fort Astor from a cannon ball , I had made up my mind to forget these sweet inducements . Now I saw the uselessness of delivering the invitation at all . " More ' n ' a month I 've been kept waitin ' on their doorstep . Like a tuppenny porter whose load it do n't convenience ' em to take in . " " They had to finish the storehouse before they could begin to fill it , sir . They 'll soon unload completely now . "  | " They 'd better . They 'd better , or I 'll have my anchors up , ' n ' that 's that . Collectin ' mud ' n ' barnacles more ' n a month , waitin ' for a lot of bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good-byes . I 've better places to go to . Up North , around Nootka , I can trade on my own account better ' n the whole lot of ' em combined . If I can only get there afore the Russians are down from Seetka for the summer , while the savages are still standin ' by to see whether it 's winners for the Spanish , the English , or who . . . . " He had it all planned . Or perhaps Mr. Astor had planned it for him , back in his office of sublime , satin-stocked omniscience in New York . " Why , goddamn ' em , Lewis , they think they 're traders . I 'll show ' em what a Yankee c'n do along that line . I 'll end up home with my hold crammed tight with otter . " " Home , sir ? Not back here ? " " Back here ? What for ? Hell , Lewis , I know my orders . Why ?  --  I held back my smile . " Right , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old look of testy suspicion . It was a misty day , and he wore his weather-greened pea-jacket . All this idle while on the river he had kept it looking as correct and clean as an old maid 's tippet . " What 've you been hearin ' , Lewis ? " " They 'll expect you to call back here , sir . They were trying to decide last night which one of the partners is to go with you . " " Which one of the partners . . . what for ? " His face was stitching itself purple . " What for ? " " To take charge of the trading . " " To take . . . why , the bastardly . . . I 'm doin ' the tradin ' , I tell you . Else nobody 's ... " " I am only repeating what I heard , sir . You 'd told me to  --  to eavesdrop . "  | " If it 's M'Dougall I 'll have him in irons in two days . " " No fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. M'Kay . They 'll have to vote which . " " Well . . . " " Mr. M'Kay 's the best of the lot , sir . " There was silence . I began again . " Mr. M'Kay knows the Indians , does n't he ? The Nootka tongue , too . And you 'll have to admit , he 's a famous old hand at trading . " I was baiting him deliberately , for some reason that was deep within me and that I could not have explained . His lull , his " Well . . . " and his pause for one decent little doubt had disappointed me . It was the devil I wanted to see in him . I wanted him to rage . I wanted to see him rail and snarl with insane hate of them , of us all . I wanted my right to hate him back , as one would hate the devil incarnate with blood specks up his corded arms , and to know that I had sold my soul to someone whose tongue was blacker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife with spasmodic meaning of fury , punishment , and utterly pitiless evil . He started for the hatchway . He returned my salute with martinet 's nicety . " Well . . . I 'll look up my orders in the matter , " he said . His orders from on high . That one dull , single-minded little money god he would go on worshiping . The devil had known the wild pleasure of taunting the heavens above , but this neat , red-faced miniature of the devil would have to run down into his too prim stateroomand study the instructions from his infinite shipowner . " Oh , they 're not bothering about Mr. Astor 's orders , " I called down the steps to him . I was quite cheerful . He stopped midway . " In fact  --  sir , in fact , they were n't hesitating to speakp220rather badly of the Astor Empire last night . They were offering all sorts of bets that the British David Thompson ' 11 reach the river here long before our own overlanders . They were sure that somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the long traverse .. . and they laughed . Not Mr. M'Kay so much , sir , but the others . At Mr. Astor himself they laughed . " There was a strange , cracking sound from down the hatch . I recognized it rapturously . With the still-open blade in his left hand he had stabbed the bulwark through . There was the steel in the thin wood first , then the side of his fist with a thump as the riven panel screeched .. . all within the half second that let loose his new , surchargedwrath . " Damn you , Lewis , that 's what I 'll do to every whoresonJudas among ' em that talks like that . Look , by God ! Come here , you , ' n ' look what you 've made me do to my own ship . " " Excuse me , sir . " I mocked him , " Mr. Astor 's ship . " And fled chuckling for the rail . We had sent some of our best men exploring up the river . Our camp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay away . We heard first that they were low in stock of furs . Then , a more believable rumor , that we had offended their Creek woman with our metal frying pans and must be forbidden any more fish . Then that the sturgeon season was coming , and with it a great number of kinsmen ' from near-by Gray 's Harbor and the Juan de Fuca strait . The Indian village across the river grew five times its former size . Cedar planks sprang to punchions overnight , and many new long , rectangular houses poured smokep221from their chimneyless roofs over the studded shore line of Baker 's Bay . Even the renegade few who had been hanging viciously around our woods and cove were paddling home to the Chinook headquarters and taking their goat mats and young daughters and their new-found love of rum all back with them . Back , they would assure us gravely , only to help stud the fish hooks with shell and to join the annual hunt for the greased and scented harpoons which the tamahnawis man , the tribal conjurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spruce boughs . I thought I recognized the fine touch of One-Eyed Comcomly in the way they insisted on the innocence of their absence . The M'Dougall and the two Stuarts wrangled away over the plans for quick fortification of our camp . We heard them at it in their tent for half the night , shouting of bastions and palisades and British army regulations for firing lines . Between the canvas and the candle The M'Dougall could be seen standing , a soft , fat silhouette , exhibiting his letter of authority from the Infinite Astor , pointing with a fat , soft shadow of a finger of the other hand to the sentence conferring on him his chieftainship . But Mr. M'Kay came back with his exploring party the next day and took real charge . We raised the shops and dwelling house parallel to the warehouse . These and the ravines below them gave us our flanks . We cut a great quantity of pickets in the forest , and formed a square around us with little guardhouses and cannon ports at each corner . We organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week we had the place formidable to see , sufficiently impregnable . Nothing could surprise it now excepting treachery from within . Less than a week  --  but long enough to send Captain Thorn on the Tonquin into another orgy of rage and insultp222over the new delay . Long enough , too , to reduce The M'Dougall to a realization that he would never really be the fort 's commander with Mr. M'Kay around , and to keep him moping in his tent in true Homeric style . Every hammer thwack they heard was gall to both of the old adversaries . Then , one late afternoon in the midst of all our preparations , Comcomly 's daughter appeared . From nowhere , patiently misunderstanding all our questions as to how she had come and what had happened to the canoe which must have brought her over and up the river , she was here . Here , and as suddenly , as calmly , pushing the flaps apart and bearding the great M'Dougall in his den . We all stopped working , crowded around . We could not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from behind , the lumpy calfs of her red legs oil-slicked and bulging up from her copper anklets , her young haunches flaring out of their cedar-braid apron ; a comical , uncouth segment of a figure which began with bare feet on the ground and ended abruptly at the tent flaps . Somebody in our waiting circle laughed aloud . Ovide . The face of our local Achilles , fiery , piggish , puffy with moral abasement , rose over the girl 's shoulder and shooed us back . He began then and there to lecture us all on the frivolity of our minds and manners . We misjudged him if we thought . . . but there was such a moistness in his words , and the drivel came so readily down his jowls , we could see well enough what he secretly hoped we 'd think . Comcomly of the One Eye was a very sick man , it seemed . He had sent this dear little daughter who was er , well  --  a favorite of the white men 's chief , the Tyee M'Dougall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , for one of those cures which come only in the pills of the huloima . For the holy magician himself , the sorcerer , the greatestp223tamahnawis man of their sept , had not been able to cure Comcomly , neither with his rattle dance nor even by blowing on him through his magic blow tube , because the white men , the mighty tkope , were supreme in the tamahnousof life and death and ana-in-the-belly . . . and because the Thunderbird of the white men had clapped its wings and told the Killer Whale , who had told the Porpoise People , who had told the Ten Brothers of the Sea Lion , that Comcomly of the One Eye must die unless the white men 's chief , the great Tyee Tkope , would come and cure him . " Come ? To their village ? " demanded Mr. M'Kay . " Are you daft ? " The M'Dougall managed to fold his arms over his fat chest . " Have I ever been one to run away from danger ? " he demanded .. " I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about danger , " replied his partner . " I said only daft . " And , giving him and the girl 's smooth , ochre-striped back another short look , turned and went off to his pickets . She had been cleverly coached . They had evidently told her to avoid Mr. M'Kay 's good sense . And to court The M'Dougall 's bad . No doubt she should have appealed to the master of the Thunderbird , out there on the river , she continued . For some of her father 's people had been uncertain which was the greatest tyhee among us , while others had been sure that he who could command those great white wings across so many seas was the one , the only one among us , who could surely cure . . . The M'Dougall had decided . He was already half across the warehouse , towards the few stock drugs which Captain Thorn had parted with only a few days ago from his neat little medicine chest . " Ah , by the way  --  " very benevolently  --  " just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . you 're among friends ; speak right out , my dear . " But it needed much supplementary pantomime from the crowd of us before she knew what he wanted to know . As though it mattered to any Indian where he was sick when his soul might be wandering in the woods or the graveyard and he was sick . . . if he was really sick , of course . An instant I fancied I caught her glancing at The M'Dougall as though she knew what a fool she was dealing with , as though all young girls must forever know the abysmal foolishness of fat old men and how to deal with it . But her sugarloaf-shaped head was glossy , and her glance went down with her face . There , her father had ana there . She clutched her throat . And there , too , in the head . Ana everywhere . And terrible ana here , ana of the dying , most ana of all down here in his belly . Like this , here . . . and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk . See , such belly-ana like this , like this ... . Six Sandwich Islanders to row them , they went away together in the longboat in the glory of the day 's end and the blaze of The M'Dougall 's regimentals . He had insisted on time enough to don his scarlet . He had a half-dozen assorted drug bottles and his Bible all wrapped in a plaid upon his wide-spread knees , and between them the daughterof Comcomly crouched and gazed up with wonder at the three moistly enfolded rosy crescents of his chin . I think there must have been an Amen in many of our minds to the thought that we might never behold him again . But we were wrong . He came back three mornings after , in the even greater state of the Chinooks ' longest and reddestand most handsomely carved seagoing canoe , reclining upon bearskins and beating the measure for a dozen swiftp225paddles as though he were the tyhee of all the red men 's race . They swung alongside of the shore , and he stepped out , squudging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still resplendent and imperial , made them a mighty dismissal speech , and came beaming up among us , his flasks and his Bible still bundled before him . We were putting the last pickets to the fort . We had had six days ' hard work at it and were tired and quarrelsomeamong ourselves . Those of us who had heavy tools in our hands must all have itched to let him have them hard against his jiggling guts or on the back of his round , puffed head . He went strolling among us with the distant cheeriness and condescension of an earl to his faithful , forelock-pulling tenantry . We would oblige him by convening in the mahkook house in the noon hour to hear some news of undoubted interest to us all . He began by chiding us whimsically for our recent alarm over the Indians ' absence . And for wasting so much labor , such expert supervision  --  a wave and a porker 's snort to Mr. M'Kay as he said it  --  on the erection of all these new defenses , when a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taught us the easier and far more just lesson of doing unto others and loving our neighbors as ourselves . True , he must admit , Chief Comcomly of the One Eye had not been precisely truthful with him , had not been ill at all when he sent for him . But he , The M'Dougall , had not been surprised or taken in by that . He . . . a tolerantsmile around the ring of us , a nod which came to rest on Mr. M'Kay . . . was quite as shrewd as anyone else . He had suspected from the first that he would find Corncomlysitting on his chieftain 's platform in the biggest of the cedar houses , as healthy as ever , surrounded by his conjurers and warriors and all the members of the klalep226tamahnawis of his sept , with no ana in his head or anywhere , and no worry except his altogether unappreciated and misunderstood affection for the tilikums across the river , the huloima with beards , the Thunderbird People who were building the big fort against all of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and against him , poor Comcomly of the One Eye , who wanted only to be known to us all , to our Tyhee M'Dougall above all , as the Father-in-Law of Fort Astor . Mr. M'Kay looked up from his Bush Cree pipe . " Eh ? " The M'Dougall had an increase of benevolence . He had not swallowed that story whole , either , he assured us . He knew human nature ... and the Indians . He had looked around the great smoky house , at the faces of all those tribesmen , threatening and awful in the sputter of many lighted candle fish , those faces of warriors war-striped , of the tamahnous men in their wolfheadmasks , their shway-at-sho-sin masks above their redpaintedarms and their waiting clubs , the slave killers .. . and he had known what to do . He had pulled out of his plaid a little bottle of orange liquid and held it under all their eyes . The candle-fish torches had given it fiendish glints , a wicked djinn had seemed to writhe and burn in it and struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had told them . The spirit of the dreaded smallpox , the terrible scourge which makes men etsitsa and sweeps with fatal , black finger nails over the faces of whole villages . They had screamed . Many had fled . Behind the cedar matting of the big house 's inner wall a whole family of them had hidden , howling and pressing their flat heads against the carven images . Comcomly of the One Eye had fallen back trembling , his children in horror around him , that little daughter ofp227his ... yes , of course , we must remember her , the one who 'd . . . well , gentlemen , all of them out of their wits and penitent , and our servants and humble allies always from now on . . . and all for fear that he , the Tyhee M'Dougall , might uncork a harmless little bottle . Syrup of figs , damme , that 's what it really was , gentlemen , would we believe it ? Some of us would  --  some of it . He was so long-winded about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a literary flavor , it was probably embroidered with flourishes from Captain Cook or some other famous explorer . What was fact and what fol-de-rol , we never did learn . I watched Mr. M'Kay tug at his long pipe , and the smoke in his brown , deep nostrils . " So , Dunkie , an ' they did ye the great honor of choosingye to kidnap ? " said the elder Stuart . Even The M'Dougall 's oldest crony had had his fill of the smallpox bottle . " Aye , so they did , Davie , the rascals , so they did . Nothing personal , of course , but in my official capacity as commander of the establishment by written authority of Mr. Astor "  --  beaming more broadly than ever at Mr. M'Kay  --  " I was the one they 'd naturally choose , gentlemen . Not that I 've had anything to do with all this foolishfort-making , and I told ' em so , gentlemen , frankly  --  and that I 've always found that diplomacy 's the thing , and that true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in his recital . The triumph went out of his pink jowls for a moment . He had understoodat last the look which Mr. M'Kay was giving him . " What did you do with the bottle , partner ? " " The  --  oh , the bottle . What should I do with it ? They were so sair afraid of it , they kept . . . well , gentlemen , do you know , they would n't let me pour it on the ground or in the fire or anywhere . And to prove to ' m how harm/less it really was , I  --  I drank every drop of it myself . " He got something like a groan from the assemblage . It encouraged him to go on now and , be the martyr for our sakes . " Tasted bad , gentlemen , and the effect . . . most inelegant . But there you are , the Indians know me now for what I am , your governor and their  --  their friend . " He smiled up again . His snout quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , my good M'Kay . " " I said daft . " And Mr. M'Kay went back into his pipe smoke . " And now , gentlemen , the most important and , I have no doubt , the happiest of my tidings . Your strict attention , please , because I am particularly anxious to impress upon you that there 's naught behind my intentions ' t smacks of  --  of iniquitous lust , or the philanderings of  --  some of you younger gentlemen had best listen to me  --  of reckless youth . It is much for your sakes , gentlemen , to preserve the peace and further the cause of amity and dignity and our commercial prowess that I contemplate this  --  this purely political alliance . Beseeched by OneEyeComcomly , as though by a vassal who 'd consider it an  --  to whom the title of father-in-law to his overlord would be a pledge of  --  ofHe got not even a glance from Mr. M'Kay to help him forward this time . His own little pig 's eyes rolled over and over with the slowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the Scriptures again , the Book of Ruth , but began to snicker and drip in the midst of the quotation . We must realize the honor of it to him and to us all , the pleasant and profitable relations with his father-inlaw'stribe forever more , the pure generosity of his motive ... but underneath all that ran that slobbery , secret little wish that we 'd also suspect him of being a lusty old rake.  |p229It  was someone else I saw as I stared up at him over all their shoulders . The girl with her buttocks striped and flaring , the flats of her hands polishing her young , red , oil-slick belly , and how she had looked at him from under her flattened brow with the look that rewards all fat old fools , the whole world over . " Dammee , Dunkie , " shouted his crony , the elder Mr. Stuart , " ye wouldna marry it ? " " It ? " The M'Dougall smiled . He indulged Mr. Stuart . Old friends are always rude about such things . Naturally ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would and I do . By both Scripture and their own rites , too , to  --  satisfy all parties , with a potlatch in celebrationand gifts from us all  --  I trust I may rely upon you , gentlemen , for I am assured it is the custom  --  gifts from Mr. Astor and us all to my happy relative , the Tyhee Comcomly . Only a few muskets he wants principally , and  --  well , we shall see , perhaps a few horns of powder and lead balls to find us some venison in the hills for the wedding feast . A detail , gentlemen , a detail .... " There was noise among the gentlemen . Ile took it for cheers and raised his pudgy fingers in a pleased protest . All that troubled him was the tight screw of Mr. M'Kay 's face behind his pipe smoke . I knew for certain now that James M'Kay would be voted to accompany Captain Thorn and the rest of our Nootka trading party northward , and that he would vote aye to that himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am proud of this proof of your fealty . . . and your enthusiasm . And when I bring home my bride , I feel sure that I can rely on you all to show her the respect that is due her as your governor 's wife , and to be kind to her , remembering . . . as true Brit -- as true gentlemen , remembering the momentousness of the arrival of the first woman in our midst . "  |p230The  noise again as we dismissed . Someone laughing loudly . Ovide . Restless , I sought the woods in the midst of a hot day 's work . I had been back and forth eight times between the Tonquin and the storehouse . The last of the goods for shore were finally out of the hold and off the decks and piling and trundling between the strand and the new shelves . Both ends of the ferry had nagged me , each trip . They had fought like spoiled children over the division of the flour bags , the powder kegs , the blankets . They were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from rail , rich compliments of the occasion on , for instance , the number of Sandwich Islanders we should be allowed to take along . Or if not that , anything . . . and each party very valorous in the knowledge of the fact that his voice could not carry quite that far . The woods were cool . Their quiet rose from the cushionedground in a windless , endless shimmering of green , high to the tree tops where the fragments of the sky were as bright as sunlight on deep water . Green shadows dwindled and grew upon the shafts of green light in broken slants and verticals , and all so cool and quiet , even the multi-green ferns around my knees seemed the noiseless vegetation of the sea bottom , and I walked miles deep under the green sea . These woods , and all the silent wealth and strength of them , the Thunderbird had claimed in the range of his bristling wings . These woods and all the things with fur which scamperedand chewed the berry bushes and tested their claws lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andp231omnipotent vulgarity to the Great One of New York . While we , his servants and his emissaries , must shatter the peace with bawling and insult , the temper of clownish avarice and cruelty , with musket shot and torch glare , click of the trap on forepaws , the slit and rip and count of pelts from still steaming bodies , and all the shrill indignityof trade . These woods that were so green and quiet . . . and my ears yet ached with the shoutings of Captain Thorn as he straddled a sack of seedling potatoes which Franchere had asked for , to plant in the burnt patch behind the dwelling house , when , at the top of his iron lungs , he 'd be damned if he 'd waste ' em on young quill twiddlers and taproom clerks . And as for old Unkie Dunkie . . . the famous news had reached the ship , of course . . . Dunkie M'Dougall had already expressed his preference for red meat and fish oil over any poor potatoes . Captain Thorn 's compliments to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills ... . A little red fox leaped daintily across the trail . Beware , O talapus , little red fox with your bright tail bobbing in the ferns . I have beaten the moth eggs from a thousand of your brothers ' pelts already in my master 's warehouse . I neared our brook , halted by its border of pungent wild cabbages and glassy moss . There was no sound the water made as it carried a garner of petals and young leaves down the green ravine . The little waterfall from the pool further hillward strung its beads of sunlight withoutchatter or haste . I leaned back against a giant fir . I was here the little thing I longed to be , drowned in the tree-high , fluid silence of a world without men . Over there , in the cinder-smeared tract which men had made , one of the fattest of them had squealed at me all day in the ill-humor of an empty stomach , having promisedp232his new Indian kinsmen to starve himself in a three days ' fast before his wedding , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual fidelity in the marriage contract . Squealed and squeaked and played the lewd martyr for us all , and nudged us to make sure we 'd see he was n't taking the savages seriously about it . ... A yearling black bear sat watching me , its pointed head between its paws , from a bough high above . Beware , 0 itswoot , young black bear with shaggy bottom , I have been sent over many seas to furnish your poll to fond old gentry to tuck around the young girls ' tender knees in the sleighs on winter nights . I strolled on up the falls . Through gray-green rocks , under the moss-damp portico of a great toppled spruce , the water splattered from the pool above with no solemner intention than to mend its little rainbow over the pool below . Deep , brilliant green of the jeweled ground , where the little bell blossoms of kinik-kinik had each its tiny clapper of spray from the tumble of the falls . I stood midwaybetween the pools , my face running gladly with this coolness which hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that little part of it which was on a level with my eyes , was dark and choked into stillness by many sunken branches . Across the throat of the falls it must have been a beaver that had built that barricade . I could see where the floating leaves crowded into brown mounds on the water , and how a pair of little black nostrilsnudged among them , bubbling the calm . And you , 0 eena the beaver , most of all of them you , beware . You , whose little scrubby outline is the very trademarkof the great fur companies , and whose skin is a necessity to the glistening of a million fops ' pot hats ... you , most of all of them , you , I have been sent to snare and slaughter you with iron teeth and club and hot lead balls ,  |p233you  who are the pet of my master 's heart and whose pelt overflows his dusty bins and the tarry stomachs of his big ships and hangs , a shiny trophy , on the wall above his beer . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prized and most staple and profitable of them all . Amused , I climbed a few steps higher until I had the whole radius of his swimming , the other dark , drenched bank , and all the brown , soupy industry of his dam . I was well hid and quiet . The waterfall itself outdid any sound I might have made as I kneeled in the bushes and gave myself a few minutes to watch him . The white man 's eyes are on you , little eena . Who are you that you have never heard of the white man , carrier of death slung over his shoulder and in his pistol pocket , with his traps to gnash you in John Jacob Astor 's name and his eternal price tags to tie through the empty eyeholeof your skin ? Who are you that trust to the peace of great woods and the safety of your own quiet building under the brown leaves , and who think you are writing your own destiny in bubbles across your little pool ? She must have been there a minute already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunny , prismatic spatter of the other end of the falls . She stood looking into the whiteness of the lower pool , quite as I stood looking into the blackness of this one above . She did not see me or know I was here . She must have been there at least a minute , because she was already acting on her whim , tuggingand wriggling out of those old overalls of hers , and it was the white light refracted from her baring shoulder that first drew my attention down . Her face and her bright shoulder from almost straight above . I started to call out , warn her I was here . The squawk I gave was not really meant to reach halfway down the crooked rumble of the brook . I stayed kneeling , one hand crushing some ill-smelling weed which had come among its fingers , the other all suddenly knuckles between my teeth to keep me from crying out to her any more . I watched the shining wet of her arms as she reached them out into the little rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her laugh like this in many months  --  as her shirt fell back and the cold , breath-robbing spray pelted her quickening skin and ran in tinier waterfalls again from off her upheld wrists . All the pent lust of a nervous , long abstinent man scratched within me . If I could have yelled now , it would not have been to warn her but out of a bestial impatience because she took so long to undress , to show herself as naked as I knew she was going to , under my suddenly hot eyes . I knew , too , what price I had given life for this . . . the whacks taken , the laughs and kicks and sickening sprawls I had had to accept , the bruise of Ovide 's boot upon me that time when I had run in bashfulness from her puddling , freezing body on the bunk . . . all for this , that I should know the joy and honor of the role of Peeping Tom . That I should long , as all men born of woman should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the white , slim , merry body of the female of my kind . That I should see at last all the eager , singing nakedness I had always known there would be below the lifted young throat of my beloved . Sooner or later she must look up and see me kneeling here in the high green . She will see me through the dancing of a little rainbow , through a curtain of flying sun drops , and she will cry out , startled and shielding herself instinctively , before she flushes . . . the slow , deep flush I have seen go up her face when she looks at me nowadays ... flushes , exclaims again , laughs softly , laughs with that long toss of her head I have watched so often but neverp235until now knew could be the carrier of laughter all the way up her open and adventurous body . And so you , too , 0 klootchman the woman , beware the white man 's eyes upon you , the heat of his eyes and his long-bound heart and the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , 0 klootchman the softskinnedwoman , 0 kloshe the white beloved , with your sea-soaked destiny lying in my toughened and at last unhesitatinghands , with your smooth white hide so prized of millionaires and famous mountebanks , courtiers and yellow-maned heroes ... . I remembered in coarse parade all the details of my tutelage : the ripe , lazy breasts of the brown girl of KarakaKoua , the dark luxury of her wide loins in among the moonlit flowers , her childish crooning over the silly shoe buckle I had given her in payment for the night , and how neither of us had ever known the other 's name . Since then , too , the sight grown common and comical and unremarkable of squat young Indian girls fresh from behind their puberty screens , their red bodies offensive with grease and ochre , their hard buttocks flaring and grotesquely striped . So that , even as I got upon my feet and started to look down the rocks , I knew that I no longer wanted to see her . Between the sight of her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mist that was half disgust , half pity , a skeptical sense of the denial of anything good or anythingbeautiful which I had long since effected for my own heart 's hardening , a knowledge of the pact I had made and sealed with the black sulphur of the powder run , and which must sacrifice even her who had been that bitter pact 's chief urge . Between her and me , the flesh of so many men who had enjoyed her , I could be sorry for her . . . but call her by the right , cheap name that she deserved . And the flesh of all the strange animal women to whom love would never mean more than a shoe buckle and a thumping and a biting in the dark . I turned my back . Not in consternation , this time , or shyness , or overmoral shame . I had had my look . In spite of not wanting to , I had looked and seen her . In her white and lovely nakedness I had seen her . Desirable , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane . And weary , aloof , quickly sickened of my instinct , wanting never to see her body again . For so I loved her , loved her that much and in that fashion . One glance had given me her body 's secret , the secret of why her name and Ovide 's would continue to couple themselves inevitably , inseparably in my mind ... always , paired , glued fast in a concept of parenthood for me all the remaining days of my life . It was true , then , and I saw in one glance that it was true , this thing which all the damned old-womanishness in me had recently suspected . One glance , and I had turned and clambered back to the beaver dam . Out of her sight and hearing . Out of her destiny , swiftly and far away from the fond destiny gathering in her womb ... and I laughed at myself when I saw the reflection of the gesture I made of dumping all my presumptuous romanticsinto this opaque black pool . Was it at the mirror of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me try to hide it . There were little streaks of bubbles fanning out from the little glittering nostrils . You had had your warning , gentle worker . My master , richest of the white men , does not believe in warning little beavers . That is bad business , 0 , eena the beaver . That is bad for destiny , whose tool is the pistol I am pulling from my pocket . See , little eena , have you ever before seen in your blackp237pool so curious a reflection as this of my arm outstretched . . . towards your glittering little nostrils , outstretched , towards your body which will shine so prettily on my master 's wall . . . as prettily , see , as the pistol at my arm 's end ? ... The shot brought panic to the woods . Great trees threw the heinous noise of it back upon me , the ravine spewed sudden smoke . Among his old black leaves , threshing and fast muddying and bloodying the pool , the little beaver struggled with death and died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt his millions . In Canton  --  I heard it as plainly as though it had been only yesterday and I stood so close I could see the red neck bulging with strong hair , and could smell the excellent beer in his silver tankard  --  in Canton it voult pring five huntret tollars . I hurried back to camp . The pistol barrel reeked and stayed hot in my hand for a short while . Then it , too , cooled . When I was far enough away to be sure that Perraultwould not know who it had been , I began to whistle gayly through tight , icy lips . But gayly . A goot pelt . . . a goot salute to destiny . Comcomly 's favorite huy-huy man , his most expert bargainer , sat facing me beside the river over a pile of goods we had just finished trading . He was a bony old fellow , his face so wrinkled that it looked like a long discardedpiece of salmon net with two holes rotted into it for eyes . He was , I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trusted accountant of all the blankets and nails , the large coppers , red flannel bolts and blue beads accumulatingso miraculously in his chief 's vast potlatch house . He could count twenty on his haiqua shells . He had traveled much in his middle age and knew words of the Nootka , the English , and the Bella Bella . In our honor he had changed his name to Thunder-and-Lightning Bird . He had many names . He nodded back at me over the painted sculpin box in which he was carrying home all of to-day 's new wealth . He was in good humor . He had managed to argue a paper of gold spangles , worth sixpence , and five little spools of worsted out of me instead of the two I had originally offered him , in exchange for merely one sea otter . He would probably try to palm a sixth spool , too , when he thought I was not watching . I could afford not to watch . I nodded back , equally good-natured . " Tell me this , old Scallighan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , your Tyhee Comcomly ? " I grinned , knowing delightedly that he would understand only one word in seven , and that his own grin was a mask of oiliness and innumerable dirty wrinkles . " What the devil does he want with all this wealth , anyway ? " He had heard the name of his master . He had at least understood my stranger 's way of pronouncing the word chickamin , the word for money , wealth . In his old crow 's voice he began to give me back jargon for jargon . " My tyhee , the great One-Eye Comcomly , is richer and mightier than any other tyhee among the Chinook . He is richer and mightier than any other tyhee among the Chehalis , the Cowichan , and the Nisquali to the north , or among the Clatsop and Tillamook southward . He has made mahkook with the tilikum from far , cold harbors where olhiyu , the seal-people , lie in wait and nenamooks , the otter , washes in with the kelp . He has made huy-huy with the huloima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the inland hills . He has sent ever more of his kinsmen in hunt of the whale , the sturgeon , all the bigp239and little people of creek and river mouth and pounding sea which give men of their fats and winter oils and flames to see by in the otherwise black night . He has built his salmon weirs out to circle all the islands of low tide . He has built many houses of cedar for the living of his people , for the ceremonies of his sept , for the stowing of his furs and copper shields and his bright blankets so numerous that only I , who can count up to twenty , can count the twenty times twenty twenties of his riches there . " The old rascal gave me a grunt when he had come this far . He was turning a lime stick critically , sprinkling it with a tobacco powder as black as his fingers . " Yes , of course , all homage to him and his one wise eye , " I protested . " But why ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  among people like yours , where wealth . . . well , why ? " Clear shallows just under our hunching place had grown lively , distracting , with the arrival of a school of small fish . Their little silver bellies flashed like thrown coins . " On the house posts of his houses are carved the crests of the Tyhee Comcomly 's ancestors and the tales of his own prowess . No tyhee in the memory of the river has raised so many house posts or caused such splendid legends to be carved . None has so many wives with so many gleaming anklets or such marvelously flattened heads , such heavy labrets pulling down their lips . None has ever fulfilled the customs of the potlatch so magnificently with such thanks for his son 's initiation , or flung such priceless quantities of olachen fluid so wastefully into the celebration fire until the smoke holes crackle red , or broken so many coppers apart , sunk so many of his own canoes , slain so many of his slaves , given away so many of his blankets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame . " " Bravo ! " I said . " I begin to understand the ethics of riches . "  | He popped the lime stick into his mouth . The suck he gave it drew his cheeks far in . Then they puffed slowly out again with excruciating pleasure , away from the burningmixture , until the old fish net of wrinkles over them had almost disappeared . " Your own tyhee , then , " he asked at length , " your farawayruler over thunderbirds , what does he do with all the beaver skins and red flannels and blankets and blankets that are in his many mahkook houses all across the world ? Has he found such grander use for all his shining chickamin ? Has it made him so much mightier and happier among you , made him so much more youtl tumtum than the Tyhee Comcomly is among his kinsmen of the river and the bays ? " I caught the undying cunning of his old , sore eyes . I was as amused as he was . The little fish were tossing pursefulsof silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're right , " I agreed . " I 'm not allowed to ask my tyhee any such questions . . . so I ca n't be sure . " " One-Eye Comcomly has found power of life and death , " he persisted softly , " over whole twenties of magic makers , live-dog eaters , famous harpooners of ehkole the whale , great corpse snatchers and secret singers of the winter ceremony , warriors and salmon spirits and the unflattenedforeheads of countless slaves . Has the chickamin of your own far-away tyhee given him power over more than these ? " One-Eye Comcomly , " he added most proudly , " has twenty times twenty enemies . " I chuckled . I remembered the slow , befuddled wrath of the farmers of Putnam County , the rumors of all the hasty conferences in state council chambers of Madrid , St. Petersburg , and London when the news of Mr. Astor 's new empire in the fur lands had arrived , and the Nor ' - westers tasting their wine suddenly bitter in the fortsp242and club rooms and muttering promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had his power over great magic makers , money gobblers , soldiers , hunters , skinners of the dead , his singers in velvet and the footlights ' glow , his slaves among the tea-stacks and the dusty bins , and all the flattery of many enemies . My mind went back once more to that hot , idle afternoon in King Tamehameha 's courtyard , to long-nosed prime minister Kraimoku retailing me the glories of his celebrated Eri 's reign beneath the dusty palms . I heard again that dry , humorous old voice . " All people are made happy in the power and riches of one man among them . " Silver shillings scattering all around us . Silver chickamin springing in teasing profusion to the surface , to the sun . I laughed . " But , what is your master 's most valuable possession , Sir Scallighan , shall I tell you ? It is this , that among his servants there is one especially crafty , a rogue so much a rogue that he knows the foolishness of being anything but faithful . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as all rogues with sharp noses and lean legs and slow , low voices in a world of the butchers ' necks of great dull domineerers . " He was not even trying to make out what I tried to say . He had sucked his lime stick to a crayon point . He leaned a little towards me between his crossed old knees , eying the goods at my side with elaborate carelessness . He would let me philosophize a little while longer . I was indulging myself in a prodigious nonsense . I was saying , over and over , " Mr. Tamehameha , Eri Comcomly , Tyhee Astor , John Jacob Comcomly , Eri Astor , Tyhee Tamehameha . . . " It actually annoyed me when I could no longer give one of them the other 's title . As though any of the titles could be wrong . As though there were any difference. 14 " We rogues who know there is no difference , and yet pretend so skilfully , with such ornamental and convincing boasts , and who would commit all the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imperial names ... we lean rogues , we fast-wrinkled ministers of villainy extraordinary to their dense , busy , power-strident minds . . . woe unto us , old Scallighan . We shall give them our bony shoulders for hoists to see Heaven . Heaven with its radiance of brand-new shillings , its aeon-wide floors of red flannel , its blue-beaded dome and its angels of brown wiles with dugs as big as coconut pods . . . on our thin , heel-dirtied shoulders we shall hoist them until , in spite of their short necks , they 'll see well across the wall of Heaven , of highest Saghalie , the House of Myths , and speak with God as to a partner , to a kinsman , at God 's own height . While we , Sir Scallighan , old rogue . . . while we three faithful rogues ... " He looked up slyly . He drew back his dry black hand a little when he saw me watching it . And that set me roaring so boisterously , I surprised him into pulling altogether back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave it to him with my loudest blessing . He grunted . He was obviously disappointed . I had robbed him of the privilege of stealing it while I talked . The thousands of little fish flashed and hoarded silver sunlight . I stood behind a circle of five old conjurers : the tamahnawismen of their tribes , those men above and apart from all others , who must never touch their hands to their own hair , and who had bones thrust through their septums , and possessed a strength of magic over other men 's souls and over the dangerous souls of the dead which infestp243and misgovern the bodies of the living , and a knowledge of all the future in all lands . I listened to their five varying and sagely disputatious tales of the beginning and the end of earth , the coming and the going of mankind , the forms and whereabouts , names , intentions , and experiences of the Supreme One , and when I went away I carried with me only the confused and insubstantial wisdom that has been given in a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hired of Comcomly for our passage North . He had drifted down with the many visiting sturgeon fishermen from Gray 's Harbor . A young man still , a captive of the Clayoquots in his boyhood , but ransomed and come home with a smattering of naval English and Spanish and all the VancouverCoast dialects . And a fawning , clever air . He stood next me , translating the venerable conjurers in a demeaning , half-derisive way , apologetic and a little angry that they took no notice of us , that they spoke such things in the presence of a rich tkope tilikum like me . If it had not been for him I should have thought I was dreaming . Gnats danced in brown , translucent swarms over the uncombed heads of this synod , and they used their delicatescratching sticks continually while they talked . The venerable on my right was dissertating on the natureand omnipotence of Etalapass , the Supreme One , the Saghalie Tyhee of land and water and furthest sky . The creature next along , whose septum-hole made a high , mewingnoise whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second divinity , more human , more man-like and more man 's friend . For Etalapass , even though he created man , created him with mouth unopened , with eyes fast shut , with unpuncturedears and immovable hands and feet , whereas the less creative Ecannum had understood the plight of man 's imperfection and had taken a sharp stone and compassionatelylaid open man 's mouth and eyes and given usefulness and skill to all his members . No more than a semi-deity , this Ecannum , addicted to several venial bad habits , such as stealing and kidnaping from his faultless fellow gods , but full of the knowledge of all the things man craved to know , and teaching him generously to make canoes , nets , paddles , to bend wood for boxes , and how to carve his weapons , his cooking implements and memorial posts . He had been even so kind as to throw great rocks into the river and obstruct the ascent of the salmon , so that man might take his fill and feast in the proper seasons . But the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his wild head and gave both these former advocatesthe lie . For it had been revealed to him that the Supreme One was a woman , a woman who dwelt aloft beyond all reach of men 's joys or sorrows , sins or braveries , a woman eternally young and eternally indifferent , eternally unenlightened of the wants of earth or the longingsof any of its people . Then the one who was next to this old conjurer , and who dribbled through his blow-pipe and had many red ants climbing and slipping and climbing up again upon the grease ponds of his kneecaps , denounced them all and told how he had learned among the far Northern Haida that the Supreme One was Wigit , who reaches behind him whenever a baby is born and picks out blindly the little stick of the length of that new life . While , for the fifth of the priests , the Supreme One dwelt nowhere unless at the end of the endless inland forests , and on this day He was a beaver and that day a land otter and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dead flowers gather . P245But Etalapass could be all these things and also a killer whale , besides , claimed the first tamahnawis man . And Ecannum , said the second , could be both killer whale and beaver-king , and a thieving raven , too . And even a woman when he wished to . They called to their helpers to build them a fire in the center of the circle . They nagged and taunted each other over the uncomfortable flames of the hot day . The gnat cloud chased away ; another of sour , yellow-veined smoke took its place . The helpers brought masks for them to wear ; huge wooden travesties and symbols of fellow animals and birds , sea monsters and nightmarish cannibal faces behind whose wooden teeth , prime-colored beaks , and muzzles the magicians gave muffled imitations in praise and defenseof their contending gods . The quarrel and the fire grew together . The old men clambered up and shook and screamed . But none could scream the others down . They clashed beak to muzzle , pulled strings and opened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shuddered themselves into a pumping rhythm of frenzy , the poor convulsionsof old men who can not achieve more than palsy and thin sweat puckering their grease coats . Then suddenly one of them was in the fire , screaming his Wigit 's name , screaming a few times more from the unendurable pain of the trial before he came out again with his legs speckled with little oil flames and smelling of cooked ants . And then the next was in the fire , out of it , then in again . And then the next and the next . . . so that God might be given a name and the Supreme One find a reason . The smug piebald young interpreter wanted me to come away . He kept telling me he knew the idiocy of thisiI .   exhibition . He kept assuring me he knew that God had no other name than the name of the owner of the Thunderbird , and that the Supreme One 's , the Saghalie Tyhee 's one and only name was Mr. Easter . Was it not so ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's deck when he was still a little boy ? Was there , could there be any other God so saghalie . . . as our famous Mr. John Jacob Easter ? I smiled . I said : " None other . " So I said , Lord . . . and knew not what I said . There was the glare around me of a confused dream . I listened to them talking in the fort of how comfortablethe living quarters would be when they were done . The white men 's talk , too , for all its plain , familiar details of blue clay , logs , and cedar-shakes roofing , came to me only vaguely and without any personal interest , as though I were hearing them promise things of some entirely foreign place which I knew I should never see . They talked of a separate dining room . Well and good ; and of a private room for each of the partners , a large apartment for the men and the artificers . They 'd build them leisurely between exploring parties throughout the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmith'sforge , first of anything , to keep the Indians away from the new tools and nails . Good . By the time we of the Tonquin put back here  --  late August , or surely September , say  --  it would be all quite complete . Governor Dunkie and Madame M'Dougall would be out of the poor little canvas tent of their embarrassedhoneymoon and moved into a larger , more befittingsuite of logwork and royal furs . Oh , yes , andP247Koaster the carpenter had already started work on the presses we needed for all the furs already soiling in the storehouse . There 'd be more presses for all the more furs we 'd surely bring back . Well and good . The Tonquin must up anchor positively in the next few days . Captain Jonathan Thorn , commanding , etc. , had had his patience pulled taut to the end of May . June first would be the day after to-morrow . Now that the woods were plentifully green and warm and the river bank crowdingwith summer flowers , I should be going back aboard to walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to be sorry about it . I could no longer be either that or especially glad . My head was chockful of sums of jackknives and bead strings , tobacco and sixpenny chisels we had divided  --  without bloodshed , at least  --  with the fort . Automatically I was already balancing each commodity against so and so many seals and otters , curage and export expenses , profits in terms of Hamburg drafts and China tea . Chockful , and still the quickest head among us at such things . ... " Dot wass how I , too , began to be a millionaire . " As though that were my whole life nowadays . That and , once aboard again , to rub hates with Jonathan Thorn . I had not spoken to Perrault since the day I had seen her at the falls . She did not know why I was avoiding her . I was not trying to avoid her . I was trying to speak to her . What was there for me to say ? A hundred things should and must be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? By me , of all of us , her betrayedduenna . . . and was it a midwife 's part I should be expected to play next ? The flush of a little wench in trouble and following me everywhere around the camp , as though I were her madame and supposedly versed in how . . . that was all it meant . She flushed when I turned about and tried toP248speak to her , and I could not say anything kindly to her , anything at all . The captain would order her along . I almost laughed in his face when he did . He 'd be damned if he 'd give the partners the satisfaction of letting him sail without his cabin boy . A no-good cabin boy , a butter-fingers and a squeaky eunuch , and ' d grow up into a morphodite sooner ' n into a midshipman . But , by God , who in hell did they think they were that they could keep his cabin boy ashore ? He was already vile about Mate Mumford . Ever since we were inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonquin . He had had his fill ( at the top of his New England voice to the all too sympathetic voyageurs and partners ) of ragging and browbeating and bad seamanship . He had been sent out deliberately to drown . The captain could jangle irons at him , strike him from the log , put Job Aitken in his place , or do what he liked about it . I took pleasure in repeating it so to the captain , and how the partners were going to sign Mr. Mumford to their company without even consulting the captain 's wishes . Too , I used that purple moment to add , as if it had just now occurred to me , that Governor M'Dougall of Fort Astor , Point George , the Oregon Wilds , had commissioned me to request the honor and unbounded pleasure of the company of Captain Jn . Thorn , etc. , at his wedding in Chinook Village on the evening of June first , tides and other details of departure permitting . And when , with proper reluctance , I agreed that all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dignity of her going , the hills above the ship had belched back echoes of a profane , crazy fury , and Indians idling around us had paddled sharply away . P249My heart bounded , as though that were my whole life nowadays . To color that wind-stitched map of his face . To help skin the freckles from his rough fist when he bashed it against the woodwork and stabbed at the insinuationof my tales . Secretly to exult  --  when secrecy was the essence of such exultation  --  in my sure talent for smirking him , baiting him , into these rages of his which raised him from a whiny little watchdog to a devil worth bedeviling . They sent me after Ovide de Montigny to tell him he had been selected to come with us as assistant to Mr. M'Kay . An honor , this selection . There was not one among the young Canadians who did not idolize Mr. M'Kay and want to clerk for him . Now , especially , when there was an odor of conspiracy about Mr. M'Kay 's having been voted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ovide would be proud to come . I went looking for him around the camp , tasting in the back of my mouth the irony of my having to tell him he was coming . These lion-haired heroes who are brought along to ornament every adventure . And Perrault . . . she would need him now . Need him against all the men and the embarrassments of shipboard , in the next few months as never before . Ovide , alternately surly and smiling , mastiff in the manger concerning a girl who adored him but only bored him , and who drove him to childish jealousy whenever her applauding eyes . . . never mind , Perrault would need him now . Had she told him ? How much had she had to tell him ? If I could guess , must n't he know for certain ? He must know . He must come along . He must be glad to come , damn him . P250I looked for him on the river bank and down the . cove , I climbed the hill and called for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hand and was crushing it with nervous fingers , lifting it absent-mindedly to my nose to possess the sweet pungence of its bruises . It was an old habit of mine . I remembered teaching my school children to do it . I remembered the round , apple-glossy Dutch faces of some of them . Yesterday I had passed a baby being tortured in its cradle  --  the fort was overrun with Indians and their belongings , nowadays , and their women were everywhere around  --  and the filthy baby 's eyes had been enormous and three quarters out of their sockets with the pain of a tight forehead strap . I had stopped and bent down . A young mother had screeched and come at me with crusted hands and a spruce-wood needle . The baby had bawled with fright , all its little body shuddering up into the monstrousness of its fixed , thong-bound face . I had fled . I was fleeing now . . . from children 's faces . Digging nervously into the fibrous little wounds of the green sprig in my fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knuckle creases and under my nails , while I fled the thought of a child that must be born into such a world of great clashing forests and no song that could ever be set to music , among men who would only hiccup at the ribald joke of it , among none but Indian women whose own children were like flies under cakes of summer flies . Fleeing the necessity to care for her , or for anyone , or to keep even this one small , futile tie to charity and pity and a gentle past . Let Ovide care for her . Let Ovide do the honors of shielding her , midwifing her , when the day came for her to go into the woods and , like an Indian woman I hadP251seen , grasp at the bushes with outflung , shuddering arms and legs and let earth tear her brat down from her womb . Ovide alone should do it . It was not mine to care . As for all the rest of them , the white men , red and brown Islanders , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would live greedily upon each other in the haphazard process of extermination which they explained to themselves as a patriotic commerce , in the buzzing cycle of exchange of myths and house plans and their various money , their own hides and their old diseases , the most foolish scum of their tongues to compose a jargon suitable to their need to betray each other in a daily trade ... as for these others , they mattered nothing at all . They mattered less to me than a beaver swollen with death and decaying , torn and upturned in its desecrated pool . I was the shrewdest of them all at trading and numbers . I could be the most casual of them all at everything . I had made me a universe of my own lacks and grievances , and had put a supremely thick-necked god of my own over it . A god whose neatest and most faithful servantI was remoulding at last into his most dangerous enemy . I was the Devil 's own creator in a theology of my own thought . . . and my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-imposed , disdainfully sober to the thought that I , with my little fly 's soul , had found power over all the other flies , the other animals , all nature , and in the end would be more powerful than God . I failed to find Ovide . I came down again into the camp , past the Indians idling with great jabber around the forge , from one knot to another of our own men talking about the future buildings of the fort . . . and none knew where Ovide was . At last he came to the warehouse door when I called . P252He filled the door frame picturesquely . He stood nursing his left arm 's sling as he leaned back upon the logs . He had a sleepy look , as though he had been in the cool privacy of the warehouse a long while . Annoyed as he was , he smiled . " What are you doing in there , De Montigny ? I have been looking every " I find it an excellent place to mind my own affairs , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , not yours , " I retorted . " I happen to have important news for you . " " No doubt . Save yourself the trouble . I happen to have important business of my own at the moment . " His shirt was open and rumpled back . His laugh exercisedall the quick cords across his naked chest . His fingers played up and down the gay pleats of his sling as though it were a woman 's bodice . " I am to tell you , you have been selected " Precisely , Lewis , I could guess all that . And some other time I shall take pains to explain why I can not accept . But some other time . " " Not accept ? Not come along ? Oh , so . " He blocked the doorway . There was that indefinable odor of arrogance about him , the air of a young man physically and immediately charming and aware of the ease of his way with all people . . . with women most easily . " So , " I repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M'Kay , I suppose ? Shall I say , a previous engage-ment ? " But he could beat me any day at the game of taunting . It gave him his favorite tone : " Tiens , dear James , a previous engagement . . . that will do nicely . I trust the kind gentlemen will understand , but I frankly prefer to join Mr. Stuart 's canoe trip exploring up the river . "  | " Mr. Stuart is one of the gentlemen who invites you to the Tonquin , instead . Even Mr. Stuart can be unkind enough to see the uselessness of a man with a broken arm among his canoe men . " " My arm is doing nicely , thank you . " He made a handsomeshow of proving that he could already lift it a little in its sling . " I am sure it would not mend as well in the sea air . " I was determined not to let him anger me . It did not concern me whether he came along or stayed behind . Let Perrault worry over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was seeing two things which amazed me . The first was that I was taller than he was . Of course I was , when I stood straight . . . but why , all these months , had I never stood straight against him and known it before ? And secondly , across his shoulder in the dim cavecoolnessof the furthest corner of the warehouse , a frowzy and obscene little figure , sprawling grinning and complacenton a tumble of fresh furs , I saw the young Indian girl . I had known long before I saw her that someone was there , someone like this behind him , giggling and sharpbreastedunder the charge of his impudent love-making . The impudence of him , here , in the crowded center of the fort , in the plainest daylight of open windows and men passing and repassing , as though he had deliberately planned to give the camp a flagrant peepshow . He knew that I had seen the girl . He pretended not to know it . He shifted a little in the doorway  --  and he smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . Her stupid eyes and the accidental high-lights on her grease-slicked , lumpy little body were all that I saw . She had pressed back upon the fur-mound , into the dim corner . She may or may not have been Comcomly 's daughter , bride-to-be of Governor Unkie Dunkie , supposedly fasting and praying at home in the Chinook village , in the cedar house especially dedicated to the purification of the Tyhee 's women , but already planting on the M'Dougall brow Captain Thorn 's wedding present of a pair of antlers from the hills . Except for the blunt humor of such a chance of who she was , I did not want to know . " Or shall we simply say , dear James , that I prefer to stay off the Tonquin ? . . . Everybody will agree with me that your Yankee captain is an unpleasant devil . " A devil he called him , and this made it my round to smile . " That was Mate Mumford 's excuse . Seasickness is a better one for you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse ? Very well , then , seasickness . The truth , you know , is that it will be a long , dull voyage without adventure or any smallest danger .... I am not interested in trade . I can find brighter duties here . " I could have sworn he was purposeful in the way he raised and flourished his right arm up the door frame , so that I might be sure to see the little Chinook girl , restless in her corner . His self-consciousness was of itself a completechallenge . All these months I had never known that I was as tall as he was . I stood straight against him , staring into his eyes until the taunt that played in them broke and hid behind lids already heavy with his love-making . As tall as he was , perhaps even an inch taller . . . and once he had kicked me out of a doorway , out of a girl 's sight . " You fail to see the brightness of your duty to Per-rault . " I said it slowly , intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , willing to give him time to establish some new telltale pose . But he was suddenly too ridiculous for further patience ,  | " Perrault ? The cabin boy ? Why .. I came close to him . I did not want the whole camp to hear . I could have struck him as I talked . " Perrault , " I repeated . " You who have called me a coward time and time again . Your cheap aping can not cover your cowardice about Perrault . Do you need me to tell you that , instead of hiding your consternation behind little rutting Indian girls and cuckolding your masters to regain your self-esteem , you have a duty to Perrault .. . to Perrault who , God knows why , still ... " " Finish it , friend Lewis , finish it if you can . " His jangle of words and mirth made a parody of defiance . " Swear to me , by all that 's noble and self-sacrificing , that of course she still adores me . M'Dieu , you should know . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father . " At the very instant I slapped his face I saw Perrault herself coming down the camp ground , walking slowly and peering everywhere among the people , as though she had been looking for someone a long while . In my rage I knew she must not see him now . He had no chance to retaliate . My slap went across his eyes . He stumbled back into the warehouse . I drove my fist hard against his sling before he could recover , and he continued backwards past the doorway , his own single curse as high pitched as the yelp of the Indian girl when he sat down , hard-jolted and stupefied with pain , on the dirt floor . I grabbed the door and pulled , slammed , held it shut . Panting , I held it . I shall never know why he did not yank it open . He did not try . There was no tug at all from the other side . He too may have seen Perrault coming in that instant before my hand slapped across his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and hot from the sting of his face bones , gave off anew a soft , fanciful pungence of evergreen.  | Perrault had not seen him . It was only I she saw as she came across the camp . She stood looking at me , wondering , timidly amused , from the bastion 's deep shadow . I had to risk letting go the latch and standing free to meet her . " What in the world are you doing , Lewis ? Where have you been all day ? I have been looking for you everywhere . " For me ? " With a lonely little try at her old-time coquetry she made a gesture which said , " For no one else . " And her lips , already a little thickened and drained by her pregnancy , added : " Do you still mind so much ? " Under the rough pile of logs and the wild carousel of branches , she looked so lost , so small . " Mind ? " I protested . " I do not mind . But I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me except . . . I do not care . " But all the while I was repeating it , I was walking her gently back , away from the warehouse , from Ovide , in and out among them all , our arms linked and quiet , bashfulas two boys in a schoolyard friendship . A great tree 's shadow ran up and down her old , shapeless clothes as though a black whip scourged her . She pressed close to me . The huge new potlatch hall of the Chinooks stank of a hundred impaled , furiously burning candle fish , of buried ovens griming under the big central fire , and roof beams charring above it , of carved and newly dyed food bowls all oily and brimming with seal meat , halibut heads , and the olachen-fatted puddings of berries and salmon spawn . It stank , too , of all the women squatting in the sweaty restraint of taboo on the wooden terraces around us , and of the warriors who stamped among us with faces of ani/mats and daubed bodies streaming under the glut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog which had been overlong sacrificed and dead , still waiting to be buried at the foot of the newly crested house post which the Tyhee Comcomly had raised in honor of his son-in-law . Of the warm , riled dirt beneath our hams it stank , and of freshly cut cedar , of bitter smoke and stifling , imprisoned air , the many gassy , warring greases of fish and humans , until the distaste of it seemed almost to coagulate and drip in opaque , fire-pierced beads from all the red planks above and about us . Strange , dehumanized creatures sprang in and out of the dense glare . Creatures with the signs of the sculpin upon them , and of the raven , the sea monster , the mosquito snout , the moon hawk , and the killer whale . Creatures who yowled and gibbered with a terrible cordiality , who had whipped their bodies sore with hemlock branches in fresh water , but who stank . Around that fat white cherub , the bridegroom , they clustered and rattled , squealed , pranced with showers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song of the wedding bear . Around the bride her relatives , defying the heat with sweated robes of sea-otter skins and broad queues of Tlingit ermine , chanted over and over her virtues and beauty , the generosity of her royal father , the great price the groom must pay for alliance with so royal a family , with a maiden of such celebrated fertility and allure . Betweenthem , at the foot of The M'Dougall 's tall crest pole , the dead dog waited with the teeth marks of cannibals still welling in its hairy throat . The conjurers were giving some foolish sleight-of-hand performances perfected in the winter plays ; they had unclotheda woman for execution , whirled a sharp paddle and seemed to cleave her with it , straight through her shoulder , down into her breast . Blood gushed from somewhere  --  froma hidden bladder , probably  --  and great lamentation began as the tamahnawis man dragged his gory victim underground . A few minutes later he brought her back , wholly cured and scatheless , a miracle , alive and shrilly self-proclaiming . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying up the little cedar-string figure designed to be the core of the bride 's diary , the long ball of daily knots , plain or beaded or red-ragged , which would hold the tightly rolled history of her private life . Perhaps there would be gilt buttons tied into it at times , or harsh-colored threads from a voyageur 's ceinture . Or golden hairs from a young man 's mane , unexplainable to anyone else , hard for even herself to remember in the years of hagdom ahead . We  --  Farnham and I , for he was not coming on the Tonquin , and these were the few final hours before she sailed  --  sat together on the ground , our backs against one of the rude mounting-steps , grease stubborn and malodorous on the planks behind us where we had wiped our hands free of food . " See , the giving begins . " One-Eyed Comcomly had mounted the potlatch platform . He and the men of his family were tossing blankets down into the crowd . Red blankets which bellied and sank in gaudy bloat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering , and rolled them up for some future potlatch in return . The women 's clamor broke . A rush to the platform 's edge . Red arms , a red forest in storm , reaching up , wriggling , fighting for finger space , for room to clutch and hold the prized possessions which were being tossed down in a climax of the feast . Native goat-wool blankets of heavy yellow and blue designs , thick-fringed , years of faithful weaving in them ,  |p259thudded  down and were hallooed , acknowledged with wild business , carried back and away . Cheap red blankets from out of the Tonquin 's hold , pitifully prized with even more delight because of their garishness and newness . Big black bowls , beaver handled , abalone eyed . Boxes of bent wood , startlingly carved , roofed and painted in miniature of the cedar houses . Furs from swiftly demolishing stacks , furs tossing down with red gleams and twirling paws into the shrieks and clutches of the guests . Blankets , blankets like red faces with wind-filled cheeks , and more blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of Comcomly 's request , The M'Dougall had made us pass some of it out among the Indians . A wedding without hiccups . . . not for him . He was nettled because neither Mr. M'Kay nor Captain Thorn had done him the decency to come . They 'd betrayed their jealousy , that was all . Jealousy of his good fortune , his luck with the lassies .. . y ' canna keep a true Scotsman away from ' em . . . jealous because he was conducting himself like the pious Nor ' - wester he still was . . . . And by God , give ' em all to drink . So that , in the annals of the river , there was never a potlatchlike this one . From the platform Father Comcomly looked proudly down on his awed , befuddled debtors . Now he was giving away his copper shields . No tyhee among the Clatsop , the Tilamook , or any of the Salish tribes could possibly have as many copper shields to give away . One to each sept 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still the burnished stack of them was not yet gone . Comcomly 's single eye burned in its shrewd socket . Behind him his favorite old huy-huy man , he who could count twenty twenties on his haiqua shells , remembered all that his master gave away , what and how much to each of them , and what each of them would have to return with vaunting interest , twofold , threefold , in future potlatches to preserve his reputation , his credit , his very chieftainship , the glory of his totem . They kept immaculately sober , Comcomly and his treasurer . The stinking candle-fish torches spattered them with greenish light , lit up their almost sweet complacence . Carved spindle whorls , alderwood urinals , beaters and shredders and war clubs of whale 's rib and jade . The slaves kept bringing them in from the heap laid out upon the beach for public admiration . Floats and hunter 's boxes , bailers and checkered mats and fine baskets from the Northern straits and far Alaskan islands . Each guest , according to his rank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts to the house of Comcomly in potlatches of old , must be rewarded , impressed , confounded . . . and indebted . Carved harpoon rests , dancing aprons , dishes of mountainsheep horn , monumental settees , dentalia hair binders , blankets . Blankets , blankets . Let each drunken chieftain , and each groggy member of his sept , remember to his dying day the richness of the mahkook house of the Chinook tyhee and die beggared and broken-hearted in some future attempt to outdo the generosity of Comcomly of the One Eye , ruler of the river mouth , father-in-law of all Fort Astor . " They 're such children about it , " said Farnham . He had all the loftiness of a tipsy reformer . I nodded . The din grew ear-splitting . Comcomly had given stone drivers into his slaves ' hands and had ordered them to break the remaining shields . He could afford to break a half dozen coppers , with horned owls ' faces engraven , and throw the pieces into the sea . Which of his rivals , covetous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them drink of the oil of humility and acknowledge his kingly wastefulness , his prestige over all . " Such damned children about it , " shouted Farnhamp261again . " They 'll all be beggars before we 're done with ' em . Men of your sort , Lewis . . . so much smarter . . . they 'll all ... " Out of the hellish racket leaped tall flames . For a final challenge Comcomly had ordered precious reservoirs of olachen oil to be thrown upon the fire . Heat and **27;1327;TOOLONG outwards from their own deep roar . A young harpooner , drunk , his face a revolting smudge of sweat and ochre , staggered past us towards the riverdoorladder . He was naked , his mantle of wood-rats ' skins held up in his hands in front of him and loaded with gifts of the feast . Men of your sort , Lewis . So much smarter . Men with the genius of profit in them . Of profit and destruction . I shouted to the young harpooner . Ile stumbled , stopped . Bat-eyed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , stood leering down at us . " Trade , trade , " I whispered to him . " Mahkook ! " He knew the white man 's way . The white man who never gave back twofold , who never gave back at all , who traded without feast or laughter or honor to anyone . He pulled the ends of his mantle high and tight to keep us from seeing its contents . " Halo mahkook ! " He started to go by us a second time . " Well , a proud beggar , " said Farnham . " I like him for it . Nettled , I grabbed up a bottle from under Farnham 's knee . There was a little rum left in it , a small band of black at the bottom of red glass when I held it up before the fire . " Mahkook . " And as I repeated it I dipped the neck of the bottle slowly in the drunken young savage 's direction . He had stopped again , dribble-mouthed , agonized , watching the glass go down until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Lum , " I said . " Mahkook for lum . " The ends of his mantle sprang away as he grabbed . He made a tragic , beastly sound . All that he had been carryingfell down around us , ours for the patronizing and the pocketing . We both chuckled at the depth of the bottle neck down his throat . So it would be with all of them . In time . In good time with them all . Flames climbed upon flames . Into the central fire , around which in stolid defeat the rival chiefs must stay seated and drink each his spoonful of humility , the slaves of Comcomly still poured his priceless olachen oil . Black clouds charged at the smoke hole and , sped by the heat whorls , stampeded back upon the walls and down upon us . A multicolored blaze ran between ground and roof , pressing so solidly upon both that it might have seemed to emerge from either . It had the deep , gusty , contrabass note of broad flames . Across it , sharper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks , the breaking and clinging of little brands over our heads . I kicked the harpooner 's fallen goods out of my way as I got up . " You can settle with this young sot , " I said . " Goodbye , Farnham . I 'm going aboard . " " Oh , yes . . . good-bye . " He said it as carelessly as I had . We liked each other well enough . We had been together since my first days in Mr. Astor 's Liberty Street establishment . " Say good-bye for me to Ross and Franchere and the rest . Do n't let them neglect their diaries . " He gave me a thin New England grin . " You 'll be back before ... " " Of course , before the summer 's over . " " It 'll all be bigger by then . We 'll have the living quarters up , you know . "  | " Yes , I know . " I would not give in to the unexplainableheaviness that pressed upon the silly little things we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the new fur racks , " I said . " Do n't let them delaythem . We 'll be bringing back otters by the thousands , worth millions . " The roof around the smoke hole had begun to burn . Flickering edges of yellow ran out along the planks . Through the red smoke I saw the closed eye of Father Comcomly , the climax of a wink , and the livid , puffy face of The M'Dougall disgraced by fright . " Like a good Yankee , keep the British away from our flagpole , " I said . Farnham took it for another joke . It might have been . All the upturned foreheads , misshapen , black-tufted , running with sweaty ruin of the paints they had had upon them , upturned towards the final sport of putting out the fire on the roof . All the broad , drunken faces as happy as faces of children just after a first exhibition of fireworks in Vauxhall . I made for the beach door across rows of greasy knees . I climbed the ladder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's your sweet-tempered Captain Thorn , " shouted Farnham . " One of his famous old blank shots . You 'd better hurry . I wish you joy of him . " Joy of him . I stumbled out into a cold night air , into the cleanness of a moon-white sand and coarse , silvered reeds which bordered the path down to the boats . I wanted for a moment to go back to Farnham . . . I was almost certain I must go back ... and tell him to say good-bye for me , too , to Ovide . But I got no more than my head back into the blistering hall . The stink of it . I no longer liked anyone that well . I thanked my own pet god that I did not . The brush of the sea came through the clinking salmon weirs , from far around Cape Disappointment , the disorderly , white deadnessof the smell of the waiting sea . From under the risen wings of a great bird , red-eyed in river darkness , another cannon thundered of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river mouth , in the surf across Point Adams 's bar and the tide rip yellow and gorged with sand . Then at length we carried free of the cape and out upon the ocean , into the north again . Mr. M'Kay made no complaint of tardiness . This commercialsurvey would be tame work , a tiresome indignity which the politics of his partners had foisted upon him . Moreover , the longer we were in the river , the larger chance we had of hearing that Hunt 's overlanders had finally arrived . Mr. M'Kay smoked his Cree pipe alone at the foot of the mast where all the voyageurs had formerly been around him . There were few of us : seventeen white men , twelve Sandwich Islanders , and the Indian interpreter from Gray 's Harbor . Once in blue water , and we should feel the roominessof even a little three hundred tonner like the Tonquin with only thirty men aboard her . The crew worked well . The captain was undisputed . This was his pet expedition , his own special proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost be friends . They sat together at the cabin mess . Sometimes they talked . The spray had the sun in it . Gulls , from the moment when Tillamook 's huge rock sank in back of us , were in holiday around our spars . Once Louis Brusle , who had shipped in Ovide 's place , pointed out to me a sprawl of loosened kelp that floated near the coast . Its long stems were slimy of the sea . It had a torn look . The stems ended in brittle , staring bulbs . Christ , what did they remind me of ? demanded Brusle . Of nothing . Of nothing that had been or that would be . Time was now , and time was pleasant . Now was my respite . All else waited on these days of a blue-white water and the white gulls in sunny rigadoon against the blue . I stretched a back of spare canvas for Perrault to rest against when we sat sometimes at the stern rail . There the long sunlight was clearest and most warming ; over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease the search of a little single cloud for its shadow far out at sea , and the mountains with low folds of snow behind the many bays we passed , and down the silver distance of the straits . While at night , when the cabin wanted neither of us , and the hold and its stacked wares were all clamped away , we had the stars , a suspended shower , and the old white horn of the waning moon butting the hills apart before he could show , too , his watery , brown-gold , winded beard with a spangle of wet stars upon it . But , no , the moon could have no beard , said Perrault . For the moon is a woman , and every woman carries the moon beneath her heart ... I must not ask her why or how . She said it in soft , desperate haste , as though she were saying too much . As though I were a little boy whose innocence demanded fables and ridiculous evasions . As though I could know nothing about herself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me where we 'd be five months from now . Stammering as she asked it , and neither I nor any otherp269man had been in the thoughts she had tried to keep hidden behind her eyes . When I leaned down to give my jacket to her cold , wind-modeled shoulders , it had seemed to me that I leaned endlessly out and to no avail , into a mystery of private fortitude against all pain and mad predicament , towards the kernel of an ecstasy of life which all the tissues of her own life were secretly preparing , to some moment five months hence around which all the quiet sluices of her mind and body were already pouring a protective thankfulnessand pride , and which neither I nor any other man could possibly reach or ever understand . I felt the thinness of her shoulder blades , the bright wind on my bony wrist as I held the old jacket there . She had said a " Gratia taut ' " ... absently , as if the careless Neapolitanstage words were of her mother tongue and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half turned and showing me only the young , high line of her dark cheek , every daily change of which I had watched and knew so well , and her short black hair that curled so ungovernablyin the salt air . But " Gratia tant ' , " she had said . She had said it happily . I remembered it now in the night , when she talked such nonsense of the moon , and when I must agree with her gravely , digging into my recollections from a college mythology class to piece out our pauses with proper instruction . She did not seem to heed my lesson . She swayed a little towards me with the fluid swing of the stern . She blotted out a star or two , and where her head had been upon the sky a few new stars sprang forward . " Ancient peoples almost invariably regarded the moon as feminine , " I told her . " It was a goddess they worshiped up there . Artemis , for example , or Diana , to give her her Roman " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Then quickly , for fear I 'd be in a scholar 's huff at such a frivolous interruption and might fail to ask the meaning : " Oh , a famous old opera of Leo 's , Lewis , Diana Amante . You should know that . I sang it twice in Parma , in a tunic of white pleated silk , so severe but . . . with a bow and arrow . Not silver , though . I was very jealous of the Diana herself because her bow was silver . I can not think who I was . I have forgotten what I sang . " " One of the huntresses , probably . " " Oh no , not just one of the huntresses . Those were small roles . " I should have known better . I begged a diva 's pardon . We were too content to laugh . She spread her hands upon the dark . " It was only a few years ago , but a lifetime .... Once I might have stabbed you joyfully for less than such a little slur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left whole lifetimes behind us , Lewis . " " You have never told me half of yours , " I said . " A singer 's . " " But a  --  a woman 's , a " I was trying to halt myself . " No , I would not have you know it . Not now . But you , " she said , " I think your youth must have been a good one , Lewis , to give you so much peace and kindliness . " The night was my refuge . There were some things about me , too , that she should never know . If she saw peace and kindliness in me , it was enough . Enough for now . " If ever I had a son , Lewis "  --  was she trying to tell me it ?  --  " I should pray to the Infant Jesus that he might have your heart . " " Oh , stop . The Infant JesusBut she would not stop . " The heart you have always held around me as you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should thank for that . . . for you ? " My voice was as dead as my mother herself when I tried to speak of her . " She is long gone . I can not remember her . "  |p271I  saw her hard little hands upon the dark again , and then the sudden clutch they gave at the moon as she raised them over her head . I wondered whether she knew withoutmy adding it that Diana had also been the goddess of childbirth , And of whom she demanded it ; did men always forget their mothers ? I started hastily to tell her of the operas I loved . Of Mozart . Of the old man , the librettist , fabulous and ghostlikein the murmur of a fountain that had been like a miniature of the murmur of this water under our stern , so many thousands of miles away . Of why I had been in the inn garden at all that night . . . until I remembered why I had been , and stopped short . She was too drowsy to insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her again of the first time I had heard her sing . She could not hear it too often . Of how I had marched home through the mud and rain humming her song , and of the face of the old city watchman with the drizzle and the street-light on it as I splashed merrily by . And of the time she had been so amused at me from her high carriage seat on the Battery green . We could be amused together , now . Her head was against my arm . " You are sleepy , " I said . " Go in . " She had retaken possession of the little chart closet , of course . " It is black in there . Let me stay with you . See , I 'll not take cold . " Her old overalls gave a funny screech upon the boards as she curled close . " And I promise . . . I 'll not try to climb the rigging , Lewis , I 'm too tired . . . . I 'll not , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go on , tell . . . talk .... " What plays were they giving there now ? Were Signor Comoglio and his company still singing between the acts and in those elegant concerts at the Commercial House ? The newly repainted Park Theater , fawn , French gray ,  |p272and  purple , with white and gold boxes where they sat , the rich ones , with plump , winy faces over their satin stocks . She was asleep . The Northern dawn would come early . On one hand we should have the far diffused reflection of a sunrise at sea , and on the other the mountains wadded with clouds and streaming faint colors of the mist down all their cataracts . The light would grow gay , and in the blue sky the white gulls would begin to swing and glitter in fresh play around our ropes , and would sit drying themselves along the rail , so close to us that we should see the merry red dab on each one 's golden bill . I brought the end of my coat up as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night breeze had found at the bottom of her throat . Her breasts were enlarging . The gulf that would run between us . . . of mother 's milk . She must have felt my hand there . She murmured something in her sleep . Someone 's name , perhaps . It was not mine . It was nothing . I did not mind . She smiled in her sleep as she murmured it , and the mother moon showed me the same untroubled , silvered face she had worn when she had said that " Gratia taut " ' to me . . . to this little time that was mine . The young Indian interpreter was giving me lessons in the people we 'd trade with here : the Nootka and their island neighbors , the sober Cowichan , the lower settlementsof the Kwakiutl , and the Queen Charlotte dwellers , the Haida , whose isolated , hostile villages we should swing to on our way back from Baranoff 's otter land . Past San Juan de Fuca 's waters we must meet the Clayoquotsfirst . An embittered little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days when the Spaniards had wrangled with the British in near-by Nootka Sound ; P273and only recently a Yankee Captain Ayres had broken faith with them and left a dozen of their best hunters to starve on a desert island of Drake 's Bay . The Russians from Seetka , a bullying and groggy ally , alone knew how to handle the Clayoquots . In Clayoquot Sound . . . oh , yes , please , I must pardon his impertinence , he should not need to suggest it to any noble tilikum of the great Tyhee Easter , but if we carried a boarding net and it was not too much trouble .. . There was something sultry about Kasiascall , our little Indian . His very name was illegitimate and suspicious . And since coming aboard he had been stealing single pieces of clothing from all our ditty boxes , so that he soon had a wardrobe of sorts , a collective dress of all his employers , the white men , which he wore in front of us with sleek anxiety . He assured me often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to Spanish sailors , attributingto her hospitality all his own superior knowledge of the ways of white men 's ships and all the Indian tongues and tempers of the inner bays , the whole Vancouver Island west coast , up to the furthest Alaskan glaciers of the boldshirtedTlingits . I never could learn what tribe had first borne him , owned and probably disowned him . He was a jack of all tribes . He despised them all , he told me in great confidence , especially the sturgeon-fishing tribes . Once he had been a prisoner among the Tanu , who had taught him sturgeon fishing . He preferred the white men 's ships , where one need only sail , nor bother about hook , spear , or paddle . On one white men 's ship , when he was a little boy , he had learned perversion . He thought all the huloima practisedit . He was always shiftily around our Sandwich Islanders . When I caught the vice in his look at Perrault I would not let him near her again. 274 The bright summer weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes turned to reconnoiter in the inland passages the clouds hung in torn veins upon the tree tops to both sides of us . I saw more and more of that upflung kelp , with its brittle , fright-cracked eyeballs sliming in the white seams of the tide . It must have been a mile below our hull that the bases of the mountains met and gave us these green channels from the sea . On our portside an occasional glimpse of the ocean was still light blue . But here , in the haphazard narrowsand bays , except where the water feasted coldly on cold rock and sucked the black lips of the shore line 's rough shadow , it had grown slowly green , the intense , malachite green of an ice too deep to be truly melted , only its physical texture submissive to the sun . The gulls were dwindling . These past few days , so Kasiascall made me understand when he saw me looking after them , they had all been absconding to the rimy ledges where they mate . He stood there , obsequious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering what I saw in this last flapping of white wings , and why I was so clownishly sad at our release from the nuisance of their fouling and their noise . But , " Nah ! " I said . " Look . . . yahwa , nah ! " For it must have been one of the very last of them I saw go wheeling seaward . A little one , sunset-breasted , tilting up from our wake and going in sharp , eager arc over a peninsula of hemlocks . The same evening glow showed me Kasiascall 's flat face piebald with the faulty mixture of pigments of the evil bloods in him , and how his purplish , slanting eyelids squeezed shut when Perrault went by in her boy 's old clothes . There would be no birds with us any more excepting a 275single huge black gony . We saw it only now and then . But sometimes I thought I knew it in the formless shadows of a mountain range , and it followed us into the black night of Clayoquot Sound , where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet a little while . He had me down into his stateroom to give me a cup of Teneriffeand the benefit of his advice on how we 'd trade with the Indians from now on . He 'd show M'Kay . I sat uneasily on his little horsehair sofa , waiting for him to drink first , and for the fretful things he would find to say about our future conduct . About my coddling that boy Perrault too much , for instance . About the Indian interpreter , the only savage he 'd ever seen in his life , by God , with right nautical manners and a proper respect for a ship 's captain and no need of a cato ' - nine- tailing . About Mr. M'Kay , too , of course . He was all right , M'Kay was , but thought he knew the Indians . 1 lad tried to persuade him to keep away from the Clayoquots . He 'd show M'Kay . He 'd make him admit in front of all those jelly-bellied partners , when we got back there , that Jonathan Thorn was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards as they deserved . And ' s Mr. Astor had intended we should treat ' em in the first place , instead of mugging ' em , marrying ' em . One fair price , a knife and a blanket for every otter skin , and that was all . Handle ' em in his own sea captain 's way and he 'd have more furs from ' em in one round of ship 's bells than we 'd wheedled in two months down at Fort Astor . He 'd show M'Kay . " Knives , sir ? Blankets , yes , but might it not be better to ... " P159A bull 's roar and Adam Fisher had him around the knees and down again , Ovide 's head cracking sharply on a bunk edge as he tumbled . There was no room for real fighting here . And we were all upon them instantly , partingand haranguing them , laughing as overloudly as men always do when they have to convince themselves of the good-nature of a sudden , entirely causeless fight . The two fighters laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugely , taking stock of each other 's hurt , of how the sailor had to hold to the bunk with the bandages dangling from his wrist , and with his sore foot off the ground , and of the red worm already crawling in Ovide 's yellow hair and down his forehead . . . while the forecastle seesawed to the storm , and the two of them , this one out of exultant frenzy , that one out of goggling , blubbering slow-wittedness , joined our laughter . " Now , " I said nervously to Ovide , " there 's no substituteleft to send for that map . " He made a wry , mad face  --  and went . But , for fear of her very life , I went along . It was only a small gash in his head , but it bled generously , and he would not stanch its flow . It must always be part of his code to pay no attention to his wounds . We had to go through the cabin to reach the chart room , and he reveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his appearance as we passed the partners ' table . The M'Dougall sat looking after us with a mouth like a cannon 's . " An ' now what ? " demanded Mr. Stuart . I let Ovide go on ahead . " Nothing at all . A silly fight with a sailor . About nothing . " " Nothing ! " The M'Dougall was purple above his shawl . " Common sailors striking a  --  a passenger ! Noth-ing ! " " One sailor , " I corrected him . " And De Montigny 's a match " They were all shouting at once . I did not finish . I followedOvide hastily into the closet and closed the door . Perrault cried out , too , at the sight of him : cried out in gratefulness for his surprising visit , and then , when he stood wildly over her berth in his boisterous dishevelment , she caught her breath and gazed up at him with foolish care . Her hands came out of the heap of old ratruinedovercoats which I had found yesterday to cover her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh of his was the only explanation she got from him then . I had to tell her for him . I mumbled a fancy lot about his fighting for her sake , to wipe her name from the greasy lips of a seaman who did not even know she was a woman . I made her see the comedy of that . Her face , thinning and meanly pale for many past days , grew flushed . She smiled like a spoiled child , was immensely pleased , giggled ... . In Parma , she remembered , two fine bucks had once drawn swords over her fallen garter in the greenroom and might have come to scratches and punctures if she had not picked it up herself and shown them both the medallion of a third man , a favorite tenor , sewn into its ruffles . She reached for Ovide 's hand . He was as pleased as she . My little half lie had made a hero of him again in someone 's eyes , even if that someonewas only a weather-browned ragamuffin who could n't get enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung and sniveled at wrong moments and told tales out of slutdom . The pretty little piece could n't help it if she was sick  --  maybe he was to blame for it , himself.
