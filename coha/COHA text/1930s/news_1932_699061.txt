txt The penetration 0/ an exploring party , headed by a woman and including three other women , into untrodclen regions far up the east coast of Greenland is of timely interest in view of the Danish-Norwegian case now before the World Court . arising out o/ Norway 's official occupation of a stretch of Greenland 's east coast in July . 1931 . The following graphic account of unique experiences in the Eskimo country on the trip by one of the women members of the expedition is the fourth of a series of six specially contributed to THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE Mourrott . Not far from our ship lay a small island which looked so interesting that we decided to explore it , especially as we had heard that it was a great bird nesting place . Though it lay only about half a mile away , we were an hour in the motor-launch reaching it . the ice was so deceptive and the lanes so few . However , by dint of backing and circling and pushing and shoving with  --  the boat hooks , we finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with broken ock and rising not more than about 20 feet above the water . The surface was ' covered with a thick carpet of rather fine grass , dotted with a few wild flowers , and everywhere were birds ' eggs , for both tern and duck lay theirs in the most casual way possible on theground without any pretense of a nest . We had to walk with the greatest care . Needless to say , in this out-of-the-way place they scarcely expect people to walk on their eggs . In some instances , the eggs had hatched and we enjoyed watching the pretty fluffy little chicks of the tern covered with the softest down of light gray-brown , spotted with dark and light spots . The full-grown bird is gray and white and has two graceful tail feathers which stream out behind when it flies . On this occasion they were agitated , as they thought we were going to harm their young and they cried and swooped above our heads in a cloud . The ducks and their ducklings , with lovely red or vermilion web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us lift one off the nest  --  which we did very gently  --  with no appearance of fear . As it was growing late , and the Ice had come in thicker than before , we took to the boat with regret , wondering who would next visit . the strange lonely little ice-girt Tern Island , the habitat of thousands of soft , warm , arctic birds . Never shall I snuggle down on a stormy winter night under my Norwegian eiderdown without thinking of that far-away desolate isle of terns . Arctic Beauty Spot A walk on Imer Island was a memorable one , for not only did we see some of the most delightful bits of scenery of our whole trip but we found our wild friends so tame that we could almost touch them ; wild hare , gray geese with their goslings , ptarmigan and musk-ox in great numbers . When we left the ship , we had to climb a gently sloping shore until we stood on a grassy , foreland dotted with many flowers . We walked on and on , unconscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upland island air ; so soft and easy was the footing . We found one small lake after another and sat down to rest beside the prettiest one of all . Our presence started up a large flock of gray geese , and for us they showed off all their tricks , sometimes running along the shore so fast they made a streak of dots , sometimes skimming the sur face of the water , again diving and coming to the surface with a great splashing like a lot of small boys showing off in a swimming pool . They looked positively crestfallen when we rose and left . As we wandered back to the ship six of us gathered huckleberries in hats and handkerchiefs , but so small were they , that Upon returning to the ship , I made them into jam and had just one cunful . King of the Arctic Being Sunday , Hilda , our pretty , gentle , dark-haired Norwegian stewardess , amazed us by appearing in correct black dress and neat white apron to serve this repast instead of her usual gay sweater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To see a sleek seal sunning himself on a safe secluded beach , an imperious polar bear lope easily along over roughest ice and then slide gracefully into the water , to see quaint little auks which look as If they ought to be on the wing , strutting about like pompous little New York stockbrokers , make one feel the futility of attempting a description of these arctic creatures . If one is fortunate , polar bears appear soon after the ice barrier is reached , hunting for seals , their chief food , many miles from the mainland , where in summer I hey are seldom seen though their tracks are found imprinted in the claylike mud of Greenland beaches . Two men rowing a boat with all their strength are soon overhauled by this superbly strong creature . Polar Bjorn , as the Norwegians call him . is easily the king of the arctic animal life , with his great strength , wonderful endurance and impressive beauty . The seals are the clowns of the region , always sleek and shining and amusine . The ' Mythical ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narwhal that we eagerly awaited a sight of him and were lucky in coming on a number of them . The explorers of olden times refer to this creature as the unicorn . The strength of these muwhals , though they appear so sleek . smug and shiny , is enormous . The , : horn , or tusk is of beautiful spiraled ivory varying front three to ten feet in length . This tusk protrudes limn one side of the upper jaw and the animal is able to wield it with such force that it has been known to pierce the solid oak of a whaler s bows . But the ease and grace with which it spars makes it hard to realize the weight of its horn . The narwhals we saw came up out of the water so near our ship that we could hear the clang of one horn against the other as they played . Before we went to Greenland an artist friend said to me , " You will need lots of blue in your paint box . " His advice was good . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that white was as much needed as blue , for the marvelous mantle of protective white was everywhere ' conspicuous among birds and beasts . But of these the lovely arctic hare was purest white of all . Larger even than our bounding California jackrabbit , these hares , with their long hind legs and curious leaping action , often reminded us of a kangaroo . Under a great sheltering rock my husband came across a fine large snow-white hare fast asleep . Calling the photographer , they set to work to get a picture . The whir of the cinema awoke the sleeper , who was not in the least disturbed but simply yawned and stretched himself , then lazily got up , scratched his long pink-lified left ear with his black-toed right foot and walked off in the most composed manner . Visit to the Arctic Owl We found a nest of the magnificent white arctic owl , if nest it can be called , on the bill above Myggbuctu Bay on July 18 , with five young ones in it , lying in between the gray stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even moss . When I picked up one of the ugly , uncouth young ones for our photographer to catch , the mother showed some concern . She hovered about on the hill above us , pretending to be wounded and hobbling about with one gorgeous wing dragging . The father joined her and they both staged their little act for us , giving us a fine opportunity to see their gleaming white plumage . We returned the babies to the nest and left the two old birds sitting like white stone sentinels with their unblinking eyes fixed on us until we were out of sight . The bird that offers the greatest contrast to the powerful cruel owl is the ptarmigan . So gentle and appealing are these soft , fluffy , silver-voiced birds , that of all those we ob served . It was our fa ? orde . The air of pride with Nillich the mother ptarmigan paraded her fat , fluffy chicks was eh:tuning , the gray of the mother s plumage and war in brown of the little chicks ' fluff harmonizing perfectly with nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure white snow or ice their color fairly gleamed and many a time when our launch disturbed them I have seen a white cloud of them arise so luminous as to reflect light upon the deep blue of the fjord , as a ' white cloud will do . They are smaller than our European gull , much less raucous in their cry , and they land on their dainty gray feet in a nuch less ungainly fashion . Many a lemming falls victim to these owls and gulls . This queer molelike little creature seems strangely defenseless . We found them with their fur , soft brown like a chipmunk and their queer digging toes like a mole . The lemming has always mystified the naturalists , for every so often it becomes possessed by an urge for travel and travels in great numbers , no obstacle hindering their march and often oven hurling themselves over cliffs into the sea . The lemming was scarce in Greenland this summer for the summer before had seen one of these extraordinary mysterious migrations . In my diary of August 12 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were : Animals  --  Polar bears , musk-ox , arctic hare , lemming , seals , walrus , narwhal ( bottle - nose ) , whale ( white ) , porpoise , foxes ( in captivity ) . Birds  --  Ravens , arctic owl , gull ( gray arctic ) , tern , guillemot , little auk , eiderduck , geese , loon , divers , snow bunting , ternstones , ptarmigan , phorope ( sea geese ) , skewer .
