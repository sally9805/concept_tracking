Wrestlers Jim Browning and " Jumping Joe " Savoldi grappled , tugged , mauled each other one night last week in Los Angeles ' Olympic Auditorium . Each had scored a fall when Referee Mickey McMasters looked at the clock . It was 11:15 , the hour the California Athletic Commission had ordered all wrestling bouts to end . The referee tapped both men 's shoulders to signify a draw , sent them from the ring . <P> Instantly the auditorium was a bedlam . Booing , shouting , shoving spectators tore chairs from the floor , heaved them into the ring , pulled down draperies , ripped out telephones . The riot lasted for a full half hour , ended only when Browning and Savoldi decided to defy the curfew and return to the mat . After another half hour , Savoldi flew feet first at Browning 's chin ( the " drop-kick " ) , missed , crashed on his back . Browning fell on him , won the match . Next day the Commission formally repealed its curfew order .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
