Mix The New Masses and The New Yorker together , shake hard , Gallicize , move back a century to the time when to be Left in France was to be Republican , and you have something like La Caricature and its daily successor Le Charivari , the periodicals by which Honore Daumier earned 30 years ' living , six months in jail , and undying fame as an artist . Beginning in the second decade after the Napoleonic Wars , hardworking lithographers including Travis , Gavarni and Grandville filled these sheets with caricatures of Bonapartist reactionaries and canting bourgeois . Daumier , who worked hardest &; longest , died blind and penniless in 1879 in a house given to him by Corot . No cartoonist of Daumier 's power , few painters so well endowed or so frustrated , have lived since . Because he was a great humanitarian as well as a great draughtsman , his work , like that of Goya , has had its significance renewed in a post-War era as turbulent as his own . The largest as well as the most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open this week in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Museum of Art . <P> More than any other great 19th Century French artist , Daumier has been imitated , forged and mistreated . One aim of the Pennsylvania Museum and of Curator Henry Plumer Mcllhenny , who assembled the present show , was to admit only those Daumier items whose authenticity is 100% established . So hard did young Mr. McIlhenny plug at this task of curatorial scholarship that his exhibition is by way of being a landmark in the scientific treatment of art . On the cover of the Daumier catalogue is no lithograph or painting but an X-ray photograph . The X-ray shows a section of the wood panel on which Daumier painted La Blanchisseuse ( The Laundress ) , a celebrated work lent by the Louvre and insured for 3,000,000 francs . <P> In " Technical Notes on Daumier , " included in the catalogue , Philadelphians are given the results of a study conducted by Art Expert David Rosen and Curator of Paintings Henri Marceau , by means of X-ray and infrared photographs of twelve paintings and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings were done on wood . Messrs . Rosen and Marceau discovered that each of the X-rayed wood panels had been scratched over as if by a fine-toothed saw , producing a texture like that of woven fabric . This gave a firm grip to the ground of gesso ( whiting and glue ) on which the paintings were made . In the absence of evidence to the contrary , this appeared to be a characteristic and unique practice of Daumier.
