 | Sideshow People Condensed from The New Yorker Alva Johnston T T HE BIOGRAPHIES Of circus I ' freaks are sometimes success stories of the most inspiring kind . They tell how , for example , an obscure village idiot rose to be an internationally celebrated Pinhead ; how Billy Wells , the HardHeaded Man , started by having his friends crown him with wooden clubs , later had them break pebbles on his head with small mallets , and gradually worked upward until thousands paid to see granite blocks shattered on his skull with sledgehammers ; how James Morris , born with an unusually loose skin and once an amateur skinstretcher at Elks ' benefits and church socials , barged ahead until Ringlings billed him as their Marvelous Elastic Skin Man ; how Prince Eric Zulong formerly devoted a few minutes of his spare time every day to crunching eggshells at home and is now paid for eating electriclight bulbs on Broadway ; how Harry Bulson , a cripple , developed into the Spider Boy , Coney Island 's greatest star last season . The life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . Born with crippled legs , dreading both the cruelty and kindness of other human beings , especially children , he played by himself in the woods near Paterson , New Jersey , where his parents lived . He walked only on his hands and made his way through trees swinging from limb to limb in the manner of Tarzan . Catching birds became one of his pursuits . Steadying himself by seizing limbs between his teeth , he used his hands in setting traps in trees . The power thus developed in his arms and jaws enabled him later in life to make Ripley 's Believe-It-or-Not series twice , once for lifting a 3850-pound automobile with his teeth and once for walking a mile on his hands in q2I2 minutes . As a half-grown boy , Buison became a mental case because of his sufferings under the inspection of inquisitive eyes . Placed in an institution , he escaped by twisting the iron bars of his window . On three occasions he escaped in this manner . Twice he was caught and returned . The third time he obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once they drove to town during a carnival , and Bulson 's career as a side-  | show attraction began . As a freak among freaks he found life endurable and his professional spirit soon developed to render him insensitive to the shuddering curiosity of spectators . His talents as a contortionist and climber were in time turned to use in I Hollywood , where he doubled for Lon , on Chaney in The Hunchback of Notre Dame . In spite of biting Half-dollars in two and lifting enormous weights with his teeth , he has visited a dentist only once in his life , and then this mission was purely esthetic ; he had a gold cap placed on a sound tooth in obedience to the dictates of Dame Fashion . That was after he married a Memphis girl . Romance is incredibly busy among the sideshow people , although the marriages of freaks are not always love marriages . There will never be a shortage of mates for sideshow stars of proved earning capacity . A single lady with a three-foot beard always has more suitors than Penelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bodies , with 600-pound physiques , or with features so ugly that millions pay to see them . The Ugliest Woman in the World , as the Ringlings were able to term her with a clear conscience , married well and had t three children . Myrtle Corbin , the ' two-bodied woman from Texas , made a happy choice of a mate and had , in the legal phrase , five heirs of her bodies , two of one and three of the other . Ten years ago , Ringling 's Living Skeleton married Helen the Fat with great ceremony at Madison Square Garden , and they are still very devoted-In private life they are the Pete Robinsons . He weighs 58 pounds , and she weighs sso . It is true that in times past the marriage rite has been abused for publicity purposes . Showmen have systematically broken into the press by holding freak marriages at every tank town until all possible combinations of wedlock had been exhausted and the entire collection of startling people was polygamously entangled . But many freak romances are real romances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midgets , who was infatuated with a bearded lady . Elmer Spangler , the midget director of the Midget Village Orchestra at Chicago , shot up the Little Mexico Cafe in that city last summer because Rosalie , the Mexican fan dancer , jilted him . The suicide of the India Rubber Man as a protest against the invulnerability of the Tattooed Lady was told to the world by the Associated Press . His name was Clarence H. Alexander , and he could contract and expand like a jack-in-the-box . He is said to have been able to stretch his  | height seven inches and his reach ten inches . He used to make amorous advances , when the freaks were on the exhibition platform , by lengthening his loose-jointed arm like a patent fishing rod , passing it clear around the Fat Woman 's back and patting the Tattooed Lady on the shoulder . She took a dislike to him and after repeated snubs the India Rubber Man became morose and lost interest in his work , expanding and contracting only in the most perfunctory manner . When the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i927 , he committed suicide . It was a liaison of unusual pattern that made Rosa and Josepha Blatzek , joined-together or Siamese twins of Prague , the freak sensation of I9I0 . Before that year they had been good girls and poor attractions . Then romance entered their lives in the shape of a carpenter of Prague . One day they were removed to a hospital , where an heir was born to Josepha . A booking agent arrived at the hospital a few lengths behind the obstetrician . The gate receipts for the first exhibition amounted to more than $2000 . Later the carpenter was also exhibited to round out the act , but he had to be dismissed shortly because of the way he strutted and took all the bows . The freak-loving public became almost unbalanced over all the wild questions of science and boudoir etiquette raised by this crowded amour . The freak is usually happy in sideshow life . In his own community he is an isolated , lonely being ; in the circus he has the society of others who failed to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . After being stared at by millions , some of them begin to regard themselves as favored children of nature . There is a touch of hauteur about a typical freak in his contacts with persons of normal size and the routine number of legs , heads , and sexes . Toward one another 's peculiarities freaks often exhibit an amusing condescension . Bulson , the Spider Boy , for instance drives an automobile with special equipment . One of his close companions at Coney Island last summer was Forrest Sayman , the Armless Wonder , who also drivey a specially-built car . Bulson has come to regard legs as superfluities and arms as the essentials . Sayman , on the other hand , looks on arms as luxuries and ca n't figure out how the Spider Boy can accomplish his feats with nothing but a couple of arms . The Armless Wonder takes as a matter of course his own expertness as automobilist , but he pointed out the Spider Boy to a visitor and said , " Can you imagine it ? That guy drives !
