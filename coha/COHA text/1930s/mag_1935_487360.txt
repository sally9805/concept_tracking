RAYMOND STEWART was found dying on the floor of his farmhouse in Kemper County , Mississippi . His skull had been crushed , His shoulder was broken . Blood covered his head . He was dressed in shirt and underwear . The witness who fou nd the body said : " . . . I opened the door and noticed a form lying down on the floor , some human being . I could n't tell right at that time what it was ; of course I imagined it was Mr. Raymond . It was dark in the room , and I went .. . to get a light . I found a lantern on the mantel and lit it and brought it back and put it close to him . I first called him three or four times to see if I could rouse him , but he did n't reply . He was breathing hard and seemed to be unconscious . " Stewart expired shortly afterward without regaining consciousness . The room in which he died was used for storing cotton seed , of which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was open and spattered with blood . A bloody chisel lay on top . Stewart 's shirt appeared to be scorched in one place , and a broken lamp was found on the floor . Its wick had been pulled out and set afire from end to end . The killer apparently intended to burn the house . The murder was discovered some time after noon on March 24 , 1934 . On April 6 three illiterate Negroes ? Yank Ellington , Ed Brown , and Henry Shields  --  were sentenced by Judge J. I. Sturdivant of the Kemper County Court to be hanged for the murder . A few hours after the murder had been discovered , Yank Ellington , who worked for Stewart and lived about a mile away , walked up to the house . Finding there was nothing he could do , he sat down on a log with some other Negro boys , talked a while , and then went home . That night Cliff Dial , a deputy sheriff , called and asked Ellington to accompany him to the Stewart house . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quarry arrived , the crowd = immediately began accusing Ellington of having murdered the farmer . Ellington denied any part in or knowledge of the killing . He was thereupon snatched up by the mob and taken to a nearby tree . A noose was quickly fashioned for his neck , the rope tossed over a limb . Would he confess ? No ! He was hoisted off his feet and threatened with death if he did not confess . Lowered to the ground he again denied knowledge of the crime . The crowd yanked him aloft a second time , the noose burning a ring into the flesh of his neck . Would he confess ? No ! He was lowered again and the noose was slipped off . He was then stripped and tied to the trunk of the tree . The men in the mob took off their belts and began swinging them buckle-end first against the bare flesh of the quivering Negro . Would he confess ? " No , " he cried . The torture drew only blood . - On the witness stand Ellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home , and I just could get home . " Next day Ellington found himself once more in Deputy Sheriff Dial 's custody . This time he was taken to Meridian for what Dial described as " safekeeping . " On the way , how-ever , Dial decided that Ellington must " belch up the truth . " He stopped his car , ordered the manacled Ellington out , stripped him , and began beating him with a strap armored with Metal at the end . So vigorously did Dial apply the lash that " he did cut his body in strips . " This was the same body that only a few hours before had been belabored by the mob at the Stewart place . During this second blood-letting by the law Ellington persisted in disclaiming any knowledge of the crime , but as the metal cut deeper and deeper his courage withered until finally he cried , " Tell me what to say and I will say it . " Coached by Dial , Ellington told a story . He was thrust back into the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed . It was in the Meridian jail that Ellington discovered that his friends , Ed Brown and Henry Shields , had also been arrested and accused of the murder , the alleged motive being a plot to get money paid to Stewart on a cotton-acreage-reduction agreement , money they claimed was due at least two of them . What occurred in the Meridian jail the first night , however , is best described by Associate Justice Virgil A. Griffith of the Mississippi Supreme Court . Said Justice Griffith in a dissenting opinion on the conviction of the three : On Sunday night , April 1 , 1934 , the same deputy Dial , accompanied by a number of white men , one of whom was also an officer , and by the jailer , came to the jail , and the two last-named defendants Brown and Shields were made to strip , and they were laid over chairs , and their backs were cut to pieces with a leather strap with buckles on it , and they were likewise made by the said deputy definitely to understand that the whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only confessed but confessed in every matter of detail as demanded by those present ; and in this manner the defendants confessed the crime , and as the whippings progressed and were repeated they changed or adjusted their confession in all particulars of detail so as to conform to the demands of their torturers . When the confessions had been obtained in the exact form and content as desired by the mob , they left with the parting admonition and warning that if the defendants changed their story at any time in any respect from that last stated , the perpetrators of the outrage would administer the same or equally effective treatment . Justice Griffith went on to say : Further details of the brutal treatment to which these helpless prisoners were subjected need not be pursued . It is sufficient to say that in pertinent respects the transcript reads more like pages torn from some medieval account than a record made within the confines of a modern civilization which aspires to an enlightened constitutional government . Confessions having been obtained from the three , it was mere routine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury of Kemper County . That was on April 4 . On the afternoon of the same day the three were rushed from Meridian to DeKalb and arraigned . The court asked if they had counsel . No , of course not . Did they want counsel ? Well , they did n't think it would do much good . Thereupon the court appointed John A. Clark and L. P. Spinks , both of the DeKalb bar . ( DeKalb is the county seat and has a population of 3,946 . ) The prisoners , however , were allowed only half an hour to confer with counsel before being taken back to Meridian , some thirty miles away . The next morning they were returned at nine , the hour the trial was to start . The two lawyers immediately requested an opportunity to confer with their clients . Judge Sturdivant ordered them taken to a room in the courthouse for the conference , accompanied by guards . Deputy Cliff Dial appeared at this point and sought a seat at the conference between the defendants and their counsel , presumably feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The counsel , however , succeeded in ejecting him , whereupon he stood outside staring through the glass panel , his eyes fixed upon the three Negroes . The conference had hardly started when the court sent word that of course it did n't mean to hurry matters but it would be most convenient if counsel would terminate the conference as quickly as possible . Counsel ignored the suggestion . But the court persisted and sent the same message at intervals until the conference ended . While it lasted , Deputy Dial contributed to the confusion by first staring and then putting his ear to the keyhole , listening- to hear whether the Negroes changed the stories they had learned so painfully . His conduct moved the Negroes to whisper to their counsel that they were afraid to talk . At the conclusion of the conference the Negroes were returned to the courtroom . Counsel was then unable to obtain time to confer with witnesses and had to do this by whispered conversation as the trial went on . The court , so scrupulous in the appointment of counsel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried separately . The court also failed to suggest that the defendants were entitled to a special venire from which to draw a jury . The court did , however , appoint two additional members of the DeKalb bar to the defense ? " Honorable D. P. Davis and Honorable Joe H. Daws . " Such an array of distinguished local counsel made a most impressive appearance in the record as well as in the court . It seems , however , that three of the talented gentlemen must have been chosen more for decoration than utility , since John A. Clark , one- of the first two attorneys appointed by the court , in a sworn statement to the Supreme Court of Mississippi , said : " . . . affiant states that neither of the three men assigned with him in the trial of said cause was at all in sympathy with-the defendants , but all prejudiced the case and thought they should be convicted . " - The technique of crime detection among the Negro population in Kemper and Lauderdale counties , Mississippi , was disclosed during Cross-examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fashion indicated above . - Then the sheriff is called in to hear it . He goes through the perfunctory gestures of his office , tells the accused to disclose the truth , says the law is there to protect the accused , and so on . His hands are thus kept clean. - The dirty work is done by the deputies and the blood mopped up before the sheriff arrives . Bruises , lacerations , even necks burned by the noose are overlooked , or credited perhaps to - misadventures arising before the accused was taken under the protection of the law . Sheriff J. H. Adcock of Kemper County and Sheriff Bryce Stevens of Lauderdale County were the two principal officers of the law called in to listen to the lacerated defendants tell how they murdered the deceased . Their testimony on the stand indicated that they had heard reports that there might have been a bit of whipping , but of course they could not testify to that , it being beyond their knowledge . Sheriff Adcock , modestly revealing his kindness toward the illiterate Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the torture , to " go on and tell the truth about this thing ; no harm can come to you here . " He subsequently added , " I spoke to them separately , but I was as kind as I knew how to be . " It was not until Ed Brown took the stand that the story of the scourgings was disclosed in detail . Brown said he was called out of his cell in the Meridian jail on Sunday night by Deputy Sheriff Dial . He told ' me to come out here , that he had heard I told that I killed Mr. Raymond . I came out of the jail house and I said , " I declare I did n't kill Mr. Raymond . " He said , - " Come on in here and pull your clothes off ; I am going to get you . " I said to the last that I did n't kill him . There was two more fellows about like that there , and they was whipping me . They had me across chairs kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they said put it on him again , and they hit so hard I had to say , " Yes , sir . " Mr. Cliff said , " Give it to me , and I will get it . " He took it , and it had two buckles on the end . They stripped me naked and bent me over a chair , and I just had to say- it ; I could n't help it . Q. They whipped you hard there ? A. Yes , sir . I will show you . There are places all the way up there . Q. Did you bleed any ? A. Did I bleed ? I sure did . Henry Shields testified to virtually the same treatment . Then Yank Ellington came to the stand . Q. Where do you live ? A. On Raymond Stewart 's place . Q. Raymond Stewart or Mr. Raymond Stewart ? A. Mr. Raymond Stewart ... . Q. What did they do after they tied you ? A. They whipped me good . Q. Was that all ? A. They hung me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Q. What is the mark on your neck ? A. That 's where they pulled me up to the limb twice . Q. That was done with a rope ? A. Yes , sir . Q. Did it hurt you ? A. Yes , sir . The Honorable John C. Stennis , district attorney , sought to show that Ellington certainly could not have been afraid of kindly Sheriff Adcock , but he elicited only this reply : " Yes , sir , I am scared of all white people . " The court meanwhile had admitted into evidence the confessions . Judge Sturdivant , however , bowed to propriety to the extent of ordering the jury from the room while admission of the confessions was discussed . He then ruled they were admissible and called the jury back to hear them recited by the sheriffs and deputies . Finally the underlings of the sheriff 's office came to the stand . They admitted conduct with the defendants that even a jury might suspect would not lead to free and voluntary confessions . Deputy Dial 's testimony was most helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present when certain parties had the defendant Yank Ellington ? A. I was . Q. Tell whether or not you took up for Yank and protected him ? - A. I did . I told them that Mr. Stewart apparently a brother of the deceased had asked me to take charge of the place , and I did n't want any of the Negroes beat up , and I did n't believe this Negro was guilty , and I would rather they did n't beat him up . Q. That was Friday night ? A. Yes , sir . Q. After you intervened , what became of Yank ? A. He went home , or I suppose he did- I got them to turn him loose . This questioning was by the district attorney . Mr. Clark then took the deputy on cross-examination and asked : Q. Now , when you went up there Friday night and befriended Yank , who had charge of him then ? A. A bunch of them was there ; I expect it was twenty men . Q. Were they whipping him ? A. It first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by the houses and told the Negroes to come up there and then went down to Dan Camp 's and came back and they had Yank and Manny Brooks . Q. Did they whip them in your presence ? A. Yes , sir . Q. Did they hang him there ? A. Well , you know they did n't hang him . They pulled him up but they did n't hang him . Q. Of course , they did n't kill him . A. No , sir . Q. How many times did they pull him up ? A. I did n't see them pull him up , but one time . Q. Did they whip him any after they pulled him up ? A. Yes , sir . Q. When did you first offer your friendship to him ? A. I begged them before they started not to beat the Negroes up . Q. But they would n't listen to you ? A. No , sir . . Q. They whipped them a little anyhow ? A. Yes , sir . Q. A right smart ? A. Not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done if it was left to me . Ellington was the last of the principals to testify , and shortly thereafter the trial ended , the proceedirigs having consumed less than two days . The jury dispatched its duties most expeditiously , finding each defendant guilty . So eager was the court to dispose of the case that sentence could not be put off even to next day . In the words of Mr. Clark : ... as soon as the court could look at a calendar and arrange the date for the execution ... they were called to the bar - . . . and sentenced to be hanged , and the date set for the execution . . . . As soon as this was done , the prisoners were immediately handcuffed , taken out of the courtroom , and driven away for Meridian , the county seat of another county thirty miles away , with no - tunity to make a motion for a new trial . . . no money in the hands of anybody to pay for going down there to visit them or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning signed the minutes and adjourned ... for the term , and affiant states upon oath that such was the manner and haste in which the trial was conducted ; . . . just before the date of the execution he went at his own expense down to Meridian and had a conference with each of the defendants , and so impressed was he with their innocence that he prepared and had executed a pauper 's oath and petition for appeal , two of the other attorneys declining to have anything to do with any effort at appeal in said cause , and the-third Davis only permitted his name to be used but took no part . . . . Lucky were Ed Brown , Henry Shields , and Yank Ellington in having John A. Clark for their lawyer . The appeal for justice which he pressed before the Supreme Court of Mississippi has thus far ( late October , 1935 ) spared their lives . The Mississippi Supreme Court denied the appeal , but John A. Clark did not give up . He went again before that most august @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of error . Again the court was adamant , relying upon a technicality to spring the hangman 's trap . The court held that had objection to introduction of the so-called confessions been taken at the proper time and in good form , a new trial could perhaps have been granted . But although the substance may have been adequate , the form wa 's not . It was thumbs down . The petition for the rehearing did , however , produce an opinion which for clarity , vigor , and grace of expression has perhaps not of ten been duplicated in legal literature . It was the dissenting opinion of Associate Justice Griffith . In replying to the points made by the majority of the court as to the delicacies and refinements of procedure having been ignored , Justice-Griffith said : To my mind it would be as becoming a court to say that a lynching party had become legitimate and legal because the victim , while - being hung by the mob , did not object in the proper form of words at precisely the proper stage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of words nor any proper stage of the proceedings in any such case as the record of the so-called trial now before us disclosed ; it was never a legitimate proceeding from beginning to end  --  it was never anything but a factitious continuation of the mob which originally instituted and engaged in the admitted tortures . Justice Griffith went farther , and in going farther did honor to a profession in which such integrity of intellect seems uncommon . He said , in concluding his dissent : It may be that in a rarely occasional case which arouses the flaming indignation of a whole community , as was the case here , we shall continue yet for a long time to have outbreaks of the mob , or resorts to its methods . But if mobs and mob methods must be , it would be better that their existence and their methods shall be kept wholly separate from the courts ; that there shall be no blending of the devices of the mob and of the proceedings of the court ; that what the mob has so nearly completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption give legitimacy to any of the works of the mob , nor cover by the frills and furbelows of a pretended legal trial the body of that which in fact is the product of the mob , and then by closing the eyes to actualities , complacently adjudicate that the law of the land has been observed and preserved . As this is written , the Supreme Court of the United States has just taken jurisdiction in the case of Ed Brown , Henry Shields , and Yank Ellington vs. the State of Mississippi . Arguments are to be heard , and some time after the new year the highest court in the land may give three of the humblest petitioners in the land another opportunity to test Mississippi justice .
