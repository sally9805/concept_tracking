" A striking feature of the last year or so has been the rapidly increased circulation of broadsheets and newsletters , privately owned , which purport to give their subscribers a mixture of ' inside information ' and well-informed comment . <P> " The demand for them clearly suggests that the public are not satisfied with the news service of the regular press . <P> " They feel uneasily that newspapers are not telling them the whole truth about current events , and especially about foreign affairs . " <P> Thus the Yorkshire Post recently summed up one of the most curious phenomena of modern British journalism . A revival of the classic art of pamphleteering , London 's newsletters are mimeographed or cheaply printed , distributed by mail to subscribers at home and abroad . Beginning about six years ago , newsletters have grown in circulation and influence until as of last week they were reaching hundreds of thousands of selected readers and had created an international incident . <P> Of the dozen or so newsletters being circulated from London these are the most important : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Claude Cockburn ( pronounced koburn ) , who quit as U. S. correspondent for the London Times because he could not stomach its extreme Rightist policy . Editor Cockburn holds down a regular job with the Daily Worker ( under the name of Frank Pitcairn ) , grinds out all the final copy for The Week in one all-night session , fortified by draughts of red wine . He has 40 regular correspondents , makes frequent , trips to European storm centres , has printed some accurate inside stories of the doings of the Cliveden Set . Many times sued for libel , Editor Cockburn has yet to be brought to court . <P> Arrow , published by an anonymous group of journalists of whom the leader is grey-haired , pink-faced Fred Voigt , one of the ablest newspapermen in England and a close friend of Sir Robert Vansittart , famed Foreign Office careerist . Printed on a hand press in an Old Gloucester Street basement , Arrow comes out on Friday , helps to fill the weekend gap in British news . Its policy : ' ' England must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreting foreign news , has good sources of information , is pretty accurate . Published anonymously , the snooty Whitehall Letter insists that its subscribers be properly introduced . The Far East Survey is published fortnightly by a onetime editor of Kobe 's Japan Chronicle , A. Morgan Young , purports to give Britishers the inside dope on what goes on in China and Japan . <P> K.H. Most successful of all newsletters is grizzled , pipe-smoking Commander Stephen King-Hall 's K.H. News-Letter . A smooth speaker on the " Children 's Hour " of British Broadcasting Corp . ( he told the boys &; girls about Mrs. Simpson ) , Commander King-Hall started his news-letter to save himself the cost of answering his fan letters individually . Circulation of K.H. News-Letter has grown to 54,000 in three years , continues to grow at the rate of 500 a week . Commander King-Hall 's chief source of information is the Foreign Office , where he goes three times a week .
