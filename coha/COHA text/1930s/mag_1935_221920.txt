A brisk grey-haired zealot is Joseph Lewis , 46 , onetime shirtmaker who calls himself " The Enemy of God . " As president of the Freethinkers of America , Inc. ( 30,000 members at $1 a year ) , Mr. Lewis does a thriving business in anti-religious books and sex manuals , busies himself at all times waging guerrilla warfare against the churches of his Enemy . Legalistically Freethinker Lewis hardly ever wins a battle . In the New York courts where he does most of his fighting , the judges are likely to be good Roman Catholics or devout Jews . Last week the Enemy of God was again trying to have the law on his adversary , unsuccessfully as ever . <P> Pending in the New York Supreme Court is a suit brought by Joseph Lewis to enjoin the Municipal Board of Education , on constitutional grounds , from using the Bible in schools . Dismissed by Justice William T. Collins last week was an application by Freethinker Lewis to have the Board 's defense answers stricken out . In a 14-page opinion Justice Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is astute and zealous in seeing to it that all religious beliefs and disbeliefs be given unfettered expression . Authentic freethinking involves the indubitable right to believe in God , as well as the unfettered license not to believe or to disbelieve in a deity . . . . Undisguised , the plaintiff 's attack is on a belief and trust in God . Such belief and trust , however , regardless of one 's own belief , have received recognition in State and judicial documents from the earliest days of our Republic . . . . ' In God We Trust ' has become an American aphorism stamped on our coins . " <P> Few days later Freethinker Lewis was again in court , this time to file a brief in an appeal from dismissal of a suit his organization had brought against Manhattan 's rich old Trinity Church . Mr. Lewis charged that St. Paul 's Chapel , a satellite of Trinity was selling 10 postcards bearing what purported to be a prayer written by George Washington . The prayer , declared the Enemy of God , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter Washington wrote to the Governors of all the States upon disbanding the Army in 1783 . Freethinkers ' Trinity Church according to the Freethinkers ' Counsel Joseph Wheless , had altered phrases as follows : <P> Letter : I now make it my earnest prayer that God would have you and the State in his holy protection ... <P> I have the honor to be , with much esteem and respect sir , Your Excellancy 's most obediant and humble servant , GEORGE WASHINGTON . <P> Prayer : ALMIGHTY GOD , we make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy holy protection ... <P> Grant our supplications , we beseech Thee , through Jesus Christ , our Lord . Amen . <P> The Freethinkers ' suit was brought to restrain St. Paul 's Chapel from selling any more cards , to recover , on the ground of fraud , 20 paid for two such cards , to assess Trinity Corporation $5,000 punitive damages . Also the Freethinkers sought to have a tablet marking a pew that Washington used removed from the church . Trinity 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no fraudulent intent since the postcards gave the source of the true text-W . C. Ford 's Writings of George Washington .
