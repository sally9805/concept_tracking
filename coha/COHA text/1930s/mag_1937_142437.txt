First publisher to take advantage of the price-fixing provisions of New York State 's Fair Trade Act since it was declared constitutional in a judicial flip-flop last month ( TIME , March 22 ) was Macmillan Co. , which last week fixed the price of Novelist Margaret Mitchell 's gusty Gone With The Wind at $3 . Reason : the book which has sold at the rate of 3 , copies per minute since it was published last June has been a favorite object of price wars between Manhattan department stores. * Swept back to Macmillan next day like autumn leaves were 35,940 copies of Gone With The Wind , returned by R. H. Macy &; Co. under terms also stated in the fair trade law . To mammoth , price-cutting Macy 's , which has fought the law from the start and is out to publicize its opposition , there was little market left for Gone at $3 . Macy 's had sold the book as low as 87 . <P> Had Macmillan refused to buy back the books at the purchase price ( about $1.50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold them at any price . Big as the return shipment was , enough copies of the 1 , 037-page book were kept to fill odd orders . Macy 's total sales of the book since last June : 170,000 . Sales at $3 the first two days after the price was fixed : ten . <P> <P> *Total sales to date : 1,300,000 . Hervey Allen 's Anthony Adverse has sold more than 1,000,000 copies since it appeared in June 1933.
