Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing Co. last week announced that it had constructed , and would exhibit at the New York World 's Fair , a new electromechanical man . His name : Elektro . In either profile or full-face he looks not unlike Actor John Barrymore , and with a total of 26 tricks in his repertoire , he is probably the most talented robot ever built . <P> Elektro is seven feet tall , weighs 260 Ibs. , is clad in gleaming aluminum . He is operated by 48 electrical relays ( circuits actuated by current variations in other circuits ) which control his eleven motors by remote control . He can walk forward or backward , with a peculiar limp ( only one leg bends at the knee and both huge feet are equipped with rollers ) . He can salute with either hand . He can count up to ten on his fingers , bending each finger individually . By means of photoelectric cells equipped with color filters , he can tell red from green . He can talk and sing ( by voice recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a cigaret placed in his mouth , and exhale through his nostrils . <P> Best of all , Elektro obeys orders . He converts the sound vibrations of prearranged commands into electrical impulses , as a telephone does , and these impulses set him in motion . He is quite indifferent , however , to what words are used ; the number and spacing of the syllables are what he pays attention to . <P> If vocal impulses in the wording of a command are not delivered just right , Elektro may apparently disobey . In Pittsburgh last week the robot made nice publicity for himself by disobeying his master . His designer , Engineer J. M. Barnett , practicing signals for reporters , ordered him to raise one arm . Instead he started walking backward , kept on walking backward even when commanded to stop by the engineer , who grew a little excited-and still less careful of his phrasing . Elektro might have backed through a wall had not Robotmaster Barnett shut off his supply of electric power .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
