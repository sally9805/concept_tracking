txt A kind of pacific mania seems to be descending upon the whole earth . Prophecies of the " inevitable " war are giving way to predictions of peaceful settlement . Wherever an international controversy shows itself , with a tacit threat of hostilities  --  except for the continuous performance going on in the Chaco  --  the universal expectation is that diplomacy will be sufficient to cope with it . Just now we learn that Russia and Japan have agreed upon the price to be paid by Manchukuo for the Chinese Eastern Railway . A little while ago that was to have been a sure origin of war . It is but one of many incidents showing the fatal drift into a spirit of all-embracing peace . Italy and France , which were to have been leaping at each other 's throats , have signed a treaty covering all the differences between them . The French Foreign Minister announces his firm purpose to establish lasting peace with Berlin . Not to remain outside this new world-atmosphere , the United States Government has just expressed regret to Canada for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Canadian ship . Apologies instead of ultimatums ! Can such things be ? The worst of it is that rulers today proceed as if such a peaceful attitude and peaceful settlements were the natural order of good government . They appear to regard preservation of good relations with other countries , the maintenance of foreign commerce , the exchange of ideas and inventions as well as goods , as if they were really more important than flag-waving and bristling excitements . The Continental taunt used to be that England had become a nation only of shopkeepers . All countries now not only merit the epithet but delight in it . They want to find customers for their products , and are willing to concede points of honor , if they can arrange to set bills of exchange flowing in their favor . There is less haughty talk of national independence and indefeasible sovereignty than there is of surpluses to sell and of fine opportunities in commerce across the seas . Munitions of war are left more and more to take care of themselves in foreign trade , and the screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals of commercial agents with great bargains to propose . Worse still , people everywhere seem to like these new international procedures , both in spirit and in result . They prefer good business , however tame , to a bad war , however acclaimed . They hope to be able to make plans for the future on the basis of a settled and secure peace . When diplomats report a successful negotiation , they are applauded much as if they returned with a carload of captured battle flags . The question for worried patriots is how long this can be kept up without impairing the national virility and pride . If we are not going to be ready to shoot at the drop of t a hat , who will guarantee our national safety ? It would seem that peace also hath her horrors , and that the world is now bent on supping full on them . Yet the closest and most impartial observers report that it is doing well on this unaccustomed diet !               @ @ @ @ @ @
