Since last summer the biggest unofficial fact in publishing has been that William Randolph Hearst-nearing 75 and acutely " conscious of the uncertainties of life " - is liquidating those parts of his $220,000,000 holdings which make no profit . Junking of three big dailies was strong evidence of the trend . Lease of two more was confirmation . So was consolidation of the two Hearst news services ( Universal and International News ) , the recent disposal of the unprofitable Hearst radio station KEHE , Los Angeles , and the announcement that some $15,000,000 worth of art objects were for sale . This week Mr. Hearst 's plan of liquidation was official fact . <P> In July he decided to put into a voting trust his 95% stock control of American Newspapers , Inc. , top holding company in the bewildering Hearst corporative pyramid . In September Lawyer Clarence John Shearn was given full and irrevocable power to vote Mr. Hearst 's stock for ten years . Mr. Hearst retained only his right to earnings and editorial control over 19 Hearst daily newspapers and twelve magazines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering responsibilities of revamping his empire is one of his oldest but least publicized advisers . Clarence Shearn intended to be a newspaperman , but one of the first stories he wrote as a New York Times reporter resulted in a libel suit . Assigned to help frame the defense , Reporter Shearn soon took the law for a livelihood . In the early 90s he became Mr. Hearst 's attorney and legal crusader against coal and food combines , has since drawn up most of Mr. and Mrs. Hearst 's most intimate documents . In New York Mr. Shearn was defeated as a Democratic Hearst candidate for district attorney and later Governor , but finally won a seat on the State supreme court . In 1919 he left the bench for the bar , took along with him a pinched , judicial expression . <P> When Mr. Hearst named him trustee last summer , Mr. Shearn called in the eminently respectable Manhattan law firm of Milbank , Tweed , Hope &; Webb , finally accepted its advice to scotch wild rumors by making the trusteeship known publicly .

Huberth , real-estate adviser ; F. E. Hagelberg , general auditor ; W. R. Hearst Jr . <P> Said Mr. White for that committee this week : " A policy of gradual liquidation as to some of the collateral and unrelated investments will be followed . " Mr. Hearst has not always conducted his business as his bankers would have preferred . Once he had bought a paper , it was a matter of pride to keep it going as a unit in his one-man show . That policy Mr. Hearst dropped last July when he killed the New York American , explaining : " The newspapers that are favorites with me are the newspapers that are favorites with the public . " Henceforth it is evident that the Hearst empire is to be run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
