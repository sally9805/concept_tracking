THE TREE OF LIBERTY-Elizabeth Page - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3 ) . <P> It is practically impossible for anyone who has hit the jackpot of a slot machine to keep from trying it again . The Manhattan publishing firm of Farrar &; Rinehart hit the public jackpot hard with the first of the 1,000-page historickal-romantickal novels , Anthony Adverse . After five years of wistful abstinence ( particularly trying because meanwhile Macmillan hit an even bigger pot with Gone <P> With the Wind ) , Farrar &; Rinehart pulled the lever again last week with another whopper , The Tree of Liberty ( 985 pages to 1,224 for Anthony Adverse ) . The book and the law of averages being what they are , no jackpot is likely to shower down . The Tree of Liberty , Elizabeth Page 's first novel , took five years to write , will not take so long to read . Its breeziness is astounding , in view of the hot and heavy research the author did for it ( 32 huge collections of national , state , private records and letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , travel books , reference books ) . Its setting is Virginia from 1754 to 1806 , easily the most fact-packed era in U. S. history . Miss Page , who once wanted to be a history professor , gets all the facts in-Indian trouble , tax trouble , Patrick Henry 's rebel-rousing , the Declaration , Trenton , Saratoga , Lafayette off Rhode Island , the Constitution and how it grew , the rise of the Republicans ( later called Democrats ) , everything from A to the XYZ affair-but so sweetly does she coat her historical pill that it might well be prescribed for students who are sick of textbooks .
