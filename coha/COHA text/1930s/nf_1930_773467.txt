When the credit investigation has been completed and the account accepted , all copies of the salescheck are authorized , the original is attached to the ledger card , and customer 's payment record book and the duplicate and triplicates are returned to the selling department . The merchandise is selected and forwarded with these copies to the delivery department . ( If the account is rejected , a refund of the deposit is made and the account is closed . ) The original salescheck , the ledger card , and the payment record are now sent to the machine operator for simultaneous posting of the total of the sale and the amount of cash paid as down payment . The customer 's passbook is mailed to her , and the ledger card is punched in the control date space and filed according to date ' classification . When subsequent payments are made , the customer presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a unit posting is made on both records . Under this plan just outlined , subsequent purchases may be added to the account on the issuance of saleschecks to cover the transactions , the face copies of the checks being the authority required by the machine control clerk for posting the debits to their proper places . Under the first plan described , the records of the original sale can not be disturbed ; new sales or exchanges are treated as separate transactions . I // RECEIVING , CHECKING , AND MARKING OPERATIONS ? THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT Much Negligence Before Merchandise Is Received. ? In the final analysis the measure of a sto efficiency is the attainment of satisfactory net profits . That goal can not be denied ; no explanations can change a red to a black figure . The discouraging thing is that so often the responsibility for a poor department or store showing can not be accurately allocated . The contributory elements may be found in the executive offices and in the submerged delivery section , in the decisions of the administrative council and the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit percentage becomes smaller at the very moment the merchandise is brought to the receiving platform ? even before that time . Poorly organized receiving methods , inaccurate merchandise checking , improper marking , delayed transportation of merchandise to the stockrooms and selling departments , ineffective control of . invoices ? these and other deficiencies in the routing of invoice and merchandise to their proper places give encouragement to the profit parasites in their everlasting quest for food . Much negligence occurs before the merchandise is even received . The placing of the order is more than mere routine ; it is the registering of a legal paper used as the basis for later checking and comparison . The wide-awake buyer knows that in his records rest potential profits or possible losses ? not losses resulting from poor merchandise selections alone , but from economies not taken advantage of . Whether the store has a traffic department or operates without the benefits of 301 // this money-saving agency , it is the buyer 's responsibility to secure for the shipment the best packing specifications and the most advantageous shipping plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he can purchase merchandise that will suit the needs of his department 's clientele ; he must not fail to recognize , however , that it is his further responsibility to keep to the minimum the cost of bringing the merchandise to the store . And shipping and packing directions must be written into the order in clear , understandable language . He must know that every economy not obtained is so much additional handicap gratuitously given to his competitor . Insufficient Care in Writing Order. ? The typical buyer does not exercise sufficient care in the writing of the order . This order , it need hardly be said , is not a memo record ; it is an important permanent store paper . If it is to be intelligently followed up , it must be right in the first place . An examination of the orders on file in most stores will disclose a disturbing situation . Many buyers have failed to place on the order all the facts that belong there , and minor clerks are expected to use mature judgment in interpolating either what is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguous . Often the order does not give the shipping or packing instructions , terms , and delivery dates , or it does not state specifically the color , size , etc. , of the items purchased , or the handwriting is illegible . It is the acme of inconsistency for the store management to insist on legibility and accuracy in the preparation of the salescheck by the lowly salesperson and to take no cognizance of illegibility , inaccuracy , and failure to record wanted data on the buyer 's order ? a dereliction that is far more costly in effect and indefensible . The investment involved in the average order is 6o to 70 times the value of the average salescheck ; yet the training department has no jurisdiction in the matter , and the merchandise manager is either too busy to give t // it his personal attention , or too shortsighted to appreciate the cumulative harm being wrought . Consider for a moment the ill effects of carelessness in the designation on the order form of just one quality of merchandise ? color . Merchandising authorities are agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the buyer , that a poor color selection is automatically a poor seller . It will not do to write " beige " or " blue " ; the designation must be rose beige , or yellow beige , or neutral beige , or pale blue , or blue green , or green blue , or violet blue . In style merchandise , and to a lesser degree in staples , color or color combination is the one feature in which the customer insists upon her exact specifications . Yet the buyer will frequently give the generic term but not the specific term . In the better stores , the merchandise checking division uses a color chart to guide it in making comparison of merchandise with the written record of the purchase . But of what avail is this chart when the record does not specify exactly the color ? It is hardly fair to condemn the merchandise checker for inefficiency when the buyer himself does not know the difference between one shade of color and another , or knowing it , does not take the trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accuracy with regard to other elements of the purchase ? quantity , size , price per unit , discount terms , freight terms , time of delivery , manner of shipping ? should be carefully recorded if proper merchandise checking is to be encouraged . Work of the Traffic Department ? As suggested in a previous paragraph , the buyer is not left on his own resources in the determination of shipping instructions , including the manner of packing and the plan for routing the merchandise from the vendor 's place of business to the store door . The better stores have organized a traffic department to advise the buyer on all problems concerned with transporting goods from // the point of origin to the point of destination . The functions of the traffic departments differ in the different stores . Some organizations give them only advisory powers and authority to audit freight bills , while others place under their jurisdiction the determination of shipping routes , the signing of contracts for steamship space , trucking and cartage services and warehouse requirements , and the control of container materials and crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of the traffic department in the rectification of incorrect freight bills , in the recovery of loss and damage claims , in rate classification adjustments , etc . The traffic department of one large western store saved its organization $65,800 in 1928 . Another company submits this partial record for the 1928 accomplishments of its traffic department : corrected freight bills ( 229 ) at a saving of $1349.65 ; collected on loss and damage claims ( 465 ) for an amount equal to $6,803.95 ; consolidated deliveries on 5,625 packages for two affiliated stores at a saving of $1,947 ; rerouted L.C.L. furniture shipments originating in the Middle West at a saving of $1,136.95 ; secured a change in the freight classification and rate on novelty waste paper baskets which were rated originally 1y2 to 3 times first class , depending on the railroad inspector 's report and were reduced to straight first class when not " nested " and to second class when nested . The saving was 6o cents to $1.30 per hundredweight ; prepared data for intervention in a furniture shipping investigation and effected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department stores have gone all the way to placing the traffic manager in charge of all transportation operations ( delivery as well as receiving and marking ) , the larger number have limited his powers to the transportation of incoming merchandise . An article in the Traffic World has defined the duties of the traffic manager as follows : 1 // " The traffic manager of a department store is called on to handle the usual duties connected with inbound goods . It may be useful to list the more outstanding of these : the quotation of parcel post , express , and freight rates ; the auditing of transportation bills ; the preparation , filing , and collection of overcharge and loss and damage claims ; the obtaining of adequate and complete transportation service ; the routing of shipments ; the obtaining of new rules , rates , and ratings and the readjustment of existing classification and tariff matters ; the protection of the relative position of the house with reference to its competitors by maintaining non-discriminatory and not prejudicial charges and services ; the preparation of packing instructions based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containers for original movements and consideration as to their use to avoid repacking and wrapping when sold and delivered ; the elimination of pilferage , concealed damages , and the expense incident to unnecessary claims ; the use of transit insurance policies , released valuations , and released rates ; the tracing and expediting of shipments and the study of ways to avoid the complaints of customers due to delayed deliveries ; the elimination of freight congestion ; the receiving of merchandise by the store ; the adoption of various methods by which to cooperate with the various departments of the store and to keep store executives informed concerning current conditions and charges affecting inbound and outbound shipments . " All Movements of Merchandise under Control. ? From the time the merchandise reaches the store to the time the check is sent to the vendor , every step of the way must be controlled with thoroughness if economies are to be gained and shortages kept to the minimum . Transporting merchandise from the receiving platform to the checking section is not just a physical movement ; it is an important operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance as an agency for // keeping losses low . To suggest one or two cautions : Does the man at the receiving door organize his work so that incoming merchandise passes completely under his control when he signs the receipt , or is he so disorganized and hurried that he accepts without question the statement of the number of packages and other details of the shipment given verbally by the delivery boy or the driver ? Does he sign for packages first and make his entry later ? Men who know present practice in many stores will agree that it is vital that before the receipt is given the receiving door clerk must be sure he has the merchandise signed for . Nor can the handling of the packages , speed or no speed , be allowed to add to the breakage bill or to the damage bill , both factors of cost higher than they should be in too many stores . Assuming the package has been received properly , does it travel quickly to its next destination ? Is there a systematic plan of relaying it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages in a congested mass from which it may be extricated only with great difficulty when the exasperated buyer clamors for the goods he needs to serve his trade ? Then with regard to the movement within the receiving room : is it well-planned or " catch-as-catch-can " ? Is the work of the merchandise checkers organized so that priority may be given to the packages first received ? Have the checkers received instruction in the best checking methods for the various articles that come to their respective sections ? Is the merchandise counted and checked from merchandise to invoice rather than checked from the invoice to the merchandise ? Do the checkers study invoices not covered by shipments and shipments not covered by invoices , so that the proper authorities may be notified and action expedited ? Has the checker been trained to report to his superior officer cases of overages and shortages and damages ? The form in Figure 74 , suggested for use by the Traffic Division of the National Retail Dry t // Goods Association , indicates the care with which such a record should be prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department under examination . Stores have registered progress in the matter of standardization of price tickets and in the establishment of a rigid system of ticket control , but that there is more work to be done will not be questioned . When to use the pin ticket , the string ticket , the folding pin ticket , the hook tag , the label , the ink stamp , the crayon ? these apparently minor matters , are in actuality of great importance in the economical operation of the marking department . What facilities has the department for re-marking merchandise ? What control of price tickets distributed to the various markers ? Is the organization sufficiently flexible to make possible an even distribution of work ? Has the department a plan for measuring production and for giving extra remuneration to markers who pass their quotas ? Portable vs . Stationary Table System . Getting the merchandise from the checker to the marker is not the simple thing it appears on paper . It is so easy in a slip-shod plan to confuse shipments , to misplace parts of shipments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should characterize operations in the marking section . The checker should assort the merchandise to avoid confusion and to cut to the minimum the work of the marker . Of course , the physical layout of the receiving and marking room is a factor that must be reckoned with when distribution and organization of work is being considered . Whether the stationary table system or the portable table system be used ( see layouts charted in Figure 75 ) , the important thing is that the layout be arranged to facilitate as much as possible the free and rapid passage of the merchandise to the reserve stockrooms or the selling floor . One hardly need mention that the best-equipped room , the most intelligently planned department , will not produce the // desired results unless all of the operatives have been effectively trained in the routine of their daily tasks . No attempt has been made in this chapter to detail the procedure in routing the invoice through the various channels beginning with its receipt on the receiving platform and ending with the preparation of the vendor 's check in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be described in Chapter 26. // Buyer 's Order on File. ? The essential principle of checking is that the buyer 's order be on file before the merchandise is received . There can be no order checking without both invoice and order . Yet it is not unusual in many establishments for the order-checking clerks of the invoice department to " chase up " the buyers for orders that should have been filed days before . The vendor 's bill has been received ; the merchandise covering the bill has been received ; but the order has not been placed in the files ; it is probably " in the buyer 's head " or in the little notebook " somewhere in my desk . " In Chapter 5 , a method was given for registering and controlling buyers ' orders that automatically places the responsibility where it belongs . But the most rigid control system will not of itself rectify this condition ; what is needed is the inculcation in the buyer 's mind of a sense of responsibility , of a recognition that his failure to register this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both vendor and store . An occasional offense may be condoned , but the habitual occurrence can not be defended or excused . Failure to file orders is a serious infraction of a fundamental store rule and must not be tolerated . With the order in her files and the corresponding bill on her desk , the order checker is able to proceed with her job . But mechanical , listless checking will be as injurious to the store 's well-being as mechanical and unintelligent merchandise checking . If she will check by unit , as she should , she will recognize in the course of time that vendor X , Y , or Z , may not be giving the house a square deal ? that he does not ship all the merchandise ordered , but only the least desirable portions ; that he makes a habit of omitting to send in the specials , and of substituting the poor numbers in subsequent deliveries . The majority of firms with which the average department store deals ? certainly those houses that place a premium upon their reputation ? will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable number of firms do . The alert order312 CONTROL OF RETAIL STORE OPERATIONS checker will help to separate the ethical from the unethical vendor , and will thus protect the buyer concerned and the whole store . Such work comes under the heading of constructive achievement . The major propositions having been stated , the corollaries may now be given . The receiving room is not the place for selling goods . Merchandise will be received only at authorized receiving points . All merchandise must be checked and marked before being transported to the selling floors . The buyer is not authorized to mark merchandise . Re-marking is a function of the checking and marking division . The buyer with the loud voice will have no more influence in the receiving , checking , and marking rooms than the buyer with a soft , well-modulated voice . Receiving , Checking , and Marking a Control Function. ? One of the controversial issues retailing abounds in is : is receiving , checking , and marking a store manager or controller function ? In a study made recently of the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that 36% of the stores placed the department under the authority of the controller , 29% under the merchandising division , 25% under the store manager , and 1o% under the supervision of other executives or superintendent . The tendency today is in the direction of controller direction , as it should be . The controller protects the store investment ; he is charged with the responsibility of maintaining a financial balance ; he is the watchdog of the treasury . And in no other place of the store is it easier to waste money , to pile up shortages , than in receiving , checking , and marking the sections of the establishment . The controller pays the vendors ' bills . If he is held to strict accountability for payment only for merchandise received and for collection on overcharges and for correction of arithmetical errors in the vendors ' statements , he must be given the authority to determine the plan of operation and to regulate // the general administration of the department . The receiving , checking , and marking sections , efficiently administered , protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . That being true , the controller should be vested with the responsibility of running them . // THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DEPARTMENT Approval of Purchase Orders. ? It is the common practice in retailing operations to have all purchase orders bear the approval of the respective divisional merchandise managers . If the merchandise manager 's approval be more than a perfunctory act , the order must contain all the information that will permit an intelligent examination to be made . The figures that may be considered indispensable are those that relate to the cost and selling prices on all the items appearing on the order form ; only by a comparison of these sets of figures is the merchandise manager able intelligently to gauge each purchase and to know that the markup is within the range generally procurable for that department . It is recognized that good merchandising permits a certain amount of purchases above or below the limits of this range of markup percentages . In such instances the situation requires more careful appraisal . Relationship between Cost and Retail Figures. ? The essence of competent buying is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices on the merchandise bought and that the retail prices be those the store 's clientele has been educated to pay . That being so , the buyer can make his purchases with definite knowledge of the prices at which his merchandise will be offered for sale to the public , and should not as a general thing be confronted with a price change condition before the merchandise is placed on the selling floors . The price that appears on the order should be the price at which the merchandise should be retailed . Revisions of price on the items appearing on the order 314 // during the period from the time it is placed with the vendor until it is ready for selling do sometimes become necessary , but in well-organized stores these occurrences are extremely infrequent . These reasons suggest themselves : an unexpected change of consumer demand for the particular commodity ; an all-store sale program ; competition by stores in the trading territory ; the merchandise appearing somewhat more or less attractive on examination by the buyer than it did when it was shown by the seller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be evaded in this dynamic competitive day . The important point of the discussion is not that such price change be disallowed , but that it be effected in an honest fashion , with the authority of the merchandise manager and through the use of a " change-of-price " form initiated and recorded in a definitely prescribed manner . Only in that way can price manipulation be averted and the integrity of the merchandising process be maintained . The approval of the order is meaningless unless price changes or other important changes are submitted to and approved by the merchandise manager . Who Shall Place the Retail on the Invoice ? ? Another debatable issue may be discovered in choosing the time for issuing price tickets and in selecting the authorizing agent for the issuance of these tickets . Traditional practice requires that tickets may not be prepared until the buyer has examined the merchandise and placed the retail prices alongside their proper places on the invoice . But experience has proved that practice to be a waste of effort and a deterrent to the quick routing of both invoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a convincing argument against the new practice that is fast being accepted in the more important stores ? that which places the authority for recording the retail on the invoice and for requisitioning price tickets , in the hands of the order checkers in the invoice control office . Such action // speeds the routing of the shipment and gives the buyer additional time for the more important , more constructive work of the administration of his department . With retail prices on the order fixed and definite , transcription to the invoice becomes a routine function which can be performed with safety by a trained clerical operative . The high-priced executive can devote his energies to more productive ends . It was stated previously that all orders must receive the confirmation of the merchandise managers . The buyers know this house ruling , of course , but the vendors should know it , too . They should be trained and are being trained in more and more stores to look for this approval as authority for shipping the merchandise . Purchase orders are generally prepared in quadruplicate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buyer 's personal reference , and the third copy becomes the record of the unit control section . The other two copies are relayed to the merchandise manager supervising the particular department 's activities for examination , comparison , and approval . The approval given , they are sent on to the invoice control office , where a record is made on the form described in Chapter 5 . From this center they are routed to the open-to-buy clerk for comparison with the budget limits and also with the vendors ' term file . When these checks have been made and the necessary notations have been recorded , the two copies are sent along their separate paths ? the second copy to the open-order file clerk for filing **29;30;TOOLONG , and the face copy to the traffic department for the examination and approval of the routing instructions . Where a change of the routing instructions becomes necessary , notice of the correction is sent to the buyer and the invoice office so the order is not " held up " in its further travels . When all these agents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face copy is sent to the correspondence department and thence is mailed to the vendor . // Merchandise to be Received only at Authorized Centers . ? Before outlining the receipt and routing of the shipment , it is desirable to consider a number of fundamental principles that pertain to the actual receiving . The larger stores receive incoming merchandise at two or more central points , depending on the number of warehouses they operate . In such circumstances , the order should state specifically at which receiving point the delivery is to be made ? store , warehouse No . I , warehouse No. 2 , etc . It is unfair to the vendor and uneconomical for the store to encourage aimless cruising to and from the various centers of receiving in the hope that the right place will be found eventually . Loss of time , late shipments , explanations , the fraying of nerves , all conduce to waste ? and for no conceivably good reason . The place of destination of every package and every bulk item should be known before the driver is on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations and at these stations only . No matter how small the package , no matter how quickly the buyer wants it , it can come into the house only when record is made at the receiving door in the regularly prescribed way . A messenger with a package for the buyer has no business making a personal delivery on the selling floor ; vendor and buyer are at fault and should be held strictly accountable . Only when the merchandise is brought to the platform and the receiving record is prepared may the vendor 's bill be signed . With this signature given by the store 's representative , the vendor is absolved from all responsibility for the future existence of the package or packages . The merchandise is now store property and possible losses must be borne by the store ; loss of package can not be charged to the sender . It is , therefore , incumbent upon the receiving room manager so to organize the work on the platform as to have the shipments received under the constant surveillance of his men . When signed for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deadline " that separates " inside territory " from // that traversed by the messengers and outside delivery workers and other persons not belonging to the store 's official family . The merchandise has been ordered ; the vendor has received the necessary confirmation and the goods are sent to the store 's receiving station . With very rare exceptions , the shipment will be accompanied by its invoice . If , in an unusual case , the invoice does not accompany the shipment , the two invoice control copies of the receiving form described in the succeeding paragraph are sent to the invoice office and the invoices received by mail are examined for the missing record ; if unlocated , the office communicates with the vendor and asks for a quick mailing of the needed record . On its receipt , comparison is made with the receiving form and the routing of the papers and the merchandise proceeds according to routine . The Door-Book Record. ? The recording form is in five copies and is generally prepared on an automatic registering machine . ( See Figure 76 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent record of the transaction . The first and fourth copies and the corresponding invoice are sent to the invoice control office ; here both copies are date stamped , copy four remains on file as a follow-up medium against invoices delivered to the receiving room , and copy one , with its invoice pinned or otherwise attached , travels to the order-checking section . The second copy is held in the receiving office until there is a fair accumulation of other second copies and the batch is then sent to the accounts payable department ; here they are assorted by department ; department totals are found ; they are added to the totals on the running control file and the amount of the bills in flux is determined . The third copy passes to the unpacking division of the receiving room and becomes the identifying record of the shipment . The face copy of the form , it will be remembered , is in the orderchecking section ; it is pasted to the invoice to which it belongs and thus becomes its " apron " through all its peregrinations // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its corresponding order , errors are noted and brought to the attention of the supervising officials , and it is relayed to the receiving room , where it is entered in the receiving room control , compared with copy three , and placed on the merchandise checker 's locked file . The checker opens the package or bundle or whatever the container may be , checks the contents , against the invoice and passes the paper to the price ticket section , where price tags are prepared for the exact quantities recorded on the vendor 's bill . Price tickets are placed in an envelope bearing the receiving number , and are sent to the marking section for distribution to the divisional markers . The buyer examines the merchandise for quality , makes price amendments wherever necessary and notes the condition of the shipment for reference // in his future dealings with the manufacturer . The merchandise is then ready for release to the stockroom or selling floor . The invoice is returned to the invoice control section , compared with copy four of the form and dispatched to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiving room for more than three days for which no invoice has been received , but for which there is a confirmation of order in the files , is checked , retailed , marked , and sent to the selling floor . The invoice checking section maintains a control on all such " dummy " invoices and closes these dummies when the invoices arrive from the vendors . Freight and Express Charges . Before proceeding with the work of the retail section and the accounts payable department , it is pertinent to consider the handling of merchandise which carries freight and express charges . If the charges are prepaid when the carrier presents the package , the door receiving record described is the only entry of the transaction . If there are carrying charges on the shipment , a prepaid freight and express form is prepared in triplicate . This record has provision for two columns ; the first where charges accumulate weekly or monthly , and the second where payment is to be made in cash immediately . Consider the first situation . Here either a copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its invoice at the end of the period , or the copy is forwarded to the accounts payable department and filed by company in a freight and express due file . If the forms are attached to the bill when received , the records are balanced and a check is drawn for the amount ; if the forms are not attached , the invoice is taken to the accounts payable department , the filed slips are drawn and balanced to the bill , and a check is written . When the charges are to be paid for immediately and in cash , the doorman operates a small money bank on the " impress // system . " As the vouchers are made out , the face copy is placed in the drawer and the money is paid the carrier company . These amounts are totaled for the day and are passed to the main cashier for reimbursement . Prepaid freight is charged for the total . The vendor 's order is then examined and notation is made on the form of the firm required to pay the bill ? whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then travels to the accounts payable department where it meets the triplicate copy which is transmitted daily and filed numerically . If the vendor pays , the form is treated as a journal entry with a charge against accounts payable control spread to vendor account and a credit for prepaid freight and express . If the store pays , the entry charges merchandise , and credits prepaid freight and express . The amounts are charged to the individual departments concerned . Work of the Retail Section. ? Reverting to the work of the retail section , the first operation is the assortment of the invoices in alphabetical arrangement . They are checked to a term file . Following that checking process the invoices are relayed to a group of comptometer operators , who verify the costs and figure the cash discounts and total retail ; then to a second group of operators , who check the cash discounts and the total retail , and figure the markups and the markup percentages . The greatest care must be taken in this work , and it is especially important to use the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? each at so much per dozen or so much per piece or so much per pound . If errors in extension are found upon checking the cost figures , it is the function of the comptometer operator to make out a claim for an overcharge and a recredit for an undercharge . These claim and recredit forms carry the signature of the head of the retail section . The invoices are next assorted departmentally . They are // then listed on a double-cylinder machine for cost and retail , with sub-totals recorded for the invoices of each department and a total for all departments . The invoices with the lists are then forwarded to the accounts payable department . The second copies of the receiving form ( see Figure 76 ) for each invoice , sent to this department as described in the preceding paragraphs , are now withdrawn , totaled by department Wand compared with the machine listing just prepared . When balanced , the invoices and the tape pass to the posting-journalizing section of the accounts payable department . The tape is detached from the invoices by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting machine operators . It is suggested that controls be split into departmental groups rather than alphabetical groups , several departments making up a ledger control or a section of an audited voucher control . This is accomplished by crediting the group control account with the total postings made to the individual departments comprising the group . If , for example , Group 4 represents dresses , Department 6 , coats , Department 7 , suits , Department 8 , blouses , Department 9 , etc. , the journal totals for each day for each of these departments would be posted to the control for Group 4 . Within this control , accounts would be kept alphabetically . Payments are spread on the cash disbursement record for Group 4 and totals are posted as debits to the control record of Group 4 . Thus the breaking down of accounts payable into units is provided for . Purchase Journal Record . ? A separate purchase journal record is maintained in duplicate for each department . A complete accounts payable record plan is shown in Figure 77 . As the invoices of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice form and the corresponding ledger form are withdrawn from the binder or file , where they repose in alphabetical arrangement with the other records of that department , and are superimposed upon the journal sheets already // in the machine . The record of the invoice is posted on all forms in one operation . When this process is repeated for all invoices of the department in question , the totals posted for the department are listed on the proof sheet and the sheet is then passed to the control clerk who makes comparison with the adding machine tape in her possession . It will be observed that this system provides for the use of a ledger record . However , it can be converted into a voucher system by substituting for the ledger form two additional copies of the statement form ? one filed numerically and the other by vendor name . Under this plan it would be necessary to provide an additional column on the journal form where notation could be made as the invoice is paid . The running balance of invoices posted is maintained weekly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cumulative figures to date are copied to the journal in their proper columns . Then the posting is made and the cumulative posting is recorded . On the proof sheet , the posting total for a group of bills is the difference between the finishing and the starting totals . As has already been seen , the third copy of the receiving form passes with the merchandise to the receiving room and remains with the merchandise during the checking process . When the merchandise is brought to the department , the buyer or assistant retains this form and lists on the back of the record the items received . It will aid him in " spot-checking , " that is , automatically checking merchandise received . But another use of the record , perhaps of greater value , is the help afforded the buyer in checking the duplicate copy of the purchase journal sheet ? sent to him weekly . The cost value of each invoice is checked against each entry on the purchase journal ; the same process governs credits . The buyer is required , when checking each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it allows for the profit expected on the invoice . If not satisfied , he is within his right in calling for the invoice and // having it checked . Again , if entries are found on the sheet for which he has no corresponding receiving record , he may require that the matter be investigated . When the buyer has checked all items on the purchase journal sheet , he returns it to the accounts payable department . This checking process is a very important one ; the buyer who neglects to use it to the full is missing an excellent opportunity to give his department proper protection . Cash Disbursement Journal. ? With a control of due dates maintained and the payment advice and ledger sheet entries made , the payment routine is a simple matter . The cash disbursement record for the group of departments in question ( Group 4 , in this instance ) is placed in the machine over the proof sheet , the ledger and payment advice forms are extracted from the files and placed over the record , and the posting process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the L. M. Z. Corp . forms are placed over the cash disbursement journal sheet for Group 4 SO that only the entries made to the left of the word " balance " carbonize on the ledger and payment advice records . The entry made on the former record follows the last purchase imprint , while the entry on the latter record appears on the upper portion of the check section . This check is used only when the total amount due the vendor is being paid ; if the check is for a part of the vendor bill only ? a payment made on account ? a separate check is used and the record is copied on all the papers , including the cash disbursement journal , the vendor 's ledger , the vendor 's payment advice form , and the check itself . The payment voucher , needless to say , need not be so deep where payments to vendors are made within 7 to TO days after purchase ; there will not be sufficient entries to take that amount of space . But the operating plan will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plan outlined has a number of features . It provides for quick movement of merchandise to the selling floors and // quick setting up of liability on the general books of the company . It carries maximum insurance against mispostings and duplicate postings . Routine processes and red tape are cut materially ; yet the control is ironclad . It is dependent for effectiveness on an intelligent personnel , but that requirement must be met in the administration of any plan that demands the coordination of the services of cooperating groups of human beings . // CONTROLLING THE FOREIGN PURCHASE Foreign Purchase in the Past. ? With very rare exceptions , the foreign purchase has not until recently been asked to give a financial account of itself . It has been shielded and protected against the analysts and statisticians that have been making the domestic purchases justify themselves from the dollar and cents point of view . There has been insistent talk of the fabulous markup percentages the buyers were able to place upon their imported purchases ; but there has also been a record of markdowns , expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the inquisitive reporter was told . " Think of the imported article as a store prestige builder . " That seemed to be its sole defense . It was increasing the store reputation , toning up its departmental displays , and poetizing the souls of the selling staff . The buyer of imported goods was until recent days also given preferred standing . His trip was a reward for services rendered the store or a bonus for volume achievement , and he was not expected to concern himself particularly with the material aspects of the purchasing process . Of course , it was known that he would visit the foreign resource markets and use his ingenuity to obtain the exclusive thing at prices that would insure selling within reasonable periods of time . But there was a tacit understanding that the business of importing was rather risky and customer demand an unrecognizable quality . Under the circumstances , the buyer was not dissatisfied if he " broke even " all around . He did not bother much about landed cost calculations and hoped that he would obtain the planned markup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // figure . It was in the majority of stores a hit-and-miss game , with losses canceled by the strengthening of the house as a high-grade institution and the broadening of the buyer 's mind as a storehouse for the beautiful and the artistic . Import Buying not Guesswork . In the last few years , the merchandising and control executives have taken the subject of import buying out of the favored class and have placed it under the microscope of investigation and research . They have learned that expenses can often be reduced materially by substituting for the buyer 's trip the welding of a closer contact with import houses in America and with European commissionaires . They have become convinced that styles and fashions originating in European centers may or may not be accepted as the vogue by the American woman , that the import charm has lost some of its magic , " that much of the glamour that once attached to imports and established artificial values for foreign products has disappeared with the growth of a greater cosmopolitanism on the part of our public . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that preclude the setting of markups steep enough to pay for the cost of bringing the mass product into this country  - -  not the higher level merchandise , of course , that the exclusive shop must have to satisfy its exclusive demand , nor the linens , ladies ' gloves , art goods , and costume jewelry that can be obtained at greatest advantage by contact with the European market . In addition , they have discovered that an art renaissance has taken place in America in the past half decade and that there are opportunities for profitable operation in merchandise at one 's back door . The point the writers are attempting to make is not that they are opposed to the buying trip to Europe , but rather to its use for a purpose that is not strictly utilitarian . There can be no justification for giving the buyer a purchasing excursion ticket to the other side and five or six weeks ' absence from // his department merely because " the other fellow is doing it " ; it may be cheaper in the long run to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his ears to the ground of the domestic market can often save his department the expense and the time lost of a voyage across the ocean . Resources are right here ? the import house ; ; the manufacturer 's fashion show , samples from abroad , the fashion magazines and services . If , with all these sources of knowledge known , the decision of the management is that the buyer make the trip , the understanding must be clear that it is to be a business act of which effectiveness is to be measured by the concrete results obtained . One simply can not evade the real question : will the trip justify the expenses incurred ? Import Purchases Planned. ? Preparation for the buyer 's departure must be made with the greatest care . The buyer , the divisional and general merchandise manager should sit in conference to determine with a fair degree of precision the kinds of goods to be sought , the cost , landed and retail prices of each item of the various classifications of merchandise listed , and the countries from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provided for in the merchandise budget for the months of the season , and may be exceeded only by authorization of the persons with power to allow the revision ( see Chapter 5 ) . This detailed list of planned purchases should be sent to the store 's foreign offices or commissionaires , as the case may be , so that their scouts may begin their market combing work and prepare the field for the buyer 's arrival . Only through the preparation of such a plan and the enforcement of a ruling of buyer accountability for all its provisions will the guesswork be taken out of foreign purchasing and reasonable profits be assured . The buyer can not be expected to determine the factors in the conversion of European to American money , but he can be expected to select from a prepared list of equivalents the CONTROLLING THE FOREIGN PURCHASE 33i factor that applies to the case at hand and to multiply that figure by the total francs , kronen , lira , or whatever the money denomination might be , at which the particular item is bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 times .0725 at one duty level and at 20o times .0865 at another duty level ; similarly , the item selling for 1os might land at io times .296 at one duty level and at zo times .438 at another duty level . These landing cost equivalents are prepared for the buyer ; it is his job to make the application . The chart shows him the figure to use as the multiplier in each instance ; the product of this cost equivalent and the total of the foreign moneys the item sells for will give him the American landed cost for that item . Knowing the markup desired , he can figure the retail at which the item should sell . He can then determine whether or not the purchase can be made with a reasonable expectancy of profit . Importing is a speculative business and is fraught with uncertainties and difficulties . First , goods must be bought long in advance of sales , frequently 6 months ; second , duties must be paid in advance and can be recovered only with difficulty ; third , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stored for some time ; the wear and tear on the goods is necessarily greater than that to which the average run of domestic merchandise is subjected ; market fluctuations are necessarily greater and the amount of markdowns for the average imported item is consequently higher ; fifth , recording for the purpose of filling needed sizes , styles , colors , and price lines is a difficult process ; sixth , it is not an easy task to allocate the responsibility for breakage and damage and to collect on claims against the foreign vendor . With these difficulties and the additional expense involved in paying the buyer 's traveling and hotel bills and other costs incident to bringing the goods over known , it is essential that the merchandise take a comparatively high initial markup . That markup // will not be attained unless the landed cost of the purchase be calculated properly . But the buyer is powerless if the chart itself is incorrectly constructed , if the factors of conversion are not basically right . Here is responsibility for the foreign office . Figuring Landed Cost. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase in France for ioo units of A merchandise at 20 frances each , 50 units of B merchandise at 120 francs each , and lo units of C merchandise at 40 francs each . The total bill is the sum of 2,000 and 6,000 and 400 francs , or 8,400 francs . Assume that the packing and packing case charge is an additional 400 francs ; the total now becomes 8,800 francs . If the franc ( including the money cost ) is at 4 cents , the value of the 8,800 francs is $352 . To this cost must be added the following expenses : duty ( assume it to be 5 ' 0% ) , $176 ; freight , $43.50 ; insurance and entry fees , S9.3o ; and overhead ( approximately 5% , including the salary of the operating force of the foreign office , rentals , traveling costs , etc. ) $17.60 . The sum of these expenses is $246.40 , which , added to the $352 , becomes $598.40 . To find the landed cost of the franc , it is necessary to divide this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes $.071238 plus . That is the figure that would appear on the chart referred to in the preceding paragraph as the landed cost of a franc for A , B , and C types of merchandise . Article A will therefore land at 20 times .071238 , or $I.43 ; article B at 120 times .071238 , or $8.55 ; and article C at 40 times .071238 , or $2.85 . At 50% markup , the retails will be $2.86 , $17.10 , and $5.70 respectively . Items of Merchandise Cost. ? Right here another controversial issue in retail accounting method bobs up . In the plan described all costs incurred in bringing the merchandise to the store door are considered part of the merchandise cost , // the foreign purchase thus being placed on a level with the domestic purchase when the two reach the store door . Logical though this procedure may seem , the criticism has been made that the inclusion of all these expense items in the landed cost so increases the cost figure as to bring to an excessive height the retail that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation . It is the belief of the persons who take this view that traveling costs should be considered a direct departmental charge and the maintenance of the European office a prorated departmental charge . It is true that by this method the retail will not be as high as it would have to be under the first plan , and the expense charges for the foreign merchandise items will then be a part of the total expenses which have been disbursed for their particular benefit . That would be well , the writers believe , if nobody suffered for the act . But there is suffering ; for the domestic article of the department is charged with an expense not of its own making and of no appreciable advantage to it . It is all part of the act of pampering the imported article and making it look well on paper . If the imported article can not pay for the expenses it incurs and stand on its own showing , it is unjustified . Include the costs incident to bringing the merchandise to the store door in the merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting point , then deduct the department expenses and arrive at the net . That percentage may not be satisfactory , yet the store may feel justified in bringing the merchandise in ; that is its privilege . But the facts should be known . The Landed Cost Chart. ? The confirmation of the buyer 's trip is made far in advance of the actual departure . Some time later the buyer meets with the divisional merchandise manager ; in some stores the general merchandise manager joins this conference , and a definite purchasing budget is drawn // up in detail as to country where the purchases are to be made , the items to be bought , the cost and selling prices . A copy of the itinerary and the plan is sent to the foreign office or offices . In preparation for his departure , the buyer is given general travel instructions , the landed cost chart , a transcript of the duty rates for the items he is expected to purchase , travel funds , and the good wishes of his colleagues . He will need them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The original is sent to the vendor , and the other copies are sent respectively to the home foreign office , the order-checking division , and the permanent files of the European foreign office ; one copy remains with the buyer . The terms of purchase are specified clearly and definite cancellation dates are stipulated . On all copies of the order , excepting that which is sent to the vendor , record is made of the approximate landed costs for the items listed . The amount spent for imported merchandise must be deducted from the open-to-buy at the landed cost figure . A determination must be made of the months that shall absorb the amounts involved . If , for example , the purchase for the fall season is $50,000 at landed cost , the distribution against the September , October , and November open-to-buys might be respectively $10,000 , $20,000 , and $20,000 . Regardless of the amount of merchandise that comes into stock in the final absorption month , the receipt must be disregarded since the open-to-buy has already been penalized . The stock figure must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the order already received . If that were not done , the open-to-buy would suffer twice ; first , when the receipt of this merchandise was being anticipated , and second , when the merchandise was being charged to the stock . Routing the Invoice . The merchandise , when purchased under the plan used most frequently , is shipped to the EuroCONTROLLING // pean office to be checked with the order , and is then assembled with other merchandise received . Payment for the manufacturers ' invoices is provided for at once . Each invoice bears a payment number the control of which is very important in the relationship of the European and the store foreign offices . The payment may be made by check , if funds are kept on deposit with a European bank , or by drafts against open letters of credit . In any case , the basis for the money withdrawal must be understood by the home office . The payment number may be for one or for a group of invoices . When the home office is notified of a withdrawal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the statement of accounts is transmitted to the home foreign office , the withdrawal number appears thereon , so that clear allocation of payments may be made . This number is also recorded on the composite shipping invoice which the foreign office prepares for the shipments forwarded to the store . The invoice is prepared by the European office in eight copies . Four copies are taken to the American consulate , of which two are returned to the foreign office representative ; one is sent to the American customs house and the fourth is retained by the consulate office for its files . Of the two that are returned to the foreign office , one is retained for its files and the other is sent to the forwarding agent with three other invoice copies and the bills of lading . The consulate invoice copy , with two other copies and the bill of lading , is then forwarded to the customs broker for the preparation of the necessary customs house papers . The duty applying to the separate sections is calculated and entered on all these copies . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two are presented when the duty is paid . The freight charge also is paid . One copy is retained and the other is returned to the customs broker who matches it with the copy in his possession and returns both to the American import office . // The Import Register. ? The truckman now picks up the merchandise , and with the exception of that portion that may have been sent to the public stores for examination , makes the delivery to the store receiving door . . The package receives a receiving number and the merchandise is sent to the receiving department . The moment the invoices are received from the customs broker , the foreign invoice division splits one of the invoices into its separate sections and attaches the sections to aprons which will all bear the same receiving number ; the department numbers are placed on the aprons and on the composite invoice . Landed costs are figured for each item of each invoice , on each of which the rubber stamp on the back provides space for the following items : foreign cost , currency rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing expense . From this record the landed cost is calculated , i.e. , the landed unit cost per item ( see the method of computing this figure described earlier in this chapter ) . When this record is copied on the composite invoice , it is retained by the foreign division and the separate invoices are released to the checking department . The retail is entered and the invoices are returned to the office for further calculations . Chapter 26 discussed the advisability of permitting clerks in the invoice control office to place the retail of a domestic order on the invoice . For foreign shipments , it is better policy to place authority for recording the retail with the buyer ; there is too long a lapse of time between the placing of the order and the arrival of the merchandise , and too many variable factors in the protracted operation . The need for change of price is more frequent than it is when the purchase is made in the domestic market . As each invoice or set of invoices arrives from Europe , an entry is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction . The first series of entries ? invoice number , country of origin , name of shipper , date of invoice , the number // of cases or parcels , and the kind of merchandise ? is a transcription from the invoice . From the " arrival notice " the date of arrival of the merchandise is obtained . The " customs entry number " is obtained from the customs house broker 's record . When the draft or the weekly foreign office record of the reimbursement of outlays is made , entries are made in the register for currency , amount , exchange rate , and foreign cost in U. S. dollars . The " duty " is entered as the duty check is drawn . As each shipment is cleared , the record of the customs broker for ocean freight and other forwarding costs is transcribed on the register form . Foreign office and traveling expenses , including the brokerage fee , are also recorded , and then the total of all costs . There is a second section to this register form . The columnar headings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoice ( aproned ) is sent to the receiving and marking room and when it is returned , the date when the insurance company is notified of the shipment , and the department number placed on the invoice . Then follow columns for entries relating to the transaction after the invoice has passed through the routing processes and is ready to be distributed to the selling department and the general accounts . These are for : foreign cost , duty , freight , expense , merchandise cost , retail and gross profit . The bills are recapitulated with totals obtained for foreign cost , duty , freight , and expense . Merchandise is charged for the total and prepaid foreign purchase , prepaid duty , prepaid freight and prepaid expense are credited . The invoices are broken into departments and total costs determined . Departmental totals balance with the total of the register entries as described . The retail and profit for each department is established and entries are made in the retail inventory record . It will be remembered that the money entries were recorded on the register form in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entries made when the draft or weekly foreign // office record of outlays is reimbursed , when the duty check is drawn , and when the customs broker clears the shipment ; and the second series of entries when the invoice is ready for distribution to departments and to the general ledger accounts . Money columns on the first section of the record not closed out by corresponding entries in the money columns of the second section represent details of prepaid items and must balance with the general ledger control of the prepaid accounts ? for merchandise , duty , and freight . // DISTRIBUTING EXPENSES TO PROPER ACCOUNTS ? THE EXPENSE MANUAL The Expense Manager . It is the function of the expense manager to analyze costs and spread them against the debtor account . Just as he can operate effectively in controlling the budget only when he is unhampered by the man higher up , so he can perform the distribution task only when the system is so planned as to insure examination by him of an order for every item of expense that may be initiated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without its insistence that established rules of procedure be carried through implicitly by every person empowered to authorize store expenditures , from the garage foreman to the general manager . No expense may he incurred without the issuance and proper endorsement of expense orders . That does not imply that the expense manager should be vested with the power to initiate an expense or to curb the executive in his efforts to conduct the business of his department with proper dignity and liberality ; no more than the analysis and control of buyers ' purchases by the controller 's office vests it with the authority to decree what shall be bought and when it shall be bought . Rather the work of that office provides the buying and expensecreating executives with a check-up on their operations that must be helpful in keeping stocks in balanced proportions and expenditures within desirable limitations . Revisions of planned budgets , merchandising and expense alike , are permissible and desirable when conditions warrant the change . The expense manager protects the financial health of the departments of the store when he subjects either the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study to which it is entitled . He sets up danger signals before , not after , the damage has been done . He cautions department heads to " go slow " when the condition of the road shows signs of bumpiness and trouble ahead . The majority of the executive staff will heed the warning ; the minority who will not must be treated in a more vigorous fashion . It is for their own good . Preferential treatment for the favorite is the one certain method of breaking down store morale . Proper Charging of Expense Items Important. ? Controlling expense items within reasonable bounds is the first operation . The second is their correct distribution . Every item of expense , no matter how small , must be charged against some account , be it direct or indirect . To make the proper distribution is not a simple task that may be entrusted to a junior clerical ; the evil effects of incorrect distribution are too far-reaching . The charging of accounts demands knowledge of the logic of management that encompasses more than information of the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a comparatively easy recording job ; with the base established , as will be shown in the chapter devoted to proration , the distribution of rentals is not the difficult process so many controllers fear ; if the package delivery cost is ascertained , an equitable delivery charge may be made with directness and precision . But what about the inventory items such as supplies , coal , etc. , that can not be charged as expense until consumed ; or the expense of professional services for which the period of service is the factor that determines how the bill is to be charged ; or the 3- or 6-month garage rental bill payable in advance ; or taxes , or insurance , or the cost of traveling for foreign purchasing ? Invoice or no invoice , every month must be charged with its share of the indebtedness for the general expense items , and it becomes the responsibility of the expense manager to set // up the charges so that there is no omission in one month and no duplication in the next . For their own protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the controller 's office . What was said in Chapter 25 of the purchase order applies with full force to the expense order . Obviously , for some types of expenses a formal order is not necessary ? for rentals , where the lease in actuality is the order , or for light , heat , and power , where the extract of the contract supplants the order , or for the payroll , of course . But for the typical everyday expense item the management should insist that an order be in the possession of the expense manager . The control should begin there ; not after the expenditure has been effected . Moreover , the order should be legible and clear , ; prices and items , especially , should be marked plainly . Charging Inventory Items .  --  Expense items such as supplies , repair parts or other material things , or for services , should be received only at authorized receiving points , again as for the buyer 's purchase ; and the bill should accompany the shipment . The merchandise is not dispatched to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage , the coal bin , etc . In every case , however , a receiving number controlling the purchase is given the shipment at the receiving door and the checking against the invoice is performed by a person reporting to the supply superintendent . Requisitions , too , are made through men who report to the sane official . The door entry for these expense items is recorded on what is known as an " E " form . It is prepared in quadruplicate . The first copy , with the invoice , is dispatched to the order checker in the office of the expense manager . The second copy also finds its place here and ' is filed in the influx expense bills file . The third copy travels with the merchandise to the supply room or to one of the central store 's rooms . The fourth copy remains in the book and acts as a permanent record of // the receipt of the goods . The aproned invoice , checked against the corresponding order and marked for account name and account number ( the second copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section to which the merchandise has previously been relayed ; it is matched with the third copy of the receiving form and is passed to the head of the department initiating the expense for his signature or for the signature of his accredited representative . The face copy travels back to the office of the expense manager , where it is checked for cost calculations . The second copies are drawn and a predetermined total is established . Those expense bills not passing through the door receiving room are sent directly to the expense manager . They are checked against the purchase orders or against the extracts of the lease , agreement , or other contractual paper the files may hold . The same " E " apron is used as the one employed for the material purchase , but only three copies are needed for controlling the record ; obviously , there is no need for the merchandise copy . These bills take serial numbers separate from those with incoming merchandise . A predetermined total of the bills passed is built up as described above . Reference has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the Controllers ' Congress comes to the aid of the stores with an expense classification scheme that is a model for mechanical ingenuity . Every item of expense is given a definite place in the scheme ; every account is defined with the utmost clarity . Every combination of numbers represents a definite expense account ; the lines are drawn sharply and surely . For example , or represents the total payroll for the small store ; or-oi represents the administrative and occupancy payroll for the smallest medium-sized store , 20-01-01 represents the administrative payroll for the mediumsized store , and 20-01-03 represents the superintendency and general store payroll for the large medium-sized store . These symbols represent precisely those accounts , never other accounts . // The numbers are broken up in still greater subdivisions for the largest store ( refer to concluding section , Chapter 17 ) . Expense Manual 's Number Scheme. ? Superficially the established nomenclature seems very puzzling . Actually it is very simple . There are 14 natural divisions of expense ? payroll , rentals , advertising , taxes , interest , supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insurance , depreciation , and professional services . The small store analyzes its expense according to this natural classification scheme . The total store payroll is ( 31 ; the total rental is 02 ; the total advertising is 03 , etc . The store that has grown to be a small medium-sized store breaks up these natural groupings and classifies its accounts in greater detail ; thus the total payroll divides itself into payrolls for administration and for occupancy , publicity , buyers and assistants and salespersons , and for miscellaneous buying and selling divisions ; hence it breaks up the of representing total payroll in the small store into or-o1 for the administrative and occupancy payroll , 01-02 for the publicity payroll , 01-03 for the third payroll group , and 01-04 for the fourth payroll group . With the next expansion , to the medium-sized store , a new element is introduced ? the functional classification of account . Twenty represents administration ; 30 represents occupancy ; 40 represents publicity ; 5o represents buying ; and 6o represents selling . The o1-01 representing administrative payroll for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative payroll and 30-01-01 for the occupancy payroll . In the large , medium-sized store , there is a further narrowing of the accounts . The administrative payroll becomes 20-01-01 for the executive office payroll , 20-01-02 for the payroll of the accounting office and the accounts receivable and credit department , and 20-01-03 for the payroll of the superintendency and the general store . For the large store there is a further subdivision. // Applicable to Any Size Store. ? This plan may-be applied by stores of any size . It makes for a definite allocation of expenses and for comparability of figures among stores of the same size . The expense manual is a monumental work , representative of the best brains of the profession in its construction , and should be followed by all stores interested in the scientific recording of the facts of their businesses . Space forbids the reproduction of the charts exhibiting graphically all the classification divisions , but one of them must be shown ? that giving the suggestive expansion of accounts in the small store to medium store grouping . It is reproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be remembered that predetermined daily totals have been obtained for the general ledger and the expense accounts . The amounts are distributed as credit to the control for the voucher and accounts payable records and as charges against the general ledger and expense accounts . Posting to Expense Account. ? The invoices now pass to the journalizing-posting division , where the operation is similar to that described in Chapter 26 for the accounts payable work . The invoices are sorted alphabetically . The account forms for the vendor accounts are withdrawn from their files and mounted on the expense journal record . The posting is done by picking up the old balance , entering the date of the invoice , the voucher or expense account number , the amount , and the new balance . The old balance is again picked up for proof purposes . The posting figure is placed in one of two columns , general ledger or expense , depending on the type of expense . After the daily postings have been properly proved and the totals entered into their proper controls , the second copies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used ) , where a card is punched for each item in detail . The punching is the same for the general ledger and the expense item excepting for the posting that marks the // expense in one of these classes . In addition to that punching , records are punched for date , voucher number , account number , and amount . The cards are then passed to the tabulator , who lists totals for the general ledger and expense accounts . These must agree with the predetermined totals formerly referred to . The cards are now placed in the file and accumulate for the month . At the end of the month they are withdrawn , passed through the assorter and distributed and totaled by functional , natural , or other grouping plan used by the particular store . Balancing the Expense Account. ? Where the tabulating process is not used , the operation is very similar excepting that there is manual division of copy 2 of the " E " form , the arrangement being by general ledger and expense accounts , then by the major divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subdivisions is balanced to the predetermined posting total . At the end of the month the records are withdrawn , and the total is balanced against the total control and the separate general ledger and expense controls . The totals for the month are posted to the respective ledgers . The system for paying the vendors is practically identical with the payment plan for merchandise invoices described in Chapter 26 . The vouchers are mounted on the disbursement record and the details of the check are written on the check portion of the voucher . This does not account for the total accumulation of expenses . The transfer from prepaid accounts and the monthly entries for accruals occur through journal vouchers . Then there is the treatment of the requisition withdrawing for consumption items temporarily accumulated as supply and repair inventories . If the budget is to be controlled accurately , the treatment of these requisitions must be a daily operation . The requisition must be issued by the consuming department and must designate the use and purpose of the items asked 35o CONTROL OF RETAIL STORE OPERATIONS for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trained in the expense numbering scheme so that the correct expense account may be charged with the withdrawal . Of course , the expense manager checks all mechanical operations so recorded . The supply requisition that does not designate the exact quantities wanted must be corrected by the supply man . Substitutions must be recorded with the utmost care . The quantities distributed must be exactly according to specifications on the requisition form . Prices must be according to notations on price card records and should be checked in the office of the expense manager . When the expense manager receives the requisitions ( there should be no delay in this transference ) , they are checked , extended by items , totaled , and forwarded to the tabulating department . Here the daily punched cards are balanced to the predetermined total and a posting is made against the budgets for the items affected . If the tabulating process is not used , after the first total is taken , the requisitions are classified and the postings are made against the various budgets . Accumulating the Payroll. ? At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their accounts , the totals of all accounts are compared with the totals of the predetermined daily figures , and the listing is posted to the expense ledger . Where the tabulating machine is not used , the daily totals are added for the month and the monthly figure is posted to the expense ledger . A complete exposition of the method of accumulating the payroll and of making the distribution will be given in the chapter discussing personnel and payrolls . Here it will suffice to say that through the medium of the census sheet or its tabulating equivalent , it is possible to dissect the payroll into the various required classifications . Comparison with the budget is made weekly and postings to the expense ledger monthly . Thus the expense ledger is built up . The figures are of // prime importance in the preparation of the operating statement . It is necessary to repeat that the operating statement shall not be released until all expense accounts have been examined thoroughly for possible omissions or for striking differences with former figures . The statistical report prepared from the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asked to refer to that section of the book . " Right Consuming . " ? Right buying is essential to satisfactory management ; so are right advertising and right selling . But what about right consuming , not by the ultimate consumer , but by the store personnel ? The right consuming of paper , twine , bags , light , time . Here are unseen losses that mount to substantial proportions . Who can measure the loss in prestige and in sales resulting from the dawdling and indifference of the sales force ? How many stores have analyzed packing and wrapping processes and have determined the one best way to pack for the various items , the kind of paper that will serve best at the least prohibitive cost ? What instruction has been given salespeople and wrappers to compare with the knot-making instruction of the boy scout troops , for example ? These are little things , but the extra consumption of supplies , when taken in the aggregate , adds up to a pretty sum of money . // TRAINING AND PAYING THE EMPLOYEE Character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning of merchandise purchasing and expenses , for intensive budgeting and control , the fact remains that the determining factor in sales growth is the character of the salesperson . To the customer , the girl behind the counter represents the store . She knows very little of inside operational difficulties , of merchandising and promotional conferences , of the time consumed in planning the window and the internal display , of the efforts of the comparison department to insure honest advertising and proper price-setting , of the work of the building superintendent to make the store a pleasant shopping center . She sees only the girl across the counter or at the racks , and her opinion of the store 's service is her reaction to the salesgirl 's attitude toward her . The selling force can promote or retard the organization 's growth . Does the average retailing establishment recognize the value of its investment in the human element of the business ? Does the store have a clear-cut , intelligent training program ? Is the salesperson rated for her sales achievements and on the basis of punctuality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store a well-organized promotion system , a plan that provides reasonable tenure of office , a method of pensioning the superannuated employee ? The store 's attitude toward its employees will reflect itself in the treatment accorded the customer and the measure of satisfaction of that treatment will reflect itself in gross sales , net sales and profits . Store Asks Much of Its Salespeople. ? The store asks a great deal of its salesperson . She is expected to give un-352 // divided attention to the job for which she has been engaged . Every movement of the merchandise she handles is subjected to constant control and continuous check-up ; the moneys received and " turned in " are recorded and balanced at various points ; all records initiated by her are checked , matched , audited , and analyzed . Store regulations demand that she report at a definite hour , that she be in the department at a stated time , that she depart for lunch and return within scheduled hours , that she prepare the unaudited sales report and the daily want slip . She must give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is given a weekly wage . There , at the wage , the stores stopped years ago ? and those establishments whose vision of personnel problems is as circumscribed as their opinions of budgeting and control plans stop there now . But the typical store has made tremendous strides in the management of its personnel in the years since the World War . The personnel division is recognized for its ability to build store morale and its powers are broadening constantly . The store manager leans as heavily upon it as the controller does on the expense control section of his office . Let us take the salesgirl through her routine . Her first contact with the store is through the employment department . In place of the old-time bully , her interviewer is a gentleman or lady of education , tact , and courtesy . If she meets the personal requirements of the position , she is examined for general intelligence and knowledge of the merchandise of the particular department for which she is making application . She is required to pass a physical examination , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives both the store and her reasonable assurance that she will be able to perform the duties to which she will be assigned . With these preliminaries completed , she may be accepted or rejected or accepted on trial . Whatever the decision may be , the applicant is treated with 9 ' // consideration and sympathy . Employment managers of the new school know that first impressions count heavily ? especially in the department store field , for often an applicant , her family , or her friend is a prospective or present store customer . The successful candidate is not thrown into the department almost bodily as she was in former days . Under the plan generally in vogue today , she is put through a carefully prepared training program which includes instruction not only in the fundamental rules of salescheck writing and in the operation of any machine that may be used in the work , the fabricmeasuring , the tube or the register machine for example , but also in the selling points of the merchandise itself . She is sponsored and guided in the early period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell , she has become acquainted with the store 's selling policy and its policy on returns , employee purchases and discounts ; she knows the exact duties of her position and the promotional possibilities . If her department is on a commission and bonus plan , she knows the method of measuring her production and her extra earnings ; if the store is operating on a reward and penalty system , she is acquainted with its mechanics . In short , the new salesgirl has sufficient information of departmental and store routine to carry on with a fair degree of intelligence and satisfaction . The reaction on the mind of the customer is obvious . Careful Training Program. ? Placed on the floor , the salesperson 's background and training come into play . She is not left to her own resources and is not permitted to drift to an attitude of smug complacency and detachment . The initial training is followed up by more intensive , more specialized training . Departmental meetings are the rule in the better stores . She is initiated into the intricacies of selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling . The training department checks her errors and the comparison department checks her salesmanship technique . She // is guided constantly but always sympathetically . That is sound pedagogy , the store executives have learned . But in the handling of cash , tenderness can not be shown . The salesperson is not bonded unless she operates her own money bank , yet she is permitted to accept customer 's money for department purchases . Department store executives will argue heatedly over the benefits and advantages of the cash register , the cashier and the tube room system of receiving and making change for customer 's money , and they all make out very plausible cases for their respective sides of the argument ? they talk of speed of completing the sale , the discouragement of manipulation and collusion , and the mechanization of the salesperson 's job . But that is not the issue here . The fact is that under any system cash is handled by the person on the selling floor and that a tight control is essential . Errors will be made and some are excusable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When drivers and salespeople are charged with discrepancies created through carelessness , the object is not so much punishment for the guilty persons as the prevention of recurrent losses . There must be an atmosphere of absolute control , the knowledge by the personnel that store moneys are protected at every point . Irresponsibility can not be tolerated . Ignorance is not an accepted excuse . The auditing procedure for the cash check was given in Chapter 19 devoted to the mechanics of auditing for all store transactions . Reference was made to the salesperson 's " bank " and a rather general description was given of its use . At this time it is pertinent to outline in more detailed form the system for distributing the money banks , their collection and control , i.e. , the work of the money office . Money Office Routine. ? In most stores money banks count up to $20 . They are made up of the following denominations : a $5 bill ; $io in single bills ; $2.50 in quarters ; $i in dimes ; $1 in nickels ; and $0.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending upon the activity of the particular station and the average unit of sale . It is important that the distributing center for the receipt and return of money boxes and bags be located near the locker rooms or at another point easily accessible to the majority of the selling force . By so segregating the distribution center , confusion will be averted and the whole process speeded materially . The windows are so numbered that the salesperson need waste no time in receiving quick attention . The operation is a simple one . The salesgirl presents herself at the proper window and gives the clerk her name and register number . A money box is given her and the control list is checked . At the close of the day , the money box is delivered to the same distributing center with some identifying symbol , such as " 3K " or " 12C " ? the numeral representing the register number and the letter the drawer number . As this designation is given by the salesperson , record is again made on the control list . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and distribution of additional banks may then be made only through the cashier 's office . When the day 's money bank and cashier distribution has been made , the work of counting the previous day 's receipts is begun . The counter adds the moneys in the various denominations ? 3 $10 bills , 3 fives , 28 single dollar bills , etc. ? and checks these totals and the total of the box with the figures shown on the salesperson 's " cash report " ( see Chapter 19 ) . If the sums agree , $2o is put back into the bank for the next day 's distribution and the remaining amount becomes the cashier 's record of cash sales . A listing of these figures arranged in numerical sequence by register and drawer numbers is passed on to the auditing department for comparison with the register readings taken the previous evening . Where there is a discrepancy of the money count , the salesperson whose account is being questioned is summoned to the cashier 's office immediately and apprised of the situation . It is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case , the difference between the cashier count and the salesperson 's figures does not necessarily indicate a shortage in the funds ; that can be determined when comparison is made with the register readings . In the counting process , as checks , money orders , or discount slips are extracted from the banks , they are marked on the reverse side for the department and register number . In addition , all checks and cash reports are rubber-stamped with the counter 's number in code . These notations become valuable aids in later tracings and investigations . Proving Cash Report. ? When the total of the cash reports has been proved against total cash received in the counting office , a money recapitulation is prepared and is delivered with the cash to the control clerk . Here the money packages are rechecked . Where errors are discovered , there is further rechecking . The bank deposit slip is now written , and the money is placed aside for receipt by the bank messenger . The petty cashier is charged with a definite sum daily . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been approved by the proper authorities . These vouchers are totaled daily and the reimbursement is made by the control clerk of the main cashier 's office . Service desk money is returned to the money office each evening and the balancing process effected the following day . The salesperson has her bank and is ready to proceed with the day 's work . The concluding section of this chapter will describe the preparation of the records that chart her production and quality ratings ? records that form the bases for weekly pay , additional compensation , and promotion to advanced positions in the store . When a salesperson is employed ? the procedure is similar for the non-selling employee ? triplicate copies of her engagement record are made : one for the paymaster 's office , another // for the addressograph department , and the third for the record division of the personnel office . Changes in pay rates , resignations , discharges , department transfers are recorded in triplicate and are relayed to the same points . The addressograph department cuts the plates and prepares the payroll record sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 for the selling department . A similar record is made for each non-selling department . ) The paymaster 's office maintains a rate card file for reference and checking with the rates appearing on the record . Note the column headed " check " in Figure 79 . There is continuous controversy about the relative merits of the time-clock and the sheet-signing system for the recording of employee time . Without arguing the point , it may be stated that the trend is definitely toward the latter plan . But whatever the system in vogue , the record of the salesperson 's time is placed on the record shown and the absence period determined . The salesperson 's number , name , rate of pay , attendance , and punctuality record having been indicated on the form , the paymaster 's office uses Thursday and Friday for entering and calculating additions and deductions . By Saturday practically all records are in for the determination of net payments due . Figuring " Charges " on Payroll Record . The word " charges " in Figure 79 refers to employees ' purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced to the time it reached the member 's bookkeeping department . The moment this record is received , a card is withdrawn from the visible index file for the proper name . The charge is entered on this card ? in duplicate ? by mounting it on a posting control sheet . At the end of the week , a total of all employees ' charges is taken for the store and a sub-total for the departments affected . One copy of the listing remains in the files and the other is sent to the office of the paymaster together with 36o CONTROL OF RETAIL STORE OPERATIONS the face copies of the cards ; these cards are placed in the salespersons ' envelopes as memos of the deductions . The duplicate cards are filed with the listing record . The columnar headings on the payroll record are selfexplanatory . It may be well , however , to describe in detail the process of recording a transfer in and out of a department . The suggested plan provides a method by which a salesperson who has worked in one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one envelope , yet have the different departments charged with their proper portions of the salesperson 's time . Take the case of Jennie Smith with a weekly rate of $i8 who worked in Department X the first four days of the week and who was transferred to Department 22 on Thursday morning ( see Figure 79 ) . The $12 she had earned in Department X is placed in the " additions-transfer " column in Department 22 . In Department 22 her rate of pay was $18 but she was absent four days , therefore the " total amount earned " is $6 . With the addition of $I2 for the earnings in Department X , her net payment becomes $i8 . Jennie Smith would thus receive her weekly pay in a Department 22 envelope , and Department 22 would be charged with $6 for her services . On the record for Department X Jennie Smith 's name would show these entries : time absent , two days ; amount deducted for absence , $8 ; total amount earned , $12 ; deductions ( transfers ) , $12 ; net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are $12 and $6 respectively ; the net payments o and $i8 . The deduction and addition totals cancel each other . For the new week Jennie Smith belongs officially to Department 22 . Scheduling Work of the Pay Office. ? In the well-managed pay office , the week 's work is scheduled very definitely . In the illustration to be used , pay day is Wednesday . From Thursday to Friday night , as explained previously , the details of all deductions and of those employee transfers that have // " come through " are recorded on the payroll form . On Saturday , as fast as the time records are released from the timekeeper 's office , the absent time , overtime , and all other time notations are made . On Monday , total net payment figures are calculated and totals are obtained for the departments and for the store as a whole . The pay envelopes , imprinted in the addressograph department from the plates used for the stampings of the payroll record sheets , but omitting the rate , are arranged by department and listings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flap of the envelope , and the envelope totals are required to be in balance with the total of all department listing totals . Tuesday is envelopestuffing day . The envelopes are bundled into groups representing the distributions of the various persons authorized to receive and pass out the moneys ? floor men and heads of non-selling departments . The envelopes are distributed , and returns for absent employees are made before the end of the day . From Wednesday on , the pay office uses its time , in addition to performing the routine described , in adjusting payroll complaints ; but these adjustments may be requested only at specific hours . Unclaimed salaries are retained in the paymaster 's office for a month , and are then released to the cashier to be credited to the unclaimed salary account . A detailed record of the salaries so credited is maintained , and withdrawals may be made only by authority of the director of the personnel department . When the payrolls , selling and non-selling , have been computed and balanced , they are released to the census department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two separate forms , one for selling and stock help and one for the general payroll . The former record gives the week 's selling salary and stock help salary figures for the total store by merchandise manager groupings and by the separate departments . Totals are obtained for each department , sub-totals for each group of departments , and a grand total for all the departments . // The Census Sheet . In the selling salary section columns are provided to record the number of employees this week and the corresponding week last year ; the number of transactions for both weeks ; the net sales for both weeks ; the payroll , both weeks ; the bonus or commission , both weeks ( to be explained subsequently ) ; total selling salary , this and last year ; the selling salary cost percentage , this week and the corresponding week last year , and the cumulative selling salary cost percentage this week to date , and the corresponding period last year . In the stock help salary section , the same information is given excepting that relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each department includes the records of the selling and stock help salaries ; by dividing this figure by net sales for the week and by dividing the cumulative figure by net sales for the period to date , the selling cost percentage is determined both for the week and for the period to date . The non-selling or general payroll lists the weekly payroll figures according to the classification shown in the expense manual . The number of employees and the dollars and cents paid this week and the corresponding week last year , as well as the cumulative salary records for the current year and the preceding year , are entered on the form . The non-selling cost percentages are determined for the functional divisions and for the total of all divisions for the week and the cumulative period this year and last . The Executive Payroll. ? The total of the selling and nonselling payrolls for the store is balanced against the money withdrawn for the week 's payroll . From the monthly payroll records a monthly general ledger posting is made , crediting the payroll and charging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for selling and stock help salaries or in the nature of indirect expense accounts involved in the other payroll items . The balancing is done monthly . An additional payroll account as yet unmentioned is the // executive payroll . This record is accumulated on a special sheet and the payment is made direct under the supervision of a trusted assistant in the office of the treasurer . Payment is generally made semi-monthly by check . A check for the total sum is drawn and the charge is in the first instance against account number oz of the National Retail Dry Goods Association expense manual and later to the selling departments either directly , as in the case of buyers ' salaries , or indirectly , as in the case of the store manager 's . The problem will be considered in greater detail in Chapter 30 on prorating procedure . Reference was made earlier in this article to the bonus and commission department . Some departments ? furniture notably ? pay their salesmen on a strictly commission basis . Most stores pay some form of bonus to their salespeople in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases on amounts of sales over predetermined quotas . It is not necessary to describe in detail the method of collecting the monthly sales in the bonus and commission department ; the difference between the salesperson 's quota and that figure is the base on which the bonus is paid . Some stores pay a commission on all quota sales and an additional bonus for the amount of sales over the quota . In Chapter 17 , another payment system was given . Whatever the store plan , the monthly bonus is determined in the bonus and commission department , and the figures are passed on to the census department for entry on its payroll recapitulating record . With the additional sum on the record , the census department is able to arrive at the selling cost percentage per salesperson and for the department and store . Department stores in various parts of the country have developed schemes for measuring the productivity of nonselling employees and for remunerating them for achievements better than standard . Production in the largest sense of the term is meant , including exceptional service in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example ) , speed of operation ( cashiers , for example ) , accuracy in posting , etc . The recording routine is not materially different from that already explained for recording of entries that come within the category of additional remuneration for salespeople . The Personnel Record. ? The selling and non-selling payrolls are passed on to the personnel department . With these records of production and with the records of punctuality , attendance , errors , ratings , etc. , the department is prepared to place on the individual 's permanent record ? selling , nonselling , and executive ? the facts that will guide it in making promotions and demotions , in increasing rates of pay and in improving the employee 's general education and special knowledge of her particular field of work . A typical salesperson 's record is here described . The non-selling employee 's record is necessarily less detailed , but its maintenance is of no less importance than the salesperson 's report . The record gives a complete history of the salesperson 's attainments from the first day of employment . The cards are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabetically for the salespeople : Page I. An attendance record for a four-year period : The numbers in the vertical column represent the clays of the months ; they extend to 31 . The letters in the horizontal column represent the initials of the month ? F for February , M for March , and so on . The width of the card allows for recordkeeping for four years . The symbols adopted are : no mark , for presence ; red stamp for absence ; green stamp for lateness ; red check for paid vacation ; black check for unpaid vacation ; X for absence refund ; diagonal line for absence excused . Page 2 . On this page , a plan is outlined for the notation of the number and kinds of errors made each month . For simplification of the plan it has been determined to use letters to represent // type of errors ? thus A may represent " wrong address " ; B " incorrect arithmetic " ; C " illegible penmanship . " There are 48 boxes on the page ? 12 boxes wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the months in 1926 , the second row for 1927 , the third row for 1928 , and the fourth row for 1929 . Hence A3 in the March box in the first row , would indicate that the person had made three " wrong address " errors in March , 1926 . Similarly C , in the June box , second row , would indicate that the person had made one " illegible penmanship " error in June , 1927 . The location and correction of errors being a very important function of the training section , the follow-up is given scrupulous personal attention , and this part of the rating sheet becomes extremely valuable . Page 3 . See Figure 80. 1 . General information of a more or less personal kind . 2 . Positions held in the house since initial engagement ? dates ? salary increases . 3 . Physical examination rating ? dates and findings . 4 . Rating of buyer and floor man . This estimate is noted every 6 months . Each quality is given a maximum of 20 , making a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide discrepancy in the respective ratings , the superintendent of the personnel department will confer with one or both of the executives interested and may sometimes deem it advisable to hold a meeting with the three persons concerned . Their rating cards are kept on file and the employees are encouraged to scrutinize them and thus observe the progress they are making . They are , of course , invaluable when promotions and transfers are anticipated . 5 . A graph to indicate the selling cost of the person rated for each month . The letters F , M , A , etc. , represent the initials for the month as February , March , April . The bold horizontal line represents the average selling cost for the entire department . A mark above the line indicates a selling cost above the average and therefore below the standard efficiency . On the contrary , a mark below the line indicates a selling cost lower than the average and hence a higher standard of efficiency . Thus , as we have // graphed our hypothetical case , for the month of February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she haproved in March and was selling at average cost ; for April , she was i% above the average ; and for May , her selling per cent had improved to 1% below . This vacillation of percentages as indicated by the movement of the line for the succeeding months , indicates very clearly the progress the salesperson is making . Page 4 .

The number of transactions ; gross sales ; net sales ; earnings ; extra earnings ; total earnings ; selling cost percentage . // PRORATING STORE EXPENSES ? THE FORMULA METHOD OF CHARGING EXPENSES The Prejudice Against Departmental Proration. ? Merchandising statistics are in the first instance departmental statistics . Purchases , sales , inventories , shortages , markdowns ? these are at their very inception departmental figures . The accumulation of departmental figures produces the store figure ; the latter is assembled from the individual departmental statistics . For expenses , the process is the reverse . Excepting the direct selling payroll , the expenditure is distributed first to some functional or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charge against the selling department . The first process is synthetic ; the second analytic . In Chapters 28 and 29 , the routine was given for bringing every expense item to the expense or general ledgers and to the subsidiary ledgers the particular store maintains . It becomes necessary now to allocate these charges to the selling departments that share the benefits of the spending act , to prorate the charges , in the jargon of the trade . Here one finds a sharp division of opinion . On one hand the point is made that departmental proration is an involved , cumbersome , analytical process that can not be justified by the advantages to be gained , that in fact there are no advantages to be gained ; charge the departments with the direct expenses and forget about departmental indirect distribution , that school asserts . Others go a step further and make the distribution against the selling department for the half-year or the year on some such basis as volume of sales for one group of ex-368 // penses and area consumed for another group of expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the monthly operating statement for the whole store , that the trouble of allocating indirect charges to departments is not compensated for by the possible gains . Non-Proration the Lazy Way. ? The tendency has been in that direction , but it is a tendency to be deprecated . It is the lazy way , the easy way , but not the right way . In the first place , proration need not be cumbersome or involved or intricate . The fact is that large slices of expenses ? the whole occupancy group , the cost of the outside delivery , the cost of operating the personnel department ? are adaptable to allocation to selling departments through a formula process that is neither direct nor indirect , but that is equitable , nevertheless , and almost automatic . Other indirect expenses do require careful interpretation and do demand intelligence of a high order in their conversion into departmental proportions , but that fact alone does not justify a hands-off policy . The selling departments are charged immediately with all their merchandising costs . Why guess at the expense costs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the needs of each individual selling department , why not the merchandising costs of the store as a whole ? Merchandising profit does not tell the story of a department 's effectiveness until it is associated with the complete expenses the department has incurred . Not some expenses , but all expenses . Of course , the result may not be a pleasing one , but matters are not improved by concealing facts . A department 's condition must be diagnosed before it can be cured . The bad spots must be seen before they can be healed . The expense lesions can not be reduced until the X-ray and microscope localize them . To lay aside the figure , the department that is overburdened with expenses must first know the nature and extent of these expenses ; then only can measures // be applied to bring them into proper alignment . To paraphrase Socrates : " Know expenses . " Store Should Know Losing Departments. ? The successful department can not long carry the burden of the unsuccessful department . Parasitism has no place in the retail store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store prestige to keep the losing department on the books , that is its privilege . But the store should know it is a losing department . And it will not know that until all the charges the department has incurred have been placed on the books of that department ? not every six months when it may be too late to remedy conditions , but immediately , if possible , and certainly within the month . If a department has the best space in the store , it must pay the best rental rate ; if a department uses twothirds of a warehouse , it must pay for two-thirds of the cost of maintaining it ; if a department makes deliveries for ninetenths of the items sold , and another department with the same number of transactions but slightly larger packages makes deliveries for three-tenths of the items sold , the first department must pay a delivery charge three times the amount charged to the second department ; if the ratio of the purchase invoices of two departments is five to one , the ratio of the amounts charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to one . And so on for every expense item , small as well as large . Proration is the very essence of departmental recording technique . It is not the troublesome process it has been called , but even if it were , it would nevertheless be justifiable procedure . Suppose all markdowns were designated " store " rather than " department " ; or all purchases or all sales , for that matter . Preposterous ? Of course . But does not the same reasoning apply to expenses ? To the point where the merchandise profit is calculated , the figures are for the department ; thereafter in the store where only direct expenses are allocated , the costs of
