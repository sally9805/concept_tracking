txt We Must Collect or Pay . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your editorial on Jan. 1 " Lift Up Your Hearts " was read with great interest . May I venture to ask , however , why in discussing this proposed cancellation of reparations this essential fact is generally ignored : that if the various debtor nations do not pay , it is not a mere matter of forgiving them their debts to us , but would mean paying them ourselves ? It seems to me that in all discussion of this subject that fact should be plainly stated . Many do not realize it . A war not brought on by act of ours ; which we entered only when forced by aggression ; which cost us heavily in loss of life and an enormous amount of money ; in which we sought no personal gain  --  and now it is proposed to saddle us also with the debts of our allies .
