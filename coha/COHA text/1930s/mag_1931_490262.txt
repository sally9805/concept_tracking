MANY factors have contributed to America 's world prestige , not the least of which are her natural resources  --  coal , iron , wheat , cotton , and five-cent candy bars . These resources have been important , but even they would have failed had they lacked , for their exploitation , a certain quality possessed by Americans  --  a certain pride of accomplishment . We saw this neatly exemplified the other day in an accident-insurance circular which came to us from one of the big companies . It contained , as the feature , a photograph of a train wreck . The locomotive and cars had been derailed and were lying on their side , twisted and crushed , a bloody scene . Under the picture was a caption : " 27 killed , 50 injured . . . " and then the caption-writer had added , with that curious pride that we have mentioned : " One of our members was killed in this wreck . " IT was a letdown to learn that the new Hudson River Bridge had become , overnight , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good name for a bridge . Many memorials to the father of our country have reduced his name to a condition far from picturesque or impressive . The name Washington is like the name Nedick 's . The Port of New York Authority should give their magnificent span a better break , and we have a suggestion . At the foot of the tower on the New York side , there is a little lighthouse . Mariners on the river know it well as Jeffreys Hook Light . Why not call the bridge Jeffreys Hook Bridge ? That 's where it is , and we think Jeffreys Hook is more of a name than George Washington , and a bridge called Jeffreys Hook Bridge would be more fun to drive across than a bridge called G. W. Memorial . THERE is some talk , as you know , of selling Florida back to the Spaniards . A great cold has settled down over the state 's hones , the long homes of the Palm Beach residents are dark with loneliness , and the mercury freezes in the glass . Slimy snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes of the subdivisions . When we consider the fortunes of this tropic peninsula , moving glacier-like into the winter of her fame , this land of yesterday 's effulgence , how warm the little northern hearth doth seem , how jovial and refined the central-heating plant . And how quick we would go down there , too , if we had the dough . ANASTY little crack we took at radio announcers a while ago ( we said they were the boys who twenty years ago used to read " with expression " in grammar school ) aroused one announcer to the point of leaving his microphone long enough to reply . Writing from KFRC in San Francisco , he says he knows the truth about us hack writers , too  --  us fellows that write mincing paragraphs for the papers . Hack writers , he says , are the little boys of twenty years ago who used to delight their grammar-school teacher by writing compositions " with originality and style . " This is a canny and true observation . Any teacher in P.S. 2 ( Miss Hackett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry , Miss Abigail A. Bourne , Mrs. Schuyler , Miss Sheridan ) will testify that that was what we were doing , circa 1906 . Really the only difference between writers and announcers is in the subject matter they deal with . The writers , penning along with originality and style , touch on such hroadscale cosmic matters as the tonal quality of radio announcers ' voices ; the announcers , reading with expression , merely introduce , each evening at seven , the Salty Sardine Troubadours . THE balladmongers of this town are asleep . There is a ballad ready to hand in Frank Dostal , who stood by a hydrant counting barrels of beer and so became mayor of Avenue B long and long ago , and who has given up the ermine to go live in California . There is a ballad , if there were anyone to write it , in Stitch McCarthy , or in the Mayor of Poverty Hollow , or in the Duke of Essex Street . Stitch has been Mayor of Grand Street for thirty-five years , which , as time goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Whittington . Where are our poets ? These locality mayors smack as much of New York as beefeaters and buttoned costers do of London . They are indigenous . They have taken root . Perhaps they are one of Nature 's political experiments , like those moires du palais who set up a Carolingian dynasty . Historians may come to rummage in the ruins of Allen Street and Hunts Point and uncover lictors and tokens of the rugged Cincinnatus-like simplicity of 1930 New York . Why , these mayors , if turned loose , could even now make government personal and picturesque ? a consummation which , with all due respect to Jimmie , might enable one to take an interest in it once more . Little Group ABOUT once a year we manage to drop into a poetry lecture to see how the Muse is making out . It struck us the other night , at a lecture down in what used to be Greenwich Village before the apartment-builders got hold of the situation , how true to type poetry audiences run . There is the young couple who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely , freely . There is the mealy-headed man grown bald without sin . There is the very beautiful Russian Jewess , worshipful in the front row . There is the woman with the hone-rim glasses and the buck teeth , who can hardly contain herself at the funny things the poet says . There is the serious young poetry-lover with the low collar , his pencil busy taking notes . There is the " advanced " woman who has wanted so much to sin but never did , somehow . There is the young lady who looks steadily at the ceiling and wears a faint knowing smile , as though she knew a little secret-something just she and the poet were in on . There is the middle-aged , grotesquely dressed female who is so dazed in the presence of the Muse that she trips on the low step of the aisle and almost falls . There is the man who is genuinely interested in poetry , bringing the girl who is genuinely not . And finally there is that sterling type , the " window-adjuster "  - -  the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right angle that he keeps on doing it after the poet says " Do n't bother , please . " Husband-Saver HAMMACHRR , SCHLEMMER &COMPANY,; the pretty well glorified hardware merchants , are selling a hammer with a new attachment which does away with the possibility of husbands ' hitting their thumbnails and sulking all day . There 's a place on the hammer 's head into which you insert a nail ; then when you bring the hammer down it gives the nail a preliminary push into the wood , and lets go of it . A salesman at Hammacher 's Fifty-seventh Street branch was about to demonstrate the hammer one day to an interested customer , with great confidence indeed , when he found he did n't have a nail . " Nail , " he said to a fellow-clerk . This man did n't have one and said " Nail " to another clerk , who did n't have one either . It turned out that there was n't a nail in the store  --  on the main floor , that is . Someone went down into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Re- search last week , which is the first club we 've joined since our college fraternity . Initiation costs two dollars , and for that sum one receives the " Handbook of Buying , " a confidential guide giving inside information on trademarked products and advising its members which toothpaste , cigarette , automobile , radio , soap , baking powder , watch , and breakfast food to buy . It mentions everything by name except stocks and bonds . It tells the percentage of nicotine in denicotinized cigarettes ; gives the lowdown on such American manifestations as halitosis , athlete 's foot , and life insurance ; announces which gasoline injures the inside of your motor , which watch keeps time , which proprietary antiseptic takes effect and which does n't ; and gives full advice on such matters as dental amalgam fillings and crow-repellents . All in all , it is a fascinating book of nonfiction , and makes us feel that just to be a consumer is to he something pretty dignified . All trademarked products are listed under A or B , recommended or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : thus $ means " expensive , " in : means " confidential information from technical experts , " m means " information from the American Medical Association . " Stuart Chase is the president of the club , and in a way the handbook is an attempt to keep up-to-date the information Mr. Chase brought to light some few years ago in his book " The Tragedy of Waste . " Besides the yearly handbook the club publishes bulletins now and then . It makes a great effort to maintain secrecy , succeeding probably about as well as our fraternity did . The most amusing items in the book are the incidental but meaty little notations : which two cars in the United States can accelerate faster than a Ford ; the happiness of a moth larva in the presence of certain patent moth-killers ; the reason for the numberless variations in life-insurance contracts ; the negligible value for the human being of certain soft drinks . Of course , being sworn to secrecy , we ca n't mention any names . In this age of unalloyed hokum , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that treats commodities realistically instead of romantically ; and we expect to save a lot of money by becoming a Wise Buyer . We do feel , however , that our club goes a little far on the subject of breakfast food . The handbook advises , as an economical substitute , washed wheat bought at a seed store , and adds , somewhat cryptically , that it 's a good idea to find out whether or not formaldehyde has been used in processing it . Then it goes on to describe how the whole grain can be soaked , cooked under pressure , and so forth . Even if we knew where there was a seed store , we shudder to think of the taxi fare going and coming , the possible doctor 's bills for formaldehyde poisoning , and our little kitchen with its pressure tanks and all . Somehow a box of patent puffed wheat seems so kind of handy . Identities A LITTLE girl answered the doorbell of her home in the Fifties one afternoon last week , and summoned her mother to deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minister collecting funds for a worthy cause . After he had been dismissed , the mother mildly berated her daughter for having told the gentleman she was at home . " But Mother dear , " said the girl , " I did n't know he was a minister ; I thought he was a bootlegger . " A Hundred WO N'T the ? V newsreel men be mad , though , when they find out that Mrs. Henrietta Dannenbaum and Mrs. Jeanette Loucheimer celebrated their hundredth birthday last Friday , without a cameraman anywhere around ? The ladies are twins , and were born when Andrew Jackson was President . Mrs. Loucheimer lives in New York , either with one of her children or at the Hotel Ambassador . Each has three or four children , in their seventies or thereabouts . Mrs. Dannenbaum lives in Philadelphia . Last week they did n't celebrate their birthday together , as they frequently do , because the weather was a bit sharp for travel . They just went on as usual , no fuss . Mrs. Loucheimer is staying at 995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great-grandmother . Thus the New York twin is a great-greatgrandmother . Our informant in this matter did n't know so much about the other twin , but she is at least a great and probably a great-great too . Neither of the ladies looks older than seventy , we were assured . Neither wears glasses , and they frequently write each other in a firm hand . " I hear , " wrote the New York lady to her sister last year , when they were only ninety-nine , " that you have n't been so well . I hope you 're not feeling your age . " The other wrote back indignantly that she was feeling fine . Mrs. Dannenbaum , of Philadelphia , spends her summers at Atlantic City , where she takes long daily strolls on the boardwalk . Three years ago she attended a performance of the musical show , " My Maryland , " but walked out on it . " I gut sick of crinoline dresses during the Civil War , " she said . Mrs. Loucheimer is just as active as her sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a companion , but is likely to dismiss them both and go off on her own . A year ago a grandniece saw her walking up Madison Avenue in a storm . She rushed up to her and asked her what-what , and where her maid was . Mrs. Loucheimer said that she had sent her away for the weekend , and that she herself was on her way to buy some sheer silk stockings she had seen advertised . Recently she made a talk over the radio - same religious crusade in which she was interested . She had a sore wrist a couple of years ago and walked to the doctor 's ; said she did n't mind the pain but it interfered with her mali-jongg-playing . Mrs. Loucheimer and Mrs , Dannenbaum still look almost exactly alike , we arc told . They are both vitally interested in national events , the more exciting and important ones . They do n't rend what Coolidge says . You 'd hardly expect that of ladies who had been through the sayings of all Presidents but six . O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . When the editors over there read the fifth installment of General Pershing 's recollections they crashed right into the fourth paragraph , one in which Pershing is quoting the King of England : " The Kaiser , God damn hint . . . . " Instantly a con-ference of everybody was called . All day they scowled at the strong words of George V. Obviously something would have to be done about it . The Times had never dealt in such lan-guage . Never had and never would , said some of the editors , Pershing or no Pershing . One or two thought the first soldier of our country ought to be allowed to use the words . Others said there was Something Bigger to think of . There were , they said , the traditions of the Times and , moreover , the German readers . What was the use in hurting Teutonic feelings twelve years after ? This went on all day , until just before dinner one of the more silent but stronger conferees arose . His jaw was set . His brow was heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ! If the King said this , we , the New York Times , can say this . " And , by whillikins , they did . Torn Thumb Yale Bowl YALE , it seems , has taken to studying babies , to try and discover whether or not people are the way they are because of being born that way . Dr. Arnold Gesell , head of the psychology clinic , thinks they pretty much are . We went to his movie last week at the New York Academy of Medicine , and observed the infants doing the little hereditary things that their characters dictate . The babies , or " subjects , " are photographed while in a bowl-shaped world of their own , the cameras recording the scene through peep-holes . Into this miniature Yale Bowl the child is put naked , strapped in a baby armchair . A nurse hands it test materials , while the cameras whir quietly and the Ph.D . ' s , peeping , make notes . For the information of parents , we can report that a normal child reaches vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a definite pass at it at twenty weeks , and swishes it around to beat the devil at thirty-four weeks . ( If your baby is a week behind schedule , do n't let it make you moody . ) Thousands of records have been made , Dr. Gesell explained in the talkie , to set up the development sequences that are comparable to our adult intelligence tests ? and they seem to show that children are horn with definite characteristics . Columbia scientists are also watching children closely these days , we learned at the meeting . The Child Development Research Laboratory has a lot of figures about a group of twenty twoyear-olds , whom they observed to see what was really going on in Toyland . On the whole science found the children living a rational life . Specifically , eighty-five per cent of their time is spent in non-social activities , five per cent in involuntary social contacts ( like taking an old college friend to lunch ) , eight per cent in voluntary social contacts , and two per cent in doing nothing-at all . Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty did n't laugh once dur ing the entire test ; but one , the speaker said solemnly , laughed nineteen per cent of the time . ( Up his sleeve , maybe . ) The thing that , as an employed father , interested us most acutely about these tests of progressive mental development was the reaction of infancs when in the presence of pencil and paper . The normal child of seven months , given pencil and paper , sees no relation between them . He wisely rumples the paper , or tears it slowly to pieces . But given , at the age of one , the same materials , the poor sprite , if normal , will make marks on the paper , try to write ; and in the baby brow will appear little wrinkles looking strangely like pain . Horses A CITIZEN with little to do fell to talking with a cop who has a heat in the Thirties , and as they conversed a mounted officer jogged by . " Would n't you like that job better ? " asked the citizen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On cold nights I can duck in somewhere and visit my friends , and when the sergeant comes along he thinks I 'm around the block pounding the pavements . " The cop looked after the retreating mounted roan . " Ja ever try to hide a horse ? " Speaking of horses , it seems that many which have outlived their usefulness are turned adrift in the streets by hard-hearted owners who find this simpler than paying a fee to have the animal taken away . Most of these strays end up in one of the several animal shelters around town , from which , if you should be interested , you can get an old horse gratis by promising it a good home . No. 7 Man WHETHER you be , ' V lieve what they say or not , somebody has to paint those big signboards in Broadway . Usually Mr. Gus Palmer does , because he is No. 1 staff artist of the General Outdoor Advertising Company , and the most outdoorsy artist alive . He painted the Camel Cigarette ladies with the seven-font foreheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corn Flakes kiddy with the forty-two-foot brow . We have found out , by the simple process of asking , how he does it . The original artist turns in a drawing about the size of a car card . This is then copied by Mr. Palmer or someone else who knows how to distort drawings so they look right when looked at from below . If they were not drawn out of proportion , the figures would look peanut-headed . Then this copy is ruled off into squares , paint is mixed in great paint pots , goodbyes are said , and Mr. Palmer and his associates go aloft . The wall or signboard is ruled off into a corresponding number of squares and Mr. Palmer breaks out his brushes and begins copying the picture square for square , starting at the top right and working across and down . This is where eye-work comes in . When one is on a scaffolding two feet away from a four-foot nose , the nose looks more like a destroyer than a nose . Mr. Palmer , taking thought , adds many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind and thinking it out as he paints . He copies it on the wall faultlessly . " You got to put personality into them , " he says , " as you go along . " He can paint a mammoth sign in one day . He worked for only three days on the biggest sign in ? the city , the Camel ad , forty by one hundred , down in Astor Place . He is certain he could copy Michelangelo 's figures in the Sistine Chapel in not more than a week and wonders what Michelangelo was doing all those four years . For his work Mr. Palmer gets twenty-seven dollars a day . Two hundred signs a year are his average . When the war was on , he taught camouflaging  --  which is just the opposite of advertising Camels . After the war , he returned to the scaffold . He says twenty years ago New York had bigger signs than it has now  --  more space . - - Today there are fewer than thirty large painted signs in Broadway . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world for the Babson Institute in Boston ; he had to lie on his stomach most of the time , ? reaching down , and it made his stomach tired as the dickens . What makes him maddest is not being allowed to sign his name to the paintings , along with the original artist 's signature . He also hates rain . The Merry Villagers ARATHER strict , elderly lady is still breathless over an experience she had while apartment-hunting in the Village . She had been looking for a place in a quiet street , and was shown into a large studio apartment which she thought delightful . " Everybody who has lived here has liked this place , " said the landlord . " The last people who had it were here two years , and they 'd be here yet if they had n't got married and moved to 4Vestchester. "
