There are two breeds of U. S. racehorses : Thoroughbred and Standardbred . The Thoroughbred , developed in England , races under saddle and runs at a horse 's natural gait , a gallop . The Standardbred , a U. S. product , races in harness and runs at a man-trained trot or pace. * For those U. S. citizens who remember the horse- &-buggy; days , no sport takes them back so fast as a trotting race , no sport event is more endearing than the Hambletonian , richest and most famed of the 25,000 or more harness races held in the U. S. every summer . <P> For the 14th running of the Hambletonian ( for three-year-old trotters ) , 40,000 harness-racing enthusiasts gathered last week in the tiny village of Goshen , N. Y. It was the year 's muggiest day . But the sweltering crowd-a hodge-podge of city slickers and country bumpkins-jostling into Good Time Park like a rush-hour subway crush , would not have traded places with the coolest sea bather . Up to the bookmakers they streamed , placed their bets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four races on the Hambletonian Day card . <P> For a century harness races have been started by a unique method called scoring : horses parade up the track in double file , turn and trot ( or pace ) down to the starting line in their lot-drawn post positions . Sometimes ten or 15 scores are required before the starter considers that they have all gone over the line " on their gait " ( without breaking stride ) - with the " pole " ( No. 1 ) horse nosing ahead . Many times seasoned drivers deliberately spoil the start in order to wear down less experienced drivers or the horse with the No. 1 position . <P> In the preliminary races on last week 's Hambletonian Day card , the horses were sent off by a new-fangled starting gate : ropes hanging down from a wire drawn high over the starting line . Drivers were permitted 15 seconds ( tolled off by a phonograph record ) to jockey for position and cross the line . Those who jumped the word " Go " were disqualified . <P> But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Ten times the ten horses went over the starting line , ten times were sent back . It was apparent that three drivers with bad scoring positions were trying to tire Gauntlet , the pole horse . On the eleventh score , the starter finally said " Go . " <P> All this skullduggery was waste motion . At the first turn , Doc Parshall , driving the favorite , Peter Astra ( 2:02 ) , whizzed by the field on the outside , saw his opening and took it . From then on it was just a breeze . Peter Astra finished the first heat* three lengths in front of second-place Gauntlet . The second heat was even more one-sided . Starting from the pole position because of his victory in the first heat , Peter Astra won by five lengths , took the Hambletonian Stake in two straight heats .
