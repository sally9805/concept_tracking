For eleven days , while scores of G-men and thousands of neighbors scoured lower Florida in vain , the dead body of James Bailey ( " Skeegie " ) Cash Jr. , 5 , lay in a palmetto thicket not a mile from his home in Princeton , Fla . Heavy rains and scorching sun left the body unrecognizable except for the white- &-rose; pajamas Skeegie wore when someone took him from his crib ( TIME , June 13 ) . But not even a sharp-eyed buzzard found the remains , till late one night last week , a surgeon , a State prosecutor and twelve G-men led by Chief John Edgar Hoover came crashing through the bush with flashlights . <P> Guiding them was Franklin Pierce McCall , 21 , a hollow-eyed " cracker , " part-time road worker , truck driver and tomato packer , son of a Nazarene preacher . He and his wife used to lodge with Skeegie Cash 's parents . He knew the child well , and knew how much money James Bailey Cash , the father , had in the bank-just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCall had professed great sympathy for the bereaved parents , had joined the first searching parties . But Mr. Cash 's brother and sister-in-law grew suspicious of him when : 1 ) he " found " one of the ransom notes under Brother Cash 's store door , 2 ) he remarked how easy it would be to break into their house . They told Sheriff Coleman , who trapped McCall in a fake alibi and turned him over to the G-men . Not for a week did he " crack " under their questioning . <P> McCall also helped the G-men find the ransom money . All but $5 of the $10,000 was recovered . McCall admitted taking that , but not the child . <P> For two days more he tried to implicate others , then " cracked " again . He had done the whole thing , all alone , to " get things " for his wife . But he had not murdered the child ; that was accidental , he said . Skeegie " must have smothered " while he was quieting him with handkerchiefs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miami 's skyscraper jail to prevent his lynching by an angry Miami mob .
