An anonymous telephone tip sent police scurrying to the tightly-barred garage operated by one Meyer Luckman in Brooklyn the night of March 3 , 1935 . Inside , stuffed in a bloody canvas bag in the rear compartment of a Ford coup , they found the warm , freshly-strangled body of Meyer Luckman 's brother-in-law and bookkeeper . Samuel Drukman . Caught in the garage , with blood on hands and clothes , were three men : Meyer Luckman , a nephew Harry Luckman , and an ex-convict employe named Fred Hull . <P> On May 10 a Kings County grand jury failed to indict the three for murder . Nine months later , after the non-indictment had caused an election scandal , New York 's Governor Herbert Lehman ordered a special grand jury investigation . Out of a sensational welter of charges of racketeering , political corruption , jury-tampering &; bribery came murder indictments against the Luckmans and Hull . On Feb. 20 , 1936 all were convicted of second degree murder , sentenced to prison for 20 years to life . Because Hull 's lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court during the first days of the trial , he decided to appeal for a new trial that he hoped might give him freedom . Last May it was granted . Last week it ended . The jury found Hull guilty of first degree murder . The conviction carried a mandatory sentence of death . <P> Said Lawyer Solovei , " I guarantee the reversal of this conviction . If I do n't , I 'll tear my sheepskin into a million pieces and never practice again and you can print that ! " Fred Hull . 53 , who had made the greatest gamble a man can make - and lost-said nothing . He is scheduled to die in the electric chair at Sing Sing the week of Sept. 5.
