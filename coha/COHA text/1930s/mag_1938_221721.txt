No daredevil is the mystic No. 1 Nazi , but the virile No. 2 Nazi who swooped down upon German Austria last week is definitely the Fatherland 's Daredevil No. 1. * <P> Arriving in Vienna to enjoy his personal triumph , twelve days after Hitler 's , Feldmarschall Gring keynoted : " Other nations probably do n't like us. but they respect us - BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG ! " <P> Inviting his own assassination , Daredevil No. 1 deliberately chose to enter Vienna standing upright in an open car which first traversed the Jewish and radical labor quarters . Any resident in one of these dingy blocks of flats could with certainty have shot the burly Feldmarschall who rode along beaming , waving his gold-starred baton at Viennese who , whatever their private opinions , screamed at the tops of their voices : " Hermann ! Hermann ! Our Hermann ! " <P> Three thousand benches were lugged into the disused Northwest Railway Station , and soon 25,000 people jammed this impromptu auditorium , bellowing guttural cheers as Orator Gring in ruthless fashion rammed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunted , by referring to the head of the House of Habsburg as " This comic boy , Archduke Otto ! " ( guffaws ) Grimly Gring warned : " If Legitimism+continues , it will be treated as high treason , regardless of whether the charge strikes at an archduke or a worker ! " Meanwhile last week , put under Nazi lock &; key near Salzburg was the first former royal and imperial highness to be arrested , 65-year-old Archduke Josef Ferdinand , husband of the young and comely former Gertrude Tomanek-Beyerfels and father of two handsome infants . <P> Orator Gring , who was wearing for this popular occasion scarcely any of his medals , and these few on the brown shirt of a simple Storm Trooper , roared that " the courts " will deal with former Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg because he " criminally " ordered a " fake plebiscite , " later canceled on the demand of Hitler ( TIME , March 21 ) . " None of Schuschnigg 's supporters died for their convictions ! " jeered Daredevil Gring . " But some of them fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was swept away and our troops marched in as brothers of a liberated people . " Since there were undoubtedly hundreds , probably thousands of former supporters of Kurt von Schuschnigg in the throng of 25,000 , their cheers were not entirely without significance . <P> The Teutonic throng burst into a wild ovation at the portion of the speech devoted to Jews . In very coarse language a pledge was given by the Feldmarschall that within three years Vienna will be a city composed exclusively of Aryans . <P> Since some 95% of the Austrian people are Catholics , and since Orator Gring 's serious purpose in Vienna was to persuade all Austrians to vote " Ja " on April 10 , * the most conciliatory part of the speech was addressed to the Church . " We have no desire to destroy religion , " said Hermann Wilhelm Gring . " In Germany we have not destroyed the Church but only the clerical politicians . "
