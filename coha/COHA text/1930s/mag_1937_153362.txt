Marked was the vigor last week of the Knickerbocker aristocracy of Manhattan in observing the joyous marriage day of Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Juliana of The Netherlands . <P> The newsorgan of most of these aristocrats is the New York Herald Tribune . Warmly it editorialized : " There is no country in Europe where Americans feel more thoroughly at home than Holland . . . . The language barrier matters little amid such hearty friendliness and genuineness of character . . . . This " New York was a Dutch colony before it was British . The Dutch strain is still strong in the city and the State . As for the pilgrims of New England , they found their first refuge in Holland , the land of toleration and it was from the port of the City of Leyden- where Princess Juliana studied law-that the ship Speedwell with her historic list of passengers set sail for Southampton , where the Mayflower awaited them . . . . Lucky are the people who can look back to such a history of toleration and strength as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas pealed for Juliana . Aboard the Dutch liner Statendam in Manhattan harbor , Knickerbocker notables toasted her name and " the truly Dutch name of President Roosevelt " at an eleven-course Dutch dinner . At the Netherlands Club in Gramercy Park , the Royal Dutch wedding caused even the most staid members to down thimbleful after thimbleful of scorching Holland gin . <P> Journalistically the story was that of Cinderella reversed . A Crown Princess whose reigning mother is probably Europe 's wealthiest woman was about to take as her Prince Consort a pleasant young German of excellent but impecunious family who might well be called Prince Cinderellus . From the moment of his marriage , Prince Bernhard zu Lippe-Biesterfeld receives a Civil List from the Dutch Treasury of 200,000 florins yearly ( $109,500 ) . <P> " Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! " More than a million people , princely and middle class , proletarian and peasant , swarmed into The Hague last week-so many that all its hotels and lodging houses could not begin to hold them . Restaurants and cafes received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear around the clock . Ten thousand Netherlands soldiers had not so much the job of keeping order as of making sure that no gin-sipping celebrant fell into one of The Hague 's canals , and none did . Piping hot Dutch chocolate , served from Army field kitchens with cake , kept the 10,000 soldiers warm , and grinning Dutch sergeants gave their men pocketfuls of sugar candy . <P> Prince Bernhard zu Lippe-Biesterfeld , at the time his engagement to Crown Princess Juliana was announced ( TIME , Sept. 14 ) , was a minor salaried employe of the great German chemical trust I. G. Farben-industrie Aktiengesellschaft , and a Nazi Storm Trooper . As the future Prince Consort of The Netherlands he became a naturalized Dutch subject and swore allegiance to his future mother-in-law Queen Wilhelmina ( TIME , Jan. 4 ) . This made no difference to Nazi Party fanatics who insist , " Once a German always a German ! " Last week rampant Nazis were whooping against the ex-German and ex-Nazi bridegroom in almost every German newspaper .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
