txt Official admission by White House attaches tonight that President Hoover had entertained at dinner on Sunday Richard Whitney , president of the New York Stock Exchange , and Allen L. Lindley , vice president of the Exchange led to rumors here ( that the President had conferred with the financiers on possible measures for curbing certain short-selling tactics that have kept the market in an unsettled condition . Another version of the reason for the conference was that Mr. Whitney and Mr. Lindley wished to get the President 's suggestions for possible steps to improve the market . Weight was lent to this theory by the fact that the White House stated the conference was arranged at Mr. Whitney 's request . From the White House there came no details to establish definitely that Mr. Hoover had actually discussed the short-selling problem with the officials of the Exchange . The attach ? s ' statement merely revealed that he had entertained them Sunday and talked with them after dinner . The rumors concerning short selling were based on persistent reports that Mr. Hoover frowned on the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the general economic unrest . Another fact that seemed to add strength to the rumor W &S; that Mr. Whitney 's Sunday night visit to Washington came only two days after his speech in Chicago in which he defended " legitimate " short selling although he decried the practice of short selling deliberately intended to force down security values . When Mr. Hoover left the White House on Saturday for his Rapidan camp it was said that he would return on Sunday in time to keep an engagement . Mr. Whitney , it was said at the White House , visited Washington en route from Chicago to New York on Sunday and made the request to see the President . He was described as being an old friend , who had served with Mr. Hoover in the Federal Food Administration in the World War . It was not explained how Mr. Lindley came to be present . While officials here pointed out that , even if the President had been informed of the details of short-selling practice , the government had little ability to correct or change the situation under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Department of Justice has been investigating the matter on the quiet . There has been no intimation in official circles , however , that the government intends to interfere with the Stock Exchange . The only group with the power to curb short selling by individuals or concerns seeking to cause a drop in security values to their own advantage , it was pointed out , are the officials of the Stock Exchange , and there were intimations in one impor- tant quarter here that some quiet investigation of short selling has been carried on by them . Justice Official Sees No Inquiry . WASHINGTON , Oct. 14 ( M. ? John Lord O'Brian , an Assistant Attorney General , said tonight he had never heard of any plans for the Department of Justice to investigate the stock market . " We have no jurisdiction over the stock market , " Mr. O'Brian said . " I know nothing of any investigation into it being planned . " Other persons in the department expressed the same opinion , but said that if such a move was contemplated by Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Mitchell could not be reached tonight . Lindley Calls Visit Personal . Allen Ledyard Lindley , senior partner of Lindley &; Co. of 52 Broadway and vice president of the New York Stock Exchange , last night described his visit to President Hoover with Richard Whitney , president of the Exchange , as " a personal visit , " saying " Mr. Whitney is a great friend of the President , having served under him . " Mr. Whitney , during the war , was with the United States Food Administration . Asked whether there had been any discussion of the present stock market situation or of short selling , Mr. Lindley replied : " We spoke about everything in general . It was a delightful evening . " When told of the reports in Washington that the Department of Justice had been investigating short selling , he . said , " I have heard nothing about that . " Mr. Whitney could not be reached last night , but it was recalled here that in a speech made before the Chicago Chamber of Commerce last Friday he sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintaining that its effect on security values had been exaggerated . He added , however , that the Stock Exchange did not sanction short selling aimed at driving down values artificially , and then went on to say : " You may fairly ask why we do not take action to prevent it . The answer is that the Exchange is convinced that normal short selling is an essential part of a free market in securities . The prohibition of short selling , which might result in the destruction of the market , is too high a price to pay for the elimination of the few who abuse this legitimate practice . " Rumors have been current in Wall Street for several days that the suggestion had been made by officials in Washington that short selling designed to demoralize the stock market should be discouraged by the Stock Exchange . While the Stock Exchange has indicated its opposition to intermittent raiding of the market by bear operators , it was said last night by an important official of the Exchange that no effort would be made to stop ordinary short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous effects , this official asserted . He cited the adverse results of such a ban several years ago when it was attempted on the Berlin Boerse . In view of this experiment , and the known opposition toward stopping legitimate short selling , it is believed to be unlikely that any measures aside from those already adopted by the Exchange will be taken here . Stocks for Lending Scarce . With ten issues commanding a premium and several hundred others lending flat , the stock loan market presented yesterday a condition of stringency which might , in ordinary circumstances , have suggested the existence of a " technical corner " in a large part of the active list of the New York Stock Exchange . This situation , without precedent in years , was said to be due largely to a reluctance on the part of Stock Exchange houses to lend stocks because of the fear that they might in doing so be encouraging " improper short sales , " disapproval of which has been indicated by the Exchange authorities . Also , it was pointed out , the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive professional selling . For the first time within memory United States Steel common lent yesterday at a premium . The rate , 1-256 , although trifling , held important significance for Wall Street . Steel common long has been perhaps the easiest to borrow of all Stocks . Because of this fact it has been a favorite with short sellers . Such a thing as a tight loan situation in this stock has rarely been known . Ordinarily lenders of the stock are only too glad to pay the current rates of interest on the amount of money which the borrowers are compelled to deposit . Yesterday , however , the stock was so scarce that the borrowers gladly paid the premium and at the same time gave the lenders the free use of a sum of money equivalent to the market value of the stock . The dearth of stock has been apparent for some days , but it became more pronounced yesterday . The " stock loan crowd , " which assembles lat the Stock Exchange after the close of the market every day except Friday , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scene was described as an unusual one , reflecting more interest in the stock loan market than has been shown in some years . Reasons for the Scarcity . The condition in the stock loan market was said to be largely artificial . Many houses which are the largest holders of stocks in the financial district have been refusing for some days to lend their securities to complete deliveries on short commitments because they did not wish to be parties to transactions which might be disapproved by the Stock Exchange . In other words , these houses have taken the position that , since the Exchange has indicated its disapproval of " bear raid-I ing , " they prefer not to have their securities used in any transaction which may have been a part of such " raids . " A considerable number of houses , it was said yesterday , are refusing to lend stocks on any terms , . although they have freely lent in the past . The picture now presented is of an extreme scarcity of stocks for lending purposes , although there is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation there is an unusually active demand for stocks at this time , growing out ' I of the large short interest that has been built up . The short account is said to be larger than it has been at any time this year . The stocks , in addition to United States Steel , which were lending at a premium yesterday and the premiums were : North American , 1-32 ; American Can , 1-256 ; Westinghouse Electric , 1-64 ; American Water Works , 1-32 ; Wheeling &; Lake Erie common , 1-32 ; Wheeling &; Lake Erie preferred , 1-16 ; Illinois Central , 1-16 ; Coca Cola , 1-256 , and Wabash , 1-250 . Among the active issues that were lending flat were Allied Chemical , American International , American Locomotive , American Telephone and Telegraph , Columbia Gas , Continental Can , Chrysler , Consolidated Gas , Drug , Inc. , Eastman Kodak , Erie , Electric Auto-Lite , Fox , Gillette , Goodyear , General Electric , General Motors , International Harvester , International Nickel , Houston Oil , Johns-Manville , Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio , Republic Steel , Standard of New Jersey and Standard Gas . All of these stocks , as well as the others which were lending flat , are ordinarily in supply in the stock loan market . The stock loan market had little , if any , relation to the day 's movements on the Stock Exchange . The early weakness may have represented some extension of the short account , although brokers said that most of the selling was done by holders of actual securities who , voluntarily or otherwise , proceeded to liquidate . The short interest , these brokers said , probably was reduced sharply when the stock market rallied sharply in the afternoon , as there were indications of active covering by shorts . The afternoon rally was also the result , it seemed , of a fresh investment demand , important interests having indicated that they were finding stocks attractive at the levels to which they had been reduced . The extent of the recovery is suggested by the fact that the average price of fifty representative issues showed a net gain of $2.03 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had touched a low of $164.47 , or only 4 cents above the extreme low to which the averages fell on Nov. 13 of last year . United States Steel , after touching the lowest level of the year at 1444 , led the rally , but lost some of its gains in the last five minutes of trading , and closed at 148% , unchanged from the close Saturday . There were sharp gains in other stocks , however . Allied Chemical was up 8% points on the day , American Can , 2% ; American Telephone and Telegraph , 3% ; Eastman Kodak , 6 ; Consolidated Gas , 3 ; Columbian Carbon , 4 ; Western Union , 6% ; Philad phia Company , 10 ; Fox Film A , 3 , and General Theatre Equipment , 5% . Transactions on the Stock Exchange totaled 3,389,030 shares ,
