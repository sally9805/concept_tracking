In December 1787 , H. M. S. Bounty , a British armed transport commanded by a brutal martinet named William Bligh , set sail from Spithead , England , for Tahiti , from which it was to take breadfruit plants to the West Indies . After leaving Tahiti two-thirds of the crew , led by the first officer , mutinied and abandoned Bligh and 18 of his supporters in a small boat equipped with oars and sail . Bligh and his companions won through to Kupang after 43 nightmarish days . Meantime the mutineers returned to Tahiti , whence nine of them set out again with a Tahitian princess for the first officer , eleven other native women and six native men . On Pitcairn Island , a tiny , wooded , steep , craggy scrap of land in the South Pacific , they beached and burned the Bounty , hoped they were safe from reprisal . They were not safe from one another . Unbridled drinking and mating , suicides , a war between natives and whites , between women and men , left alive one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the little colony turned over a new leaf and feared God . They were found by a New Bedford whaler in 1808 , were not molested . By 1855 the colony numbered 175 souls . Fearing a water shortage , they persuaded the British Government to move them to a larger island . A few were unhappy there and returned to Pitcairn . There they and their descendants have lived in peace ever since. * <P> Last December the tawny , friendly islanders received the longest visit ( ten days ) from a scientist that any of them could remember . The visitor was Harry Lionel Shapiro , 32-year-old anthropologist of Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History . Dr. Shapiro went to Pitcairn not as a nostalgic historian and romancer of the sea but as a student of what he called a ' ' laboratory experiment " - the development by cross-breeding of a new type of human from precisely traceable origins . In the ' ' Pitcairn Island Register " he found a record of births and deaths and he was able to obtain vital statistics concerning newcomers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preponderance of European inheritance over the Tahitian and more occidental features are discernible than those of the South Sea native , but in appearance the islanders range through all gradations between European and Tahitian . No pure types of either remain and the statistical chance of such a " throwback ' ' is extremely remote . Dr. Shapiro prepared hereditary charts from which he plans to show the operation of the laws of genetics on Pitcairn-the same laws by which geneticists predict and produce nearly 700 mutations in the fruit fly . <P> " Inbreeding in this instance , " said he , back in Manhattan last week , " although extremely close , has not led to degeneracy as it is usually supposed to do . Inbreeding in a stock which has latent defects will naturally intensify those traits . I ca n't say that race mixture in this case has been harmful . . . . The people are superior physically and are also a hardworking , intelligent lot . In psychology and behavior they are predominantly British . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
