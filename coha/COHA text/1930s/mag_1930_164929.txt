Last year Albert Moore Reese , zoologist at West Virginia State University , stopped thinking so much about alligators , on which he is an authority , and turned his attention to owls . His interest began when citizens of Morgantown , W. Va . complained about being attacked by owls . Dr. Reese inquired hither &; yon , asked people who had had owl encounters to tell him all about their experiences . From all over the U. S. came letters . Last fortnight he published some of his data in Science ( weekly ) . <P> Most of the attacks were made at dusk or on moonlight nights . Several correspondents wrote that the birds had swooped close to their heads , had only snapped their beaks before darting away . The majority of victims , however , had actually been struck with beak or claws . Frequently the skin was painfully lacerated . One correspondent wrote that he knew a lumberjack who had suffered from a clawed neck for several months . In Louisiana , a Negro complained that an owl had gouged his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar antipathy for policemen , made frequent passes at their blue-capped heads . <P> Varied were the reasons advanced . Many people noted a nest in the neighborhood , agreed that the attacking owl probably was protecting fledglings . Others suggested that owls may mistake the hairy human head for a fat , slow-moving rat .
