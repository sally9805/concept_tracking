With tears in their eyes , 250 Poles and Italians gathered at Rome 's railroad station to welcome a husky , crop-haired churchman . He was Auguste Cardinal Hlond , Archbishop of Gniezno and Poznan , Primate of shattered Poland . Silesian-born , twelve years ago the youngest Cardinal ( 46 ) in the Church , he had served his ill-fated country well . He fought Fascism as well as Communism , sought to ease the lot of Polish workers , voluntarily renounced the taxes which had supported the Polish Church . Last May Cardinal Hlond and his hierarchy rallied Poland 's faithful with a call to arms , to repulse the " neopaganism of our neighbor , " Germany , as once they had fought the " Godless Communism " of another neighbor , Russia . <P> Last week Cardinal Hlond , on the Vatican radio , broadcast a message in Polish to his people . He exhorted them " to be calm and united , to work in harmony and to pursue an intense religious life . " He concluded : " Such great suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but find from a merciful God the compensation we all invoke-the resurrection of the land of our forefathers . " <P> Two days later the Cardinal , the Polish Ambassador to the Vatican , and some 200 other Poles in Rome journeyed out to Castel Gandolfo . Pope Pius XII had summoned them to his summer palace for an audience . Cardinal Hlond took his place by the side of the gaunt Holy Father , who began sadly to speak in French of Poland 's lot . The Pope 's voice broke when he mentioned " this war , from which all of our efforts so persistently and ardently , but nevertheless futilely , sought to preserve Europe . " Twice the Holy Father 's dark , tired eyes flooded with tears , which he wiped away . His auditors sobbed aloud at such passages as this : " Poland has already been overrun by many disasters , but there also have been shining victories . . . . Poland is faithful to the Faith of Christ , and for that reason we are sure that you will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Pius XII gave the Poles his blessing , prayed : " May Christ , who wept over the death of Lazarus and over the ruin of His fatherland , gather and some day compensate you for the tears which you spill over your dead and over that Poland which does not want to die . " The Pope stepped down from his dais , stood rapt as the Poles sang the hymn of their fathers , May God Protect Poland . Weeping , the 200 exiles filed out .
