txt Rowdyism in the Park . To the Editor of The New York Times : I was an interested spectator on Sunday of the baseball game played on the old reservoir diamond and got a great kick out of it . However , I noticed an absence of policemen to enforce decorum . During demonstrations of joy or chagrin some rooters showed a rowdy spirit and used vile names in " razzing " the players or umpires to the mortification of ladies and children within hearing . Furthermore , some of this class perched upon an adjacent wall pelted the onlookers with small stones . If we advocates of this movement for clean sport on public grounds are to continue to back up the action of the Park Commissioner it will be necessary for proper police protection to be accorded both the players and fans . CENTRAL PARK WEST . New York , May 29 , 1933.
