It is fantastic for a nation proclaiming the lofty ideals of America to exhibit a criminal record worse than that of any other civilized country . Other nations in recent years have been curbing crime . . . . <P> Responsibility for the existing conditions rests with the homes , schools , churches , communities and the legal profession . The fault is not with the police and prisons so much as with us , the people . . . . <P> Henry Goddard Leach , 54 , A. B. A. M. Ph . D. , Commander of the North Star ( Sweden ) , Knight of St. Olav ( Norway ) , Knight of Falcon ( Iceland ) , and president of the American-Scandinavian Foundation , read over what he had written for the next issue of his Forum and found it good . It would make a whacking lead editorial . <P> After okaying the galley proof , Editor Leach scribbled a headline : " The Revolt Against Crime . " He clapped a hat over his thinning brown hair , slipped into a raincoat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and joined the late afternoon crowds hurrying along Manhattan 's Lexington Avenue . There was plenty of time for his customary brisk jaunt through Central Park before dinner . <P> Completing the traditional " once around the reservoir , " Editor Leach bounced along the West Drive toward a Park exit , thinking of the anti-Crime indignation he hoped to arouse . Suddenly two men jumped from the shrubbery into his path . One pinioned Editor Leach 's arms , forced him to his knees . The other mercilessly drove his fists again &again; into Editor Leach 's face , closed both his eyes . The ruffians took Editor Leach 's wallet , containing $40 , and his gold watch , chain &; penknife which his wife had given him before they were married . By the time the editor recovered sight &; senses his attackers had vanished . But he found a small address book which later led to the arrest of one of the hold-up men . <P> Home from the hospital , with a trained nurse at his bedside , Editor Leach felt cheerful enough to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public and I have not been after the police enough to have the Park properly protected . " <P> What disappointed Editor Leach as much as anything was the fact that he could not attend that night 's meeting of the Poetry Society of America . He was to have been inaugurated president .
