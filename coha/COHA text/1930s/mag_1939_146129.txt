At most U. S. racetracks , six out of seven races are claiming races . Started primarily for the purpose of equalizing competition among second-rate horses , claiming races , in which any starter may be bought for a sum fixed before the race , have become a major medium of horse trading . Every year some 2,500 horses and $4,000,000 change hands in claiming races on reputable U. S. tracks . Bulk of the traders are gyp ( for gypsy ) horsemen , + migratory trainer-owners who race thoroughbreds for profit rather than sport . <P> Like most commercial enterprises , the keystone of the horse-racing business is astuteness and luck . A smart gyp ( or halterman ) picks up a likely horse cheap , tries to put him in shape to win a few purses before he is claimed . Entry fees in claiming races are low , average $10 ; purses range from $500 to $1,200 . Sometimes a halterman develops a plater into a first-class racer , risks the $200 or more entry fee to put him in a rich stake or handicap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fool rival horsemen into claiming a plater that is about to fall apart . Last week at New York 's Jamaica Racetrack , grizzled Milo Shields , a seasoned halterman , entered a two-year-old gelding named Staff Sergeant in a $1,500 claiming race. ** Staff Sergeant had not won a race in five starts . As the field pounded into the stretch , Owner Shields ' heart sank . Staff Sergeant , running in third place , suddenly crumpled up , dead . <P> Resigned to his bad luck , Milo Shields ambled over to the Racing Secretary 's office . There he found that one William Wick had put in a claim for Staff Sergeant . According to the peculiar rules of claiming races , Seller Shields received the $1,500 . Buyer Wick received the carcass-and a bill for $25 to have it removed . <P> <P> + Not a deprecatory title . **Classifications of claiming races range from $1,000 to $5,000 . A $1.500 claiming race means that any horse which leaves the post may be claimed for $1.500 . Claims must be made in writing and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before post time . If more than one claim is in the box lots are drawn to determine the buyer . Any prize money a claimed horse may win in the race goes to the owner who started him , not the new owner .
