Proud would Samuel Brearley have been if he could have returned to Earth last week for a banquet at Manhattan 's Hotel Astor . Proud were the 1,000 handsome , well-dressed people who gathered there to celebrate the 50th birthday of the famed Manhattan girls ' school which he started in a small brownstone house on East 45th Street . They were proud that Brearley had attracted the daughters of Cleveland H. Dodge , Herbert L. Satterlee , Oswald Garrison Villard , Henry Fairfield Osborn , Felix M. Warburg , Owen D. Young . They were proud that Brearley had schooled such distinguished personages as Dean Virginia Gildersleeve of Barnard , Mrs. Charles Carey Rumsey , Sculptress Malvina Hoffman , Actresses Michael Strange and Hope Williams , Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney . <P> With many another college president on hand to listen , Smith 's urbane William Allan Neilson urged the cultivation of feeling and imagination as Education 's next step . " The incuriousness of the girl of college age , " declared he , " is one of the most appalling things I know of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proudly told how Brearley was developing feeling and imagination among its girls through sculpturing , dramatics , woodworking , painting . Five hours passed and the banqueters went home convinced more firmly than ever that in Brearley 's the girls ' private school had reached its zenith . <P> Socialite but not smart is Brearley School . It has never wanted to be smart . The fathers who persuaded Samuel Brearley of Harvard and Balliol to found it were disgusted with the genteel finishing schools of the 1880s . They wanted their daughters to be as well prepared as their sons for college . When Founder Brearley died in 1886 they got for headmaster , James G. Croswell , an old-school classicist from Harvard . In 28 years he set a scholarly tone which Brearley has never lost . In the select sisterhood of Manhattan 's half-dozen famed private schools for girls it retains a first-rank reputation for scholarship . <P> In 1912 Brearley moved to a new home on Park Avenue at 61st Street . Then began the parade of Brearley fathers marching their Brearley daughters to school before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought pretentious . The parade stopped in 1929 when Brearley built and moved again , this time to a sumptuous ten-story structure overlooking the East River at 83rd Street . <P> Tuition fees are above the Manhattan sisterhood 's average . Upped $100 in 1928 and another $100 in 1930 , they now run from $400 for the preliminary school to $800 for the six upper classes . But of this year 's 412 students , 52 are on scholarships , against nine in 1929 . <P> Appointed Brearley 's headmistress in 1930 was Millicent Carey , onetime English professor and acting dean at Bryn Mawr . Young , personable , friendly , moderately progressive , Headmistress Carey increased her popularity with students in 1932 by marrying able Pediatrician Rustin McIntosh , sent it sky-high last year when she bore twin boys .
