Twenty-five years ago , the Manhattan drama season always seemed to open on Labor Day , with the late John Drew descending a grand staircase of the Empire Theatre in something by Arthur Wing Pinero . No such impressive starting gun has ever inspired the art world , but for the past two years a modest parallel has existed in the annual shows of Government-inspired art held in Manhattan early in September . At these exhibitions taxpayers are given some idea of what unemployed artists and others on WPA rolls are producing for their money . <P> Last week 's show was held on the impressive premises of the Museum of Modern Art , embellished with one of the elaborately illustrated catalogs for which this Rockefeller-supported museum is famed . Limited to work paid for by the Federal Government and produced during 1935-36 exhibits by 171 artists were presented . <P> As usual , the mass of the exhibits were exercises in mediocrity . Such artists as Sculptor Concetta Scaravaglione , Muralist James Michael Newell , Stuart Davis , Marsden Hartley , Yasuo Kuniyoshi , Aaron Bohrod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , by contrast , superb . An innovation was a new department entitled Index of American <P> Design . Its purpose is to employ artist-draughtsmen to visit collections of U. S. antiquities , make careful drawings of furniture , chests , ironware , pottery , costumes , etc. , for distribution to schools and colleges . As last year , a sizeable section was set apart for the work of children in state-supported institutions . Some of their output , particularly the sculpture , was better than that of the adults . Outstanding were a plaster head of a miner by 15-year-old Mike Mosco ; a stone buffalo by 11-year-old Antony de Paolo , who was run over and killed by an automobile few weeks ago , and a watercolor of a vixenish young lady in a little veil , painted by 10-year-old Donald Liguore of the Boys ' Welcome Home and entitled Going to Town . <P> Discovery of the year was a 28-year-old Spanish-American from Taos , N. Mex. named Patrocino Barela , with an instinctive talent for wood carving . He presented a number of bultos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single block of wood . To the most ambitious of these , a 14-in. stump of native pine carved into simplified interlocking trees and figures representing the Hope or Four Stages of Man , Whittler Barela appended his own explanation : <P> " Man is born and created by laws of nature , so he born all by himself and then he hope for that hope he has been waiting , and then comes Number 2 , which means it is a son which has been reproduced by him and it only half the man he should be , but then he grown up to a man and that signifies Number 3 . Numbers 2 and 3 make a complete man and he grows up like the tree that is by his side- large and strong in life , full of happiness and full of hope . But then comes Number 4-that man is growing older , he has gone through life , he has worked and struggled , now he is old , tiresome , and weak . Same way with the tree by his side . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life ; when he is boy and when he is a young man , and then middle man , and then an old man , and those have been my ideas to carve a Bulto so as to represent the life of man in these carvings .
