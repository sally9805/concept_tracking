The Week WITHOWITHOUT analyzing the President 's message UT to Congress in detail , it is possible to describe its main tendency . As is his habit , he speaks with the utmost satisfaction of our supposedly individualistic economic system , and even with some satisfaction concerning the depression which it has brought about . From this depression we have learned something . But what we have learned , according to Mr. Hoover , is just what he believed before it occurred . The specific measures which he recommends to deal with depression ( our comments on which are implied in the editorial in this issue , " What Congress Might Do " ) are carefully guarded against inaugurating permanent changes . The recommended tax increases and the governmental credit agency are automatically to pass out of existence in two years . The basic assumption behind his policy is that our economic arrangements are really all right ; the only trouble is temporary lack of confidence . The aim is to restore confidence ? to use political agencies to rescue business from the mire into which it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave it alone so that it may repeat the performance all over again . AND so the government has n't fallen after all . The old ladies in New Haven and Columbus who trembled every time a truck went rumbling past their windows , fearing that it carried the diabolical hunger marchers bent on overthrowing our Constitution , may settle back to their knitting reassured . The hunger marchers ? to the number of 1,619 by . the accepted count ? arrived in Washington ; they paraded between the Capitol and the White House by the longest route that the efficient police could lay out ; they were received by the President 's third or fourth assistant secretary ? and Congress is still in session , and the Potomac still flows to the sea . What shall we say of the whole affair ? The national hunger march bears little resemblance to such upheavals of the past as Shay 's Rebellion , or the Whiskey Rebellion , or the draft riots of the Civil War . It suggests the coming of Coxey 's Army on May 1 , 1894 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irredeemable paper " in order to provide for public works . The hunger march was much better organized ? indeed , it seems to us that many capitalistic organizations could profit by studying the methods of the Workers ' International Relief ? but it was less of a mass movement . To arouse the mass of the unemployed is a task that seems beyond the power of the Communists , or in fact of any party or movement whatsoever . Social workers report that the psychology of the unemployed is most often that of the defeated and demoralized , without courage to speak in their own defense . The Communists have the right to speak for them as long as nobody else does so . WE ARE glad to have from Dr. Charles A. Beard , who knows Japan and its government intimately , confirmation of our belief that the Japanese military can not be controlled by the civilian government , and that its ambitions are overweening . ( Dr. Beard 's letter may be found on page 137 of this issue . ) This means that all negotiations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and whether under the Covenant or the Kellogg-Briand Pact or the Nine-Power Pacific Treaty , are so many waste motions , except for purposes of the record . The Japanese military mind is just like the military mind anywhere , and as long as the army is supreme it will go on advancing until it is stopped by some superior force or has gained its objective . The civilian government can merely create diversions and make excuses for what the army does . In spite of all promises , the Japanese may have occupied Chinchow by the time this issue reaches our readers . If so , the incident will be merely a repetition of all the others which have occurred since the crisis began . It goes without saying that no Occidental nation will stop Japan by force of arms . That being the case , we might as well register our disapproval , cease attempts to negotiate a settlement and sit tight until the military policy brings its inevitable economic reaction to the Japanese people . For there are two things the army can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the prosperity which makes larger expenditures possible . THE tears which Mayor Walker shed in behalf of Tom Mooney have by this time mingled with the Pacific , the tumult and publicity have sagged off to a dead calm , while any hope that Mooney will be freed in the immediate future seems to have receded beyond range of the naked eye . Governor Rolph , who in the first exalted moments of the crusade , when bands were playing and flashlights popping on every side , promised an early decision and seemed ready to grant a pardon , now gives every evidence of falling back upon the stalling tactics of his predecessors . He announces that at some indefinite time within the next three months he will review the case with his advisers , will hear the arguments of those opposing a pardon and will decide the appeal for pardon on its own merits . In other words , Mayor Walker 's California crusade , creditable as it was to his goodness of heart , seems only to have intensified the fanaticism of Mooney 's opponents and to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career by freeing Mooney than he was a month ago . Meanwhile the case itself has settled even deeper into that bog of class prejudice and intolerance where it has remained for the past fifteen years . WHAT amounts to a post-mortem over our recently deceased prosperity is being held by Senator La Follette 's subcommittee on manufactures , which is preparing to introduce into Congress a measure for a national economic council . One by one the leaders of frenzied finance have been giving their fascinating testimony before this committee . The latest of them , Charles E. Mitchell , head of the National City Bank , has announced himself as opposed to control by an economic council , and pessimistic on all such plans . But this erstwhile optimist now willingly confesses that during the epoch-making days of 1928 and 1929 the bankers were " too liberal " in their credit policy . When they saw how unlimited was the " public appetite " for mergers , // for foreign loans , for securities of all types , they outdid each other in filling this demand . Even Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflationary tendency might have helped in good measure . " There were warnings aplenty , " he says . But who , if not Mr. Mitchell , made himself known as an outstanding " bull " by his extravagant predictions ? Who , if not Mr. Mitchell himself , rushed with many millions in cash to the rescue of the call-money market , during the temporary squeeze of April , 1929 , so that the mad dance might be madder still ? Mr. Mitchell 's testimony , to say the least , is suspect . Everything he says in his own defense convinces one of the need for some check upon the excessive operations of the Mitchells , such as might be provided by economic planning . THE writers ' committee which visited the coal fields of eastern Kentucky came back with the report that the Red . Cross , in Harlan and Bell counties , was allowing itself to be used as a strikes breaking agency . It began to function in the Kentucky mining towns last winter , at a time when wages were being cut so sharply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving . That , it seems , was an act of God . When unions began to be reorganized last spring , all hint of the Divine Mercy faded from the picture , and Red Cross relief work was sharply restricted . The writers ' committee reports that when a starving miner applied for relief , he would be interviewed as follow : " Are you working ? " ? " No . " ? " Here , take this card around to such-and-such a mine and the superintendent will give you a job . If you do n't earn enough to support your family , we 'll see about helping you later . " ? " But the mine 's on strike . I do n't want to be a scab . " ? " So you wo n't work , you lazy , hulking tramp Get out of this office and do n't come back . " There are evidently two ways in which the Red Cross has served as the tool of the operators : first , by offering them an ex ' cuse not to pay their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the men back to work when they g ? on strike . The local Red Cross workers , usuallY drawn from the class financially interested in the mines , are of course directly responsible for this state of affairs , but their actions have never been condemned by the national organization . It seems to us that people who contribute to the Red Cross have a right to ask whether their money is going to be used for disinterested charity , or simplY as means of keeping wages down . THE financial condition of our city governments provides immediate problems which must be face relief whether in planning national unemployment or in revising government economy . In most timelYi fashion a new statistical survey of the financia ? status of 135 cities in the United States and Canada has just been completed by Frederick L. Bird of till ; Municipal Administration Service . Although till survey is in no way alarmist , and although it cove ' only the period up to the end of 1930 ? before things began to look much blacker ? the statistics picture a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds quite panicky during the summer of 1931 . In the great majority of cases , city expenditures have been rising steadily , tax assessments have also been rising , and direct expenditures for unemployment relief have more than doubled for 1930 as against 1929 , although the greater share of poor relief is still carried by the counties . Meanwhile , there has been a sudden increase in delinquent and unpaid taxes . Bond issues to cover the deficit have not always been possible : the unused margin of authorized bonded indebtedness fell about 10 percent during 1930 ? roughly , $81,000,000 . " Some cities have so nearly reached the limit of their borrowing power , " Mr. Bird states , " as to preclude any further financing by this means . " The great majority must curtail their borrowings and cut expenses . But how are they to do so and still continue their relief expenditures and public-works programs ? If municipal relief work continues , taxes can not be reduced ; if taxes stay up , rents can not be radically lowered , and thus the thoroughgoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business depression is indefinitely postponed . THE three articles in this issue of The New Re . Public under the heading " The Cotton Kingdom : 1931 " are all by Southerners . They were all spontaneously submitted , and none of the authors knew of the existence of the other articles . None , of course , assumes responsibility for the opinions expressed by the others . Nevertheless , they seemed to us to tell such a significant story when combined that we have printed them together . Persons in , the cities where unemployment is prevalent are likely to forget how deeply the depression has bitten Into agriculture , and how badly disorganized rural economy has been in prosperity and depression alike . No mere automatic " revival " can rescue a state of society which is at all like that pictured in the Southern articles . THE movement among the workers of the Brook-Y Edison Company to organize a union has been bitterly though silently fought by officials of the company . A culminating incident was the clash in which a group of organizers distribut-hood leaflets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attacked and beaten by a mob of thugs . They had obtained Permission to distribute literature in the streets , spite of the objections of company officials on Previous occasions ; this time , the union organizers the Brooklyn Edison Company sought to Intimidate them by turning loose several hundred hired gangsters . The union is still an " under-ground " organization , owing to the threat of dis-c tsaal hanging over the heads of members . Nurner-us church workers in Brooklyn have taken the side of the employees , among them the Reverend Bradford Young of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity . Recently Matthew S. Sloan , president of the Brooklyn Edison Company , withdrew as a member of this church and canceled his subscription to its endowment fund . He then issued a statement in which he answered the charge of having encouraged the slugging and intimidating of union organizers : he answered it merely by attributing the attacks to " unauthorized " employees of his company . If their zeal in his behalf took the form of using blackjacks on theological students , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Christian sentiments . Though it sounds na ? ve of us , we ca n't help thinking that Mr. Sloan , in resigning from his church before issuing this statement , did exactly the right thing .
