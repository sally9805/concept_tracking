txt President ROOSEVELT submitted to Congress yesterday a budget which leaves in mid-air the most important fiscal question before the Government . It is that of relief expenditures . It is the Government 's outlay on this account that caused the enormous deficit of 1935 and now forces the Treasury to borrow heavily in 1936 . How large the prospective deficit for 1937 will be depends on this same item . But the new budget for 1937 contains no estimate of total relief expenditures , and the accompanying statement of the President carries no intimation of how large an amount he thinks will be required , except that he expects to carry over $1,100,000,000 as an unexpended balance from last year 's appropriation and does not think that as much as $2,000,000,000 more will be needed . The reason given for failure to submit a definite estimate for this one item in the budget is the difficulty of estimating now how large a sum will be required . Later in the session Mr. ROOSEVELT promises to submit a figure . What remains is part of a budget  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President estimates the total expenditures of the Government at $5,649,000,000 . This is an increase of slightly less than 20 per cent by comparison with " regular " expenditures for the current fiscal year ; but the situation is actually more favorable than this comparison suggests , for the President 's figure includes not only all " regular " outlays but the cost of CCC and various other items which have hitherto been classified as " emergency " expenditures . As against this outlay of $5,649,000,000 the President forecasts revenues of $5,654,000,000 . On the face of these estimates , therefore , he has brought his budget Into balance , except for the important and still uncharted item of relief outlays . As matters stand , the size of this item will automatically determine the size of next year 's deficit . Two further items may be noted , both of immediate interest in view of the present situation in Washington . What will be the effect on the budget of the Supreme Court 's decision yesterday in the case of AAA ? And what will be the effect if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As for the first point : the budget anticipates revenues next year of $547 , - 000,000 from processing taxes . Those taxes are now dead . If Congress determines to award benefits to farmers who have signed contracts with AAA for 1937 , either the budget will be thrown further out of balance or some new tax must be provided . As for the bonus : payment at this time would adversely affect the budget for the current year and not the budget for 1937 , which the President submitted yesterday . In effect , however , Mr. ROOSEVELT warned Congress against payment in either year ; for he urged it to remain within his budget estimates and declared it to be " im " portant , as we emerge from the de " pression , that no new activities be " added to the Government unless pro " vision is made for additional revenue " to meet their cost . " If borrowing is to be the method of Congress in paying the bonus , the President implies another veto .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
