There she came , Magna , as trim as a willow whistle , and there came the person Bolo Marks who pursued her . Still , Pethner wondered , watching angrily , could it be called pursuit when Magna went out of her way to meet him ? She , she was the pursuer . To-night they would have this out . But Pethner then entered his shop , weighed beans and selected loaf sugar , and made change with all the urbanity of the unperturbed . He " passed the time of day , " beamed about , lifted the cat from the peanuts , and gently said to all when they would listen that he never laid his troubles upon others . " The world has those who show off their troubles and those who do not , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course to this rule one 's wife would be the natural exception . Ethna , his wife , was in the back of the store sorting apples , and Pethner now rapped out at her : " Devil take that fellow Bolo . Here he is again . " Ethna went on sorting apples . She did not lift her eyes . " Here he is always , " she assented . " Yet you do nothing , " said Pethner , spreading his Lands . " And you  --  what useful things you do in the matter , " Ethna said . Pethner glanced over his shoulder . No one was in the shop . Not enough persons were in the shop any of the time nowadays . ? Will you tell me , " he asked with an enormous distinctness , an enormous repression , " what one is to do ? " " You tell me , " said Ethna . " Just like you tell me everything else , " she added . But with that she looked at Pethner over the apples and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , so shining , and her smile so good-humored , so eternal , that the ire went out of Pethner ; and he made his extreme gesture of affection . He patted her arm . " You bark so , Pethner  --  how you bark , " she said , her little gray eyes laughing at him . He pretended to frown horribly . " It is not that I like you , " said he , " but 1 am so very used to you . " " As a fact , " she said , " Bolo is a good man . And if his office is not crowded , that is only because he has not yet been a doctor for two months ? is n't it so ? " " He has no money , " said Pethner . " Neither had you . " " You throw that up at mel " " You must not throw things at this Bolo Marks . If Magna loves him . . . " Pethner stooped , looked over his shoulder for customers who were not there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you that Alec Pethner is here ? So fine a young man . A Pethner from Scotland  --  and the Scotch Pethners are grand people and rich . There is the match for Magna . " " Pith-wish-wish ! " said his wife . " You brought her up , " he cried , " and you should have given her proper ideas . This is not the old country where it is an honor for a shopkeeper 's daughter to marry a profession . No . This is America . We want money . We . . " Someone entered and wanted macaroni . Pethner 's finest domestic climaxes were too often blasted because someone would come wanting something ridiculous . The macaroni furnished , Pethner went back to the front door . He raised the awning slowly , all the time looking down the street . How slowly those two moved ? loitering , looking in shop windows , and all the time laughing , laughing . " When two laugh like that at nothing , " Pethner muttered , straining at the awning , " they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wound the rope . " Maybe they do too , " he said aloud . He fixed his look on Magna , who did not yet see him , engrossed as she was in the man who walked with his head high , but his glances along his cheek perpetually caressing her there in the open street . She came on laughing , her look lifted to the brown face above her  --  Magna , strangely named , since she was so little . And now Magna 's eyes fell on her father 's face , and at once the light went out of her own . " Like a stone thrown at a bird , " Pethner thought , " but it 's because she is caught in a wrong-doing , that 's why . " Your work is waiting for you , " he said curtly and without greeting . Bolo Marks bent with a gesture of sweeping off his cap , though he wore none . Pethner now saluted stiffly , without change of expression . Something of the Old World was left in these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pethner , that the North European blood flowed in their veins  --  Scandinavian , Danish , Welsh , and long , long back of that , a strain of a blood from some tribe of the East . Of that Pethner talked differently at different times  --  now he said Cossack , now Kurd , now Spanish , from those Spaniards cast on the coast of County Galway and marking with their great sleepy eyes of darkness certain Irish of that shore . Magna had those eyes , and Ethna  --  but Pethner was harder to trace , fierce and soft as he was ; and Bolo seemed of the gentle blood of many peoples . Magna , with her yellow Northern hair and her County Galway eyes , and her skin of youth , was yet all of America and of to-day as she said to her father : " Father , we are going to Farway , to the Forty-niners ' fair , and back here for the pageant . " " Blazes , " said Pethner , " have you forgot the family picnic ? " Magna turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she cried . " It 's to-night . Oh , Bolo . " " I should think so , " said Pethner . " In that case . . . " said Bolo , who had an incomparable manner of stooping with his shoulders , standing him in good stead for words . Now Magna cried : " Father ! Could n't it be for the older ones ? It 's an awful thing to have to go to . " Pethner took on more expression , even more stature . " Since when , " he demanded , " is your family so great an awfulness ? " " Come inside , " said Magna . " Bolo , come in ! " She spoke with such determination that both men followed her . She went straight to the back of the store where Ethna sat , and Pethner marched beside her . But Bolo paused , saying , " Magna , it may be . . . " " It is not , " said Magna , and Bolo laughed and followed . Magna stood beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " is it all right for me not to go to that family picnic thing to-night ? " Her mother looked at her lord . " Do n't look at him , mother , " said Magna . " Look at me . It 's fine for you older ones , and for the childrenth at picnic . But for me it 's deadly . I 've hated it for five years  --  eight years  --  always . And to-night I want ... " " To-night you want your own way , as always , " Pethner injected . " Since when is a family so hard to bear ? " " Not the family , father , but their picnics . Uncle Jasper , Uncle Sven , Uncle Steven  --  everything they say I 've heard from my birth . Aunt Faith , Auntie Marty , Great-aunt Elizabeth  --  I ca n't listen to recipes for four hours . Mother , you know it bores you . " " Wait , then , " cried Pethner . " You do not know what you say . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen before . " " Who ? No , that 's impossible . Who ? " Magna asked scornfully . " It may be that we have a surprise for you there at this picnic to-night , " said her father slyly . " That , " said Magna , " must be another relative , and preserve me from such a surprise . Mother ! " she cried , " you know these picnics bore you ! " Ethna looked up , an apple in each hand . " It does not interest me whether I am bored or not bored , " she said . " I do things . " " But I . . . " " You have not learned that yet . This picnic , it is a good place to learn such a thing maybe . " Bolo spoke , and his manner of quiet lowered the tension of the moment . " She 's right , Magna , " he said . " This picnic is important . " He nodded slightly toward Pethner . But Pethner scowled . " I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said shortly . " Well , then , father , " said Magna , " take it from your own . Invite Bolo to this picnic , and I shall go . " " Never , never such a thing , " Pethner shouted . " Cyrus ! " he shouted on , in the same tone . The back door had opened and the delivery boy had entered . " You forgot the lettuce for Mrs. Ailing . Lettuce . She telephones three times . " The boy had impish eyebrows and a way of pretending not to understand in order , it might be , to gain a little more attention or a little respite from delivering groceries . He flashed even teeth at Magna , ducked at Bolo , with a manner of respect , and went slowly about wrapping up lettuce , and departed . Bolo stood waiting , his manner of quiet making him seem older than his twenty-six years . There was about him this quiet and a power which would not express itself until he called upon it , and such times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that she could not remember when she had first seen him , Merely , he was there . Nor could she remember , she had said , when she began to love him . It had all been quiet , natural , all but matter-of-course . It was as if she had always been engaged to him , she said , though their betrothal was now two months old . On the street that day he had asked her again to let him tell her parents . And now he spoke quietly to Magna . " Shall 1 ? say something ? " he asked . Magna nodded . There was that in her manner and in Bolo 's manner which arrested both the father and mother . " Magna and I wish to be married , " said Bolo . And this he said without shyness or hesitation , but as if he had the right . But Magna spoke in another tone . " Tell that to everyone at the picnic , father , " she said , " and we shall be there , Bolo and I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with apples , looked from one to the other and at her lord , who now began to shout : " Never ! That is to say  --  never ! I shall never give my . . . " Ethna stood up , and her apples rolled to the floor . She spoke with a manner of physical breathlessness , looking about her , a little above the heads of the others . " See here , " she said , " all this can not he settled in a minute . They take time  --  these things . A picnic is n't much , " she looked sweetly at Magna . " Say you go to that , and we talk these things over to-night . ' ' At this Pethner began to smile a little and shrewdly . " To-night we talk things over , " he exclaimed . " Nell , that is not so bad an idea . Let us do  --  let us do so . After the picnic , things may look different . After that surprise . . . " " Things will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his arms . " You do not know what you do ! " he shouted . " You think yourself in love with the first man who asks you to marry . " Into his wife 's eyes , as they chanced to fail on the doorway , came the softness of relief . " Andris , " she said , " two customers . " As if he were unwound by machin-ery , Pethner fell silent , turned , and bowed to the two women who had entered . At once he began cutting cheese , and his voice might be heard rising cheerily : " Excellent weather  --  as if the summer were opening up early is it not ? ' " I 'd go to the picnic to-night , " Ethna murmured . " If you do n't , it may make it harder afterward for you both . " Magna and Bolo were picking up apples . " Then come for me  --  early . I 'll leave there  --  early . The Oak Opening , you know . " " I 'll wait by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store , Pethner pretended not to see him . Very superior cheese , " Pethner was saying  --  and smiling . " It 's a pleasure to sell such cheese as this . " The Pethner picnic , in the Oak Opening , had taken place in June for eleven years . There were twenty-seven Pethners and near-Pethners , and all these  --  well or lame or very old  --  made a prodigious effort to be present . These were nearly all assembled when Ethna , Magna , and Andris Pethner arrived , and Magna heard her mother saying : " Look at them as if you 'd never seen ' em before  --  that 's the way to get the best out of your family . " " I 'd so much rather look at them as if 1 were never going to see them again , " Magna whispered . " Pish-wish-wish , " said Ethna , without expression . There they all were , in the sunset . Great-aunt Elizabeth , enormous , her breathing shaking her whole bulk , head , breast , abdomen rocked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was one of those who could see only by turning her head from side to side and staring with bright eyes , the lips parted . To her , breathing , looking , listening were all active performances , like motion to another . When she talked she heaved up her words , and this she did now : " Well , Magna ! You can come where you enjoy yourself , I see , even if you ca n't come to see your old aunt . " Magna had her father 's own ability to change a mood . She caught up a handful of violets blooming under an oak and ran to her great-aunt Elizabeth . " I bring you a flower . I bring you a kiss , " she said , and blew her one . , " Words jingle nice , " said the Great-aunt Elizabeth , and began looking over her relatives violently , as if looking were a pursuit . There was Aunt Marty , that one of the Pethners who had English blood and who tried to move and act like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had means , " she once said to Magna , " and you will act accordingly . I used to imagine myself with five thousand pounds . Now it 's ten . It gives you better manners . " ) There was Aunt Faith , who had borne eleven children , and who looked down fiercely on all women and on all men who had not contrived at least eight . " Poor , pindling creature , with only ( two or ) three children to her name , " she had been heard to characterize one of her neighbors . Uncle Jasper and Uncle Sven , the husbands of Marty in her black wig , and of Faith with an ear trumpet . Uncle Jasper , tall and cross , raging against the government and Uncle Sven big , well-fed , reconciled , his skin drawn taut and red and shining over his unused muscles . Magna made the rounds , pausing at all the groups , taking their chaffing at nothing , trying to laugh with them , asking for this one and that one as if she cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times , and took her place by the chair of a tiny woman , lame , dressed in very bright colors and with her face brightly made up . Taffyhad wanted to go on the stage , and the story was that her father , long since dead , had pushed her down a stairway in a fit of religious wrath against the drama , and had himself been reconciled to the act which had lamed his daughter , since thereby he had undoubtedly saved her immortal soul . " I embrace my sin , " he had said over many times before he died . " I embrace my sin and I thank God for my perdition . " He was Uncle Andrew Pethner , and his family called him , aloud at least , a martyr ; but Magna had said that he was an old criminal , and Taffy was the only one in the family whom she really loved . " Aunt Taffy , " she said now , " I 'm engaged . " The little creature , whose shoulders seemed so high and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know you 'd met him yet . " " Who ? Met Bolo ! Who ? " " No , not Bolo . Alec ! " " Alec ! Alec who ? " " Have I given it away ? Is n't he here yet ? Alec Pethner , the new cousin from Edinburgh . " " Aunt Taffy , " Magna cried , " He must be the surprise ! " Magna ran to her mother , who stood four-square , her veined hands crossed on her stomach , while she superintended the unpacking of her baskets . " Did you know about this Alec one ? " she demanded . Ethna lifted her placid eyes . " Ye 'll either marry him or ye wo n't , " she said . " What 's the good getting so excited , Magna ? " Magna threw out her arms . " I 've got twenty-seven Pethners trying to live my life , " she said . " I 'm the only one that 's not living it . " Ethna leaned and whispered to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for me , Magna , " she said . Into Magna 's face came a great softness and a shining . " I 'd like Bolo to live my life for me , " she said . " fish-wish-wish , " said Ethna and settled her hands on her stomach again . Magna crossed the open space round which sat the Pethner family , in readiness to picnic . The grove was small and colored , the leaves newly opened to June , some still pink and ochre with the sap of spring . The late sun smote through the leaves , shafts of brightness on the fresh green of the short grass , on the thorn apples blossoming , and on Magna 's yellow hair and on her reddish gown . She saw her father hurrying by her , his stocky figure stooped a bit , his long head outthrust in his best shopkeeper desire to please , to anticipate , to ingratiate  --  in a word in his best shopkeeper savoir faire . And on the edge of the Oak Opening Magna saw a stranger . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detachment , a considering look , as of one who remembers himself and does not rush headlong into even the slightest situation . Straight , slim , admirably dressed , he advanced among them and was met by Magna 's father . " As excited as if he were going to sell him a cabbage , " Magna thought , and chided herself , and thought it again . Then it came to her that this was that stranger , that Alec of Edinburgh , of whom Aunt Taffy had spoken and of whom her mother had known and her father had so complacently hinted . " Pleased to welcome you hospitable into our little group , " she heard her father saying . A silence had fallen on the Pethners round the Oak Opening ; and there were Magna 's father and the stranger before them all , as on a stage , and there was Magna , standing alone , with the sun upon her . She tried to turn aside and at once was overshadowed by Earl Pethner , a large young man , a Pethner who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all think you 're paired off with , " he whispered . " Better take me . " " Why ? Can you think of one reason why I should ? " Magna asked , for once grateful for Earl 's presence . " Because you and I are the most promising Petliners , " said Earl . His huge face and small eyes were close to her . " I 'd like to be in love with you , Magna , if you 'd ever look at me . " " Please make a new joke , " said Magna loftily , and turned to find her father beside her with the stranger . " Oh , father would ! " she thought . " Could n't he have the decency not to march the man straight up to me . " She acknowledged her father 's presentation and did not lift her eyes . . . my Magna , my best and only , " her father was going on , " a Pethner , through and through  --  like us , no ? Welcome into the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " her father repeated , as if to say a name twice were somehow a double greeting , one for her , who was not even looking up at this stranger . " How do you do , " said this stranger 's voice . Magna lifted her eyes then , as if at a summons ; as if at a signal , given faint and far off . She said nothing but merely looked at him as if nothing more were required . " I have come three thousand and some miles to a picnic , " he said , thoughtfully . " To a family picnic , " said Magna . At that he smiled , with a flash of even teeth , and she herself smiled . " A most suitable occasion , " said Magna 's father , expanding in complacence even as he had expanded in anger . " Come , Magna  --  let us introduce your cousin . " She moved beside him , heard her father 's words of explanation . Nearly twenty-seven times he said , with his presentation , " Cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an early day . " She tried to drop out of this march , tried to linger by Aunt Taffy , by Great-aunt Elizabeth , even by Cousin Earl Pethner . But her father bore her on . " Cousin Ethan Pethner 's son , who went to the Hebrides in an early day . " When it was over her father shouted " Now I 'll leave you two young people to get acquainted , " incredibly winked at Alec Pethner , and rushed away , shouting " Ca n't you fellows build a fire that 'll make coals ? Have I got to teach you how every time ? " Magna stood beside Alec Pethner and she dared not look up at him . For she was swept , as if she were in water , by a feeling strange to her , in all her twenty years . She looked down at the grass , she looked away at the branches lacing the bright west sky , she looked round on the platelike faces of all the Pethners , waiting for their food . She thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened . She heard Alec speaking , and it was as if his voice came from a great way off . " So , " said cousin Alec Pethner , " you do not much like family picnics . " " Do you ? " said Magna , looking away . " Why , " said he , " this one I like uncommonly well . And that is no ' altogether because I 've come so far to attend , either . " His speech had that infinitesimal difference of the Scot  --  that frail burr , that elision of the final t . Magna listened but still she could not look at him . " You must keep me straight on all these Pethners , " he went on , " or I 'll drown in them . " " I 'm Magna myself , " she found spirit to say . " That is quite clear in my mind , " he said gravely . " For Lord 's sake , " he said , " sit down with me till I get the Pethners sorted out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . A clear-skinned young Scot , with springing brown hair and a look of health and soundness . What was making her tremble , change her breath ? She tried to think of Bolo . She could think only of that which this man was saying . And he was saying nothing save of matters concerning the Pethner family . " That must be Aunt Taffy , the disgraceful one . I always thought she sounded nice . And Great-aunt Elizabeth  --  what does one talk to her about ? And those cousins  --  Earl , Hector , Conrad  --  does it make any real difference if I never know them from one another ? How do they tell themselves from one another ? You though , " he suddenly centered his look on her , " I thought you were a little girl . " Furious with herself that her heart was beating so that she could barely speak , Magna said low : " What makes you think I 'm not ? " " Because , " said Cousin Alec absently  --  and his voice had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girls always like me at once . The older ones seldom like me at all . " He was still absent , grave , when he added , " What a fine face that woman has . " " That 's my mother , " said Magna , and for Ethna , who had spent her life for her , Magna felt a new respect because this stranger praised her , in that voice " No wonder you 're beautiful , " Alec Petlmer said , still grave , still absent . At his words Magna was shaken as by a kind of cry sent out to her alone of all the world . " What on earth is the matter with me ? " she thought furiously . " When will it be time to meet Bob ? " o Now her father turned from the cairn of stones where his fire blazed and cried out that the picnic was about to begin . " A picnic is eating , " he shouted , laughing heartily . " A picnic is eating ! " he repeated earnestly , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in company  --  all his life long Andris Pethner had longed to be funny , to make people laugh . He probably never had made an authentic joke in his life but he never had ceased to try . " Wieners , hamburgers , bacon , coffee , " he chanted . " Open your piates , " and laughed and laughed . The youngest Pethners served  --  Pinker and Polly and Rolf  --  breathing heavily , stumbling , dropping things  --  all in an agony of fear lest they should not do these tasks right , all squirming in anguish when they did them wrong . And Henry , Teeny , Bucky , Peggy , all so earnest and so bent on playing their parts . When there was a pause in the contest of voices Great-aunt Elizabeth 's tones might be heard , going on with some recipe : " And I beat it and beat it and beat it and beat it . . . Once a terrible moment of silence was caused by little old Aunt Lydia Pethner , whose husband , Uncle Jute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced to the circle of the firelight and announced : " Jute 's coming home to-night . He 's been gone for a long time , but now he 's corning home . " " He died before I was born , " Magna whispered as they led Aunt Lydia away . Alec spoke very low . " God ! " he said , " love like that ... " He said no more . But once more his words , his voice , shook her . Not his strength nor his gentleness , not his voice alone nor his ways  --  but the presence of this man of whom she had heard only with distaste until an hour ago . . . . And out there , somewhere , by the last turn , would be Bolo , waiting to take her to the Days of Forty-nine . Dear Bolo . " Tell me about yourself , " Alec was saying . " I 've heard about you when you were a little girl . I mean , tell me how it is now . " " I 'd Iike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went on . She was astonished at herself . All the things that she thought about at night in her small room , when she was dreaming  --  things about her life and about how brilliant she would be , among brilliant people  --  all this she found herself telling this man Alec Pethner ; and merely because he listened , so gravely , so absently , his eyes on the fire ; and surging from him , and giving her an excitement such as never in her life had she felt or guessed , that incredible power . Then suddenly it was all over and before she had told him half that she wanted to tell . The sun was down , the fire was blazing and throwing out great curtains of shadow to meet the curtains of the oaks . The circle drew closer , and now would come the great hour of Uncle Jasper and Uncle Sven and Uncle Steven , telling how they had conquered America with their bare hands . It was eight o'clock . Bolo would be waiting . Now came to Magna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whispered : " Will you do something for me ? " " Anything , " his voice came out of the darkness . " In town there 's a grand celebration ? Days of Forty-nine  --  the gold rush  --  the gambling the covered wagons . You should see this . . . " she said earnestly . " I must see this , " his voice came . " Will you go with me ? " " They 're going to think it 's terrible ? my taking you away . " " Oh , let 's go ! " Abruptly she knew that she wished that she were going with him alone . - It 's this , " said Magna faintly , " a friend  --  it 's Bolo Marks  --  is waiting for me down the road . If you and I leave together to go to this . . " " I see , " he said . " I 'll explain to them . I 'm new  --  from the Hebrides  --  I must see this historical re-creation . " " Just so they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my father . " They found Andris Pethner telling the younger of the aunts how to wash the dishes . To him Alec explained that he must see this re-creation of the American scene . " Of course , " he said , " ten years in Edinburgh and two in London gave me some idea of the Scotch and English pictures of you Americans ? which were n't much better than the Hebrides picture , do you see . But I feel that I really should study this historical affair . " " I 'd take you myself , " said Andris heartily , " only Edina does n't walk much . " " 111 take him , father , " said Magna . Andris looked at her and wavered between approval and his passion to make a joke . The joke-lust prevailed : " I tried my best to trade you off for a bad quarter , " he roared , and Magna and Alec slipped away . The night was warm and sweet . They walked slowly through the wood . At first they said nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not interest him . No doubt with all his travel and his knowledge of far places he was bored by her . In the darkness she imagined his face  --  the clear skin , the quick smile , the intent eyes . But he was so grave , so absent . No doubt he was thinking of a girl he had left behind in Scotland . She remembered hearing  --  or had she heard ? ? that all Scotch girls were very beautiful . He was so silent , not at all like Bolo , who talked and laughed always ; yet when this man spoke he was different from Bolo , different from everyone . " Are all American girls like you ? " Alec asked suddenly . Like her ! Oh , no , but they were beautiful , they were clever ; she had been at college for only a year , she was nothing . When he saw the real American girls he would not think of her again . " You are all that I 'd ever ask for , " Alec said . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she repeated furiously . All the men whom one brew said things such as this , and what did they matter ? But this man  --  but she was in love with Bolo . Dear Bolo , dear Bolo , she repeated steadily . This man seemed to speak only when he followed his own thought . And he laid upon her a silence , so that the time seemed his and as if she were not to use it in speech when something else was happening . What was happening ? She knew only that the moment was stronger and stranger than speech , that she was beset by experience , by sensations which were new to her , which attacked her with violence , but with sweetness too . She was aware of his presence , of his motion , of his breathing , as of powerful onslaughts of sound . She waited for his words . " The Hebrides , " he said , " Scotland , London , America  --  all the lines leading to this town and to .. . " The tone said " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enveloped her . Less like sinking through water than like drifting into sleep or going under an opiate . She fought it , with her mind , as she had heard of travelers fighting the stupor , the warmth , the delicious ease of deep enveloping snow . Bolo , Bolo . . . . Alec stopped in the path . The oaks rose sturdy and tender-leaved , their leaves carrying the wood odor of wet tea roses . She saw Alec 's black bulk against the farther blackness of the trees . " You will let me see you sometimes ? " he said . Li yes : , " Often ? " " Of course  --  cousin . " " Well  --  cousin . Not that that matters . It is you that I want to see  --  and not a cousin . " He laughed , and she must laugh with him . What new thing had laughter become , shared like this ? " You must take pity on me  --  in a strange land , " he said , " though pity is n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often to the house , " she said . " My father . . . " " You , " said Alec Pethner . They were close to the turn by the Oak Opening . " And Bolo Marks , " she said . " Our ? my friend . You must know him . " But to this Alec paid not the faintest attention , so that Magna felt a kind of flicker of jealousy for Bolo , as if someone must take his part . " Bolo , " she called . " Bolo . " " Right , " said Bolo 's voice . He emerged , coming towards them down the dim trail . And Magna ran towards him . " Bolo , " she cried , as if in some eager defense , " this is our cousin  --  our cousin , Alec Pethner . From the Old Country . " Then the two men shook hands and fell into talk , question and answer , Bolo shy and merry and Alec silent and courteous ; Bolo leading the way , and Magna following , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the adventure of meeting Bolo in the wood , of stealing away to meet him  --  this was for Magna no more ; yet all the adventure of the Days of Forty-nine and its pageantry was upon her , with an excitement such as she had never known . Oh , gay and colored and bright with light the way to the town in Bolo 's old ear . And when they came in sight of the tents and torches and lanterns of the Forty-niners ' camp , and when they heard the music and the far clarion calls , everything that Magna had ever known of the thrill and the glow of living was gathered into that hour . There was Bolo whom she loved and to whom she was pledged  --  there were sweetness and the tenderness of Bolo and her sense of refuge in him . And here was this stranger who said little , who merely waited and made her wait for she knew not what , and whose presence filled her with such a sense of life that all her former days lay dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days of Forty-nine lay glittering and musical , in a little grove that bordered the river flowing through the suburb . This town , Farway , lay on one path of the westward migration , away from the new Western Reserve , on , beyond , where the new West had summoned . Eighty years before wagon and horse , traveling overland to California , had passed through the village , and the people had stood in their safe doorways , too lazy , too comfortable , or too timid to venture forth , and had watched that stream of traffic in the first stages of its westward journeying . This was before the rigors of the desert or of mountain roads were known to the wayfarers , or ever thirst or fear had touched them . The women were trim , in finery which they would not wear thereafter , the men were confident , the children were healthy and happy , the horses were sleek , the wagons were new . Thus Farway and the towns on the settled stages of the route westward saw the wagon-trains go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow of a beginning . They knew nothing of the bony beasts , the riddled canvas , the sallow men and women , the children puny or buried in the sand that marked the trail a thousand miles to the west . The tragedy of the westward migration they could picture but dimly , as men picture war with half a world between ; but the romance and the zest of the outset the Midwest knew well , and it was through this rose glass that Farway had undertaken to make pageantry of the Days of Forty-nine . The California of Forty-nine had been imagined gay as it was , careless as it was ; but also safe and well-fed and content as indubitably it was not . Yet for the uses of the pageant all this played its part well . And the tourists from the near-by resort towns , already opening , were present to be amused . As Magna and the two men drew up at the gates of the grounds the procession of the horsemen was issuing for its parade of the town . Open flannel shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled , and girls and boys , and men and women rode through the streets , released from routine , playacting with the social sanction of Far-way . " Oh , Miss Magna ! " somebody called out , " Come on . I 've got a horse here for you . " It was Cyrus , her father 's shop boy , his bald pink face shining . " Have you three horses ? " Magna cried . " Four , " said Cyrus . " They 're my father 's plow horses , but they sure can travel in a parade . " These horses stood without saddles , blankets strapped about them , and Magna tossed her hat to Cyrus and mounted the nearest . " Come on , " she cried . " Bolo  --  show Alec what we do to amuse foreign visitors ! " Slim and straight in her reddish gown , she sat her great horse blanketed in red plaid , and challenged them with her laughter . They fell into line  --  Bolo sitting his mount superbly , Alec riding like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ofbeing ready for anything ; and they moved up the streets with the moving crowd . The shops that she knew so well , the second-story windows crowded with faces that she knew , buildings , glass-fronts , striped awnings , familiar to her from daily encounters since her childhood  --  these she seemed never to have seen until now . A light over all , or was it a singing in her  --  or was it a transformation of the air  --  but when had she known anything to compare with this hour ? Four abreast they rode through the town , she between Alec and Bolo , with a Catholic priest for the fourth in their line , who cried out , " Sure , no padre ever did more in his day than I in mine , with this baste . " The slow motion , the sound of the feet of the horses , the thud and lift of the band , the drone of the music from the grounds , the shouts of the people , the popping of pistols  --  these were no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet for her this night swam by in dream , in haze . She looked at Bolo , and he was like a dark young god and her heart was warm towards him , and she was tender and devoted and yearning . She looked at Alec , and he was crumpled on his horse , but he was strong and slow of glance and he kept claiming her eyes for his own . So fierce a current of life and the alive swept over Magna that it was all but pain ; and she wanted nothing but to be caught in that current again and never to lose it or to have it lessen . " I am lost , " she thought , " I am a bad woman . Is this Magna  --  is it Magna ? " ? and abruptly she knew that it was Magna alive as she had never known herself to live . She thought " What will become of me ? " and laughed aloud with her confidence that was like a carelessness of all that might befall . " You laugh like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , " said Alec . " Hebrides , " Magna said . " I love the far sound of it . It sounds farther than it is . " " You 'll love the Hebrides , " said Alec absently , and that pang of pain and joy tore through her . She looked quickly and guiltily at Bolo , who was smiling , content and serene . Her eyes filled with tears . She leaned toward him . " Bolo  --  you love me ? " she spoke softly , but he heard . He smiled , gently , adorably , possessively , as a husband smiles at his wife , sure of her , serene in his love . She felt restored and comforted and quieted and ? quenched . This tremendous pulse , of life as it might be , was not for her from Bolo . It was for her from Alec . She passed her father 's shop , closed and dark , and now she seemed to see it as from a distance , both in time and in space . Only that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and venturesome with the thought of telling her news and his . Only that day ! And she had had no idea then that life was like this . Life was not in the least as she had supposed . " Look back at the torches , " said Alec , and at these words , at any words of his , she trembled . A song swept up the lines of the riders : We 'll look to the West And we do n't give a dorn , If we go by the desert Or we go by the Horn . She caught the air and her voice rose freshly and joyously . Bolo had no voice , but at the second repetition , Alec had fixed the words and his baritone , rich and throaty , blended with hers . She had a momentary sense of being lifted above any-thing that sense had ever recorded . To sing with himwas like flying with him . . . . There he sat , humped on his horse , a look of almost absurd earnestness and purpose on his face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones as to wind . " I guess them fellows had a terrible time getting round the Cape of Good Horn , " said a voice behind her . She looked at Alec , and he had heard , and they changed eyes in silent merriment at this blunder . " I read an account of one of ' em , " said another voice . " An autobiography ? " " No . Just the story of a Forty-niner 's experience . " " Written by someone else ? " " No . No . He wrote it himself . " Magna and Alec rocked with laughter . Anything would do to laugh at . To laugh together  --  that was the thing . " What 's the joke ? " Bolo asked , quite kindly . " Everything ! " cried Magna , and murmured , " Bolo -- -I love you more than anything in the world . " " I know that , " said Bolo . His face was almost beautiful and Alec 's was plain and marred . " It 's Alec it 's Alec , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept through the streets and circled back to the grounds . " Now nothing escapes us , " Alec said as they alighted . " In at every show ! " The gaming tables came first  --  every variety of the games of chance of those days in California and on the trail . Raw games , subtle games , games that have survived and those that have been forgotten . Piles of paper script for money ? a quarter 's worth made a fortune . Alec thrust the stuff into Magna 's hands . She played and played and could n't lose . Beginner 's luck , luck of the ignoramus at the tables , she threw and won , and doubled and won . And Bolo watched her , amused and tender , and Alec laughed at her and teased her and watched the other tables  --  but she knew where he was and she knew when he spoke . Once she and Bolo stood alone at the table , and she looked up at him . " I did n't know it was in people to feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't feel this , " said Bolo . " You just pretend to feel it . That 's your fun . " " Do I pretend to love you ? " " Do you ? " he asked . How gentle and kind and tender he was . " No " she cried . " You 're the best ! " Alec came up . " Magna , " he said , " you must let me call you Magna , Cousin . Do you want to go ? It 's a stuffy hole . " She wanted to stay , but she followed him . In the grounds , among the tents and the wigwams , there coursed the people of Farway , all whom she knew best . She knew everyone . The suburb had ten thousand , and her father kept a little shop , but she had beauty and brains and she was marked among them . Yet to-night she looked at them all as if she had never seen them before : Mr. and Mrs. Temple , she short and burnt-out , listless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit and not as performing a function . Had they been in love as she and Bolo were in love , or as she and Alec might be in love ? . . . At that she stopped and turned away . Mr. and Mrs. Denison , she gaunt and startled , and he with the deep lines of his face serving as a smile  --  well , Bolo and she might be loving as little as those two loved and no more than that . She caught herself again . Well , then , Mr. and Mrs. Agers  --  and he dark and sneering and unsuccessful and she quick and dominating and pouring out her emphasis on everybody  --  they two must have loved tremendously , not in the least as Bolo and she were in love . " Darling , " said Bolo , " would you have gone west with me , in Forty-nine ? " " Yes , " she said  --  and had a picture of that trail , Bobo and she serene under the stars , taking what came , going west as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was what she had thought love was , until tonight . Suddenly she clung to Bolo , pressed close to him in the crowd . It was as if she were protecting him from something . " Darling , " said Bolo , and smiled at her as a man smiles across his own hearth . They had come to a picture tent , where one sat for a photograph , and waited for its development , and might discover his head on the body of an elephant or a clown . Alec 's picture showed him in the full costume of an Indian chief , fringed , feathered , beaded . The plain dark face glowered up at her from the photograph . Oh , with him there would he no taking love as a matter of course , no making love when there was time , nothing serene under the stars . With him .. . Again that sweep and onrush of a current that claimed her , carried her , tossed her against the unseen . But he might not even love her or notice her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and she herself was betrothed to Bolo . They began meeting members of the Pethner picnic who had reached the grounds in time to participate . Andris and Ethna , laboring along together , he ordering her briskly , she doing as she pleased , slowly ; Uncle Sven and Uncle Jasper , each playing the elder to the other and advising him as to his steps and his ways ; Aunt Marty and some of the children , looking for Uncle Steven , whom everybody else knew to be deep in the gaming tents . Magna stared at them . All , all , she decided , had known a peaceful love , like hers and Bolo 's . This other , it could come to one but once in twenty lifetimes . The blare of the hand , the call of a trumpet , the ascent of rockets announced the hour of the pageant . They hurried towards the grandstand , Bolo watching her , helping her , telling her when to avoid wet places in the earth , murmuring to her she hardly knew what . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet rushing her along , and he watching the crowd , intent on the newness , the difference . Once he said , " Is n't this jolly ? " And again , " You 're the kind that needs a man 's help in this about as much as you need an umbrella . " At that she looked up at him and said , " You probably like the helpless . I 'm sorry to make a bad impression . " But this he seemed not to hear . Now Bolo she could always depend on to hear and to answer properly  --  with a reassurance , a compliment . But this man stalked on and did not know that she was there , and then abruptly remembered her with such a blaze of something focussed full upon her that she could only tremble . They sat in the grandstand , to watch the pageant . The place was crowded with the people of Farway come to see dramatized that which they all knew well  --  the story of their settling of the town , of the great trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the scenes ( almost equally familiar through the tales of returned uncles ) to which they had been en route , on trail and in camp . it was amazing , the beauty that the pageant had uncovered : the prefacing meadow with fireflies and fairies before men came . The Indians , the Jesuits , the fur traders , the settlers  --  and then that oncoming stream from the east , by horse , by ox-team , driving their flocks , entering on that great emigration which was to open up three-fourths of a continent and to change the destiny of the nation , of the nations . Great stalwart sons of settler and immigrant alike , these men and women entered into their parts , lived again the lives of their forbears , buried far in the land where they had sought life and had found death , or returned in fair comfort to end their days ; or silent in safe little hillside cemeteries where they had crept back home to lie down and to forget . There it all was  --  the story , spread before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , enacted by the men and women who had taken the trail together . How they had loved , had borne everything for the sake of one another . Sometimes with a fierce and terrible love , and sometimes with a love like hers and Bolo 's  --  tender , tepid . . . oh , no , no , no ! In the intermission Alec went to sit for a moment with Andris and Ethna , and someone dropped into his seat  --  Earl Pethner . His large white face , with its eyebrows too much arched and its loose mouth which moved about when he talked , was turned on Magna with its thin fixed smile and its tiny eyes . " Got two to-night , I see , " he began . Magna said nothing . " Whenever you want three , " he said , " I 'll trail . I 'm not proud . Magna ? " his voice was rasping when he dropped it , " remember what I told you awhile ago about this love business ? " " No , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " When you 're in love you 're alive . The rest of the time you 're just dumb . If you want to keep alive keep in love . I 've found that out . " " Nothing that you say means a thing to me , " said Magna coldly . " Because you have n't been in love , " Earl told her triumphantly . " Magna , try me . Unite the two fortunes  --  of course , there are n't any fortunes , but try to think of me as the one that 's the one . Magna . There 's a girl that I 'm terribly in love with Helga Griffiths . She 's as sweet as they make them . But I could leave her for you any minute . You 're the one I want . " She tried to silence him , and he said , " It 's my belief that you 've never been in love . . . never been alive . " Alec came back and Earl went away , saying " Remember my dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This which Earl meant , with his unsavory doings  --  was it possible that some people went through life and knew only that and thought that they knew love ? But then those who knew the thrill and the power and the terror of love  --  would not these think as pityingly of the love that she and Bolo knew , thin and sweet and tepid ? How to know ? If something strong and beautiful would happen , something that would test them all . Something that would tell her whom to turn to , to cling to  --  that would show Bolo or Alec in a flash of light , bared to the spirit , open to all that she might need to judge them by , to judge her own feeling . But nothing strong and beautiful ever did happen to test one out . You just went on and on . You had to find out without a test , without light , without anything but the Every-day . What if you judged wrong  --  what if you paid all your life by never having life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Men did that , women did that .. . why , the town was filled with those who had done that . Mr. and Mrs. Temple , Mr. and Mrs. Denison , Mr. and Mrs. Agers . Or had they done that ? Had they not perhaps had their beautiful flashing love , and then had sunk into lethargy and routine like the rest ? Did it all come to that anyway ? Whichever way one chose  --  whether one found love or thought that one had found love  --  did it all come into the deadly , the dead , the numbed , and never stay in the terror and the glory of love at all ? The pageant was going on . Magna was watching . All were watching . And abruptly , without a moment of warning or challenge , that happened which had been prophesied for too great a crowd on the badly built structure where they sat . There was a report , a tottering of timbers and a crash of beams , and the tawdry foundation with the old planking sank suddenly into chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely one of the sordid accidents resulting from lack of ordinary care . No one was killed , no one was more than bruised and shaken and thunderously indignant . Of these last was Andris Pethner . One might have heard his voice to the edge of the grounds , declaiming against the authorities , the government , the lack of order and safety in the universe . He and Ethna , unhurt , clambered to the borders of the scene , and he inveighed against them all , while Ethna said , " Can you see Magna ? But Andris , these people did n't build the grandstand . Do n't you think we might help ? " To which Andris shouted , " You keep back . Enough people are injured . " " Can you see Magna ? " she asked again . Magna felt herself carried over debris and through the struggling mass . It was Bolo who held her , she knew . She had a moment of swift satisfaction that it was Bolo who had saved her . But in a moment she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat and put it under her head , who made sure that she was all right , said , " Thank God , " and was off again . Then Bolo kissed her and left her too . She lay at the distance to which they had taken her , felt the blackness and nausea leave her , became fretful that no one returned to her , tried out feet and legs , and finally rose and made her way towards the place of confusion . Once there she was deep in the work of rescue , and she was everywhere , taking others to safety , finding children , bringing water . Once Alec , carrying a child , came by her . " Get out of here  --  go back where you were , " he shouted- " I shall do nothing of the sort , " she called out crossly and went on binding someone 's head . Bolo was in and out of the crowd , saw her , asked , " All right ? " and was gone again . She tore up her slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One or the other of them ought to have saved me . They both saved me . They 're both working like Trojans . This does n't test out anybody . It might as well not have happened . " She laughed crazily and went off to find a car for somebody , and later she realized she would not be able to recognize the person 's car by any known means . Now nearly all were out of the grandstand . Magna had seen Earl take her mother and father away  --  Earl was probably a much better fellow than he seemed to be Perhaps everybody was better . Perhaps love was better . No , but of course it was the other way round and love was better , really , than anyone knew . All the pity and the terror . . . . She saw Bolo and ran towards him , unevenly , over the uneven ground . He caught her , kissed her , caring nothing whatever for those who stood about . " Somebody 'll take you home , " he said . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Alec ? " She dragged Bolo about , looking for Alec 's coat , and stood hugging it in her arms , with Bolo 's arm about her . She thought : " This is disgraceful . It 's  --  it 's bigamous , " and then laughed and laughed until she cried . At last , when only the helpers were left and there was no more danger from fire , Alec came asking for his coat and saying in a matter-of-fact way : " Of course you 're all right . " And Bolo said , " I 've brought my car close by . " On which she amazed them both by crying out passionately : " It might just as well not have happened ! " She thought crossly , " Why could n't one of them have turned out a hero ? They were both so decent . " They took her home , and found Andris and Ethna in their comfortable sitting room , having coffee . " I saw she had two protectors , " said Andris , " and if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andris , " said Ethna , " we must ask Mee to spend the night . " " Sure , " said Andris , placidly , " I 've got his suitcase . I did that before the picnic . He 's visiting us . " So he was to be there , in the house . Magna sat silent . Over her poured the simple ecstasy of being near , of being under the same roof with this other human being . But now Bolo was saying good-night . She followed him into the passage and found herself weeping . " Bolo , Bolo , " she said . " I do love you . I do . " " I know it , sweetheart , " said Bolo gently , and she wanted to shout , " Do n't you be so sure . " She went back to the others , to Alec ? sitting there in their house . She drank coffee and thought , " Is it possible to love two men at the same time ? Has anyone ever felt this way before ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is love , then what I feel for Bolo is nothing . But if what I feel for Bolo is love  --  then what on earth is this other ? " Alec was speaking to her . There was much that he wanted to say . If he got a car next day would she drive with him ? But the whole day ? " Surely she will  --  surely , " her father agreed affably . " Surely she will show Cousin Alec all of America . No  --  Magna ? " " I will go , " said Magna . She explained carefully , " Bolo is busy , of course . " At this Alec looked thoughtfnl , but he said nothing . It was as if Bolo were nothing really to him , nor could be . " I must tell him that I 'm engaged to Bolo , " she thought , and felt the most violent repugnance to the idea . " I am a wicked thing , " she thought . Alec sat down before her and looked at her and looked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hurt there to-night , killed , perhaps . When I had just found you . " She met his eyes , and she felt fear , a glorious fear , at being so near to him . " You were n't killed either , you know , " she said . " Well , no , " he said . " We might exchange congratulations . " He leaned back and looked away . She thought : " Idiot . Now you 've let him see what it does to you to be near him  --  and he 's withdrawn a mile . Oh , idiot . " She moved away , said good-night coolly , and went to her room . As soon as she was there she would have given all the world to be back downstairs again . The one night out of all the years when she might have sat listening to him talk . . . . For an hour she lay listening to his talk with her parents  --  and she lonely , miserable , confused . And first she would put away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance she would cling to his image and long for the next evening when she might be with him . But even with the words , repeated over and over , she would be living the day which she was to spend with Alec . The whole day ! A day of that rush and sweep of feeling which might be love , which might he something that she could never know for Bolo . But then Alec would go away . He would go back to the Hebrides , which sounded so far . And there was certain to be a girl in Scotland , very beautiful ... oh , but had he not said that she was sure to like the Hebrides ? " To-morrow I shall tell him that I am engaged to Bolo , " she thought , and lay listening and listening to the sound of his voice . ( To be continued )
