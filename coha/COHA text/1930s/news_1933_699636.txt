txt Greeting the " New Day . " To the Editor of The Nato York Times : It used to be said that " cleanliness is next to godliness , " but , judging by present activities in midManhattan , it appears that cleanliness is next to the passage of a beer bill . Such a scrubbing the old town has n't undergone for a decade . The old hotels , which have stood drab and forlorn and neglected for years , are having their faces cold-creamed and lifted to greet the " new day " with fair countenance . Their interior anatomy is receiving a corresponding overhauling . If the advent of a mere 3.2 per cent can bring about such a reformation , it 's a good thing the legis , lators stopped there , for I fear our eyes could n't stand the shining glory of a city marching in dress parade to meet , say , 3.6 per cent . Anyway , the paint manufacturers , the sand cleaners and the renovators are having their day . B. B. KIRCHER . Brooklyn , April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
