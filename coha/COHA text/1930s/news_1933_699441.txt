On the basis of evidence already laid before the grand jury , Assistant District Attorney James G. Wallace will seek today the indictment of members of thirty additional election boards in Manhattan . At the same time , the grand jurors themselves will get first hand knowledge of the discrepancies between the vote cast and the vote tabulated , when they will examine some of the paper rolls , on which voters attempted to register their preference for Joseph V. for Mayor .
