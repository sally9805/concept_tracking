Indian stocks and even bonds broke sharply on the Bombay Exchange and did not recover last week , as the Indian National Congress ( TIME , Jan. 6 ) voted by a virtually unanimous majority the following Declaration of Puran Swaraj ( Complete Independence ) : <P> " It has become a solemn obligation and a ( revolutionary right for the people of India to assert their inherent power and dissolve the immoral ties which bind them to the British imperial system . . . . <P> " We solemnly declare that India . . . is a free and independent nation , and that Independent India now undertakes the responsibility of conducting war , concluding peace , contracting alliances , and establishing political and commercial relations with other nations . <P> " For the support of this Declaration we pledge our lives , our honor , and all that we possess to the cause of our country and humanity . . . . " <P> Additional specific clauses of the Declaration in effect created the Executive Committee of the Congress a Government of Independent India and authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to the British Raj ; 2 ) Order nonpayment of taxes ; 3 ) Command the desertion of the 200,000 native troops in the British Indian Army ; 4 ) Exact the resignation of native members of the nine Provincial Legislative Councils , which flourish as puppet congresses under British tutelage ; 5 ) And finally to do any or all of these things at such time as members of the Government may deem best . <P> As the Congress adjourned the Executive Committee in its character of Government immediately called upon the 145 members of the Central Indian Legislative Assembly to resign . At once 23 did resign . The Government then fixed Jan. 26 as the date for a " nationwide demonstration . " Great was the triumph of India 's ascetic little Saint , famed Mahatma Gandhi , boss-politician and demigod of the Congress . Usually he wears only a loin cloth , but at the final session at which his Declaration of Independence was adopted he appeared exclusively clad in a large white sheet which flapped dramatically as he gestured . <P> In London the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prime Minister and every statesman of consequence away on vacation , caused the grave and startling news from India to be received with curious apathy . Evidently carnivorous Church of Englanders still view the menaces of vegetarian Hindus with the customary contempt . The Daily Herald , party organ of Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald , recalled that during 1929 the Indian Nationalists demanded " dominion status , " and complacently alluded to the 1930 demand for Pur an Swaraj ( Complete Independence ) as " an academic change involving no immediate consequences . " In Manhattan , Chairman Sailendranath Ghose of the Indian Nationalist Association of America talked boldly of arming a million Indians for revolution but had no theory as to how a million rifles could be smuggled into India past alert British frontier guards .
