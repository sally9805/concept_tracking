Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. ' s Paul W. Litchfield this week fixed a figurative bayonet and counterattacked the wartime forces that tend to inflate prices and costs . In full page national ads , full-jowled No. 1 U. S. Rubberman Litchfield announced tire price cuts of as much as 12% , in spite of a wartime increase of nearly 25% in the price of crude rubber ( August 29 , 16 a lb. : Oct. 27 , 20 ) . After " streamlining " plants and methods , costs were slashed to absorb September 's rubber inflation as well as the rubber business ' big complaints : higher wages &; taxes . <P> Goodyear 's credo : " We stand for prices as low as manufacturing efficiency , economical distribution and raw material costs permit-prices productive of wider sales and wider employment . " Litchfield 's challenge : " That is the way to economic stability , which should be the goal of every responsible business leader at this time . "                @ @ @ @ @
