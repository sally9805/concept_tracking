About all the painting most strictly modern architects want in their buildings can be done by a house painter . This fact greatly grieves the young school of muralists who have found their inspiration in Rivera and Orozco , their opportunity under WPA . Lately , however , a few architects and a few painters have had a happy , conciliatory thought . If modern architecture relies on the beauty of abstract forms , why should it not employ , for certain chaste effects , the painting of pure abstractionists ? <P> Two years ago , when the Public Works Administration began to build its biggest , most expensive ( $13.500,000 ) , most admirably planned housing project , in the Williamsburg District of Brooklyn ( TIME , April 18 ) , Consulting Architect William Lescaze and Burgoyne Diller , head of the Federal Art Project 's New York City mural division , decided to try abstract murals in the project 's ten recreation rooms , each entrusted to a single artist . By last week , murals were installed in two rooms . Last week , blue-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of WPA 's abstract murals to exhibit some of them with other " Murals for the Community " in the Federal Art Gallery in Manhattan . <P> Many visitors to the exhibition liked best a number of ice-cold , clear abstractions of streets and buildings by 37-year-old Francis Criss , rejected for Williamsburg because out of key with allotted color schemes . Approved were smooth murals by : <P> Balcomb Greene , 34 , onetime instructor in art at Dartmouth , now respected as one of the few U. S. abstractionists capable of inventive , exhilarating design . <P> Ilya Bolotowsky , 30 , Russian-born artist skilled in the blob , or kidney , type of abstraction . <P> Paul Kelpe , 35 , German-born adept at solidly built , rectangular abstractions.
