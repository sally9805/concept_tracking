Kern-McBride ( $2 ) . <P> " Men marry , " said urbane Philosopher George Santayana , " as their fortunes prove . " That women play a big part in assisting fortune was established again last month by four books on the art and science of marriage . Written for women , they cover all sides of the subject , from advice on illicit love affairs to instructions on how to can tomatoes . <P> Love and Happiness is a good-natured book of the benevolent , family-physician , **33;1327;TOOLONG type , explaining frigidity , homosexuality , adultery , venereal diseases and a variety of semi-clinical matters with a joviality that is sometimes excessive . " Here comes a young lady , " says Dr. Hotep , " who is beginning to wonder when she will become ' promiscuous ' - when she has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Other perplexed souls who poured out their problems to Dr. Hotep included two well-brought-up college girls who wondered if it was safe for them to pick up strangers on trains , a sheltered boy who was sent to him to learn the facts of life but who turned out to be fully informed , a woman of 42 on the verge of a nervous breakdown ; many , many others .

" Where the bliss ? " She also thinks that no bride should ever be heard saying , " I wish you 'd hurry up and make more money . " <P> Indirectly , this same advice is given by Countess de Forceville and Marjorie Kern . One of the things that worry them most about modern marriage is the tendency of husbands &; wives to complain about each other in public .

She can ask him to tell his best story . If that does not work , she can answer back . Or she can become completely silent , or- " this is a blow between the eyes " - she can leave the room .
