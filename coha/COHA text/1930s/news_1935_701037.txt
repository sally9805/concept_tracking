txt In an extemporaneous speech bristling with scorn and indignation , Justice , delivering the opinion of the minority in the gold clause cases , startled spectators in the Supreme Court chamber today with a blistering attack on New Deal currency policies . There were gasps as the 73-year old Tennessean , scarcely glancing at his manuscript , declared that Nero undertook to use a debased currency , asserted that the Constitution had " gone " and expressed the " shame and humiliation " of the minority consisting of himself and Justices Vandevanter , Sutherland and Butler . At the very outset he said that to share the view of the majority would mean a " repudiation of national obligations , " and that " these things are abhorrent " to himself and the three other associate justices . His striking utterance came as a complete Surprise , even though it had been believed that the court would split on the celebrated issue . The audience was spellbound , listening for every word ; as he went on in his Southern voice , government attorneys and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Majority Seen . What seemed to be stinging allusions to the ' majority came from Justice 's lips . Once he said that he and his fellows refused to use " mere generalities or a multitude of words " to distract the public mind from the basic issues . He scoffed at the idea that the framers of the Constitution would for a moment sanction repudiation of the " solemn pledges " of the gold clauses , which Congress had " swept away with a word . " He remarked that " . millions of dollars " had been invested with these " solemn pledges " as an assurance to investors . Chief Justice Hughes and Justices Brandeis , Stone , Roberts and Cardozo of the majority , sat silent while the former Attorney General in the Wilson Cabinet proceeded with his onslaught . One or two of the justices glanced slightly toward Justice as he declared that he did not want to talk about the present situation in the government , but that a Supreme Court Justice had a responsibility " to reveal in all its nakedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his attitude had come from Mr. while Chief Justice Hughes was reading the majority decisions , nor even while Justice Stone reviewed his criticism of the finding in the Perry issue . Leaning backward in his big leather chair , he rested his head on its cushion and for the most part looked with half closed eyes at the ceiling . Emphasizes Effects of Decision . As Justice Stone finished . however , Justice rested his arms on the bench and calmly announced that he and the three other justices could not agree with the majority . Almost immediately this calmness was replaced by emphasis . He raised his voice frequently to drive his points home . Sarcasm and irony were behind sentence after sentence as he went along . He spoke for twenty minutes . and as he took this method of expressing the written views of the minority , no transcript was made of his remarks . Newspaper men caught many , but not all , of his rapid words and phrases . No official record was made for the court . He stated early that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who wished to read it , but that it might be just as well to " rehearse " the conclusions of the minority " to see exactly what it means and just what the situation is . " " It . is a plain , simple tale , " he went on . Pausing , he added slowly but very distinctly : " It seems impossible to overestimate the result of what has been done here today . " Here he spoke of the Constitution , adding that it did not seem " too much to say that it is gone . " Says Guarantees Are Swept Away . " The guarantees to which men and women heretofore have looked to protect their interests have been swept away , " Justice continued . " The powers of Congress have been enlarged , and we stand as a people today stripped of the very fundamentals . " He declared that the picture was not overdrawn , and that in the days to come when " the panorama was unfolded " the truth would be seen . " The people expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he exclaimed . " A debased currency is nothing new . Nero undertook to exercise that power . Six centuries ago in France it was regarded as a prerogative of the sovereign . " On the strength of these obligations , hundreds of millions of dollars were loaned to the great corporations of the country . Bonds were sold to men , women and children throughout the world , " But Congress , Justice said , " may sweep away " the gold clauses " with a word , and in the face of the facts , declare it against public policy . " Solemn Promise of Congress Seen . Discussing Liberty Bonds , he said that Congress " executed a solemn bond " to pay in gold , " Billions and billions of dollars of these bonds were issued by this government with that solemn contract , " he continued . " During the World War men stood on the street corners and said these bonds were the finest in the world , with the solemn promise of the government back of them . They told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , 1933 , it had been decreed that all gold should come into the Treasury , and that there should be issued for that gold " any kind of money . " " For every dollar of gold we issued a depreciated currency , " the justice declared . He remarked that Congress had given to the President the right to depreciate the gold content of the dollar up to 50 per cent . Congress , he continued , saw necessary to pass a law " to destroy every one of these contracts for the payment of obligations in gold . " Relating the steps taken in the currency program , he said : " That 's the state to which our government has come . " I " This is not a thing I like to talk about , " he remarked later . " God knows I wish I did n't have to . But there are some responsibilities attaching to a man on this bench to reveal to the bar , in all its nakedness , just what has been done . " In one breath it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government obligation . In the next breath , It is said , it is true you have but 60 cents and you were promised a dollar , but Congress has made it unlawful for ? you to accept what you contracted for . Since it is unlawful for you to accept what you contracted for , you have not been damaged . " The Treasury says , ' Here is the depreciated dollar . You must accept it for your contract . ' The Treasury of a great nation says , ' Take this depreciated dollar . Congress made it unlawful for you to accept what is due you . ' And since it is unlawful there is no damage . " Justice remarked that he and the minority refused to use " mere generalities or a multitude of words to distract the mind " from the issues involved . " No one denies that Congress had the right to adopt a monetary system , but it does not follow that it can adopt any monetary system , " he continued . It was not intended to give Congress power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , he held , Almost a Wicked System . " Here we have a monetary system  --  the extent , I almost said the wickedness ? of which is almost beyond comprehension , " the justice continued . " First , we give the President power to depreciate the dollar to 50 cents . Next , we destroy all these private obligations by statute . Not only private obligations but government obligations as well . ' And so . having put out $500,000 , - 000 of gold clause bonds in May , Congress in July says all these contracts or promises to pay in gold are contrary to public policy . Having undertaken to destroy these gold clauses , the dollar is depreciated to 60 cents . Prices of commodi-1 ties can now be estimated in the deflated dollar , and now instead of a dollar we have 60 cents . " All mortgages of the railroads and the great corporations , all bank deposits . all insurance funds , everything the thrift of man has accumulated toward his old age is subject to this depreciation . No Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ever granted by the framers of the Constitution . It was not there then . It was not there yesterday . It is not there today . We are confronted with a condition in which the dollar may be reduced to 50 cents today , 30 cents tomorrow , 10 cents the next day and 1 cent the day after . " We are told that the government has made out of this transaction the royal sum of $2,800,000,000 , which now reposes in the Treasury . " On that basis , Mr. said , " you could depreciate the dollar to 10 cents or 5 cents and that would give you abundant capital to pay off the public debt and discharge the private obligations as well . " " That never was the law and it ought never to be the law , " he declared .
