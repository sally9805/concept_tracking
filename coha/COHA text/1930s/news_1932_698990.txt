txt Will Rogers Finds Athletes Outrunning the Politicians To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , Aug. 3 . ? It 's awful hard to get your mind on such insignificant things as Republican or Democratic candidates with 1,500 picked athletes of the world breaking records under your nose . If an athlete wins an event and do n't break a world record we hiss him out of the arena . Incidentally , the man that brought the first slaves to this country must have had these Olympic Games in mind , for these Senegambians have just about run the white man ragged . Every winner is either an American Negro or an American white woman . Wait till we get to golf , bridge , or cocktail shaking , then the American white man will come into his own . Everybody out here is predicting this California recordbreaking to continue right up till after Nov , . 4 , when Roosevelt will outrun Hoover , Tolan , Metcalfe , and maybe Babe Didrikson . Tours , WILL ROGERS .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
