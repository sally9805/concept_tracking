txt If Douglas G. Corrigan is to be punished for failure to observe laws and regulations in his unheralded flight to Ireland , it appeared here today his chastisement would be extremely light . . When news of the aviator 's feat was made known here , there was a visible raising of official eyebrows , but this served as well to reveal a kindly twinkling official eye , which may be a clue to the extent of Mr. Cor  --  igan 's future punishment , if any . Secretary of State Cordell Hull was informed of the flight just be . fore he received newspaper men for his usual daily press conference . As questions were- shot at him as to the government 's official attitude , Mr. Hull maintained , his usual calm , and observed the.news was " very interesting . " But there was a gleam in his eyes that bespoke his secret admiration for the- young flier 's feat , and he referred the reporters to the Commerce Department for its attitude on regulations that Mr. Corrigan broke when he left without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Denis Mulligan , director of the Bureau of Air Commerce , seemed pleased also at . Corrigan 's safe arrival at Dublin , but he confirmed the fact that the flier neither held , nor had applied for , a permit . Mr. Mulligan explained that Corrigan had discussed the matter of the flight with Air Commerce Bureau officials last Fall , but had made no application for the permit after the officials had discouraged the attempt on the theory that his equipment was inadequate . " It 's a great day in the history of the Irish people , and we do n't want to spoil their fun by talking about punishment , " Mr. Mulligan // foolhardiness  --  but we earnestly hope that there will not follow in his wake the usual host of aspirants who will want to ride to glory by the same route , which has been the history of spectacular flights during the past ten years .

" Our pat answer for the re ent is that we are taking the under advisement . " Mr. Mulligan said his main concern now was to prevent Corrigan from flying back from Ireland . He said every effort would be made to prevent this , but added with a shrug of " the shoulders that " you never can tell what an Irishman wilt do next . " Mr. Mulligan said Corrigan held a regular pilot 's license and an experimental license , which permitted him - to make experimental flights within the United States . The a.viat ? pr did not apply for a certificate that his plane was airworthy - or that he was competent to fly the Atlantic . Ordinarily the rbureau might punish an offending pilot by revoking or suspending his license . The State Department saw no difficulties in the situation , although Corrigan did not go through the formality of obtaining a passport or a visa from the Irish Legation . The problem , if any , is one for Ireland , officials said , because of the usual requirement for permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory of a foreign government . The State Department will do nothing about the matter unless there is a. protest from Ireland , but that is not expected . If Corrigan returns his plane to the United States , he will have complied with the only law the State Department might be compelled to invoke against him . That is the Neutrality Act , which requires a license of a person attempting to dispose of a plane abroad . If he flies or ships the plane back , this law will not apply to him . But the possibility that Corrigan might attempt to fly back worried Mr. Mulligan , who said that he not only wanted to prevent that from happening but desired to stop other young fliers from going off on a flight to or over foreign territory without a permit or United , States Government sanction . " The Bureau of Air Commerce acclaims his courage , but in the same breath admonishes him ' to be content with his newly won laurels and not attempt a return flight to America ; for the westbound passage , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastbound flight , " Mr. Mulligan said over the National Broadcasting Company 's Red network .
