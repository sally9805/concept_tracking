Almost axiomatic with Left-wing labor leaders is the belief that the U. S. labor movement will fail inevitably unless it includes Negro workers . William Z. Foster , generalissimo of the 1919 steel strike blamed the failure of his great drive directly on Negro labor . Some 85% of Negro labor is unskilled . Not only do Negroes work for less money than whites , but Negroes , particularly if raised in the South , are more impressed by demonstration of civil authority , more easily cowed by tough company tactics . Moreover , Negroes , having been barred , openly or tacitly , from many an old line union , have little incentive to stand by white strikers , although C. I. O. has embraced Negroes more willingly than A. F. of L. , which frequently carries discrimination to the point of segregating them in " Jim Crow unions " affiliated with its regular craft unions . The only Negro-controlled international union in the U. S. is the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters . <P> Last week in Manhattan 's Harlem , the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory was a contract signed in Chicago with The Pullman Co. , and the meeting was a triumphant welcome by the Harlem porters for the returning Brotherhood president , A. ( for Asa ) Philip Randolph who brought back some $2,000,000 in pay increases . Minimum wage for train porters was hiked from $77.50 per month to $89.50 . For maids from $75 to $97.50. * A basic 240-hour month was established , time-and-a-half for overtime provided after 260 hours , working rules &; regulations agreed upon . <P> President Randolph 's contract was the product of a twelve-year campaign . Born in Crescent City , Fla. in 1889 , the son of a Methodist preacher , he made his name as founder-editor of the crusading Negro Messenger . For his opposition to U. S. participation in the War , he was officially branded as the " most dangerous Negro in America . " Once he received a threat on his life in the form of a bloody human hand , mailed from Louisiana . <P> In 1925 Asa Philip Randolph began organizing porters . Having been duped in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union for a price . By 1929 the union had gained A. F. of L. Federal charters , but recognition from Pullman was not forthcoming . President Randolph carried his case to the old Board of Mediation , to the Interstate Commerce Commission , to a Federal Court . First success came in 1934 when the Railway Labor Act was amended , outlawing company unions , guaranteeing collective bargaining and-at the behest of President Randolph-bringing porters within the scope of the law . Membership jumped , and the next year when the National Mediation Board held an election the Brotherhood beat a reorganized company union , 6,000 to 1,400 . Subsequent conferences with Pullman bogged down , requiring intervention of the Mediation Board . Last year the Brotherhood was granted its international charter , and last month , after five months at the conference table , the contract was finally signed . Diplomatic President Randolph declared last week : " The Brotherhood and The Pullman Co. are now enjoying the most cordial relations . . . .
