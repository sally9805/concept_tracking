Before Adolf Hitler came to power , tall , flabby Dr. Hans Frank , one of the first Nazis , was kept busy defending brown-shirted terrorists in German courts and figuring out legal ways &; means for the Nazis to take over the Government . Since Jan. 30 , 1933 , Dr. Frank has been even more occupied writing a Nazi Penal Code , compiling briefs proving the Third Reich 's legal rights to its conquests , thinking up new methods to milk the Jews of their money and jobs . <P> It was Dr. Frank who introduced " love of the Fhrer " into Nazi Germany as a " legal concept . " He also invented the notion of " civic death , " whereby the Nazis ' enemies would be denied all legal existence and hence would have no rights , recourse to law or protection . Instead of " no punishment without law , " Dr. Frank 's motto was " no crime without punishment . " Besides being a Minister Without Portfolio and Reich 's Commissioner for Justice , Dr. Frank is also president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Occupied Territories in Poland . Last week his various duties kept him hopping : <P> &gt; In Berlin , before the Academy , Lawyer Frank defined Germany 's new code as " war law , " predicted that these Nazi principles of law would soon become a part of world law . " The maxim ' Right is whatever profits a nation ; wrong is whatever harms it , ' marked the beginning of our legal work , " Dr. Frank keynoted . " Pale phantoms of objective justice do not exist for us any more . . . . The transition from the normal status of National Socialist legal thinking to thinking in terms of the law of war is being accomplished without grave upheavals . . . . The decisive principle is , who is stronger , who is more determined , who has better nerves ? Whoever does not admit this is a pale theorist and is no good for politics or , in the deepest sense , for creative law-giving . " <P> &gt; Back in Cracow , Poland , from where he governs some 15,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving by special train . Two years ago Dr. Frank called Germany the " protector against Bolshevistic terror " and said that the Germans would have " no dealings with Communism in Moscow or elsewhere . " But last week the visiting Bolshevists were treated to a ceremonial tour around the historic old city . Then they sat down to arrange details whereby 800,000 Ukrainians and White Russians in German-occupied territory would be handed over to the " Bolshevistic terror " in exchange for 100,000 Germans in Russian-occupied Poland who would return to the Nazi homeland . <P> <P> *Report had it last week that numerous bands of Polish guerrillas actively resisting the German Government necessitated calling out four German divisions for " cleaning up " operations .
