Three students of French blood from small Canadian towns last week fired their fellows at Laval University to take up walking sticks against Vice in the big city of Quebec . Laval 's Three Musketeers , Gilles Ayotte , Paul Emile Brazeau and Jean Paul Tremblay , did not act until they had on their side a recent angry declaration in the Quebec Court of Sessions by Judge Laetare Roy that the authorities were " flagrantly failing in their duty " to stamp out Vice . After reading this the French-Canadian students sallied forth one night last week , broke into eight houses of prostitution in succession , whacked naked inmates upon the buttocks , upset beds and tore up bedding , ripped lighting fixtures from the walls and otherwise proved their collegiate Virtue . <P> By this time Quebec cohorts of Vice , in the persons of the city 's taxi drivers , had gone violently to the rescue of girls and madams , swinging monkey wrenches and auto jacks in their onslaughts upon Virtue 's students . In the thick of the battle Quebec patrons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into closets and under beds . When finally police began to arrive and make arrests the students were nearly victorious , shoving the few remaining girls out of doors into the cold autumn night . <P> Proudly in court appeared bandaged Musketeers Ayotte , Brazeau and Tremblay to answer charges of " disorderly conduct , creating a disturbance , and causing damage to property . " Proudly behind them on spectators ' benches sat scores of students who had escaped arrest but not injury , as their bandages and sticking-plaster showed . <P> Quebec braced itself for a Vice trial in which the students ' lawyers prepared to expose in detail conditions in that city and in Montreal . <P> Looking wise , local journalists wrote that tourists seldom learn of these cities ' numerous resorts , mostly patronized by Canadians . Worst of Montreal Vice , opined local reporters , is the depression-bred habit of some impecunious high school girls , who earn pin money by stopping briefly after school in questionable houses , then go on home to their unsuspecting and respectable parents .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
