 | Japanese Poaching in Alaskan Waters By Marc A. Rose BERING SEA has become an arm of Tokyo Bay , " says a pamphlet recently published in Japan . Backing the provocative words with action , a fleet of 101 Japanese vessels this summer strung fishing gear for 200 miles along the coast of Bristol Bay , Alaska , incomparably the best salmon fishing region in the world . Ostensibly they were after crabs , but Alaskan fishermen suspected the Japanese plan was to stand outside the threemile limit and pack salmon aboard floating canneries . Despite Tokyo 's official denials , the Alaskans were right . One Japanese " mother ship , " the Taiyo Maru , was seen from the air to have some 20,000 fresh-caught salmon spread on its decks . It was seen again half-loaded , judging by its water line , with wooden cases of canned salmon still on deck . Planes with Bureau of Fisheries and State Department observers aboard swooped down within ' co feet of the Japanese vessels , low enough to identify salmon nets and even to read labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating cannery , said the Coast Guard , had " drift nets as far as the eye could reach . " Crab nets do not float . Says Frank W. Bell , Commissioner of the Bureau of Fisheries , " Undoubtedly the Japanese have been chiseling ; they have not lived up to their assurances . " Our own citizens are only allowed to fish in Bristol Bay with nets 900 feet long , of 5-inch mesh , between certain dates and on certain days of the week . Even then , they may take only half of the schools , permitting the rest to escape upstream and spawn . That is n't the Japanese way of fishing . The Japanese ships laid impassable nets three miles long in the fish migration lanes . Then they set gill nets ( of unknown mesh ) in V traps seaward from the barrier . This is a murderous salmon trap . Did the Japanese stay outside the three-mile limit ? Who knows ? These are among the loneliest waters on earth . Once a month in summer the mail steamship passes . Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything can happen . The Alaskan pack of salmon was worth $5o , ooo , ooo last year , built up to that all-time peak by rigid conservation measures . The industry employs 17,500 men ; it provides half the income of Alaskan residents , pays 75 percent of the Territory 's taxes . Salmon alone have produced a third more revenue than gold and all other miner-  | als combined , shipped from Alaska since 1867 . It is no wonder , then , that protests poured into Washington and that mass meetings on the West Coast passed angry resolutions . The situation has the makings of a first-class international row , as serious as our troubles with Japan over immigration . Our State Department professionally deprecates the excitement . It had official word from Tokyo that no licenses were issued to Japanese vessels for salmon fishing in Bristol Bay this year and that none will be issued at least until 1939 ? cold comfort at best . But hard-headed fishermen were not reassured . The kind of nets the Japanese used and the extent of their operations convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the giant crabs , which for some reason our canners neglect . And eventually their suspicions were confirmed . Appearance of the fleet was not a complete surprise . Last year , the Hakuyo Maru , a Japanese government ship with a complement of scientists , spent some time in Bristol Bay . It packed 600 cases of salmon , experimentally . It was back again this year . The Japanese Diet had made an appropriation for a three-year investigation of the commercial possibilities of deep-sea fishing in the region . Tokyo said operations in 1937 were to be merely part of the threeyear research program . " Research , with 10t vessels ? " Alaskans asked . The two governments have been polite and punctilious . Private citizens have not been so discreet . There has been fiery talk by our people in which the ugly word , " boycott , " has bobbed up . Japanese commercial interests have used irritating language . The " Society of Oceanic Fishing Promotion , " with its offices in the same Tokyo building that houses the Japanese salmon canners , issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international waters , and ridiculing the contention that Bering Sea salmon are American property . Then there was T. Takasaki , manager of a large Japanese can manufacturing company . He appeared in Seattle early this year with a long memorandum which he presented to a meeting of American salmon fishermen and canners . God had not given Japan great natural resources , said Mr. Takasaki 's document , but God had evened up by endowing the Japanese with a remarkable talent for fishing . Evidently it was God 's intent that the Japanese should develop their unique talent to the utmost to take care of Japan 's millions of people . The only opportunity left for further expansion of Japan 's fisheries is in the deep seas . That is why the Japanese have perfected the floating  | cannery , which has been a great success . It was so efficient in salmon fishing off the coasts of Kamchatka that the shore canneries , also Japanese-owned , suffered and complained . Whereupon the government made the shore and floating canneries consolidate into one monopoly , with curtailment of offshore operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of job " deep-sea canners have applied to the government for license to fish off Alaskan coasts . Japanese labor is very cheap ? men on the cannery ships get $39 a month out of which they feed themselves , said Mr. Takasaki . ( He exaggerated the wages . ) Would it not be mutually profitable , Mr. Takasaki asked , for American and Japanese capital to combine and operate off Alaskan shores , the Japanese to supply ships and labor ? Mr. Takasaki never hinted in any way that he represented the Japanese government , but knowing the relations between government and big business in Japan , his hearers drew their own inference . Japan was proposing to participate in fisheries that exist solely because of our conservation laws . Mr. Takasaki did n't say , " Share ? or else ? " but this year 's fleet suggested the alternative he possibly had in mind . To understand the angry consternation on our Pacific Coast , remember that of all fish , salmon are the most vulnerable to the attacks of man . We have proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dint of long self-discipline . Every salmon is born an orphan . The parents scoop out hollows for the eggs in the gravel bed of a clear stream or lake , then cover them , and stand guard together until both die . The young fish make their way to the sea while they are still midgets . Some years later , they reappear in great schools , fight their way past rapids and falls sometimes for a thousand miles up the stream in which they were born . They eat nothing after they leave salt water , so that they steadily become thinner and weaker . Arriving at their birthplace , they spawn and die . Pink salmon live for two years , red salmon for five , some other kinds for three , but for each variety , the life cycle is rigid and unvarying . Their annual arrival can be forecast almost to the day . Close the mouth of a stream with nets ? cork it , as the fishermen say ? and you will catch all of that year 's run . But two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literally none . Salmon are not only easiest to net , but are best to eat just as they enter fresh water . It is true also ? surprising as it may seem ? that if too many fish go upstream to spawn , the result will be fewer young fish , not more . Around these  | two basic facts we have built our conservation measures . Fishing is permitted in Bristol Bay only in specified areas near the shore and only with gill nets . Half of the fish must be allowed to escape . Government men with counting machines keep tally as the salmon swim past a submerged white board in a narrow gate . The nearby cannery packing the fish from that stream reports its catch daily . It must not run ahead of the number of fish that escape upstream . If it does , the cannery must close until the count is evened up . Now if foreign fishing boats should stretch great nets three miles offshore , this conservation system would be completely upset . There could be no check-up of the fish they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely the full-sized salmon driven to the river mouths by the spawning instinct , but perhaps the smaller fish . Apparently this is what happened off Kamchatka . Japanese scientists themselves report that the average size of salmon caught there decreased steadily when the floating canneries went to work . If Japan would only apply our conservation regulations to her own salmon fisheries , she would not need to fish in our waters . The Alaska Fishermen 's Union telegraphed Washington that it believed the Japanese would destroy Bristol Bay salmon fishing in five years ? one cycle for the red salmon . That probably was exaggeration , but the threat is serious enough . The runs would not have to be wholly wiped out to make the shore canneries unprofitable . Even disregarding conservation , we can not operate deep-sea floating canneries . Our seamen 's labor laws would make them much more expensive than shore canneries . Well , what can be done ? There are precedents , but they are distinctly unhelpful . Take the case of the fur seals . They also return annually from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rookeries are on United States territory . Japanese , Russian and Canadian vessels , unable to land crews on our soil , used to hover offshore and kill the seals as they migrated , and also kill them when they left their young and swam out for food . They drew no sex line , and every female slaughtered meant that a pup , born or unborn , must die . They recovered not more than one out of four seals killed ; the bodies would sink before they could be reached by the boats . The seal herds were being exterminated . The United States asserted that the seals were American property , since they bred on American soil . This claim was disallowed when the matter went to international arbitration . Canada , having no rookeries of her own , demanded  | compensation if offshore sealing was to be abolished by agreement . The upshot was that in 1911 , the United States and Russia agreed to pay both Japan and Canada 15 percent of the value of the yearly catch . The United States patrols the waters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands herd has been built up from 215,000 in 1912 to 1,800,000 in 1937 . Meantime , we have taken 700,000 pelts . The Japanese apparently believe they can muscle their way into the salmon fisheries in the same way ; between extermination of the fisheries and sharing them , we might well choose to share . That something like this is in the Japanese mind is evident from the fact that they have made direct allusion to the precedent , pointing out that an international tribunal rejected our claim that the seals were our property , and remarking that our claim to the salmon is just as tenuous . The difference to us is that all parties profited by the sealing treaty ; by cooperation , the herds have been built up . But the salmon runs already have been restored entirely by our own action . The Alaskan pack of 8,300,000 cases in 1936 is believed to be the maximum attainable on a permanent basis . Any concession to Japan therefore can do nothing for us , and must come out of our pockets . Another precedent distinctly embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we please , so long as we stay three miles offshore . It happens that our fishermen persistently take tuna just outside the three-mile limit on the west coast of Mexico . Mexico does n't like it , and has said so on numerous occasions . One suggestion already made is that we negotiate an international salmon agreement . The Japanese are willing enough ; Dr. Seiji Konda of the Japanese Department of Agriculture proposed in August , 1936 , that the United States and Canada join with Japan in a " scientific investigation of eastern Pacific fisheries . " But Japan has nothing to trade for any salmon concession ; we shall merely be buying her off . If we decide to do so , there are , however , some relatively inexpensive offers we might make . Our laws now do not permit the Japanese to ship directly to our ports the crabs they catch and can in Bristol Bay . Although we buy the greater share of the pack , it first has to be taken to Japan . We might permit it to be brought here direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the swordfish we eat comes frozen from Japan , whether you know it or not . A tariff concession on swordfish would affect comparatively few fishermen here and very little invested capital .  | Retaliation , of course , is possible . Despite our own big pack , we are Japan 's best customers for canned salmon and canned crabs , next to the British Empire . Canada might persuade Great Britain to join us in refusing to admit Japanese canned seafood unless Japan kept her salmon canneries on the other side of the Pacific . Canada 's interest is already manifest ; if the Japes get away with it in Alaska , there is nothing to stop them working further down the coast . But the difficulty is that Great Britain is touchy about Japan and eager for cheap food . One constructive solution would be a treaty to include all the north Pacific powers ? Japan , Canada , Mexico , the Soviet Republics and the United States ? binding all parties to the same conservation measures . Failing to cooperate , Japan would appear in a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not too hopeful an idea ; Japan has refused to sign the whaling convention which every other nation concerned has accepted . And her regard for world opinion , judging from recent events , is small . Senator Lewis B. Schwellenbach of the State of Washington suggested to the Senate that Canada and the United States might write new international law by jointly declaring the whole continental shelf to be their exclusive fishing area . Anthony J. Dimond , Alaskan delegate in Congress , think- ing along somewhat the same lines , introduced such a bill on June 17 , just a week after the big Japanese fishing fleet appeared . Bristol Bay is 15o miles across , and 15o miles long . Here is a body of water entirely inside American headlands and in no place 600 feet deep , yet if the three-mile convention be accepted , most of its 10 ; 000 square miles are international waters , the high seas . Whereabouts of the salmon between spawning runs used to be a mystery , but the best scientific opinion now is that they never go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow waters . With this background , consider Mr. Dimond 's bill . It declares the salmon spawned and hatched in the waters of Alaska to be the property of the United States . Jurisdiction of the United States for the protection of her salmon industry shall extend in all cases four leagues ( 12 miles ) seaward and also to all waters off the coast that are less than zoo fathoms deep . ( That means all of Bristol Bay , and the halibut banks to the southeast . ) In the enforcement area , officers of the Coast Guard or the Bureau of Fisheries may board and examine any vessel , and , if it has been violating fishing regulations , confiscate it , its gear and merchandise , and fine and imprison its owners and operators .  | If such a law were upheld , it would protect not only the salmon , but also the halibut fisheries which the United States and Canada are successfully rebuilding through a treaty which gives the International Halibut Commission broad powers to enforce closed seasons , closed areas , type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken outside the three-mile limit ; the fish hover just on the edge of the continental shelf . Last spring , the Thorland , a Norwegian trawler backed by British capital , prepared to enter the Pacific and catch 2,000,000 pounds of halibut , 10 percent of the total U.S. - Canadian quota for the year . ( American fishermen are not allowed to use trawlers , by the way . ) The Canadian government did some diplomatic work in London , and the threat was averted , for the present . But when will some other nation decide to strip the halibut banks ? For that matter , if we buy off Japan in the salmon fisheries , how long before another nation has to be bought off ? The Dimond bill copies faithfully the language of the AntiSmuggling Act of 1935 . Long hearings on that bill went deeply into the traditions of the three-mile limit . The leading experts on international law agreed pretty well that there is nothing sacred about three miles . Several nations assert their complete territorial authority far beyond that belt . Nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from waters in which their authority is as complete as it is on shore . Our own customs vessels , for example , maintain their right to visit vessels 12 miles at sea . The most important decision on which Congress relied in drawing the Anti-Smuggling Act was handed down by John Marshall in 1804 . The Portuguese government had seized the Aurora , an American ship , more than 12 miles off the coast of Brazil and on discovering that she was engaged in illicit trade ? which meant merely that she was attempting to trade with a Portuguese colony ? confiscated her . The great Chief Justice ruled that Portugal was wholly within her rights : a nation 's " power to secure itself from injury may certainly be exercised beyond the limits of its territory . " " If that is good doctrine in dealing with violators of customs laws , why is n't it a sound way to deal with violators of our fishing laws ? " Mr. Dimond wants to know . The answer probably is that it is just . fine ? if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
