Fortnight ago The New Yorker discovered a family of three who had moved out of a $125-a-month apartment in mid-Manhattan , taken to living in their two-room trailer jacked up in a Broadway parking lot for $25 a month . First such case to make news in dense New York City , this was only an inkling of a problem that is vexing local authorities and real-estate owners all over the U. S. <P> According to the latest estimate of the American Automobile Association , there are 1,000,000 people living in trailers . Most of these are constantly on the move . But many have settled down at one spot . The question thus arises : Is the trailer a taxable home or a nontaxable automobile accessory ? Last week , in tiny Orchard Lake , Mich. , the first court to study the question handed down an answer of tremendous importance to the rapidly growing horde of trailerfolk . <P> In the summer of 1935 a Pontiac , Mich. factory mechanic named Hildred Gumarsol drove his trailer to Orchard Lake , removed the wheels , jacked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the summer . Several other trailers followed suit , paying the owner of the land the usual small parking fee . Most of them drove away at summer 's end , but Gumarsol left his trailer there all winter , returned last summer to live in it again . Last month , angry owners of nearby real estate brought suit , charging that he was violating a village ordinance by living in a dwelling with less than 400 sq . ft. of floor space . Gumarsol retorted that his trailer was licensed as an automobile accessory . Legally , the case thus hinged on a single local law . But all participants admitted that it pointed up the greater issues of whether trailers should be taxed as personal property or as realty , and whether trailerfolk may continue their present carefree , taxfree , squatter way of life or are to be regulated by a set of brand-new laws . <P> With these weighty matters hanging on his word , Justice of the Peace Arthur Green took several weeks to decide . Meanwhile , the village council levied a prohibitory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hildred Gumarsol , who at first talked of going to the State Supreme Court if necessary , became so pessimistic that he packed up his trailer , left town , first martyr of the brave new trailer world . Last week his pessimism was justified . Justice Green held trial with Gumarsol absent . His decision : that Gumarsol had violated the law and that " trailer shantytowns " would no longer be allowed in Orchard Lake . Fining Defendant Gumarsol only $1 plus $3.10 costs , Justice Green declared : " We gave him a break because we knew this was an important test case . "
