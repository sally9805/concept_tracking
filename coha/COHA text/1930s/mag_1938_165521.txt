As political quarterback Franklin Roosevelt returned on the U.S.S. Houston last weekend toward his " humiture " - ridden , politically fermenting country , he could have added up his political score , based on the week 's primary elections in six States , about as follows : Kentucky-an all-important , extremely satisfying New Deal touchdown in the renomination of Majority Leader " Dear Alben " Barkley for the Senate ( see p. 10 ) . <P> Tennessee -a safety in the defeat of Senator George L. Berry , a questionable New Deal asset , by a " 100% Roosevelt man , " in a contest fought on local issues ( see col. 1 ) . <P> Missouri - a field goal against the New Deal in the renomination of Senator Bennett Champ Clark . This adverse score was light because Senator Clark was not actively fought by Roosevelt &; Co. , and his two 100% New Deal opponents were worthy political nobodies . The heaviness ( 400,000 majority ) of the vote for Senator Clark , who opposed the Court Plan , Reorganization and other Roosevelt legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comfort for the New Deal could be found in the victory of Judge James M. Douglas of St. Louis , candidate of New Dealish Governor Stark for the State Supreme Court , by 117,000 votes over Judge James V. Billings of Kennett , candidate of non-New Dealish Boss Tom Pendergast of Kansas City . <P> West Virginia - an easy first down , but scarcely a score , for the New Deal in the renomination of all six incumbent Representatives , all New Dealers . Three were unopposed , three opposed only weakly . <P> Virginia - a field goal and a first down against the New Deal in the renomination of Representative Howard Worth Smith of Alexandria and the defeat of Representative Norman R. Hamilton of Portsmouth . Mr. Smith 's opponent was William E. Dodd Jr. , 32 , son of Franklin Roosevelt 's former Ambassador to Germany , picked to run against Judge Smith by Roosevelt henchmen who consider Judge Smith too independent ( he helped delay the Wages &; Hours Bill ) . Candidate Dodd was given a campaign manager from Attorney General Cummings ' staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria home is in the district ) . <P> Secretary Ickes attacked Representative Smith for him . His slogan was : " A vote for Dodd is a vote for Roosevelt . " But young Mr. Dodd was unknown , inexperienced , no political fireball . Mr. Smith , after four terms in the House , has a potent personal organization , allied with Senator Byrd 's . He promised Virginians only that he would continue to vote his convictions , suh , as a good Virginian should . They renominated him by 3-to-1 over young Son Dodd . <P> Representative Hamilton 's defeat was closer , about 19-to-17 , by Colgate W. <P> Darden Jr . of Norfolk , whom Representative Hamilton unseated two years ago . In their contest , the New Deal issue was less clear-cut , Mr. Hamilton only accusing Mr. <P> Darden of being a member of Senator Harry Flood Byrd 's machine , who might be anti-Roosevelt.
