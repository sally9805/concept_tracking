W E HAVE occasionally had letters from women of ninety , still keenly interested , as all women should be as long as they live , in making themselves easy to look upon , But this is the first letter I have ever had from a little lady of nine . It asks a question many mothers have asked me in behalf of some small son or daughter , and the fact that Janet herself real-izes the gravity of her problem shows that she is a pretty intelligent young person . She writes : I would be very glad if you would tell me , how I can stop biting my finger nails . I am only nine years old , but I would like to have nice nails when I grow up . You have already begun the cure , Janet , because you have no ticed how ugly bitten nails look , and I think you need go only a little further in order to be cured entirely . Be proud of your hands , even a little vain of them . Keep them very smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers so that the half-moons show nicely . Get a little manicure set and keep the nails filed and beautifully shaped . Then you wo n't have the heart to gnaw and spoil anything so pretty . And if you keep forgetting , and find yourself nibbling absent-mindedly , ask your mother to buy you a preparation to put on your nails to make them taste bitter so that you will be reminded of your wish to keep them nice . Here is another nail problem from an older reader : I am wondering if you can suggest something that will help brittle finger nails with rough , ridged surfaces . So far as I know , the cause of ridged finger nails , which are almost always brittle , has not yet been determined . People who have them notice that at times the ridges disappear and the nails become normal for a while . This indicates that the ridges are caused by some easily corrected physical condition . It may be a matter of diet . A dermatologist to whom I talked about the problem said that he advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out whether one was getting enough rest , enough sunshine , and a sufficient amount of the protective foods such as milk , fresh fruit , and fresh vegetables . You can make your nails look better by oiling them every night to keep them and the cuticle as soft as 100 possible . When you manicure them , butt with dry polish first to smooth the surface somewhat , then remove this completely , and apply liquid polish . The sculptured , close-to-the-head coifEVERY cosmetic which bears the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval was put through a searching test before it was finally approved . This test included a chemical analysis and a practical test of the claims made for it . Are the products you are using approved by Good Housekeeping ? If you would like to know , send Ruth Murrin the names of those you are using , together with a stamped , addressed envelope for reply , and she will tell you . She is always glad to answer your questions , either with a bulletin or a personal letter fures which we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly carefree curlyheads . This writer tells the story : My hair is black , much too thick , and so much too curly that it is almost kinky . I have had it thinned several times , but the short ends grow in and stand in fuzzy ends on top of my head and look very untidy . My hair is coarse and dry except near the scalp , where it is soft and glossy , and is too bushy to be pretty . Can you tell me anything that will make it look better ? I have tried an oily tonic and brilliantine without success . Too curly hair is like permanently waved hair , and needs the same treatment . Have a hairdresser give you a finger wave with a wave-set lotion , and practice until you can do it for yourself . The waving fluid straightens out the frizziness in a surprising way , and leaves the hair soft and glossy , while the finger wave molds it into a becoming coiffure . This will seem like a lot of trouble to most curlyheads , but ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the effort . Why the idea that washing is bad for the hair persists in a nation devoted to baths , I do n't know , but this question often comes to me for an answer : How often do you advise washing the hair ? Mine becomes oily about four days after being washed . Some people say it hurts your hair to wash it every week . Mine is thin and fine , and I do n't want to wash away what little I have . Still I hate to have it oily . What do you think about it ? Wash your hair as often as is necessary to keep it clean and attractive . The brisk rubbing during the shampoo stimulates the circulation , and the suds clear the scalp of scales and dirt . Both results should encourage the healthy growth of hair . Certainly frequent shampoos make one 's hair nicer to look at , nicer to touch , and nicer to smell . I have an oily skin , and I use nothing on it but soap and water and a good face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines around my eyes , and I have wondered if I should use a lubricating cream . Is this ever permissible for a skin like mine ? Yes , indeed , you can and should use an emollient cream for those incipient crows ' - feet . But just put the cream only where it is needed ; do n't use it over your entire face . There are a number of very nice eye creams made especially to keep the lids smooth and to prevent crows ' - feet . Here is a complexion problem that troubles many women over twenty-five : On my cheeks there are hard little white spots the size of a pinhead . I think they are called whiteheads . Can I get rid of them ? Whiteheads , or milia , as the doctors call them , are generally due to unbalanced diet . They may be due to sluggish skin , and better care will prevent them . You can remove these by pricking them with a needle which has been sterilized in a flame , or better still , have them removed by electrolysis. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
