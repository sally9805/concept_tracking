The huge new German conscript Army which Adolf Hitler has been raising in violation of the Treaty of Versailles was ordered by the Realmleader to take its oath of loyalty to himself &; Germany this week and thus come officially into being . This new German war machine , rapidly assembling last week , consists of some 170,000 professional soldiers and more than 200,000 conscripts who will soon swell to 500,000 . Adolf Hitler , " Apotheosis of the Little Man , " never rose above corporal 's rank during the War and today lavishes unheard-of comforts on happy German soldiers . Crews of carpenters were busy last week replacing great , grim Prussian barrack rooms with small , snug squad rooms equipped with easy chairs , tables , cheerful curtains , hardwood floors and such lavish tiled lavatories as no other European army can boast .
