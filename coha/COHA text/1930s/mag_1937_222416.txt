Quietly knitting a dark blue sweater for his fiance-who last week legally changed her name to Wallis Warfield - the Duke of Windsor sat in the Chteau de Cande last week through the broadcast of his brother 's Coronation ( see p. 15 ) . Acting as unofficial press representative , the Duke 's faithful U. S. friend , Herman Rogers , issued to newshawks genteel snippets of information : legally changing Mrs. Simpson 's name had cost $2.50 . . . . Mrs. Warfield had put aside Ernest Simpson 's engagement ring for a new emerald from the Duke . ... On Coronation night there was a dinner and card party at the chateau . <P> " We all had a swell time last night , " said Mr. Rogers . <P> The happy couple posed easily for press photographers , one of whom snapped them going into action ( see cut ) .

At week 's end news of a compromise of a sort emerged . <P> Out at Windsor a tweed-capped workman climbed a stepladder in St. George 's Chapel ( lodge room of the Knights of the Garter ) , took down the armorial banner of the Duke of Windsor above his stall ( first on the right ) and moved it three places down the line . This meant that in the ritual of the Garter and in the British peerage , the Duke of Windsor would rank fourth , after the King and his brothers Gloucester and Kent , so that even should Wallis Warfield be accorded rank as a royal duchess there would be no chance of her taking precedence over her sisters-in-law . <P> After the marriage of Queen Elizabeth to the then Duke of York she was raised to the rank of royal duchess by a special order signed by George V.
