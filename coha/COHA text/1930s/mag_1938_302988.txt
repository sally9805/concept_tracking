The best of Latin American Presidents is at least half a dictator , and burly Agustin P. Justo of Argentina , although he loves to dress in the most correct cut of cutaway , is no better than the best . <P> Pleasantly surprised were Argentine politicos when Justo announced last fall that he would retire at the end of the single consecutive six-year term allowed him by the Argentine Constitution . Not so surprised were politicos when Justo hand-picked his successor , Dr. Roberto M. Ortiz , his Finance Minister . In Argentine politics the Government nominee usually wins . When the votes were counted five months ago Justo 's man had done even better . He had rolled up the largest popular vote in the country 's history . <P> Happy , therefore , was inauguration day in Buenos Aires last week as Agustin Justo turned over the President 's palatial Casa Rosada ( " Pink House " ) , the Presidential sash and ebony gold-headed cane to Roberto Ortiz . Six huge U. S. bombers ( see p. 77 ) demonstrated over the city as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 51 , President Ortiz belongs to none of Argentina 's influential " old families . " From an importing firm and small law practice in 1910 he has built a $4,000,000 fortune . Last week , as he took over the Presidency , he had the backing of foreign and Argentine financial interests , who expect an era of good business under their businessman-President . In a country where foreign capital has some $4,000,000,000 invested and where exports of the livestock and agricultural barons are 90% of the nation 's business , it looked as if they would get what they wanted .
