txt Of all the results of the visit of the King and Queen to Canada , which ends with their sailing from Halifax this evening , probably none is more significant to those who watch anxiously over the affairs of empire than the emergence of a deeper feeling of maturity and a higher sense of responsibility in the senior dominion of the Commonwealth. / Canada 's record needs no defense when contributions to the Empire are counted but there have been hints and rumors in recent years and even months of a new attitude which perhaps would not include the full and wholehearted support which the Government at Westminster had come to expect from Canada . The voice of the Dominion . was not heard in London last September when other members of the Commonwealth indicated that they were ready to offer their unconditional support to Great Britain . There were , too , whisperings of isolation and even secession , which while they were no more substantial than whispers seemed to indicate a changed attitude towards the Empire and the Crotim . But , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection and loyalty Their Majesties have been told how Can ada feels about the throne and the Empire . As Halifax drops astern through the dusk tonight those two monarchs must feel a quiet strength that defies the weariness and tells them that all is right in their Dominion of Canada . Not only has the tumultuous reception of Their Majesties been a revelation and a joy to the King and Queen but it has come almost as a surprise to some Canadian politicians , who , not because of any disloyalty but because they felt that the bonds between the Empire and the Dominion had slackened with the years , had come to the conclusion that there was no longer the fervent adoration which the Crown had once inspired . Even in French-Canada , where the throne is not regarded with the profound respect that it enjoys in English Canada ( so some observers had decided until May , 1939 ) , there were welcomes and exhibitions of loyalty which on at least one occasion brought tears to the eyes of the King and queen . Loyal Reception Everywhere It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Quebec there was less cheering than in the districts where the sprinkling of English-speaking residents was greater . This has been explained by recalling that the French Quebec are descendants of a race of Hoyalists , e they are not modern Frenchmen , and to them as to their forebears the Crown was for many years regarded with quiet respect akin to reverence . There could be no doubting , however , the depth and sincerity of the feeling of those people who have for years been cast by tradition in a passive and indifferent role . The same was true in Western Canada , where in Saskatchewan especially , there are entire districts populated by foreign-born Canadians and their first-generation Canadian offspring . Here was the same demonstration of loyalty and affection . Cheers leap from emotional stimulation , and probably offer an unstable base upon which to build political judgments . But those whose ears are attuned to the voice of the people in that type of thunder are framing opinions and they are , almost without exception , that in those cheers is a clear indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been indications of Canadian opinion , gleaned from observers , politicians and groups but not for years has there been an opportunity to get a mass reaction upon this subject . So , it appears as though Canadian steadfastness and loyalty , especially among the non-English-speaking groups has been underestimated . Whether or not the upward revision of this estimate will be reflected in Canada 's foreign policy can not be seen at this early date . The assurance and confidence which the expression of fealty must surely give to those entrusted with the affairs of Empire will probably be sufficient without the added voice of government for a time at leasts . There are particular questions about Canada 's attitude upon foreign affairs which must remain unanswered . Questions of participation in a foreign conflict or intervention in European affairs on behalf of the Empire after all can not be answered precisely by cheers , but indications can be given and Canada has given very strong indications as to how it feels on all subjects related to the Empire and the Crown . That is enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know . It was through such outwardly formal ceremonies as that which took place in the Senate Chamber , when the King nodded assent to several bills and by so doing became in truth the King of Canada , that there came to the people of this country the full realization of their Nation 's status as the senior Dominion . There was in what has been called the King 's " Canadian Coronation " a fulfillment . The Statute of Westminster , which in 1931 gave Canada equal national status with the other members of the Commonwealth , became a fact during the visit of the King and Queen . A political and social maturing seemed to be taking place each day the King and Queen were among their people . And with that coming of age there seemed to come , in the mysterious way that a nation expresses its consciousness and itself , a feeling of responsibility and a desire , to serve the royal force which has helped to make Canada the Nation it is . History Enriched It was significant that Their Majesties insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to them that the Empire in this part of the world must look for its strength and maintenance in the years to come . By their visit the King and Queen shaped traditions , left memories and legends and by this enrichment of the history of the Nation probably did as much to strengthen the ties of Empire as they did by fulfilling the constitutional purposes of the Statute of Westminster . Their trip can not be counted less than a triumph , ending as it did in a great , warm welcome in the United States and a tumultuous return to French-Canada and then a final three days in the Maritime Provinces ? the cradle of confederation . The probable effect upon world affairs has been estimated and can only be revealed by the years and the peoples joined together by the strong bonds of friendship ? bonds which have been tested and found firm by two wise and friendly monarchs who must surely return to their task with the satisfaction of a job well done .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
