txt Plans for a systematic city-wide unemployment relief program for next Winter were discussed yesterday at a cbnference in City Han between Acting Mayor and representatives of charity organizations . The program contemplated is to dovetail with the plans now being worked out by a committee of prominent bankers headed by Harvey D. Gibson , president of the Manufacturers Trust Company , which is to raise a large fund , probably more than $10,000,000 , to provide jobs for unemployed heads of families . As the first step toward the development of the relief program , it was decided to make a careful survey of the actual needs that will confront the unemployed of the city during the coming Winter . These needs , according to the spokesmen of the charity and welfare organizations , will be greater than last Winter . The survey will be made by the charity organizations .

Mr. let it be known that Commissioner Taylor will confer with Mr. Gifford either in this city or in Washington on the extent of assistance the Federal Government is prepared to give . Before deciding upon the funds to be appropriated by the city , Mr. said , an effort will also be made to determine the scope of assistance which the State will offer . Governor Roosevelt , it has been reported , plans to ask the Legislature to raise $25,000,000 by taxation for unemployment relief , and city officials want to know how much of this will be available for New York before a local appropriation is voted . Mr. said he desired to assure the people , and particularly those in need , that the city would be as generous as possible . A fund of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it is realized that considerably more will be necessary . " We are going to have adequate plans to take care of whatever needs there may be , " Mr. declared .

But we do welcome any assistance we may get in taking care of those unemployed who have come here from other communities in search of work . " Mr. explained , however , that the city would welcome Federal aid providing relief for outsiders and will also ask that any amount raised by the State should be so allocated as to give New York a portion commensurate with the amount to be supplied by the taxpayers of the city .

" We feel that we shall be able to take care of our own problem , " Mr. said , " and that it will not be necessary for us to resort to any bond issues . But we do not object to the proposed legislation , since many of the communities of the State are not as fortunately situated as we are . Moreover , the adoption of such legislation will constitute for us a reserve source to which we can turn in the event of necessity . If the Governor contemplates raising money by taxation for relief purposes we shall take the position that practically 80 per cent would be raised in New York City and we should like to have the money dispersed where it is raised and in corresponding proportion . " Pointing out that under the city charter the city is not permitted to extend direct relief in the form of charity , Mr. said that money apropriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be used in providing jobs in parks , on public works and in other departments . Direct relief work , financed last year through contributions by city employes , ' will be continued through the Mayor 's committee , Mr. said . How this committee will obtain its funds for the coming Winter still remains to be determined , however , although it is probable that the system of voluntary contributions by city employes will be continued . The bulk of the direct relief work , in the form of food and clothing , will be performed by the charity organizations , which are to conduct a drive for this purpose , Mr. explained , while the task of the Gibson committee will be to raise a fund to provide work . ? Groups to Coordinate Work . " The work of all agencies , city and private , will be carefully coordinated in order to eliminate waste and to achieve the maximum results , " Mr. declared .

Mr. Blanshard declared that the entire unemployment relief program of the State could be easily financed from incomes over $1,000,000 a year , and that New York State could profit to the extent of $150,000,000 by adopting the more steeply graduated income tax schedule of Wisconsin .
