Ever since last winter the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo has acted like a French Cabinet in a crisis . Only expert bystanders have been able to puzzle out its complicated tangle of splits , mergers , lawsuits , reorganizations . Last week , as the troupe , now sponsored by Universal Art , Inc. , started its U.S. season in Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , balletgoers got their first chance to see the practical results of this confusion and commotion . <P> Notably absent from the programs was the name of Colonel Wassily de Basil ; notably present was the familiar trademark of Concert Manager Sol Hurok . Long-nosed Lonide Massine was still choreographer , still danced with his wonted spirit . But of the Ballet 's four familiar prima ballerinas-Tatiana Riabouchinska , Irina Baronova , Alexandra Danilova and Tamara Toumanova-the first two were missing . In their places were two newly acquired slim-limbed bids for U.S. favor : diminutive , British-born Alicia Markova ( Alice Marks ) , and Nini Theilade ( pronounced Tay-lah ' - de ) , an exotic , Javanese-born tripper of mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three brand new ballets , all built by Lonide Massine , were shown Manhattan audiences during the first week : <P> Saint Francis , most ambitious and startling of the three , was a colorful , ingenious mixture of secondhand religious fervor with syrup of ballet : it caused terrific applause . Saint Francis had the advantage of a score by famed self-exiled German " Kulturbolschewist " Paul Hindemith ( TIME , March 14 ) , which proved to be not only top-flight Hindemith but the finest contemporary ballet music Manhattanites had heard since the palmiest days of Igor Stravinsky . To its subtly suggestive , drypoint phrases , Saint Francis ( Choreographer Massine ) , in a medieval setting , pursued his ideal of Poverty ( paradoxically embodied by demure , eye-filling Ballerina Theilade ) , tamed a big bad wolf , ardently embraced his very tangible ideal , and ended by miming a fervent hymn of praise to the sun . <P> In Gait Parisienne , most ingratiating of the new ballets , the tinseled , Second-Empire melodies of Jacques Offenbach set off a riot of color and horseplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visiting Peruvian roustabout . <P> Seventh Symphony , most pretentious of the three , used Beethoven 's great opus as an accompaniment for somewhat irrelevant but agreeably spectacular choreographic capers.
