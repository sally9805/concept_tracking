IT WAS a crowded day at the hospital . Emergency cases had kept coming in all through the night . The house doctors had been continuously in the operating room . The interns and graduate nurses were working overtime . The student nurses , since early morning , had been making and unmaking beds , setting up extras in rooms already overtaxed for space , and taking the places of the graduate nurses on the less serious cases . Late in the afternoon a couple came into the Maternity Ward . They were very young ? scarcely more than boy and girl . Her time had been set for two weeks later . Like many first babies , hers was anxious to be born . Pain had already etched itself in the shadows under her eyes and in the lines at the corners of her mouth . But she was brave as she took leave of her husband . " I wish I could be with you , Honey , " he said , the pupils of his eyes dark with anxiety . " I do , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I 'll be all right . Wo n't I ? " she asked the nurse who had taken her in charge . " Sure , " said the nurse , " we 'll look after you . " " And just think , " said the girl , " what we will have with us when you take me home ! " She followed the nurse through the swinging doors , turning to blow a parting kiss . When she was in bed , the head nurse came in , scanning the card the girl had brought with her . " Do you mean to say , Mrs. Hardy , that you have not been to the clinic here for over four months ? " " It was so far to come ? " the girl hesitated , to steady herself against a passing pain , then went on . " There is no clinic in our neighborhood ? and the subway made me feel so faint . " " You should have made the effort for the sake of your child , " said the nurse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we  | had expected to have a pay doctor , but Tim 's wages were cut . Then they told me that if I went to an outside clinic I could not be taken in here . And a lady in our block said that clinics were no use anyway . She had four babies and never went near one . " The staff doctor who made the examination prophesied a long labor , ordered a sedative , said that she would be all right , and to call him if anything unexpected came- up . All through that day and late into the night the girl struggled valiantly to hold her own . Toward dawn she was taken to the operating room . The staff obstetrician was not available . The interne in charge of her case saw that anesthesia and an operative delivery were necessary . Something went wrong . The life of the young mother flowed from her an hour after her eightpound boy was entered into the world . This is not a pretty story , but it had to be told . For its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother in the first flower of her womanhood nor in the desolation of her loved ones and the doubtful destiny of her child left motherless on the threshold of life , but in the implication that it could so easily have had a happy ending . The one entry on the patient 's clinical record indicated that her pelvic measurements were not so generous as they should have been and that there was evidence of cardiac weakness . If there had been a maternity center in her neighborhood where she could have gone at proper intervals for prenatal care , she would have been given a diet to regulate the size of her child , her entire system would have been built up , and those who attended her at birth would have been prepared for the ordeal . If the hospital had not been shortstaffed and overcrowded , she would have had the services of an experienced obste-trician , The case of Mrs. Hardy is not an isolated one . With some variation or another , it is being repeated daily and even hourly all over this country of ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so emphatically thrust upon public attention as by the recent report of the New York Academy of Medicine of its study of maternal mortality in the five boroughs of New York City during the years IC3o , 1931 , 1932 ? This study was conducted by the Academy 's Committee of Public Health Relations , the members of which are among the foremost medical scientists of the day . In their investigation they had the aid of the Department of Health , which every week sent them photostatic copies of all death certificates on which the demise was attributed to some condition due to pregnancy or childbirth . Trained investigators then visited the physicians whose names appeared on the certificates . All attendants during the pregnancy , at the birth , and up to the time of death were interviewed . Home conditions were looked into . Clinical and hospital records were thoroughly inspected . A complete history of each case , including the reports of physical and laboratory examination , of the temperature charts , and of the reputed cause of death , was compiled and given detailed analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has New York the highest maternal mortality rate of the large cities of the world , but that of the 2341 deaths occurring in that category during the three years , 1343 were preventable . And what was more startling was the statement that the high percentage of casualty was the fault of the doctors and the mothers ? sixty-one and a fraction percent in the first instance , and thirty-six and a fraction percent in the latter , with the hospitals , in some directions , sharing the brunt . The report , taken up in the newspapers , started a tempest in a teapot . Certain interested factions insisted that it should never have been made public . Others declared that it was unfair . Others still , while agreeing with the main facts , disagreed with the figures of preventability . Not a few attempted to account for the high ratio of mortality by placing it on the hackneyed shoulders of the depression . The report itself , in methods of procedure and in the figures which it competently sets forth ,  | gives denial to the dissenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the death was listed as non-preventable . This was done even when , as was frequently discovered , the nurses ' records differed from the diagnoses recorded on the certificates . Without doubt , the lean years have had some effect on the stamina of a large number of mothers . And , because of the necessity of cutting expenses and appropriations , hospitals have been overcrowded and understaffed , and the activities of clinics and nursing services curtailed . But , according to the records of the Department of Health , the rate of maternal mortality in the city has remained practically stationary over a period of twelve years . In 1920 it was 5.33 per thousand live births , while in 1932 it was 5.69 . Furthermore , the Committee , in its tabulations , shows that the highest number of preventable deaths were not among the very poor , but in the artisan and white-collar classes . To be exact , they divided the casualties into four groups , A , B , C , D. In A , which represents the slum population , where extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where free medical care is available , there were 275 deaths , of which 193 could have been prevented . Of these the physician was blamed in 115 cases , the patient in 67 , and the midwife in I r . In B , which stands for the better-paid workers , whose living standards are somewhat higher , but who must rely on municipal and voluntary hospitals for free medical care , there were 6J3 deaths , 407 of which were preventable . The fault here was put upon the physicians in 278 cases , upon the patient in 114 , and upon the midwife in 15 . Under C , were listed the white-collar class , in which living conditions and general education are much higher in the scale . They are able as a rule to pay for their medical needs and usually compose the clientele of the general practitioner and less highly-trained specialists . In this group there were 572 deaths , 345 of which were preventable . In 245 cases the physicians were held responsible , in 88 the patient , and in 3 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated who can afford highlytrained specialists and the best hospitals , there were only twenty deaths , ten of which were deemed avoidable . Nine of these were attributed to the physician and one to the patient . A significant supplement was another table revealing that , with the exception of D , the highest number of fatalities occurred in municipal and voluntary hospitals , while the lowest was in obstetrical hospitals or among women whose babies were born at home . NOW , it is reasonable to suppose , with these conditions existent in a city like New York , whose great wealth and richly endowed foundations and institutions have placed so many facilities for medical care at the people 's disposal , that they must also prevail in the nation at large . The birth and death rate for the United- States Registration Area as given out by the Bureau of Census up to and including the year 1931 , proves this to be much more than a supposition . It shows that since 1921 , when the total maternity mortality dropped to 6.8 in every thousand live births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same number , there has been little or no change . In 1931 it was 6.6 . The New York Academy 's report was not the first one to criticize the medical fraternity . " Obstetric Education , " the report , published in 1932 , of the Sub-Committee on Obstetric Teaching and Education of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection , proves by painstaking detail and analysis that the high rate of both infant and maternal mortality is in great part the fault of the doctors . The records of the investigation of the United States Children 's Bureau in 1930 declare that the death of over 16,000 mothers in and through childbirth occurring in the registration area of 41 states during the preceding year was caused by the negligence of the doctors or the mothers , by the shortcomings of hospitals and clinics , or by the inadequacy of state and city laws and dispensations . THE trouble with the doctors begins in the universities . In a number the obstetrical course for the student who is to become a general practitioner covers no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present at less than ten births and deliver , under the supervision of a doctor , fewer than a dozen babies . While many medical colleges require an interneship , many do not . And in the majority , the students and the interns have little or no experience with abnormal pregnancies and deliveries and the emergencies arising out of them . Going out from the colleges young doctors may often accept maternity cases only as stopgaps while building up a clientele . Their interest in this part of their practice is slight , and they devote neither time nor effort toward increasing their skill and knowledge . When they begin to get along , they are apt to take more cases than they can handle , and they find it more convenient to send their patients to hospitals than to care for them in the homes , as they know that if they are not within call , there will be house doctors or interns to do their work for them . From this it may often eventuate that the doctor attending a delivery knows nothing except what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of the mother . This un-correlated care at its best does not rebound to the good of the mother or child . The high cost of motherhood is another great factor in the death rate among the middle class . It is sadly true that in many instances doctors have become business men . With an eye to profit , certain groups have leagued together to keep up the price of medical care . Even in middle-sized cities the expectant mother whose husband is earning a fair salary , one which can not bear excessive medical fees , will have to shop around in order to find a doctor who is within her means . In the end she may have to accept the services of one whose skill she can not be sure of , or the husband will have to run into debt . The price for doctors with any kind of reputation is all the way from $250 up to $rood . In smaller cities they may charge $150 . Often this does not include hospital service , which so many of them insist upon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a day and does not provide the patient with a room to herself or a personal nurse . Some doctors , in their delivery fees , do not include prenatal or post-natal care , by which the extra fees , ranging from $5 to $20 a visit , make the cost prohibitive . And all doctors who are expensive doctors are not necessarily good doctors . They may have gained their reputation through some trick of their trade or by the personal asset of a good bedside manner . Some of them become known for their ability to shorten the hours of labor . This may be done by the delivery of an anesthetic or a drug too far in advance of birth , in which case an instrumental delivery , which is always dangerous , may result in fatality . One such doctor who had become popular in a large city , because he was able to prognosticate almost to the hour the time the child would be delivered , had a very high record of mortality . And yet the fashionable women flocked to him . The indictment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises . From all authoritative sources of information comes the imputation that they are getting too soft . They refuse to take sufficient exercise during pregnancy . Through ignorance or laziness they neglect to attend clinics , either because it is too much trouble , or because some oldwife has told them it is unnecessary . Or they may be victims of a false modesty which prevents them from telling their doctors the truth about their symptoms . Their greatest drawback , however , lies in their inability or unwillingness to bear pain . At the first twitch they begin to beg for an anesthetic . A good doctor will refuse to give it to them until dilatation has set in . But many , . in fear of diminishing their clientele , or because they wish to get through with the birth , will give in to the patient . An enormous proportion of fatalities ! result from lacerations leading to septicemia or of hemorrhages brought on by instrumental delivery made necessary by the use of an anesthetic . It was Dr. Frank Halstead Brown of Roselle Park , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my lay mind both the cause and cure of this flaw in our national regime . For over twenty-five years Dr. Brown has been a general practitioner , his services having been at the disposal of both rich and poor . All told , he has attended twenty-eight hundred mothers during pregnancy and childbirth and has never lost one . Three babies were lost ? still-born . So he speaks with authority . A type of old-fashioned family doctor brought up-to-date , he is a thoroughly human human being , with wide sympathy and understanding , and that sense of humor which goes far toward keeping up the spirit of the ailing . Praising the action of the New York Academy of Medicine in making its report public as one of great bravery , he was in agreement with its findings . " Birth , " Dr. Brown said , " is a perfectly natural process . In the vast majority of women it is a normal function , and if anything goes wrong , it is due to the inexperience , neglect , or ineptitude of the doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers . " Generally speaking , he defined the causes of mortality as hemorrhage , septicemia or puerperal fever , convulsions resulting from kidney trouble , affections of the heart or lungs , narrow pelvic measurements , cnsarian operations , and fallopian pregnancy . " None of these , " said he , " is necessarily fatal except in extreme cases where there are complications . " The culpability of the doctors , he maintained , began , as other authorities had declared , in the universities . " Most of the cases which come to a general hospital , " he said , " are normal ; therefore the student gets little or no practical experience in the great emergencies . If he has an interneship after graduation , he will have more experience . Personally I do not feel that any young interne should attend- a birth unless he is supervised by a more advanced doctor . " TO BE a good obstetrician , a doctor has to be something more than a mechanic . He has to care enough about that part of his work to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends with his patients . Above all , he must have confidence in himself . The general training in many colleges is not thorough enough to ensurethis . " Dr. Brown stressed the tendency of many doctors to give anesthetics too readily . " In order to make things easy for themselves they will send all their patients , for whatever causes , to one hospital . They do this for two reasons : they know that if they are detained outside of the hospital or if they are unable to leave one ease to go to another , the interns or house doctors will be there to take their places ; and it enables them to get from one case to another with the least possible expense of their own energy and time . It is this type of doctor who endangers the life of the mother by giving an anesthetic prematurely . " Another bad habit is the modern practice of giving pituitrin , a glandular extract which stimulates muscular activity within the uterus , but contracts the uterine muscles . If given too early in labor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is dangerous in the extreme . You ca n't get an elephant through  | the eye of a , needle , you know . " No good doctor will give an anesthetic , under ordinary circumstances , until complete dilatation has taken place . The anesthetic relaxes the muscles , and the patient is unable to expel the child by her own efforts , in which case it becomes necessary to use instruments . The handling of these instruments is an art in itself . If not done with the greatest care , there may be hemorrhages , or lacerations causing septicemia . " " Do you prefer a hospital or the home for maternity cases ? " I asked Dr. Brown . ? - My definition of maternity is motherhood in the home , " was the response . " Unless conditions are such that the patient can not be taken proper care of , I insist that the birth take place there . A woman is more at ease when she is surrounded by her own things . She can get better food . And she is immune to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the nurses may be germ carriers . " A doctor should not be too anxious to get away from a confinement case . Where a woman is having her first child , he should , if possible , remain with her from the time he is called until long enough after the birth to be sure that the patient is resting easily . He should not take too many patients who expect to be delivered at the same time , and he should be prepared for emergencies preventing his being on hand by engaging a colleague to take his place if it becomes necessary . " DOCTOR Brown placed great emphasis on the necessity for prenatal care . " That , too , is up to the doctor , " said he . " The first time a woman comes to me in pregnancy I give her a thorough going-over . I examine her heart and her lungs , take her measurements , and make a laboratory test of her urine . I see that she returns to me at proper intervals . If she ca n't come to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends with her , so that I become a receiving station for her troubles . By the time of her delivery , there is very little that I do n't know about her . - " As for the mothers . " he said , " a good deal of what happens to them is their own fault . Many of them have come to think that bearing a child is a great and untoward imposition instead of the glorious privilege to carry out their complete destiny . The minute they find they are going to have a child they begin to complain . Or they imagine they have every ailment in the dictionary . You can frighten or think yourself into most anything , even smallpox , if you try hard enough . And they wo n't take exercise . They think if they go for a ride in an automobile , or walk around the block to sit on a neighbor 's porch making baby clothes , that they have done their full duty . The women who have the easiest time in childbirth are those who have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patients take good walks , and if they do n't , I get after their husbands to make them do so . " When they come to me , I tell them that there is nothing to be afraid of if they will help me by following my advice . If , when labor begins , they ask for an anesthetic , I wo n't give it to them . They can howl their heads off , but they do n't get it until dilatation is complete . I show them how to take deep breaths between pains , so they can help themselves . If I find a woman is going to have a hard time , I tell her so , but I add , If you 'll work with me , I 'll work with you ; and if you are patient , you 'll be all right . ' " And , as I said above , twenty-eight hundred women who trusted him learned that he knows his business . At the Maternity Center Association in New York , whose errands of mercy have done much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , Miss Hazel Corbin , the director , begged for a better cooperation be- " Much that goes wrong , " she said , " is because of the regulations by the city itself . If a woman goes to a clinic which is not a part of the city hospital service , she can not have free care at one of its hospitals at childbirth . She may , if there is a Public Health nurse in her neighborhood , avail herself of such service . But if the Public Health work has been curtailed , it is often impossible for the mothers to get proper advice and help during the months before their babies are born . " This could be easily taken care of . It costs the cities all the way from $3.50 to $5.70 a day for ten days to take care of women during childbirth and afterward . This same amount of money would pay agood midwife who , in Miss Corbin 's opinion , could in normal cases , take excellent care of both mother and child and look after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Bureau at Washington made public its report of maternal mortalities , it set forth the many fatalities occurring through the ignorance and ineptness of midwives . Reminded of this , Miss Corbin responded : " I said good midwives . While here in this city the requirements for midwives are comparatively high , at the same time direct medical supervision is lacking . No midwife should be allowed to deliver a patient who has not first been examined by an obstetrician and pronounced normal . Then , too , the present practicing midwives should be given refresher ' courses each year to keep them up-to-date . " There are other counts on which the present system may be taken to task . Something more is needed beside a minimum amount of prenatal diagnosis and prescription . Women who are about to become mothers are highly sensitive . It is easier for them to tell their troubles to another woman than to a man . In the official clinics the doctors and nurses are too busy to give much time or thought to the personal needs of any one patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold institution one takes what one gets , or one goes some place else . Place a diffident and frightened young woman in the hands of such disinterested service , and her mental condition may easily react upon her physical well-being . In this respect , Miss Corbin said : " Our nurses are made to realize that their full duty is to take care of any condition which affects the health , happiness , and peace of mind of the mother . They are taught to make friends with their patients , in order to find out everything they can about them and do their utmost to minister to their needs . " Miss Corbin spoke with indignation of the growing attitude in some directions toward the right of the poor to have children . " You have no idea , " she said , " how widespread this feeling is . It is just too bad if a young couple who are in love are to be denied the privilege of having a family . Two young people , husband and wife , came to see me the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . Their particular problem was not only ways and means , but the necessity of the wife holding on to her job . The husband 's salary had been cut , and she wanted to go on working in order to save money for the layette . As she was not very far along , and her condition was good , we told her there was no reason why she should not do so . But what broke my heart was their apology for daring to have a child . The husband said to me , You know , some way or other ? I do n't suppose we should under the circumstances ? we ca n't help being happy about it . ' " Of course , you ca n't , ' I replied . Why should n't you be ? Two such fine healthy young people ! ' " It 's so good to hear you say that , ' said the wife . Every one acts as if we were committing a crime . ' " Miss Corbin spoke of one of the criticisms against the Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she stated , " that it would make women afraid to have children . That , of course is ridiculous . They do n't need to be afraid if they are informed and if they are given the proper advice and facilities ? something that they are not getting today . All over the country public health appropriations have been cut down until the budget can not take care of even the minimum of emergencies . In Georgia the last visiting nurse has just been taken off the list . In other states the curtailment is answerable for an enormous number of fatalities . " The good accomplished by the Maternity Centers points to the great need for them in every community , no matter how small it may be . In his report of his study of their records , Dr. Louis I. Dublin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company shows , by comparing the data on two groups of mothers in one of New York 's most congested areas ? one which had access to maternity centers , and one which did not ? that the former had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ births , while that of the latter was 6.2 in every thousand , or nearly three times as high . " This reduction in the deaths of mothers , " comments Dr. Dublin , " is very gratifying and is indicative of the saving of lives that might be accomplished in the general population were every pregnant mother to receive the benefits of a specialized maternity service . " In his final summary he says further , " But it is only too true that in spite of the gains , the irreducible minimum of still births or of the deaths of babies under one month has not been reached . A combination of such service as the Maternity Center Association gives with a controlled Medical Delivery Service , preferably under a hospital 's supervision , would more than likely eliminate many of these misfortunes . " THE sharp challenge in this dark welter of wrong is not to New York City alone . How many of the sixteen thousand mothers who ? last year and the year before and the year before that and so on ? lost their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfillment could have been saved if they had had proper counsel and care , we have no way of knowing . But we do know that in no small number of states there are vast sections in which there is neither a doctor nor a nurse , and that the women in their hazardous adventure have neither competent advice nor aid , and must depend at delivery upon ignorant and inefficient midwives or good but none-the-less inadequate neighbors . And in innumerable cities , crowded hospitals , the scarcity of clinics , the meager appropriations for public health and maternity service , and the indifference of state and community to conditions , are pyramiding the toll of negligence to shameful proportions . And the bitter truth is that it need not be so . Knowledge is power only when it takes form in action . If we are to hear and not to heed , all the time and conscientious endeavor which went into the making of the various investigations and reports will have been wasted . What is needed is a program and a persistent and tireless campaign for putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and social scientists , contains the following suggestions : Better teaching and experience in obstetrics in the universities and hospitals ; less overcrowding in the hospitals through delivery , wherever possible , in the home ; better understanding and more human sympathy in hospitals and clinics ; better city and state laws regulating the practice of obstetrics and setting higher standards of efficiency in both doctors and midwives ; better cooperation between the city hospitals and the maternity clinics ; larger appropriations for the Public Health nursing and doctor service ; better cooperation on the part of doctors , in the way of moderate fees , so that the middle-class mother may have proper and adequate care during pregnancy and confinement , and as long as is necessary afterward ; maternity clinics in every community ; education of mothers , consisting not only in teaching them the necessity for prenatal care , but of looking into the records of the doctors whom they engage to attend them ; extension of the service created by the Sheppard-Towner Bill ? one generous enough to meet the wider demands of today . IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests upon the doctors . If they do their part toward it , the greatest obstruction to it will have been overcome . For it was the doctors who defeated the attempt to prolong the dispensation of the Sheppard-Towner Bill , in the passage of which by Congress ins r92I , GOOD HOUSEKEEPING Was a strong shoulder at the wheel . This enactment set aside a fund by which the Federal Government was enabled to donate five thousand dollars for maternity aid to states making a like appropriation for the same purpose . In all , forty-one states and the territory of Hawaii met the offer in good faith . Just'I at the time results were beginning to accrue in , the way of decreased infant and maternal mortality , Congress ? the Senate part of it ? turned its back on this kind of altruism and common , sense , and the work stopped . Efforts were made to procure follow-up legislation . That they , failed was due in part to the powerful opposition of the medical fraternity . It is now time , in the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending the full strength of their approval and influence to bring about the new era involved ' in the program . For it is they who will stand convicted in public opinion if they fail to do so. , In a great degree it is also up to the mothers l to become aware of their responsibility not only to themselves but to their children ? that they may enter this world whole and healthy and with the assurance that they will have the care and training which only a conscious and conscientious motherhood can give them . Upon the women of this country now lies a tremendous obligation . In every city , town , and village , they have the power , if they will use it , to insist that the local , state , and federal governments support by proper regulation , enactment , and appropriation every item in this project of safe and sound motherhood . It is only by this strong offensive that the day can be won , and the bright millennium attained when the robbed and tortured mothers of the past will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
