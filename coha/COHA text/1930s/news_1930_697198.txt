txt The New York Telephone Company reluctantly yielded yesterday , the rate decision of the Public Service Commission . In an announdenient last evening after he had conferred with his rate expertS and counsel J. S. McCulloh , president of the COMpany , said he would not authorize an appeal to the courts to upset the decision , at least for the time being . " The company will comply , under protest , with the order of the commission with respect to the filing and putting into effect of the rates prescribed by such order , " he said . " No further application to the courts is contemplated at this time . " The schedules fixed by the commission on Thursday , Mr. McCulloh declared , would " fall far short " of yielding the 7 per cent return on the fair value of the company property which was directed by the Federal court . Proof of this , he added , could be more-definitely established by the , results of actual operation . This comment was taken to be an intimation that there may yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event be postponed for many months . The company has heretofore contended in the commission proceedings that the present temporary rates , which In general effect were lowered slightly by the commission 's decision , would fail by more than $13,000,000 this year to earn a 7 per cent return , due to bad business conditions . They would fail by $11,000 , - 000 , it said , to earn the return now decreed to be legal by the commission . Accuses Board of Pretense . Mr. McCulloh charged the commission with " pretense " when it said that its decision accorded with the decision of the court . He also voiced resentment at the criticism of the company 's operating expenses , declaring that the commission had no real understanding of operating problems . Temporary acquiescence , also reluctant , was given to the commission 's decision in the office of Corporation Counsel Arthur J. W. Hilly who actively opposed the telephone company 's case . Mr. Hilly , however , has one more card to play . In the near future he will petition the Public Service Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the telephone company . His object will be to obtain a reorganization of the depreciation accounting system of the company by forcing abandonment of the straightline method which builds un a depreciation reserve . Should this be accomplished a rate cut as high as $12,000,000 could be effected , he argues . The same plea in a different form was rejected in the present decision . It is known that some members of the commission will be sympathetic to a new petition from Mr. Hilly which can be given attention in separate proceedings . From Trenton , where he had gone in connection with the Delaware water litigation , the Corporation Counsel made no personal announcement . A. S. B. Little , the city 's utility engineer , said that he deprecated the rise in business telephone rates and thought it would have a reaction upon the company in the loss of stations . Extension telephones particularly would be reduced , he predicted . The city , Mr. Little declared , had been the only one to seriously ques- tion the operating expenses of file company , a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that the city also took the lead in contesting the company 's gloomy business outlook , which the commission subsequently largely ignored . Statement of Company . The telephone company 's statement follows : " The decision just announced by the Public Service Commission making changes in telephone rates throughout the State purports to cut by $2,760,000 the annual rates proposed by the company last January under the authority of the judgment of the court . As the rates then proposed by the company were designed to yield somewhat less than the 7 per cent return authorized by the court and since the evidence before the commission to the proceeding - just closed fully supported the company 's estimates , there is no justification whatever for the reductions in the rates made by the commission . " The commission in its opinion properly states that the decision of the court of last December is binding upon it and pretends to follow that decision in making its detemination . But it is pretense only ; for example , in deducting $35,000,000 from the rate base for 1930 the commission does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The commission criticizes the increase in operating expenses over the period 1913 to 1929 without having any real understanding of the operating problems and disregards entirely the large increases in wages and cost of materials directly affecting the construction and operation of the telephone plant which have occurred throughout that period . Such increased costs of wages and material inevitably increased the total operating expenses . " Moreover , - the people of the city of New York and throughout the State require and have insistently demanded a constantly improving quality in all forms of telephone service . This the commission recognizes in its opinion . The meeting of these demands for refinements and - Improvements in the various grades of service necessarily resulted in further increasing the operating expenses . The implication in the opinion of the commission that there have been undue increases in the operating expenses is entirely unwarranted . All of these matters were gone into exhaustively upon the trial of the court case and both the special master and the three-judge court found upon the extensive evidence before them that the property was kept in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in the conduct of its operations had ' availed itself to the fullest extent reasonably possible of all savings and economies . ' " The rates ordered by the commission will fall far short of yielding the annual rate of return upon the fair value of the property directed by the court 's decree . Proof of this fact may be more definitely established by the results of actual operation than by predictions . Therefore , the company wil comply , under protest , with the order of the commission with respect to the filing and putting into effect of the rates prescribed by such order . No further application to the courts is contemplated at this time . " Ward Cites Valuation Cut . In a statement from his New York office Attorney General Hamilton Ward pointed out that the commission 's decision along with the Federal court 's decision made a total reduction of $226,00,000 from the valuations of the company as found by the special master who reported to the court . " More than $152,000,000 of this is due to disallowance of claimed assets by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory court that 7 instead of 8 per cent constitutes a fair return , " he said . " A large part of the $152,000,000 also were reductions made by the court . " This makes a difference of more than $15,000,000 per annum in the tolls to be collected from the telephone users in New York State . " One part of the commission 's decision was read with partiqular interest by the company 's experts yesterday . This was the commission 's opinion that the 5 cent charge for public pay stations calls was too low . The commission did not act upon its opinion but-it may mean that efforts will be made in the future for ways to raise the charge . " At this rate , " the commission said , " the cost per call from a public pay station is often less than the cost per call to regular subscribers , both message rates and flat rate service . This is opposed in our opinion to principles of good rate making which require that the occasional or convenience user should pay more than the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
