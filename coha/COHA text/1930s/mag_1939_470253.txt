FOR a year and a half the professional r business men of the land have been learning how to co-operate : they have been working together to reorganize American business management . It is high time they did so . Business management must function ; for it is , in fact , a governing organization in charge of the nation 's economy . When business management fails to function ordinary people run into debt , go broke , or lose their jobs . When business management pursues unenlightened or tyrannical policies the results are reflected in the conditions of work , in pay checks , in credit terms , in housing and transportation facilities , and in the cost of food , light , heat , and clothing . As business spokesmen like to point out , management controls the " American standard of living . " Ever since 1932 there has been an imperative need for reorganizing management to cope with modern social and economic conditions ; nor have business men been unaware of this . Some few sized up the situation even in 1929 and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days : the so-called " Old Guard " controlled management , as it always had . Even to suggest reorganizing management in any fundamental way was to fly in the face of the Old Guard ? and that was considered a fatal thing for a business man to do . The Old Guard , it must be rememtiered , consists of the heirs ( spiritual and actual ) of the " empire-builders " who constructed the American business machine in the first place . The Old Guard stands heir to the great tradition ? the tradition of John D. Rockefeller , who saved his first dollar ; of John W. Gates , who bet a million , and would bet on a raindrop ; and of the elder J. P. Morgan , who formed the first billion-dollar corporation and built the grim and apparently eternal business house which stands at the corner of Broad and Wall . Moreover the Old Guard has always been identified with a system of managing business ? a simple , straightforward system , which once worked surpassingly well . Conceived by the original Rockefellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fricks , and developed by such men as Judge Elbert H. Gary of the United States Steel Corporation , it is the system of " boss rule , " perpetuated on a semi-hereditary basis . This management system is devoid of democratic forms ; it is therefore difficult to change or even to modify . No " checks and balances " restrain the Old Guard boss . He is lawmaker , executive , and judge rolled into one . He is unfamiliar with the concept of responsibility to the mass of ordinary people : in the hierarchy of bosses which constitutes management under the Old Guard men owe responsibility only to their superiors ; and on the topmost levels , bosses answer only to God . Before the depression , business men simply did not criticize the underlying principles of this management system . Even when the depression revealed its weakness , business men hesitated to work for change . But the hard years wore on , the voters supported men " hostile to business , " and the need for reorganizing management became too plain to overlook . The times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangers , many Old Guard members were decamping for their chateaux in Europe , their Manhattan clubs , or their yachts . Others , notably the unfortunate Richard Whitney , were resorting to criminal practices in a desperate effort to maintain their position . By 1937 fundamental reorganization of management had become wholly practicable . The Old Guard was on the run and the Old Guard 's opponents were finding support not only in the spirit of the times but also , in tangible form , in the New Deal ( help , to be sure , which was offered , and accepted , with large reservations ) . Accordingly , in 1937 the open movement to reorganize management started ; it has since been progressing steadily , step by step ; and it works . In case after case , in the past year and a half , the Old Guard has been deprived of power in management , and extremist members of the Old Guard have been expelled from management . Also a new and more nearly democratic system of managing business is being shaped : that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being provided ; and the responsibilities and duties of the various business officers and managing bodies are being strictly and publicly defined . The new management of business is taking on the character of a " government of laws , " as opposed to the Old Guard 's " government of men . " Finally , a new management personnel is being recruited . A new partnership is being cemented : the progressive forces of Wall Street and the professional business executives of the West , Midwest , and South are co-operating to manage the nation 's business . Men distinguished neither by wealth , nor by prestige , nor by " breeding , " but simply by professional competence are making common cause : Wall Street and Main Street are teaming up at last . However , one word of qualification is necessary : the new group which is coming into power in management is more democratically compounded than the Old Guard was , and is creating more nearly democratic forms of business organization ; but that is not to say that the policies of the new management of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . Whether or not this consummation is actually coming to pass is a hard question , and we shall not try to solve it in this article . This article will simply describe the movement of business men which has been creating a new kind of management , step by step , for a year and a half . II The capital city of the Old Guard government of business was New York . In the heart of New York , in Wall Street , the power of Old Guard management centered . Accordingly , during the past year and a half the opponents of the Old Guard in business have been openly criticizing the centralization of economic power in New York and they have been taking steps to modify it . For example , on January 28 , 1938 , W. Averell Harriman addressed a luncheon meeting of the Bond Club of New York . We have been hearing a lot recently said Mr. Harriman about holding companies , about interlocking directorships , about the socalled " Sixty Families " and the concentration of control in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control in New York . . . I think we should frankly analyze what this concentration of control in New York , and the interlocking of directorships , means . . . . We all know of cases of companies that moved their headquarters to New York for one reason or another , because they thought they would get greater national prestige , or they would be financed better . . . . I think that to you all ... there come to mind companies that would be better off with their headquarters in some other part of the country than New York . . . . I think New York would be better off with that decentralization of management . We would n't have the load to carry here of justifying why there should be so much of the business of the country centered in New York . In speaking thus , obviously , Mr. Harriman avoided making a frontal attack on the principles of Old Guard business organization . He was issuing a very broad hint ; and in order to evaluate his words it is necessary to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of New York ought to be modified is not new . It has been expressed over and over again in the past fifty years ? not by business men , like Mr. Harriman , but by the so-called " radicals " and " opponents of business . " In 1896 , for instance , Senator Benjamin R. Tillman of South Carolina widely circulated a cartoon which he had had drawn to express the popular grievance against Wall Street management . By now everyone has become familiar with this cartoon , or variants of it . It shows a monster cow straddling the map of the United States : while the workers and farmers west of the Alleghenies labor to feed this cow , a silkhatted banker sits in Wall Street and milks her . Sixteen years after Tillman 's cow appeared , Congress authorized the Pujo investigation , making this statement : ( G. . there is reason to believe that the management of many of the great industrial and railroad corporations of the country . . . is rapidly concentrating in the hands of a few groups of financiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detriment of interstate commerce and of the general public . " Needless to say , neither Tillman 's cow nor the Pujo investigation nor the subsequent writings of Louis D. Brandeis on the " money trust " and the " curse of bigness " solved the Problem of concentra-MAGAZINE tion of control . Late in 1937 and early in 1938 , just before the time of Mr. IIarriman 's Bond Club speech , the New Deal , through the then-Assistant Attorney General , Robert H. Jackson , and the Secretary of the Interior , Harold L. Ickes , was still uttering the familiar denunciations of " absentee financial control " and " concentration of economic power . " Fifty years of this had charged the whole question of centralized control in New York with explosive emotional connotations . It had become a point of honor with the Old Guard to maintain the traditional power and prestige of New York . Mr. Harriman , speaking as he did to the financiers and industrialists of the Bond Club , was touching a sore point indeed : he was speaking as the " radicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , Mr. Harriman is in no sense a parvenu . His position and his inheritance entitle him to a seat in the inner circle of the Old Guard . His father , the late E , H. Harriman , did as much as any one man could do to concentrate the management of the great industrial and railroad corporations of the country " in the hands of a few groups of financiers in the city of New York . " Mr. Harriman himself is the chairman of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad , chairman of the executive committee of the Illinois Central Railroad , and a director in nine other industrial and railroad corporations , besides being a partner in Brown Bruthers Harriman &; Co. , Wall Street private bankers , a director of Brown , Harriman &; Co. , Wall Street investment bankers , a director of the Guaranty Trust Co. ( a big Wall Street commercial bank considered to be affiliated with the House of Morgan ) , and chairman of the W. A. Harriman Securities Corporation . In short , W. Averell Harriman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you that he could not and would not have made his Bond Club speech ten years ago ; the financial community in New York would have known how to resent it . When he did make his speech last year , however , he got very little opposition . The Saturday Evening Post , generally an indicator of arch-conservative opinion on such matters , editorialized benignly , saying that if industry were to follow Mr. Harriman 's advice and move out of New York , " the moral standing of American business as a whole would profit . " What really happened at the Bond Club lunch on January 28 , 1938 , was this : a member of the Old Guard turned against the Old Guard , preferring to side with professionally competent business men in the task of remodelling management along rational geographical , social , and political lines ; and he got away with it . It was a sign of the times . III Mr. Harriman sometimes practices his preachments . Last year , not long after his Bond Club speech , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directorate of the Illinois Central railroad . On May 18 , 1938 , the " director-control " of this Midwestern road was transferred from New York to Chicago ( where the road 's operating headquarters are located ) . Moving the " director-control " out of New York meant moving the meetings of the board of directors ; it also meant purging the board of its Old Guard members . This was a pointed incident in the whole struggle between the Old Guard and its modern opponents in business , for the board of the Illinois Central had been an Old Guard stronghold from the earliest days . " In the seventies and eighties , " one historian says , " . . stock in the Illinois Central became the favorite solid investment for many of the old New York families . " Another remarks that buying stock in the Illinois Central " was considered the thing to do and regarded in much the same light as holding a pew at Trinity Church . " There is the root of the situation . In those early days the Vanderbilts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest shares in the ownership of the road , and also of course in the management . By 1938 the ownership had passed into the hands of 14,375 ordinary American common-stockholders ; but the management still reflected the power , tradition , and system of the Old Guard . Under the Old Guard system , inevitably , men were awarded rank and power in management not only because of possessing competence and ability , but also because of possessing the " right connections " in business and society , and the " right background " ( meaning ancestry , breeding , and education ) . Before the Harriman purge , the board of the Illinois Central clearly illustrated the results of this feudal method of recruiting personnel . Consider the five New Yorkers whose resignations were accepted by the board of the Illinois Central on May 18 , 1938 : 1 . Cornelius Vanderbilt . At sixty-six , he is the head of the Vanderbilt clan and a director in ten corporations ( excluding the Illinois Central ) . In his youth he puttered round railroad shops and invented a cylindrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , he soon lost interest in invention and in business , and threw himself heart and soul into the National Guard . He has devoted most of his energy to military activities , rising to the rank of brigadier general . 2 . Vincent Astor . He is the greatgrandson of John Jacob Astor , and the present head of the Astor clan . He inherited a fortune of $70,000,000 , and , as of May , 1938 , held directorships in eighteen large corporations . He has stated that " My interests are almost entirely in New York real estate " ; but as this was written , he was engaged in collecting rare fish in the South Pacific , from his yacht , Nourmahal. 3 . Robert Walton ( " Bertie " ) Goelet . Before his marriage , he was known as " America 's Wealthiest Bachelor . " As reported in the New York World-Telegram , Mr. Goelet visits " Newport in the summer , a Canadian hunting lodge in the early autumn , a French medieval castle during the pheasant season , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Georgia , to Florida ? turkey shooting ? and Paris in the spring . " However the paper does not specify when Mr. Goelet customarily coped with the management problems of the Illinois Central and the six other railroad and industrial corporations of which he was a director at the time of the Harriman purge . 4 . John D. Peabody . He is a member of the Manhattan law firm of Montgomery , Peabody &; Grace ; and he is the son of the late Charles A. Peabody , onetime chairman of the executive committee of the Illinois Central , onetime president of the Mutual Life Insurance Co. ( of which Cornelius Vanderbilt is a trustee ) , and onetime real estate trustee of the estate of John Jacob Astor. 5 . Robert E. Connolly . He is a native New Yorker who went to work as a clerk in the New York office of the Illinois Central in 1902 ; he has served as treasurer of the corporation since 1918 . Year after year , these men had been " elected " by the 14,000-odd stockholders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of successfully managing the system . Now consider the men chosen in May , 1938 , to fill the vacancies on the board of the Illinois Central ( the size of the board was increased from 13 to 15 at that time , so seven new directors were chosen ) : 1 . John L. Beeen of Chicago . A native of McComb , Mississippi , who started with the Illinois Central as a clerk in 1899 ; by May , 1938 , he had risen to be senior vice president of the system and he has since been elected its president . 2 . A. D. Geoghegan of New Orleans . He was born near Fayette , Mississippi , and started working in the cotton business in the ' 90s , as office boy , messenger , and stenographer . In 1908 he organized his own business , and finally , in1925 , created the Wesson Oil &; Snowdrift Co. of New Orleans , of which he is president . 3 . William R. King of Memphis . Born on a farm near Washington , Arkansas , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm which he now heads , the William R. Moore Dry Goods Co. of Memphis . 4 . Clifford W. Gaylord of St. Louis . A native of Lockport , Illinois , he was in the construction business before the War and the paper business afterward . He is president of the Gaylord Container Corporation , the New Orleans Corrugated Box Co. , the Texas Corrugated Box Co. , the Southern Container Co. , and the Florida Container Co. 5 . James Norris of Chicago . Born in Montreal , Canada , he formed the Norris Grain Co. in Chicago in 1906 , and has been one of the city 's leading grain merchants ever since . 6 . Thomas E. Wilson of Chicago . He was born in a small town in Ontario , Canada . He came to Chicago as a boy , working first for the Burlington Railroad and then in the meat-packing industry . He was elected president of the packing company , Sulzberger &; Sons , in 1916 , and the name was changed to Wilson &; Co. that same year . 7 . General Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life in the Army ? ten years of it in executive positions with the Panama Railway Co. , on construction of the Panama Canal . He entered business as an executive , and has been associated with both Montgomery , Ward &; Co. and Sears , Roebuck &; Co. since 1919 . He became president of Sears , Roebuck in 1928 ; and this year he became chairman of the board . The comparison between these new directors and the old ones speaks for itself . After the May purge , only five New Yorkers remained on the board . And one of these , an Old Guard financier named Jerome J. Hanauer , died the following September . The man selected to fill his place was John W. Rath of Waterloo , Iowa , situated on the Illinois Central , who was born in Ackley , Iowa , on the Illinois Central . He has headed the Rath Packing Co. of Waterloo since 1898 . Before May 18 , 1938 , all the directors of the Illinois Central except one were New Yorkers . To-day a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central System . The new directors would seem better fitted to represent the System 's 14,000-odd stockholders than were the old directors , whose background , experience , and geographical prejudice , for the most part , would seem to fit them to represent the original stockholder-owners of the 1 8 70 's . Messrs . Geoghegan , King , Rath , and their colleagues are professional business executives of large general experience , possessing specific management knowledge useful to a modern Midwestern railroad . Messrs . Vanderbilt , Goelet , et al , are not professional business executives and they possess a highly specialized business knowledge , of a kind chiefly useful in Wall Street before 1929 . That leaves the most important question to answer : Does the new directorate of the Illinois Central actually " direct " the affairs of the system ? Arc the new directors fitted to conceive socially desirable labor and public policies for the corporation ? Such questions are matter for individual judgment . But however the reader may answer them , this much remains certain : the new directors know what the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dealing with them , of a sort which the old directors , for the most part , did not possess . IV The largest industrial corporations in America , excepting the Ford Motor Co. , were put together by the Old Guard and developed by the Old Guard . These giant corporations have always constituted the most impressive embodiments of the Old Guard system of management . During the past year and ahalf the opponents of the Old Guard in business have been reorganizing the entire management system in several of these large corporations . Probably most important to ordinary people were the reorganizations of the General Motors Corporation and the United States Steel Corporation , which are worth examining in detail . Prior to its reorganization in May , 1937 , the General Motors Corporation had been strictly organized on the Old Guard model . Thus the managing or governing power of the corporation resided , in theory , in the following bodies : the board of directors , the finance committee , and the executive committee . Under this form , which prevailed in most large corporations at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board , and the finance committee ? all , ordinarily , more closely affiliated with New York financial interests than with the working management of the industry ? exercised the policy-making power . But the directors met infrequently ; in most things , the finance committee ran the corporation . In the case of General Motors , prior to the reorganization of May , 1937 , Lammot du Pont was chairman of the board , chairman of the corporation , and of course a member of the finance committee . The chairman of the finance committee was Donaldson Brown , a son-in-law of one of the du Ponts ( but also a working executive of General Motors ) . The membership of this powerful committee included , among others , four du Ponts , namely , Henry F. , Iren6e , Lammot , and Pierre S. ; two Morgan partners , namely , J. P. Morgan 's son , Junius S. Morgan , and George Whitney ; and Seward Prosser , president of the Guaranty Trust Company ( a " Morgan bank " ) . All the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the board of directors tended not to override decisions of the finance committee . The executive committee consisted of working executives of General Motors ; it exercised authority over operations ; but on the matters of critical policy , which affect ordinary people , it tended to carry out the wishes of the finance committee . Of course all this practice had been changing gradually , under the new pressure of the depression ; and on May 3 , 1937 , the directors adopted the formal reorganization . The finance committee and the executive committee were abolished . Two new committees were created : to the new policy committee was given the specific task of shaping the public and private policies of the corporation ; and thus the importance of this truly political function of corporations was for the first time recognized officially . The new administrative committee was created to administer the corporation 's business affairs . This was more than a nominal change . Assorted du Ponts and Wall Street figures were weeded out of the committees . The new policy committee , for instance , includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are working executives of General Motors , as is the new chairman , Alfred P. Sloan , Jr. ; and the new administration committee consists wholly of working executives . In the reorganization Mr. Sloan took Mr. du Pont 's place as chairman of the board and of the corporation . William S. Knudsen , who started with General Motors as a worker , became president of the corporation , in charge of operations ( in addition , on May 1 , 1939 , Mr. Knudsen was made chairman of the administration committee , replacing Mr. Sloan ) . The operating headquarters of General Motors remained nominally in New York after the reorganization . But in effect , the headquarters had been transferred to the center of operations in Detroit . As Business Week pointed out : " Detroit swelled a bit with the announcement of the General Motors reorganization , elevating William S. Knudsen to Corporation President and naming Marvin E. Coyle and Floyd 0 . Tanner vice presidents . . . the citynow claims 10 of the 17 vice presidents of General Motors . The story has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shift his headquarters from New York to Detroit because of more intense focusing of executive responsibility in Michigan . This is unnecessary with Mr. Knudsen taking all the administrative duties except those of a strictly financial nature . " The du Ponts , the Morgans , and such of their associates as Seward Prosser and John J. Raskob , all formerly of the finance committee , retained their places on the board of directors after the reorganization . But every clause in that reorganization had had the effect of restricting the power of the Old Guard in some way and of putting more power into the hands of professional working management . Also the reorganization , contrary to Old Guard principle , tended to define the specific duties and responsibilities of the various managing bodies and executive officers . In the early part of this century cynics spoke of reorganization as " rc-Morganization . " To-day " deMorganization " would be more apt . V The board of directors of U. S. Steel and the then-chairman of the board , Myron Taylor , reorganized that corporation between January and May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steel Corporation . They dropped certain members of the Old Guard and deprived others of their powers . They fractured the Old Guard traditions in " Big Steel . " They formally moved the operating headquarters of U. S. Steel from New York , where they had always been maintained , to the center of operations in Pittsburgh . Business Week , the McGraw-Hill magazine for business executives , remarked : " Big Steel 's complete reorganization of production and policy . . . shocked Wall Street 's hardshells down to their very spats . " This installation of a complete new management system in Steel was indeed a monster task : the traditions and customs now to be broken had been shaping since 1901 in strong and able hands . In 1901 , when the late J. P. Morgan formed U. S. Steel ? the first " billion-dollar corporation " ? he picked the late Judge Elbert Henry Gary to run it . And run it Judge Gary did , to the day of his death in 1927 . An Old Guard boss of the first calibre , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to execute these policies , and saw to it that his orders were carried out . He kept the operating headquarters in New York because he ran operations and , being a lawyer and financier primarily , he preferred New York to Pittsburgh . When he disagreed with his directors or with other business men about policies , he cracked down ; when he disagreed with labor organizations about policies , he cracked down . He truly ran Steel , which meant running dozens of works for the manufacture and processing of iron and steel , besides railroads , ship lines , and mining operations of several different sorts . Running U. S. Steel is similar in difficulty and complexity to running all American industry . Judge Gary ran it all the same . ( It has been alleged that the late J. P. Morgan and his associates , in their turn , ran Judge Gary . It is useless to debate this point , which has been denied as often and as adroitly as it has been made . The very nature of the Old Guard system of management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it impossible to locate formally and finally the source of authority and the seat of responsibility . ) Whether the boss , Judge Gary , ran Steel well or ill will never be generally known . But at any rate , it is certain that after his death in 1927 those interested in the corporation felt strongly a need for reorganization and modernization of the organization and the property . Myron Taylor , an associate of the present J. P. Morgan , was brought in in1929 as chairman of the finance committee , and little by little he took over this task . In 1932 he got the necessary power : he took J. P. Morgan 's place as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the corporation . Already , with the help of accountants , engineers , and other such technicians , Mr. Taylor had been studying the giant corporation . He continued these studies and obtained the consent of the directors to a broad plan of reorganization in 1932 . The reorganization finally went through in 1938 . The transfer of operating headquarters to Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodying operating authority in a new corporation , U. S. Steel of Delaware , owned by the parent , U. S. Steel of New Jersey . The president and directors of this new corporation , meeting in Pittsburgh , co-ordinate and supervise Steel 's operations by negotiating and making contracts with the heads of such subsidiaries as the American Bridge Co. , the American Steel &; Wire Co. , the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Co. , H. C. Frick Coke Co. , Michigan Limestone &; Chemical Co. , Oliver Iron Mining Co. , Pittsburgh Steamship Co. , and Tennessee Coal , Iron &; Railroad Co. ? in short , with all the subsidiaries of U. S. Steel except the public service and railroad companies . Benjamin F. Fairless was chosen to head this operating company , U. S. Steel of Delaware . He is a miner 's son and a one-time miner and steel worker . The twenty-one directors of his company are all professional , working executives in charge of various phases of Steel 's operations , hailing from Birmingham , Chicago , Cleveland , New York , Pittsburgh , and San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Steel 's reorganization is of interest : " U. S. Steel Shakes Off Old ' New York Rule , " ' was the headline . " Practical steel men , " the story said , " will have full control of the operations of the subsidiaries which make up the United States Steel Corporation . . . . They will shortly take over the powers formerly held by members of the board of directors , sitting in New York and largely chosen for their financial prestige . " The creation of this rational machinery for administering the production and distribution of from half a billion to one billion dollars ' worth of iron and steel products annually was indeed important to the ordinary business men of the Midwest for whom the Tribune speaks . It was important also to the 200,000-odd employees of U. S. Steel , to the 200,000-odd stockholders who " own " U. S. Steel , and to the ordinary people of the land . But more important still to all the people was the creation last year of a planned management organization for determining the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . When Myron Taylor completed his reorganization in April , 1938 and resigned as chairman of the board he did not turn the corporation and its policymaking function over to one man , a boss comparable to Judge Gary ( who was chairman of the board , chairman of the finance cotninittee , and chief executive officer of the corporation ) . Instead , he turned the corporation over to three men . And what is more important , the duties and responsibilities of these three men were formally and officially limited and defined : the men were subordinated to the offices . Enders Voorhees , as chairman of the finance committee , helps to formulate and executes the financial policies of the corporation . Benjamin F. Fairless , as president , helps to formulate and executes the general operating policies of the corporation ; and as president of the Steel Corporation of Delaware , he helps to formulate and executes the detailed operating policies of the corporation . Edward R. Stettinius , as chairman of the board , acts as a general liaison and supervising officer , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations of the company . " This last feature of the new system is particularly significant , In giving the chief officer of the Steel Corporation the full-time job of administering " public relations " the management recognized the essentially political nature of the corporation 's activities , and the consequent necessity for dealing with the public ? through the public representatives in Washington , and directly . This is the first such complete and formal recognition by an American corporation of the first grade . Hitherto " public relations " have been left to employees devoid of policy-making power or , at the most , to vice presidents , making something of a mock of the idea of " dealing with the public . " Also last April , when the three new officers took over , the by-laws of the Steel Corporation were altered . The changes , generally speaking , restricted and defined the powers of the executive officers and of the managing boards and committees ; also arbitrary and irrat:anal authority , built up during the Old Guard regime , was stopped off . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter governing the finance committee : the finance committee was deprived of its former " power to remove all officers , agents , and employees of the company , except officers elected or appointed by the board of directors . " Thus the finance committee of U. S. Steel has been limited to performing the function implied by its name . This limitation , in its small way , is a step toward creating a " government of laws " in business : in precisely the same spirit , the authors of the Constitution wrote down restrictive clauses , limiting the Congress to making laws , and the President to executing these laws . VI The attack on the OM Guard is being pressed also in the financial and banking community of the United States . Of course such reorganizations as U. S. Steel 's have already indirectly affected financial practice . Last year , for example , the reorganized Steel Corporation made a $50,000,000 bank loan , and it was announced that Chicago and Pittsburgh banks were to be included in the list of lending institutions in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its banking operations in the communities where major operations of the subsidiaries are carried on . " This innovation is of little intrinsic importance . But it illustrates how the new spirit in business management may make itself felt in all sorts of subsidiary transactions . The practice of the Old Guard was to keep as much business as possible -- -especially financial business ? close to home , which is to say , close to New York ; the new managements are moving in the direction of doing business where it rationally ought to be done . The main attack on the Old Guard in finance , for the past year and a half , has centered in one man who sensed and expressed the spirit of the day . The man is William 0 . Douglas , chairman of the Securities &; Exchange Commission during the period under discussion ( President Roosevelt appointed him a justice of the Supreme Court in March , 1939 ) . Mr. Douglas was unique in the New Deal : he organized his official program of action round a philosophy which was coherent , continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Douglas had several responsibilities : it was his duty to regulate the traffic in securities and the conduct of the securities exchanges ; and also , under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 , to bring about the dissolution of publicutility holding companies . He translated these duties into a practical constructive program : by education , cooperation , and regulation he attempted to assist the development of strong regional financial centers , of securities exchanges organized as responsible public institutions , and of geographically integrated utility systems dispensing their legal , financial , and other business in their operating districts . Accordingly , the opponents of the Old Guard in business found it advantageous to make common cause with Mr. Douglas on more than one occasion . Notably , the progressive members of the New York Stock Exchange , working with Mr. Douglas and the SEC , succeeded in defeating the Exchange 's Old Guard under Richard Whitney and in reorganizing the Exchange completely . The revision of the Exchange 's constitution and the reorganization of its management took place in the late winter and spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-member president ? a professional , giving his full time to managing the Exchange as a public institution responsible to the public . The first man hired to handle this job was William McC . Martin , a former statistician , bank examiner , and broker from St. Louis . The board of governors of the Exchange was reduced in size and was made more nearly representative of the public interest by the inclusion of six nonmember partners of New York firms dealing directly with the public , six partners from out-of-town firms dealing with the public , and three " representatives of the public . " The three chosen last year under the latter head were Gen. Robert E. Wood of Chicago , chairman of the board of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. ; Carl C. Conway , chairman of the board of the Continental Can Co. , and chairman of the committee which worked out the plan of reorganization for the Exchange ; and Robert Hutchins , president of the University of Chicago . ( Note the similarity between these changes in the hoard of governors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of directors of the Illinois Central . ) Further , the standing committees of the Exchange were reduced in size ; and in number , from 17 to 7 . Formerly they were composed largely of governors ; now the general membership is better represented on these committees ; and they are organized so as to be effective policymaking bodies in their various fields . Under the old organization this great Exchange , where roughly eighty per cent ( by dollar volume ) of securities transactions by American investors are executed , was unwieldy and stiff ; duties and responsibilities were not defined . Thus the " Law Committee , " containing a particularly well-knit Old Guard group , came to exercise the real , though unofficial , directing power in the Exchange before the reorganization ( just as the " Finance Committee " had formerly exercised the main power in General Motors ) . The objection to the Old Guard members who had controlled the Board of Governors , the Law Committee , and thereby , the Exchange , was not that they were dishonest or incompetent : none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply that the Old Guard represented private and highly specialized interests ; the Old Guard did not represent or understand the interests of the general membership of the Exchange , of the out-of-town business interests with which the Exchange continually deals , or of the investing public . The active endeavor of Chairman Douglas and of the progressive group in the Exchange was to create a professional management more nearly representative of these interests . As President Martin has said : " The spirit and purpose of the reorganization has been to provide a simpler , more efficient , and more democratic structure adaptable to changing times and conditions . " The spirit and purpose of the reorganization , described in other words , was to purge the Old Guard out of the Exchange and to abolish the Old Guard system of managing economic activity . These are two sides of the same coin . Co-operating with Chairman Douglas of the SEC , the opponents of the Old Guard in several other national financial institutions have recently been able to accomplish reorganizations based on a purge of the Old Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Curb Exchange , forinstance . Again , at the convention of the Investment Bankers ' Association in October , 1938 , the Old Guard element was voted out of power ; while the opponents of the Old Guard in this instance were observed to be co-operating with Chairman Douglas . However , the Investment Bankers ' Association is one thing and investment banking is another . The great investment banking houses , which underwrite , distribute , and sell securities and thereby supply American industry with capital , still are largely organized in accordance with Old Guard principles . They are concentrated in Manhattan more completely than any other business group . Chairman Douglas was able to do very little about this during his term except to conduct an educational campaign . He spoke in regional financial centers all over the country , along these lines : " . .. well over one half of our capital market .. . is concentrated in lower Manhattan . . . . i should expect that a reduction in absentee financing would result in a reduction of absentee ownership and management , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for the home folks . . . . I should expect that the development of regional capital markets would bring new capital and new brains into the investment banking industry and the financial management of local business . " Thus encouraged by the Chairman of the SEC , financiers outside New York have in fact made a beginning toward changing prevailing practices in investment banking . For example , in July , 1938 , the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce formed a " Committee of Banking and Investment Banking , " intended specifically to enlarge the capital market in the Cleveland district and to bring a greater share of national financial business to Cleveland . In evaluating this activity it is necessary to remember that the bankers and investment bankers of such cities as Cleveland have depended for business on the Old Guard in New York since the earliest times , and that , therefore , even the gentlest act of revolt is a matter touching the bread and butter of the financiers of Cleveland . This Cleveland Committee , the first of its kind , probably could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cleveland investment banker and utility magnate , made a speech in 1930 on the subject of financial decentralization . " Is the political independence of the sovereign state a thing of great value , " he inquired rhetorically , " if at the same time the State is financially dependent upon some distant State ? " These mild questionings were not calculated to please the Old Guard ; and in 1938 , during an investigation by the SEC , Mr. Eaton testified that that " indiscreet speech " was a factor which forced him to surrender control of his investment trust company , Continental Shares , Inc. , to other financiers . He said that in 1930 he had been having a tussle with certain financiers over his views . " The banks , " he said , " were very powerful at that time and commanded enormous influence . " In the light of these remarks , and considering the recent activity of the Cleveland Committee , the following incidental note is enlightening . It appeared in the syndicated column , " Washington MerryCo-Round , " by Drew Pearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad announced the flotation of a big bond issue and called for bids from investment houses . Halsey , Stuart &; Co. of Chicago , and Otis &; Cox of Cleveland , bid 100 each . Highly pleased with these par offers , the C &O; prepared to award the issue to the two firms , when representatives of New York financiers descended on the railroad with a loud squawk . The Wall Street bankers had handled most of its financing in the past and now they vigorously protested . They also spoke sonorously about the need to uphold the prestige of the New York money market . C &O; executives were not impressed , but offered to let them bid on the bonds . They retired and after a long wait returned with a bid of 9514 . The offer was rejected and the Wall St. men left in a high state of peeve . The New York financial editors reported this illuminating incident with enormous restraint . For example , the New York Herald-Tribune said : " It is understood that spirited bidding took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which leading New York banking firms participated . In the past Chesapeake &; Ohio financing has been handled by Morgan , Stanley &; Co. , Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , and Edward B. Smith Co . " VII The fundamentally weak and dangerous character of the Old Guard " government of men " was publicly revealed in two specific cases in 1937 and ' 38 . No theoretical argument for instituting a democratic " government of laws " in business could have produced the effect of these two dramatic revelations . The first was the case of Richard Whitney ; the second was the case of McKesson &; Robbins and Philip Musica , alias F. Donald Coster . The two cases were similar . In each case a criminal or swindler , of a type sufficiently familiar , succeeded in holding a responsible position in a public institution , at the same time siphoning off other people 's money over a period of years ; and in each case the swindler in question accomplished his feat simply by taking full advantage of the weakness inherent in the Old Guard system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been president of the New York Stock Exchange . At the time his crime was discovered he was the recognized leader of the Old Guard group in the Exchange and was waging an effective fight to keep the management organization of the Exchange from being modernized . It came out that he had been illegally using securities , which he had been holding as trustee , for his own purposes ; and he was given a term of five years in Sing Sing . It came out that he had been carrying on his larcenies for a long period , and that several respected members of the Wall Street financial community had known this for several months at least before the public revelation . The case told much about the Old Guard method of management , as applied specifically to the Stock Exchange . The SEC , having investigated , described the Old Guard philosophy or method involved in these terms : " This philosophy was characterized by the unwritten code of silence respecting misdeeds or misconduct of a member such as Richard Whitney . . . . It was evidenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business judgment indicated a contrary course . It was apparent in the failure to render more than lip service to the concept of a public institution . It manifested itself in the administration of the Stock Exchange as if it were a private social club . " This summary of the Old Guard philosophy is worth keeping in mind while studying the case of McKesson &; Robbins , which revealed the Old Guard 's weakness with even more appalling clarity . It boiled down to this . Philip Musica , an ex-convict operating under the alias of F. Donald Coster , had maintained a fictitious " wholesale drug department " within McKesson &; Robbins for ten years ; for ten years , he had caused this department , representing $18,000,000 of fictitious assets , to carry on fictitious dealings with equally fictitious " independent companies . " By means of this obfuscation , Musica had been able to help himself to McKesson &; Robbins ' funds for ten years without being detected . Musica 's fictitious department , his fictitious companies , inventories , and transactions , existed only on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten years , any check or audit of these books against the actual facts would have given Musica 's game away . When all this came out the question naturally was asked : why had n't the company 's books been checked to the point of revealing Musica 's criminal operations , during those ten long years ? Musica did not own the company . Its stockholdersowned it ; a board of directors , " elected " by the stockholders , was supposed to be managing it in their interests ; and to administer the supposed policies of the board , officers had been appointed , not only " Coster , " but also Julian Thompson , treasurer , and John McGloon , vice president in charge of accounting . Why then , with all this machinery , were the books of McKesson &; Robbins never checked against the facts ? The answer to this question has appeared , piecemeal , in the testimony of the various officers and directors . Why did n't Mr. Thompson , the treasurer , check the books ? Here is one reason : Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual responsibility for the organization of accounting or credits . " Besides , Mr. Thompson testified , " Mr. Coster was always the dominant one because he was very forceful and hardworking . He was the largest common stockholder and everyone deferred to him in the fundamental decisions of the business . " So much for Mr. Thompson . Why , now , did Mr. McGloon , vice president in charge of accounting , fail to check the affairs of the crude drug department as set forth in the books ? The answer to that is simple . Mr. McGloon says that it never occurred to him to be curious about the crude drug department ? " not when it had been approved by the board of directors . " ( Note : possibly it is necessary to discount this testimony . As this was written Mr. McGloon had just been indicted by the Grand Jury . However his reference to the directors , even if disingenuous , is revealing . ) This brings us to the board of directors : why did the directors fail to inquire into Musica 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Director Seeley testified that he had " never heard of the crude drug department until this case came up . " He said he had never discussed it with other directors or heard them discuss it at board meetings . Director Van Vleet said he had attended six or eight board meetings in 1937 and ' 38 and had never heard crude drugs discussed . However in August , 1933 , the board of directors had commissioned Waddill Catchings , an expert corporation analyst and executive , " to examine the business and make constructive suggestions . " Accordingly , Mr. Catchings reported to the board in 1934 that the crude drug department was in the " most chaotic condition " he had ever seen ; and he said there were indications of " manipulations of accounts . " Appalled , the board hushed up Catchings ' report and dropped the whole matter . Director John Wilson Cutler , a partner in the Wall Street investment banking house of Smith , Barney &; Co. , explained why this was done in one of the most curious statements in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other directors , had been " elected " by the stockholders of McKesson &; Robbins , began by testifying that he was on the board " to protect the bondholders . " Then he explained why he opposed checking up on the crude drug department , as follows : LL . . I will tell you exactly how I felt about it . I thought Mr. Catchings was endeavoring to make a place for himself at or near the top in the management of this company , and I thought then , and I have no reason to change that feeling to date , that his record and standing did not entitle him to that position . " There is no use examining the details of the case any farther , because they arc really pathetic . Quite apart from the fantastic depredations of the Musicas , the whole management plan of the com pany was revealed to be a tangle . Elected representatives of the stockholders conceived it to be their duty to protect the bondholders ; the treasurer was n't really a treasurer ? instead he was a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the vice president in charge of accounting passed the buck to the directors , and the directors , in many cases , pleaded total ignorance of a department representing$18,000,000 of the assets of the company they were supposed to be directing . More : Price , Waterhouse &; Co. , the leading firm of accountants in the country , had been chosen by the directors annually to prepare audits of the company 's books for submission to the stockholders . Every year for ten years this firm certified to the stockholders that the affairs of McKesson &; Robbins were as represented on the books , collecting $1,000,000 in fees for doing so . In all this time Price , Waterhouse &; Co. not only failed to discover the true state of affairs in McKesson &; Robbins , but also these " blue-ribbon " accountants apparently failed even to become suspicious . What makes this fact even more surprising is the circumstance that individual examinations of the books had aroused the suspicions of comparative amateurs like Waddill Catchings , Treasurer Thompson , and others , over a period of years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventories of all departments of McKesson &; Robbins , except the crude drug department : that is , they made partial examinations of the actual goods represented on the books . " Spot checking " in the crude drug department would have revealed that its inventories were fictitious ; but Price , Waterhouse &; Co. did not " spot check " these inventories , because " Mr. Coster " said not to . In considering this case it is necessary to remember that the officers and directors of McKesson &; Robbins , excepting the Musicas and possibly one or two others , were neither stupid nor dishonest . On the contrary , they seem to have been well above average both in intelligence and probity . But they subscribed to the Old Guard method of management by personal authority ; they set up a little " government of men " in McKesson &; Robbins , placing all the real power in the hands of Philip Musica . They placed themselves , the business , and the owners of the business in the hands of this one man . Unfortunately he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum to the movement to build a new system of business management . As this is written , the McKesson &; Robbins case is four months old , and it has not been completely unraveled . But already it has brought results : already it has caused changes in management methods , and directed attention to the question of corporate responsibility to the public . Several firms , among them the American Can Co. , the Radio Corporation of America , and the Consolidated Edison Co. of New York have just amended their by-laws to provide that auditing firms be elected by the stockholders , not appointed by the directors . The Schenley Distillers Corporation , in preparing its annual report last March , hired a firm of accountants to check the books , as usual , and , for the first time , a firm of engineers to check the physical inventories . Of course various suggestions for statutory regulation of accounting and corporate methods have been made ? most of them , it is true , uninformed and superficial . The main result of the cast is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate managements and directorates , and about the meaning of such formal proceedings as " stockholder elections . " Even staid Philip A. Benson , president of the American Bankers ' Association , was sufficiently moved by the case to state last January that the responsibility of corporate directors to " direct " is becoming more widely recognized . " Directors may attend a hurried meeting , " President Benson pointed out , " listen to a few remarks and reports by the presiding officer , pass a resolution , such as the declaration of a dividend , and leave the meeting . They have not thus altogether discharged their duty , " he cautiously went on . " They should inquire how the business is being conducted , what have been the results , and what is its condition . " That statement is a criticism of Old Guard practice . VIII Taken separately , the events described in this article are not of great importance . But because they all press in the same direction they have combined to produce nationally important results . For example : the Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions where it operates ; the investment bankers of Cleveland band together to increase the amount of corporate financing handled in their district ; and Chairman Douglas administers the Utility Holding Company Act with a view to creating regionally integrated utility systems , headed up regionally and not in New York , and dispensing their financial business regionally , not in New York , Here three separate interests , inspired by as many dissimilar motives , have undertaken to change prevailing practice ; and the total result is a definite step toward decentralizing the financial mechanism of the United States . Again : General Motors abolishes its finance committee ; U. S. Steel , while maintaining its finance committee , deprives it of the power to dismiss employees , and deprives the chairman of the finance committee of executive control over operations ( by assigning these two different functions to two different men ) ; meanwhile the Stock Exchange abolishes its " Law Committee , " and the Illinois Central moves its " director-control " out of New York . These are all different moves , arranged in terms of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net result of measurably limiting Old Guard power and of weakening Old Guard strongholds . Again : the Stock Exchange provides places for " representatives of the public " on the board of governors ; several companies provide for " stockholder election " of auditors ; and several organizations strictly and publicly define the duties and responsibilities of their officers and managing bodies ; all of which has the effect of setting up a more nearly democratic system of management and of giving representation in management to more of the people of the country . Again : the Stuck Exchange grants representation in management to out-oftown brokers ; the Illinois Central grants representation in management to business interests in the territories served by the system ; General Motors increases both the number of committee members and the number of vice-presidents living in Detroit , and gives the chief operating authority to a Detroit man ; and Steel creates an operating authority consisting of twenty-one working steel executives from all over the nation ( as a substitute for Judge Gary ) . The net effect is that a planned partnership of professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the key position in management once held by the Old Guard . That is the pattern of events to-day . Perhaps a word of qualification or reminder is also necessary . This new business movement is not finished and its objectives are not fixed . It is based on mixed motives and a profound human fondness for compromise . To cite but one illustration of this : W. Averell Harriman , who succeeded in moving the board of the Illinois Centralout of Ncw York , has no intention of trying to move the board of the other railroad with which he is closely connected , the Union Pacific , to the center of operations in Omaha ; the UP has stronger and more important financial connections than the Illinois Central , and a stronger " tradition . " Also , Mr. Harriman , who advocates moving industrial managements out of New York , considers the corollary movement toward financial decentralization unsound , unwise , and impossible . No one should be shocked to find such a measure of inconsistency in a human undertaking . It is possible to recriminate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks , the du Ponts , run General Motors , and about how that octopus , J. P. Morgan , runs U. S. Steel . It is possible to scent out self-interest and hold it up to the light with loud cries . But this whole method has the one fault that it never gets any results . It is better to find out how business management works . It is better to become familiar with the forces which are shaping a new kind of management . It is better to form a clear national idea of what the economic government ought to be and of what it ought to do . . . . Understanding is better .
