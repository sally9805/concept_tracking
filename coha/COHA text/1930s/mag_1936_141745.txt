PRESS <P> A solid block of 300 French daily and weekly newspapers began last month pounding away at the so-called " New Deal Cabinet " of Socialist Premier Lon Blum . Over and over they hurled charges of which the most effective was the weekly Gringoire 's incessant repetition that during the War the present Minister of the Interior , Roger Salengro , deserted from the front-line trenches and rode off into Germany on a bicycle . <P> Unable to deny that he was in fact court-martialed for desertion , M. Salengro became the butt of jokesters in Paris music halls who kept referring to " Cyclist Salengro " until members of the Blum Cabinet would have liked to scream . They appointed a " Jury of Honor " under General Marie Gustave Gamelin . Chief of the French General Staff , and this last fortnight whitewashed the Minister of Interior by discovering extenuating circumstances , but he is likely to be called " Cyclist Salengro " to his dying day . Indignant , Premier Blum was resolved to punish the man he blamed for organizing the anti-Blum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris of the Agence Havas , chief French wire service and advertising agency . <P> M. Guimier handled more particularly the advertising side of the business and in France it is not considered strange that there should exist an Agence which in the U. S. could be duplicated only by merging into strange bedfellowship , for example , Batten , Barton , Durstine &; Osborn and the Associated Press . Adman Guimier is also the publisher of the violently anti-Blum daily Journal and as such is a newsman in his own right . Last week he broke the biggest French press story in years by resigning his Havas directorship and hurling the charge that Premier Blum had told Havas they could take their choice : either M. Guimier must resign from Havas , or the Havas advertising agency must be unmerged and separated from the Havas news service . How the Premier of the French Republic ever came to have the notion that it is his right to face French journalistic organizations with such alternatives was this week the burning question . Alluding to the fact that the Premier is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't we even print that Blum has been circumcized ? " <P> This was printed and nothing was done about it , but Premier Blum does intend to introduce shortly a law compelling all French newsorgans to list and publish the sources from which they derive their income . It is against this that M. Guimier and his friends have been waging what became an open vendetta when the Premier forced him out of Havas . Under the new law the Premier 's own newsorgan , Le Populaire , will have to print that it is largely subsidized by the Socialist Party : L'Humanit will have to print that it is subsidized by the Communist Party ; the Action Franaise will have to print that it is subsidized by the Royalist Party- and none of these three Paris papers will mind in the least . They constitute openly the bought and kept press of the pinks , the Reds and the bluebloods , but who keeps M. Guimier and most of the 300 papers now attacking Blum ?             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
