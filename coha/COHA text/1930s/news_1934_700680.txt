txt The New York Chapter of the American Red Cross , having during a period of twelve years shown the possibility of bringing about favorable health conditions in what was once one of the " real sore spots of the city , " has turned over to the city for its use the East Harlem Health Centre in which the experiment was made . The transfer illustrates what has taken place in the , evolution of most of our governmental activities . Private volunteer effort has generally shown not only the need but the way of meeting it , and has then turned the permanent maintenance over to the community , State or nation , and most often  --  till lately , at any rate  --  to the community . Mayor LAGUARDIA and the Commissioner of Health accepted with appreciation the house and equipment as a model for a series of such centres which , it is hoped , may be built in the next few years . One such additional centre is put first on the list of things that the Mayor promises to get done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in prevention of sickness results in saving in expenditure for hospitals . In the original East Harlem district the infant death rate has been reduced by nearly if not quite one-half . Before the centre began to function , the death rate from diphtheria averaged 32 per hundred thousand per year , whereas in the last three years , 1931-33 , there were only two deaths from this cause . In the adjoining area , which has recently been added , the infant death rate is far higher than in the demonstration district . The great boon of such a centre is the neighborliness and even intimacy of ? the service . There is a danger always that when it passes out of the direct concern of volunteer effort it may lose something of the spirit that is essential ' to its highest effectiveness . The Mayor at the Hudson- Guild function on the same ilay. expressed him- self as ashamed to be living in a community where charity is necessary . But . whether charity , which is still imperative , is administered under governmental or private support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its close cooperation . " Health on every . doorstep " is the goal of such a , movement for the city as it is now for that district . VIRGIL said that Jupiter had made hard the lot of the farmer to sharpen his wits . , The farmer today has a hard lot of it , but with compensations that strengthen his own character . The chinch bug has come back to add its devastation to that which the drought wrought in the fields of the Midwest . It flourishes in a dry Summer and , beginning with small grain , migrates to the green cornfields , moving in billions , " like a living carpet . " It has now extended its ravages over parts of Oklahoma , Eastern Kansas and Nebraska , Southern Iowa , the greater part of Missouri and all of Illinois and Indiana . But the Federal Government has appropriated a million dollars to supplement local effort in checking the advance of this mighty army , Trench warfare has been resorted to . Barrier ridges are plowed across the path of the insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tops of these ridges . Repelled by this , the bugs run along the barriers and fall into the pits , where they are destroyed in great quantities .
