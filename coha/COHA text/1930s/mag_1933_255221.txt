Argentine wheat farmers , overdue last week on their spring sowing , could not get a plow into the ground that a long drought had baked iron-hard . And due sometime next month was a dread enemy : the scourge of locusts trying to repeat their last year 's feat of eating clean two northern provinces . Last week brought the farmers a good turn on both counts . Rain fell and softened the hard ground . And the Ministry of Agriculture got under way early against the locusts by announcing $5,000,000 worth of contracts for 12,000 mi. of sheet-iron locust barriers . <P> The contracts brought good news to British ironmasters , not so good news to U. S. ironmasters . Favored by the pending British-Argentine trade treaty , British companies will deliver two-thirds of the 12,000 mi. of sheet-iron , U. S. companies the rest . The last such contract , in 1924 , went entirely to U. S. companies . <P> On delivery next month the sheet-iron will be distributed at cost to Argentine wheat farmers to wall in their sprouting fields . The dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheet-iron , hop short , pile up in rustling drifts . Workmen will rake them up , burn them in oil or sack them for sale to the Department of Agriculture Defense . The dried and sacked locusts will be sold abroad as fertilizer . <P> Argentina 's one-man Government , frustrated old Hipolito Irigoyen , died last July , stripped of power and mourned bitterly by 150,000 poor followers , including many who called themselves Personalistas Irigoyenistas ( " Personal Friends of Irigoyen " ) . Last week Irigoyen 's ranch was put up for auction . A few " personal friends " showed up to buy his steers for $18 each , his horses for $2.
