IT WAS said by Comte that Denis Diderot was the greatest genius of the eighteenth century , and by Goethe that a failure to appreciate him was the sure mark of a Philistine . Every age , indeed , is too complex to be embodied in a single figure ; and the eighteenth century in France was both more and less than all that Diderot implied . Yet it is not untrue to say that he summarized supremely certain fundamental aspects of its spirit . Its infinite curiosity , its passion for omniscience , something of its endless talent for the making of systems , its faith in the destiny of man , its desire to end the needless infliction of pain , its confidence in the power of science to conquer the realm of nature , its happy certitude in the ability of man to overcome the need for the supernatural ? all these are of its essence ; and all of these are more certainly a part of Diderot than of any other thinker of the time . Compared to him , the hard clarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rousseau seems only the most eloquent of mystic reactionaries . He is the leader of a mighty army in search of conquests which still elude our hopes . He is the high priest of a church none the less ecclesiastical because it marched to do battle with the self-styled armies of the Lord . To appreciate what he was , we must remember when he did his work . The France of 1750 offered little prospect of good to ardent and inventiveminds . Politically and economically bankrupt , it still disposed of a social system which made of birth the supreme test of personal merit . Religiously stagnant and theologically obscurantist , it was so morally degenerate that , as Voltaire said , vice had ceased to pay to virtue even the homage of hypocrisy . Its social life was built upon a theory of aristocratic privilege which surrendered to patronage the rights of intelligence ; and to think fearlessly was still to court the risks of prison and exile . Not even the elegant minuet of the salon can obscure the price which humble men and women paid that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Geoffrin , there was the Chevalier de Ia Barre ; if there was the brilliant tragi-comedy of Madame du Deffand , there was also the grim fate of Calas and his kindred . Wherever we turn in the eighteenth century , its brilliance , before the advent of the philosophers , is obscured by the ghastly shadows of the cost it involved , The ancien rigime deprived men of half their humanity that a fragment of their kind might know something of the beauty of life . In the thirty years before 1789 a revolution was effected in the mind and temper of the French people , the quality of which compares , for its intensity , with that of the Renaissance two hundred years before . New prospects opened before mankind . New hopes were kindled , new discoveries were made . The chains which fetter the human spirit lost something of their power to imprison and to impede . The hopes , perhaps , were hardly realized ; the discoveries contained , in fact , less prospect than their makers had dared to dream . Yet no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century without the sense that real progress had been made . A blow was struck at obscurantist despotism , both in politics and religion , from which it has never recovered . The right of the common man to be master of his own fate was declared with an emphasis which no longer brooks permanent denial . The privilege of reason to follow its discoveries whithersoever they may lead , the splendor of unlimited speculation for its own sake , these were laid down with a conviction that has left their opponents ever since upon the defensive . There is something of the exhilaration of spring in those thirty years . Mankind seems to have renewed its youth : after the dead inertia of winter it has once again the freshness of a new promise of growth . In that revolution Diderot is a primary figure . Born in 1713 of prosperous working-class parents , he was , like so many distinguished radicals of his generation , a pupil of the Jesuits ; and they were not without hope that their brilliant scholar would become an ornament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which his father apprenticed him , had any attractions for Diderot . Once he had tasted the charms of Paris life , its endless talk , its feverish exhilaration , its sense that one hovers perpetually upon the verge of great discovery , nothing that involved routine could hold him , For nearly twenty years he was a dweller in theupper reaches of Grub Street , different only from a thousand other natives of that dreary waste by his infinite resourcefulness and his inability to keep an enemy . Like a thousand others also , he married and repented of his bargain ; like many another , he worked stoutly for the woman to whom he was unsuited and adored the daughter of the marriage . He had one mistress whose futility was equalled only by her folly , and another of whom little can be said save that his letters to her are perhaps the most valuable source of our knowledge of his character and ideas . We can see him in these early years , doing any hack job that offered , from sermons for the Jesuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaftesbury 's essays . He seems to have torn the heart out of every book he read and never to have forgotten its substance . There was no limit to his interests . Philosophy , art , chemistry , anatomy , medicine , physics , literature , the drama , he had read about them all , made practical researches into most , could write about all of them well , and about some of them profoundly . We have glimpses of a man upon whom police and clergy kept a watchful eye , of suppers with Rousseau and Condillac , of a man glad to do service to any poor devil of an author , always working and always talking : the kind of man who is a legend to the Fleet Street of his generation , and forgotten within a week of his death . And , indeed , had Diderot died in 1750 he would have remained practically unknown save as a superior hack of promise who lived as the publishers ' slave . By then he had written two or three interesting philosophical tracts and a volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement was the offer to edit an encyclopedia upon the basis of as English work by one DIDEROT : HOMAGE TO A GENIUS 69P Chambers . He accepted the task , and for twenty years he made its portly folios the artillery of one of the greatest armies that have ever served the cause of freedom . It is , indeed , impossible to overestimate the qualities Diderot displayed as editor . Courage , patience , resolution , devotion , these he showed as they have rarely been shown . He braved the thunders of the Church , the threats of the State , desertion even by such friends as D'Alembert and Voltaire , the treachery of his publishers . The enterprise converted him into an eminent man who was at the head and front of the European movement for intellectual enlightenment . Without ever being wealthy , he became comfortable . He could write for his own pleasure , and cultivate his friends . He could go out to the Baron d'Holbach 's , and at those famous dinners pour out that endless stream of ardent discourse which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him merely in his writings . Men like Grimm and Voltaire , Helvetius and Montesquieu gave him their respect and friendship . He was courted by Frederic of Prussia and that Empress Catherine who so nobly esteemed the free play of intellect in all countries save her own . H he was seen rarely in the salons , whose elaborate etiquette embarra.ssed him , he was always , as Madame Necker 's letters show , an honored guest there . He tasted the life about him to the full . He met everyone and examined everything . Save Rousseau , he never lost a friend ; and he met no one of whom he did not become the friend . He had the power to be interested in all that is a part of human experience , and the genius to adapt himself to the Empress Catherine in her palace in St. Petersburg as well as to the workman who explained to him the machinery in some factory he was visiting . The man of books saw life around him aboutas completely as it has ever been given to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no one who was attracted but was influenced . He did not , indeed , like Voltaire , become the uncrowned king of the mind of his generation ; nor did he , like Rousseau , give birth to a movement of European significance . But when he died , in 1784 , it could be truly said of him that he was at the center of every effort in his age which sought the betterment of its quality ; that , if he did not plan the battle , it could not have been so fruitfully won if he had been absent when the essential decisions were made . Diderot is one III of the few seminal figures in the history of thought who never gave birth to a masterpiece and was incapable of building a system . To understand him , we must grasp first the significance of the Encyclopedia , and the richness of the hints he threw out upon almost every aspect of philosophy . He was not a great philosopher , but he made his impact there . He was not a great critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater as well as the theory of art . Though he did no original work in theological criticism , the Church rightly regarded him as , after Voltaire , the most important of its enemies . His political ideas are for the most part the best commonplaces of his time ; but they are notable for the eloquent clarity with which they are stated and a certain plebeian note in their substance which reveals that , with him and , more notably , with Rousseau , the Third Estate was at last beginning to emphasize its claims . There is hardly a whole work of Diderot 's which is still worth reproduction in its entirety ; yet so powerful was the range and force of his mind that one could make an anthology from his writings as outstanding in quality and insight as any in the history of the modern mind . There had been encyclopedias before that of Diderot 's , notably the remarkable volumes in which Bayle foreshadowed the coming of the Enlightenment . There has been none , before or since , to which the same importance attaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are valuable articles in its volumes , those of Quesnay , fur example , which mark an epoch in economics , or of Turgot , which are decisive in the history of philology . It is not even that no one had ever previously thought of producing a work which should literally cover the whole range of human knowledge as it was then known . It is much more the temper in which the work is written to which its importance is due , together with a realization of reaches of human effort the social impact of which had escaped all previous inquirers . The Encyclopedia is a manifesto of a party struggling to free itself from the trammels of a despotic State and an obscurantist Church . It is a claim for the unlimited right of free inquiry , an insistence that reason , not faith , intelligence and not dogma , are the tests by which truth is established . It has , of course , its faults . There are inaccuracies and to spare ; there are compromises with truth that the censorship may be evaded ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can read its pages without a new sense of the dignity of the mind or a new ardor for the establishment of its rights . ' What it garnered was the outcome of that speculative revolution which hi majestic progress from Descartes to Newton had replaced hypothesis by observation and conceived of the universe as capable of rational explanation without supernatural intervention . It transfers the center of intellectual interest from the forces we can not apprehend tothose within our control . It makes knowledge the outcome not of mystic insight but of verified experience , not of dogmatic command but of consistent inquiry . The Encyclopedia registers the triumph of the scientific spirit over its religious rival ; and it was Diderot who dominated the organ of victory . Not less important is the social spirit which pervades the Encyclopedia . Here the novelty of temper is greater than may appear upon the surface . It is the first popular exposition of the Baconian thesis that the increase of scientific knowledge is the measure of man 's power over his environment ; the sense of science as an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the happiness of mankind . Notable throughout is the reformer 's mood , the constant insistence that man must not only seek to assuage but act to prevent misery . There is the emphasis on this life as that with which men are concerned , the refusal to make eternity the keynote of effort . It is also striking that Diderot should have given such detailed and exact attention to the state of the industrial arts ; here he was a genuine innovator who glimpsed the significance not only of the application of science to industry but also of the social value of the part played by productive effort in human good . Throughout also Diderot seeks the reform of an antiquated legal system ; he has advanced , and even modern , views on economic organization ; he attacks privilege and inequality with all the passion of 1789 . The treatment of government is always upon the assumption that , in his own words , " the lot of the working-man is the end a good government must keep in view ; for if he is miserable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudalism after the devastating analysis to which , in a score of articles , it is submitted . The price which society has to pay for a rich and privileged sacerdotalism is as clear before the reader as the impossibility of the good life where the conscience is fettered . And the duty of the state to develop the education of its citizens may almost be termed the impalpable atmosphere in which the whole work is clothed . It is improbable that any save the professional student now turns over the pages of these mountainous volumes ; scholarship has not stood still in two hundred years . But the Encyclopedia may claim without presumption to have established the liberal and critical spirit as part of the permanent inheritance of mankind . The thin flame which the Renaissance kindled , at which men like Rabelais , Montaigne , and Bayle had warmed their hands , became with Diderot a mighty furnace which consumed a dead forest through which men had been unable to plow their way . Its assumptions are allimportant for ourselves , not least because its opponents accepted its publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reality of progress , the self-sufficiency of the world about us , the inexpugnable claims of scientific method and , with them , the necessity of tolerance , the duty of men to bow before the demands of reason , disinterested inquiry as the only true source of happiness , with the corollary that wars of conquest arc invariably a setback to mankind , the impossibility of accepting religious dogmas as the measure of truth ? these arc its funda1 mental assumptions . They are , for the most part , commonplaces to ourselves . It is worth insisting that they are only commonplaces because Diderot , and others about him , were prepared to risk their liberty for their diffusion . He organized a great army to do battle for the right of intelligence to the profit of its victories . He gathered about him every man in his generation whose achievement we respect . It is not fanciful to compare the fellowship of the Encyclopedists to an army upon the march ; and to the general who directed its strategy belongs the credit for the victory . Iv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion he would have an assured place in history . But it is , in fact , only a small part of his labors . In the evolution of philosophy he played an important part in three ways . Beginning as a deist in the English mode of the eighteenth century , he was rapidly converted , largely by his interest in physiological discovery , to an atheistic materialism which , whatever its defects , is a current of decisive importance in the great stream of metaphysics . Here , indeed , he is not an originator ; both La Mettrie and D'Holbach played a more important part than he . But what he was striving to do was to extend the meaning of Newtonian physics into a system of all-embracing laws which should resume not less the animate than the inanimate universe . His attempt , with all its vigor and ingenuity , must be held to have failed very largely because it lacks a comprehensive theory of knowledge . But it was a challenge to alternative systems of inestimable value ; and its search for a bridge between science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the starting-point for all who seek a rational explanation of life . Nor is this all . Diderot , with Rousseau , must be held to be one of the outstanding figures in the eighteenth-century effort to vindicate the right of human nature to respect . His considered rejection , for example , of Christian asceticism is built upon the insistence that a denial of the right of impulse to satisfaction disfigures the nature of man . He searched for principles of conduct which should at once satisfy the ultimate factors of our constitution and the limitations upon their expression which experience indicates as necessary . He refused to admit that an ethic can be true which starts , as Christianity starts , by assuming that man is in a state of sin . Much of this work is a brilliant exposition only of what was in the mental climate of his generation . Its value , as in the famous Letter on the Blind , lies less in what he said than in the way in which he related his positions to the orthodox positions of his day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the first French thinker who plainly understood the relativity of knowledge to our methods of perception , who was able , accordingly , to attack at its base the absolutism of his opponents and thereby to shatter the claim of Catholic dogma to contain an exhaustive theory of the universe . De Maistre saw the importance of Diderot 's effort when he endeavored to rehabilitate Catholicism after the Revolution by an attack upon the principle of relativity . But the work had been thoroughly done ; and the essential result of Diderot 's analysis was to show that a philosophy built upon science can make no terms with dogmatic theology . One final point in this contest may be made . As early as 1754 , in the Interpretation of Nature , and , a little later , in D'Alembert 's Dream , Diderot had clearly seen that the inherent principle of biology was evolution . The root of this insight in him is the dominant one of explaining the operations of nature without the aid of supernatural hypotheses . His acceptance of the idea of evolution was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of what seemed to him the only possible way of explaining the relationship between the simple and the complex in nature in such fashion as to bring all its parts within the embrace of a single comprehensive law . It is the sense of matter as selfsufficient , the view of it as shaped at each step by the demands of environment . For him there must either be evolution or an acceptance of final causes ; and the latter he rejects as inconsistent with the whole of scientific experience . Forty years before Lamarck , nearly a hundred years before the Origin of Species , Diderot had , by deliberate intellectual effort , found the one explanation of Nature which makes possible the grasp of her complexities . That , assuredly , is not the least striking of his achievements . Of Diderot the literary artist there is less to be said . None of his novels is a great achievement ; one , at least , of them reminds us that if he was the contemporary of Montesquieu and Rousseau , he was also the contemporary of Crebillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist and a playwright , he lacks the art of creating persons who live and the power to write dialogue which has psychological relation to the people who speak it . Yet , even here , there are noteworthy things . The Nun is a brilliant psychological study of what convent life does to a soul unsuited to it . There are pages of Jacques the Fatalist where the verve is not less remarkable than the capacity to create the illusion that we are sharing in the experiences of a living being . He can narrate amusingly , invent brilliantly , write dialogue in which things are said which are unforgettable . But , alike in his novels and his plays , what he shows is less the necessity of invention than its facility . He writes them because he can , not because he must . They are rather an episodic aspect of his range than an essential index to its character . The Nun apart , they are read more because they illuminate the mind of Diderot than because they are a permanent part of literature . But Diderot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wrongheadedness , he is of the first order in everything that he touches . Not seldom , indeed , the evolution of ideas has moved in a direction other than he desired ; but almost always the influence of what he had to say is traceable in the debate . And this is the more remarkable since most of his critical work was , for himself , simply the byproduct of an interest which could not brook denial . He cared passionately for the theater ; and anyone who reads his Paradox upon the Player 's Art will see why Hazlitt could judge that no man has ever written better upon the actor 's function . He hated the stilted and artificial conventions to which the classical drama of the Augustan age had reduced the theater of his time . Deeply influenced by the turn Lillo had given to the English theater of the eighteenth century , he desired a drama which should be in direct contact with nature itself , which should also deliberately seek to make itself a propagandist vehicle of great ideas . No one now accepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ; but it is not an exaggeration to claim that he would have recognized in Ibsen and Mr. Shaw the realization of his ambition . He was , moreover , an agency of great influence both in the development of literary naturalism and in making known to French readers the significance of English literature . His appreciation of Shakespeare stands out in remarkable contrast to the contempt of Voltaire ; and his passionate eulogies of Richardson gave the latter his letters of credit in France and were no small factor in revolutionizing both the form and substance of the French novel . Diderot , indeed , could without injustice claim that he was the first writer of eminence to see literature as a genuine social function whose object is the criticism of life . For him the man of letters is the priest of great ideas who fails if he does not elevate the mind of his generation . He has nothing but indignation for the view of literature which makes it merely a source of rest from effort . Its quality is a measure of civilization ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition steadily in view . Yet his service to ( esthetic theory was perhaps even more important . Here , indeed , it would be sufficient to quote the remark of Lessing that , without Diderot 's contribution , he could not have written the Laokoon , or to remember Goethe 's exclamation that in this realm he had the quality which calls out the highest powers in others . Diderot 's services to aesthetic theory are twofold . On the one hand , by the famous descriptions of the Paris salons which he contributed to Grimm 's literary correspondence he may be said to have founded the literary criticism of painting ; and even Carlyle could display what can only be called delight at the vivacity and brilliance of his descriptions . No man has ever equalled his power to make the reader see for himself what the painter has sought to achieve , or has surpassed his skill in making description a vehicle for the conveyance of principle . He would not , indeed , be Diderot if his Salons did not abound in glorious irrelevancies ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all part of the charm one feels in contact with a first-rate mind taking its ease . And , as in the theater , so in the world of art , Diderot is the insistent advocate of the rights of nature . Realizing as he did that the painter is an expression of his social environment , he was the determined foe of academic convention . It is true , as Goethe said , that he did not sufficiently realize that art has its own rules which arc not those of nature ; but the man who said that he would give ten Watteaus for a single Teniers had got to the root of the matter . He saw , as few people have ever seen , the just relations of the arts to one another ; why , for example , the poet should eschew detail which a painter can fearlessly represent . He saw , as no one before Leasing had seen , the meaning of the limits set upon the artist by the nature of his material ; just as he was the first to grasp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diderot , his aesthetic work , as he himself realized , is a superb torso rather than a finished effort , a rich series of hints scattered over the widest field . But where he so generously sowed , Lessing and Goethe reaped the harvest . That in itself is a sufficient title to our gratitude . Diderot 's versatility is such that any picture of its achievement would end only at the boundaries of knowledge . If his political ideas have no claim to originality , at least they are well expressed and representative of all that is most creative in the liberalism of his time . The writings on education are more important . They show not only his sense that the problem was urgent ; there is a modernity of temper about them ? especially in his preference for modern languages and science over the scholastic discipline of his day ? which is noteworthy . On physiology , on the principles of legislation , on music and mathematics there are vast collections of memoranda , never , indeed , of the first importance , but rarely without point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be termed the Baconian spirit ; in all of it there is that restless and exciting sense that , to use his own words , " we touch the moment of a great revolution in the sciences . " All of it also is inspired by a large humanism before which it is difficult not to feel humble . They are fragments from a great man 's workshop , the outpourings of a mind so full ofideas , so rich in invention , that he can hardly stay to hold the pen which should express the thoughts which crowd one another . And even in their incompleteness , they make one understand why the range of Diderot 's inventiveness fertilized so much of what was best in the creation of his age . V Yet in the end the greatness of Diderot lies not in what he did but in what he was . No one can meet him , either in his own letters or in those of his friends , without acquiring affection for him . The great , hearty appetite of the man , his endless good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , his courage , his insatiable curiosity ? these are qualities which bind one to him inescapably . No doubt he lacked delicacy of mind and manner ; no doubt also , as Rousseau was to experience , his imperatives in counsel were as excessive as that ebullience in talk which , as Voltaire dryly said , made him incapable of dialogue . He always was a little over-emphatic , usually over-sanguine , often a little vulgar . He yielded too easily to instinct and rarely showed the capacity for second thoughts . He was passionately interested in himself , over-prone to interfere in the affairs of others , lacking in tact , turning to coarseness with the characteristic facility of his time . But , as Voltaire truly saw , there was something of Socrates in him . He brought to whatever he touched a genuinely demonic quality . He really put truth in the first place ; no man has ever had a profounder passion for knowledge . In whatever he touched he had to dig down to the foundations . He stimulated other men to their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have equalled during the history of thought . He found happiness everywhere in simple things and simple people ; he respected in an ultimate way the dignity of his fellowmen . He hated deeply everything that made for cruelty , obscurantism , and ignorance . He helped the advance of knowledge to the full limit of his powers . And wherever we meet him he exerts over us his irresistible fascination . This mass of energy , half-workman , halfintellectual , was at home in any company where the mind could work freely . It may be at the Baron d'Holbach 's when the servants have withdrawn and , over the coffee , men dispute the existence of a first cause . Diderot proclaims his ardent atheism in a voice like the call of a trumpet , and the Abbe Galiani interjects one of those sparkling epigrams which were the delight of Paris . Then Diderot 's great eyes flash fire , and with minatory forefinger he pours forth a stream of ideas before the sheer brilliance of which his listeners sit in silent rapture , until the guttural voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already peeping through the curtains . We see him , in his beloved dressinggown , on the fifth floor of the little apartment in the Rue Taranne ; there comes to him a down-at-heel journalist who hopes to obtain money by suppressing a libellous attack he has written against Diderot . But the latter has a better way . He urges the journalist to publish it with a dedication to a nobleman who hates the Encyclopedists and will pay for patronage . After his manuscript has been corrected , the young man leaves but hesitates on the threshold ; he is nervous of writing a suitable dedication . So the good Diderot sets to work and produces a suitable inscription which sends the journalist off rejoicing . Can one help loving such a man ? And he is the same everywhere . Whether he is in the factory , learning from workmen the secret of their technic ; or in the salon of Madame Necker at the famous dinner where it was decided to erect the statue to Voltaire ; or , again , in the antechamber of the Empress Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis compels him to strike Her Majesty ardently upon the knee ; or in his native town of Langres where he and his father , so different in hopes and ideas , yet weep with joy at meeting ; or , finally , in his prison at Vincennes where he is visited by Rousseau and develops , in a perspiration of excitement , the theme of the latter 's First Discourse ? here , as always , be is Denis Diderot , hungry for life , ardent only for ideas , incapable of malice , full of generosity , the embodiment of Bacon 's saying that " the nobler a soul is , the more objects of compassion it hath . " Those who met him for the first time must have felt the same kind of enchantment that Socrates exercised over the youth of Athens . Diderot is one of the first men of letters in French history who was proud of the class to which he belonged and did not seek to exalt himself above it . He had , to the end , the qualities of the petite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great virtue of endless hard work . He never sought to separate himself from his original milieu . He judged social systems , to the end , by their effect upon the lives of the class of which he was a part . In large outline , indeed , the whole atmosphere of his philosophy is shaped by the needs of that class ; and the victory of his principles meant nothing so much as the certainty of response to their needs . The suppression of privilege , toleration , civil liberty , representative government , the application of science to practical life , freedom of contract , a patriotism which put peace before war , and low taxation before monarchical splendor , who can fail to see in the social doctrines that he preached the wants he must have heard discussed half-fearfully many a night in his father 's house at Langres ! Because , of course , he was an extraordinary man , he saw them with exceptional clarity ; and because , again , he had extraordinary knowledge , he stated them with exceptional power . But just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Diderot expressed and justified the half-articulate ambitions of the little property owner , always hard-working , never rich , and , as every good Frenchman must be , a little inclined to play the Frondeur . They came to power after the Revolution ; and Diderot might claim with justice that he played his full part in laying the philosophic foundations of the middle-class industrial state . There are books , the Institute of Calvin , the War and Peace of Grotius , the Social Contract , the Wealth of Nations which rank in the record as great historical acts ; Diderot can not claim to have written any such book . There are men who by sheer beauty of style have kept the attention of posterity long after their ideas arc obsolete and their causes forgotten ; Diderot 's style had none of this magic . There are others , again , Descartes , Newton , Darwin , whose ideas are so seminal that they seem to remake the foundations of knowledge ; no such discoveryis connected with Diderot 's name . He lives partly because , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generation by his remarkable fecundity , partly because his rich and vigorous personality made him an outstanding leader in one of the halfdozen essential battles for freedom of which the modern historian must take account . He had few of the material rewards which come to successful men . The Academy honored him only by excluding him from election ; and he was never until his last years without the need to work hard for his daily bread . But be moved always amid the play of great ideas and be kept , without compulsion , the affection of his friends . Above all , be had the joy he accounted so high , of fighting consciously in what Heine called the " Liberation War of Humanity . " What haunted him in life was the longing for that immortality which comes with the recognition by a later generation that one of the forerunners has served it well , " Even if this were but the sweetness of a lovely dream , " he wrote to a friend , " . . . it lasts as long as my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diderot that yearning has not been vain ; the praise of posterity , " that lovely concert " he strained in life to hear , in death still echoes its music .
