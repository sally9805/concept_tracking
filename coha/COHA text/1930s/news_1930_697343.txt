txt William F. Doyle won a point yesterday when Judge John E. Martineau , after a hearing In chambers , dismissed two important counts In the indictments charging him with income tax evasion in 1927 and 1928 over the objections of United States Attorney Tuttle . Judge Martineau held that the Southern District of the Federal court lacked jurisdiction as the returns were filed in Brooklyn . The judge denied other defense motions , however , and upheld the perjury counts for those years , as well as the 1929 tax evasion count . The testimony was concluded without Doyle taking the stand in his own defense to explain the income he received in his practice before the Board of Standards and Appeals . The government and defense counsel will begin to sum up with the opening of the court session this morning , and it is expected that the jurors will receive the case late in the day . The trial started two weeks ago today . Doyle 's Son Takes Stand . Both sides rested during the afternoon when the veterinarian 's son , Louis P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last defense witness to offer testimony designed to controvert the government 's evidence regarding the 1927 and 1928 perjury counts and Mr. Tuttle had summoned a few additional witnesses in rebuttal . With the hearing adjourned to Judge Martineau 's chambers , the judge indicated early in the discus- sion that he was inclined to believe that the tax evasion counts for 1927 and 1928 lacked a jurisdictional basis . During those years , according to the government testimony , Doyle received as income in fees a total of $294,137 , as compared with $152,275 named as his income in his tax returns . Mr. Tuttle , in a discussion of almost an hour , asserted that the statute was concerned not merely with the actual filing of a return ? in this instance in Brooklyn  --  but with the steps that led to it as well . He said that testimony showed that Doyle had kept incorrect records in Manhattan and had given false information to an internal revenue investigator and that these actions , as well as his oath to the return in Manhattan , constituted a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contention that jurisdiction existed the United States Attorney cited rulings to show that when " an offense is begun in one judicial district and completed in another , it may be regarded as having been committed in either district . " Doyle 's allegedly false record books , his reception of a part of his fees in cash , his incorrect statements to the investigator all were " part " of the offense charged as laid down by the statute , Mr. Tuttle asserted . He pointed to the ruling of Federal Jude Patterson before the trial upholding Southern District jurisdiction . Judge Martineau , who queried Mr. Tuttle closely at several points in his argument , clung at the end to his original contention that the Southern District lacked jurisdiction . Motion to Dismiss Is Denied . Former Judge Alfred J. Talley of Doyle counsel moved for dismissal of the other counts on the ground that the government had failed to make out a case . Judge Martineau , without much discussion , however , overruled him on these points . Doyle will go to the jury facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with having declared only $76,800 of this in his return , and the two counts charging him with having sworn falsely to his 1927 and 1928 returns before internal revenue agents in Manhattan . The defense contends that Doyle did not take this oath personally and Doyle 's son was put on the stand to meet opposing government testimony . He said that his father 's tax returns for those years were filled out in the Doyle home in Brooklyn by William Ruddy , a Brooklyn internal revenue agent , and that Doyle signed them in Mr. Ruddy 's presence . He did not know whether his father or Ruddy took them away , he said . Ruling Reduces Income . On the 1929 tax evasion indictments Mr. Tuttle called Jacob M. Poss , a new witness to testify that he paid Doyle $2,500 in fees during that year for getting a modification of a zoning rule before the standards board . The United States Attorney also put Herbert J. Flesher , a Department of Justice accountant , on the stand to sum up his statistics , and during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out $2,617 of his original total for 1929 as not having been proved as income . He also struck out for the same reason $21,357 for 1927 and $14,487 for 1928 . By these rulings the government claim of Doyle 's total fees for the three years was cut to $389,220 , as compared with the $229,075 total he declared in his tax returns . Mr. Tuttle also recalled Ely Maran , a Bronx builder , to tell again of a $10,000 cash payment he said he made to Doyle . He summoned a bookkeeper and an accountant to substantiate records of this payment . The defense is contesting this $10,000 fee as well as several others and asserts that when these fees and the split fees testified to by lawyers who brought business to Doyle are reckoned in comparison with the $95,083 income figure tabulated by the government for 1929 , Doyle 's income is shown to be within his declared figure of $76,800.
