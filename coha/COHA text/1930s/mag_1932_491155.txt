W HEN , in 192x. kl Smith was a candidate for the presidency of the United States , an intelligent friend of mine expressed the grounds for his disapproval sharply : " I have the greatest respect for all that Governor Smith has accomplished , but I could not vote for him , because he has no education . " There are , of course , always differences on political questions , but were those who refused to vote for him for reasons like my friend 's justified ? Governor Smith 's most poignant memory carries him back to the day when , as a boy of thirteen , he rode back from Calvary Cemetery with his mother after his father 's funeral . His father had been a truck driver ; he had saved , bought horses and trucks of his ow and become master of his business . In the united household and neighborly atmosphere of New York 's East Side as it was then , the early year of the children had been happy and the family had been laying by a nugget against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come too soon . Illness had overtaken the father and undermined his powerful physique . After lingering two year he had died . The savings had been exhausted and it was plain that life was going to be hard . The governor 's mother was the lodestar of his life . It is a tribute to the character of both . She , like her son , was not one of those whom life 's mischances embitter . In women of her rare type , they call forth the stoic virtues . She had reached her decision on that ride back from the cemetery . As a single woman she had learned umbrella making , and , with her son , now went directly to the home of the forewoman of the factory . The next morning she left the house early and took up again the work which she had given up at the time of her happy marriage fourteen years before . The incident is eloquent of the simple annals of the poor , and with it the training of Alfred E. Smith had begun . Whatever schoolboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of having a career were swallowed up in the one great desire that was born in hint then  --  to try to make life easier for his mother . This ambition will continue throughout her life , and with retributive justice , young Al was to he allowed to realize it fully . A Single Scholastic Attainment AS A FIRST step toward realizing this desire he be- came a newsboy on the sidewalks of New York . Even in the period of his father 's illness , he had tried in his own way to continue the trucking business , but this was clearly too much for his years , and his mother insisted that he continue at school . Al Smith , unlike President Hoover , looked forward to no particular profession . In youth and young manhood , such progress as he made , such few opportunities as he was able to grasp , came to him , as he says , more or less automatically . He saw life not in terms of success in some profession , but in the simpler terms of " what shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed ? " He knew that some of the older boys in school whose parents were more fortunately circumstanced went on after graduation to Manhattan College and then studied to become priests or lawyers . He saw clearly and without bitterness that for boys on his own economic level no such choice was open . He never worried about it ; he rarely even thought about . it . Those who hold that Al Smith lacks education are warranted in insisting that be did not have even a high-school training . He left St. James ' Parish School , after the first year in the high-school grade , with no particularly brilliant record behind him . The case against him is even stronger than this . He showed no liking for study , no promise whatever as a scholar . He had no taste for books ; he had not even developed that reading habit held by many to be prerequisite to all education . With disarming candor , he admits the case against himself . All that he could here allege he puts into one sentence : " At school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " With the case against him so strong , we must he scrupulous and present one item in his favor . There is a highly important volume of some educational value which even teachers too frequently do not rate as a book at all . Smith had been an altar boy and , because of his religious nature and environment , this book , the Bible , an encyclopedia of literature and morals , already meant much to him . One of the secrets of his effectiveness as a debater in later life was his ability to clinch an argument by using effectively some simple text or illustration from that Good Book . So , for instance , when the representatives of the canning industries were attempting to defeat Smith 's bill for an obligatory day of rest for women and children in factories , he ended his argument with the remark , " ' Remember the Sabbath Day , to keep it holy ' ? except in the canneries . " He carried his point . Defenders of the governor 's ease would probably hold that his later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after leaving school , in the years from fifteen to thirty , he must have had some traffic with the masters of language , with literature in some form ; that , at least in his late teens and twenties , there must have been good books in the offing . Even with the governor 's help , it is impossible to find them . " Do n't try to make any kind of scholar of me , " he will tell you . " I 'm sorry , but it ca n't be . done . " In his life in those years there is not enough tincture of that culture which comes from hook learning to color litmus paper . Questions about books every young man has read brought negative replies . In desperation , I mentioned Robinson Crusoe . Here was a book no boy could have escaped . The governor shook his head again . " I 'm sorry , but I never read it . " If books are the source of all education , Al Smith clearly had practically none up to the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank . if he can be said to have an education , we must look elsewhere for its foundations . There has been much nonsense in educational circles about . personality . It is sometimes assumed that this is purely a God-given gift . It is , of course , true that some people are by nature more favored than others , and everybody will admit that Governor Smith has the qualities of personality . In his second campaign for the governorship of New York State , he was to run nearly half a million votes ahead of his ticket . To have wonsuch support from his political opponents , evidently thegovernor must have had something more than fair-weather popularity . to the brothers ' house to train him in public speaking . So good was the instruction and so willing the pupil that in the public-speaking contests open to all the pupils in the Catholic schools of New York , Al Smith won the first prize for any boy in the grades  --  a gold medal  --  and in his only year in the superior school he won the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent would not be allowed to lie dormant ; and Smith was to make himself one of the ablest debaters and campaign speakers in our political history . There was another native capacity Smith had which he deliberately developed to an astonishing degree . If you do not know where things are to be found in libraries , you can only compensate by keep-ing more of them on tap in your head . You must make your mind a card-index library of ready ref-erence . He developed his memory first through acting . Because the neighborhood had come to like his good-natured helpfulness and because of his recognized ability as a speaker , he was in- ? ited to take part in the plays given by the parish . The Whole Show to go out of his way to make himself useful to his friends . As one of his biographers puts it : When he heard the stroke of the fire alarm , he would make for the coffee can and the sandwich basket kept near the entrance ; and when horses , men and engines had darted out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he and the fire dog together  --  he carrying the coffee can and the sandwich basket  --  would dash to the place where the fire was . . . if it was a false alarm or if the lire were slight , he would return with the firemen on the engine , the envy of his boy friends . . . If the fire was serious , he would go to the restaurants , where ho was known by ; this time , and get coffee and sandwiches for the men . From childhood he made an effort , he trained himself , to be more than ordinarily helpful and obliging . There was another asset that Smith was to develop in the year of his scant schooling which would later become one of the most important factors in his success . This was his talent for public speaking . He had a good presence , and someone was to say of him later , as a campaigner , that his voice had trumpets in it . One of the teachers in St. James ' Parish School noticed the germs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite him around in the evening TJE DID not trust to 1 I his great . powers of improvisation ; he insisted on making himself letter-perfect and never needed a prompter . He became what actors call " a quick study . " Among the governor 's trophies there is a beautifully bound copy of John Gold-en 's play , Turn to the Right He had only heard one performance of it , but years after , in Gold-en 's office , he repeated some of its speeches so perfectly that Golden presented him with the manuscript . The favorite roles which an actor plays are of ten a telltale index of his own inner nature and desires , but here Al Smi th is disappointing . He admitted frankly that the role he preferred above all others was that of Bardwell Slate , the unattractive and ridiculous country congressman in The Almighty Dollar . It seemed ditllcult to understand why this young Irishman should have preferred Slote to the many other , more attractive characters he impersonated . The governor has an instinct for catching the drift of questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use working along that line . You 'd better give it up . It 's much simpler than you think . I really liked to act . The reason the part of Bardwell Slote was my favorite was because he had four hundred and fifty speeches . He was on the stage all the time ; he dominated the piece . He was the whole show . That 's why I liked it . " In Smith 's case , then , there is no question that he possessed certain gifts . The only question is whether he would ever be able to use them to educate himself . Opportunity , in any case , seemed to be in no hurry to meet up with this young man . One stage in the governor 's apprenticeship , when he sold fish , has been so frequently referred to that it has made Fulton Street famous . The governor has always taken these references so good-naturedly that many are inclined to take it as a joke . It was no joke . Circumstances made it necessary , but aside from teaching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long hours , it was , educationally speaking , a liability rather than an asset . Work began at four in the morning , except on the rush day , Friday , when it began at three . When young Smith returned home in the evening lie was dead tired . As he says : " You washed up , sat around before . This was what the nation expected of him , and the leaders of the Left-wing parties had already decided on the electoral district in which he was to stand for office . But suddenly , between a Friday and the next Sunday evening , Briand decided to remain . What had happened ? Long before the presidential election , when Senator Doumer was proposed as a candidate he came to his friend Briand , whom be had known for decades , and asked him straightforwardly if he himself considered becoming a candidate , because if he did , Doumer wanted to stand aside out of respect and friendship . Briand , who had then decided not to become a candidate , was able to give an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and announced his candidacy , and put his old friend in a fatal position , which became even more disagreeable after the friend had won . But when Doumer was chosen president of the republic , he summoned his foreign minister , Briand , and without recalling their previous conversation , simply said to him , " Now , you must not abandon me . " Briand , being put . on his honor , remained , even though it necessitated his sitting with one of his most intense enemies in a cabinet presided over by Laval , his own former undersecretary of state . They were all pleased that he compromised with them for the sake of the future . What he himself planned and thought , we can read in his own words , which he said to me about the newspapers when he was being attacked by almost the whole Paris press : The country is for me . The power of the newspapers , believe me , is beginning to wane . Two years ago , when all the newspapers were urging Poincare to return to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . Do n't believe the voice of the press . ' Briand has gone quite blind , ' Poincare remarked , but I replied to him , in the presence of a number of deputies , ' At noon , after the elections , when you have most of the results before you , please summon me . ' And on that occasion Poincare was decisively defeated . " Will Briand again seek to occupy the big , ugly office in the Quad d'Orsay , where the officials used to say the nicest things about him when they left their desks ; or will he remain on his little estate at Cocherel , which his friends call a simple farm ? It is comfortable , but not luxurious , and is gradually growing larger from the profits that he has made out of raising cattle  --  for none of his enemies has ever accused Briand of corruption . A proud rooster called Daudet is the only political touch . There is nothing else but cows , sheep , pigeons , and accounts of the inspector , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective stories and pirate tales , and spend the whole day onboard a motorboat , accompanied by two sailors , Although Briand is fond of food , he eats no evening meal because , like President . Masaryk , of ezeeho-Slovalda , who is twelve years older , he has a weak stomach . Today he still strolls through the village near his estate with walking stick and cigarette , sitting and conversing with the common folk as Lincoln did , drinking a. glass of wine with them , letting them talk , and thus binding himself more closely to the heart of his people . to rest a hit ; then walked out on the street and talked to the neighbors or the policeman ; and it was time to go to bed . " Such years might have been deadening and , as we shall see , have left their mark . He lost  --  in part , at least  --  years that are precious for the boy in even ordinary circumstances . Nothing happened for five years , and then the talents Al had developed on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was running for assemblyman against the regular Tammany candidate , and Tim 's supporters were short . of speakers . Some of Tim 's friends thought of young Al . He made speeches for Tim , but Tim lost by a wide margin . If this was really Dame Opportunity , she had come in deep disguise and heavily hung with ( rape . There are those who like to explain the achievements of successful men on the basis of lucky breaks and personality , and make them merely the favored children of fortune , the darlings of the gods . Like President Hoover , like perhaps most . successful men , Al Smith does not believe in lucky breaks : " No one can sit by and expect to attain anything by luck . In my experience , when it seems to happen to people that way , it does n't do them much good . " However , a well-to-do bachelor , Henry Campbell , who , in spite of the similarity of names , was no relative of the candidate , had heard one of Al 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday dinner , and out of this first lost cause the young man won a good friend . Henry Campbell succeeded in obtaining for him a position as messenger in the office of the commissioner of jurors , with an increase of salary . His work was to deliver subpcenas to all the citizens summoned for jury duty . This gave him the freedom of the city and a chance to use more widely his attractive social qualities , his willingness and his intelligence . He learned much about the foibles of his fellow men and about the needs and problems of great . centers of population . It also gave him more leisure to discuss with older and experienced men the fascinating art of practical politics . Here he was to lay the first foundation for his later work . Smith 's second opportunity came when , in 1903 , at the age of thirty , he found himself in his first elective office as assemblyman at Albany from his district . There are those who explain Smith 's rise from ward politician to candidate for the presidency on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , in an age of rapid social changes , what seemed to be his handicaps were really advantages . Born in poverty , the son of a widowed mother , familiar with tenements , sweat shops and factories , he could understand better than anyone else the lives of the underprivileged and the sore spots in our system . It is true that in his time the sense of social responsibility was rapidly increasing and that Smith 's later positive contributions to legislation were accepted by other states as models along these lines . But his case is not nearly so simple as all that . The work of the effective legislator calls for some degree of fitness and previous training , and , so far , we might as well admit that Smith had none . Helped by His Opponents For this work he might have been declared educationally insolvent . His budget would carry the following items : As assets he had , first , intelligence and a good memory . Second , a determination to make good . On a later occasion , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " If I fall down on this job I shall never forgive myself and shall never ask you to forgive me . " Third , he was willing to work . The only man for whom he had no patience at Albany was the shirker , whether in his awn party or in the opposition . One day the Democratic chairman of a commit tee resigned because he found that the task assigned to him was going to involve unusual difficulties and weeks of hard work . On his way home from the capitol , where lie had turned in his resignation , he slipped on the pavement and injured himself . When Smith heard of it , his comment was withering : " He could n't have injured his backbone . What . he has for a backbone is a strip of spaghetti that has been soaked overnight in hot water . " Fourth , he recognized his deficiencies fully . Without this his other assets would have been nullified , for he needed education , and the beginning of all education in any field is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully aware of his own that , perhaps more than any other politician in our history , he was willing to learn from his opponents , and they would provide him with a part of his training . Before we list his heavy liabilities , let us see what his opponents were to do for him . It was the Republican floor leader , later - United States senator , James E. Wadsworth , for instance , who , impressed by Al 's character and intelligence , first appointed him to a committee and gave him the opportunity to study the problems of insurance during the Hughes investigation . His own party leader , knowing he was green , had for two years failed to give him an appointment . During Smith 's time in the legislature there was no more deeply dyed-in-the-wool Republican than the late Senator Edgar T. Brackett . No two men differed more widely on problems of abstract politics ; yet Brackett was to support Smith for governor in 1018 . But perhaps nothing illustrates so well this phase of Smith 's training as his long and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwin A. Merritt , Jr . Merritt was aYale graduate and assemblyman from St. Lawrence County ; a part of the state about which , as yet , Smith knew nothing . He was probably the ablest Republican leader at Albany and had been chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , majority leader and speaker of the assembly . When , in 1911 , the Democrats , for the first time in many years , held a tnajority , Smith was appointed majority leader . Merritt was tho leader of the minority , and they sat across the aisle from each other in the assembly chamber . As Merritt explained to his friends when he found himself minority leader , he found also that the overcrowded capitol building could provide him no office in which.to work and meet his Republican colleagues . Smith had euffered under this same disability theyear before , and invited Merritt to take one corner of his own large office . When Merritt demurred on the ground that this must inevitably embarrass the leader of the opposing party , Smith insisted : " Nothing is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing going to be said that you ca n't hear ; we can disagree later . " They did , but it was to be open warfare , conducted on a basis of mutual respect . They became fast friends , and Smith , called upon to speak at the funeral of his Republican colleague in 1914 , there recognized his deep indebtedness to this experienced legislator , for whom " I developed , " he said , " as strong an affection as it is possible for one man to have for another not of his own relationship . " Merritt showed Smith the life and problems of upstate villages ; and Smith , in New York , took Merritt around and showed him the problems of the thickly crowded tenement sections of the lower East Side . The relation of these two political opponents who helped to educate each other in the problems of their state deserves a chapter by itself somewhere in the troubled annals of America 's political history . Returning again to Smith 's educational budget , we shall list now only his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of political theories , about laws or legislation . He did not . even know how laws were made . This , however , was only a minor disability . The second was far more serious , We have said that he had not developed the reading habit in early life . Perhaps even more staggering was the fact that lie had never been trained during his teens to focus his attention on long , complicated , intricate problems whose elements had to he patiently analyzed and solved . This was to come within an inch of undoing him . Taking Orders In Illbany It was a bitterly cold night , December 31 , 1902 , when Smith arrived at Albany with another green assemblyman and found lodging in a cheap hotel . Realizing his limitations , he at once obtained the record of the previous session and made up his mind to study all the bills introduced . He worked until three in the morning . but could make absolutely nothing of this jargon . I t was a bitter disappointment . " I can tell , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hake by the look in its eye , but in two hundred years I could not . tell these things from a bale of hay . " It looked as though , like a baggy suit of clothes that could never be cut down to make a fit , this job must remain forever too big for him . As the job could not be cut down , he decided he would try to grow up to fit the job . For an unschooled East Side boy , it looked as though he were facing an impossible task . It would be useless to hunt for signs of particular competence in the record of Assemblyman Smith 's first year . The men back home  --  the bosses  --  were much better versed in legislative problems than he ; and though he occasionally argued with them , in the main he accepted their decisions . As an unfavorable critic , William Allen White , put . it : " He took orders until such time as he was able to give them . " He began as a machine politician . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a member of the assembly . Anyone interested , however , can do this by reading the reports issued annually by the Citizens ' Unionof the city of New York , a nonpartisan organization which reviewed the records of all men nominated for public office . He had gone to Albany as a machine man , and their early reports indicate that they were not predisposed in his favor . By 1906 they find him " intelligent and active , somewhat above the average machine man . " The next year his " increased ability " has made him " one of the best Democratic . representatives from New York . " The impression that he was to make upon nonpartisan voters , and even upon political opponents , was to be increasingly favorable until , in 1915 , when he was nominated for sheriff of New York County , his candidacy was to be indorsed not only by the Citizens ' Union but by newspapers ordinarily as strongly Republican as the New York Tribune . Rewriting a Constitution An opportunity to test whether Smith had succeeded in educating himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The amount of legislation annually turned out in every state complicates its organization , procedure and laws to such a point that revision or the constitution as a whole is highly necessary if anyone  --  even a Philadelphia lawyer  --  is really to understand its intricacies . New York State is wise enough to revise hers every twenty veers by culling a constitutional convention . How seriously the Empire State regards this task is evident from the character of the men appointed . Elihu Root was president ; George W. Wickersham , former Attorney-General of the United States , was selected to lead the Republicans ; Judge it lurean J. O'Brien , to lead the Democrats . The late Louis Marshall , one of our greatest constitutional lawyers , was a member ; so also were Seth Low , former mayor of New York ; Jacob Gould Schurman , later Ambassador to Germany and then president of Cornell ; and Henry L. Stimson , now Secretary of State . The convention sat for months . So distinguished was the personnel of this body and so important its task that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively un. - known politician , Alfred E. Smith . During the process of the sessions. however , they completely revised their opinion . Smith 's knowledge of governmental processes and of the constitution and laws of the state astounded them . The memory which he had trained as a boy made it possible for him to cite verbatim statutes , bills and documents , while his penetrating intelligence enabled him to point out weaknesses in proposals for remedial amendments . His language , his use of English , was remarkable ; and if the stenographic records show that he occasionally used colloquialisms and homely similes of ordinary life , they also show a remarkable gift for reducing legal verbiage to simple , direct statement ; while , over and over again , his touch of good humor ' relieved tension and prevented partisan antagonisms from becoming too pronounced . After the convention , Elihu Root , its president , summed up the impression this assemblyman had made : " Of all the men in the convention Alfred E. Smith was the best informed on the business of the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the opposition party , admitted , " He was the most useful man in the convention . " H. F. Pringle , a critic not predisposed in Governor Smith 's favor , concludes , 1 I 0 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST F31 , ? . ary 27 , 1932 after his discussion of the four thousand five hundred pages of the voluminous proceedings : Most of the gold will be found in the record of the remarks of Delegate A. E. Smith . I think there is material for countless theses in the opinions of this man who had scarcely seen the inside of a schoolhouse and who had never listened to the profundities of a seminar on political science . Humanity Versus Precedent The type of training Smith had acquired was evident , for instance , in the long debate before the convention on an amendment which would have prevented , in New York State , the enactment of laws giving privileges to any class . Smith recognized immediately that this would render impossible laws governing workmen 's compensation , widows ' pensions or hours of labor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in terms of previous theories of government but in terms of the effect of that particular hill upon human lives . The learned members of the convention had argued hack and forth , had cited the Emperor Diocletian and acts by Edward III and Edward IV ; the Code of Justinian had been brought in , and an act by the governor of Rhode Island in 1777 . Smith probably knew nothing of any of these precedents . He listened attentively and , at the conclusion of the long discussion , went quickly and effectively to the heart of the question . He held that in spite of their pleading for a return to the American ideal , the delegates , by the very force of their arguments and precedents , were allowing themselves to drift in the other direction : The gentlemen around this chamber would lead us to believe that law in a democracy is the expression of some Divine or eternal right . I am unable to see it that way . My idea of law in a democracy is the expression of what is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes the farthest to do the greatest good fur the greatest . number . After all , is not that the reason for the existence of great political parties ? The example of Al Smith should not give aid and comfort to lads disinclined to general reading . Smith himself is not proud of this . He regrets it and it has left him hobbled . There are certain physical coOrdinations which can he successfully mastered only in youth . No man who began golf after thirty ever won the National Open . In that game , as in tennis , the champions are likely to emerge in their teens . It is not so well recognized that this is true of certain mental coordinations as well The habits , or leek of habits , of our youth make or break us later . Smith 's ease can be safely bracketed with that of the famous Italian dramatist , Alfieri . At twenty-five , Alfieri became consumed with the desire to make himself a great poet . He had native aptitude and intelligence ; the results were to prove that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in amorous adventures , but had never trained himself to spell and write his own language correctly . To do so at his age was a labor of Hercules , and to prevent him From giving it up in disgust and yielding to distractions , he finally had to compel his valet to tie him into his chair at his table so that he could not escape . Smith 's case , for different reasons , was equally desperate . We have seen that when he first arrived at Albany and tried to master the bills that had been introduced , he simply had to give it up and conclude that in two hundred years he could not tell them from a bale of hay . His first years at Albany proved to him that there was no way around this hurdle . As one of his friends put it , " Al would not admit that he knew anything about a subject until he knew everything about it . " To know everything about a bill that might possibly contain jokers , you had to read and master it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . As an assemblyman , on fifteen hundred dollars a year , he could not hire a valet to tie him into his chair . It was as hard for him as for the noble count . He had to tie himself down to his task himself , drive himself through every single phrase of every bill . It meant , in those years , staying at his desk eighteen and twenty hours a day , but he finally mastered them with that amazing thoroughness which was to he evident at the constitutional convention . But if his consuming interest in politics and his determination to make good carried him through at the cost of incalculable labor , those who know him well will tell you that he never fully mastered the art of general reading . Even now , in plodding through volumes or articles concerning his chosen field , his attention flags quickly , and if his friends or secretaries wish to bring something to his attention , to be sure he notes it they must underscore the passages heavily . Over his books , Governor Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as governor of his state , which was to win him the distinction of being the only man who has ever held that office four terms , was to illustrate that even for a man handicapped as he had heen thorough education in a chosen field is possible ; but only on the same terms that make it possible in any walk of life . To educate oneself better than mediocre men do , one must . begin with an open mind and be willing to work harder than the man next door . Putting Men Before Books Because of the unusual character of his training , Smith developed a new technic for himself . As governor , particularly , his method of approaching a new problem would be the exact opposite , for instance , of so differently trained a statesman as Woodrow Wilson . When President Wilson felt that he must study the question of the Philippines , instead of summoning some of the men who had been there and dealt with it at first hand , he wrote to ask General Scott , then on the Mexican border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . Smith reversed the process ; he would consult , first , men who had had actual experience , and , after listening to divergent views , would dig out of books or reports anything more that he needed ; then reduce the problem to terms of human needs and experience and draw his own conclusion . It was , perhaps , Smith 's inexperience and unusual openness of mind that led him to make an important discovery in American politics . In his very first year as assemblyman , and in the period before ho really knew what it was all about , as he listened to the sessions one thing greatly astonished him . Representatives of the opposing political parties would debate interminably the phraseology of statements of abstract principles which would bake nobody any bread . After wasting days in such discussions , these same legislators would appropriate , on a quick roll call , thirty-five million dollars , when they could not possibly know what it was going for . He discovered what the American public unfortunately does not yet realize , that political questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at the polls . Of the many questions that come before a state or even a national assembly , only a few are really political . Nearly all of them are just plain business , and political antagonism and partisanship , so frequently indulged in with resounding phrases to astound the galleries and make a noise back home , merely hamper the state 's business . As he learned to see it . the task of a leader was to provide proper and effective administrative machinery and men capable of discharging the functions to which they were appointed . That is why , when he had carried out his program for reorganization , his cabinet consisted of eight Democrats and six Republicans . The governor 's own secretary belonged to the opposite party and became head of the executive department . Whether or not Al Smith has an education depends only on what you mean by education . If you mean a trained and efficient intelligence and master of all the principles and details of his profession , Elihu Root and Attorney General Wickersham will tell you emphatically that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man who , with no initial advantages succeeded in educating himself by human contacts and by long , arduos and often bitter experience . There are limitations to even the best education possible without leisure or books or teachers . Al Smith himself does not recommend his method . His rooms are hung with the school and colleges diplomas of his children , and he is proud of the honorary degree of doctor of laws which Columbia University con ferred upon him . His advice to any young man would be , " By all means educate yourself , and for heaven 's sake if books , schools and colleges are wit 1 , in your reach , take every advantage of them . It is much easier that way , nail likely to be much more satisfactory But , " he would add , " whatever the situ-a tion with regard to books and school , whether you pull an education out of the fire of life or not is strictly and emphatically up to you .
