Rugby Amricain <P> From Paris to the Pyrenees last week Frenchmen were reading fantastic accounts of a troupe of giant " rugbymen amricains " who were invading the provinces of France , " dressed in gold helmets like Roman emperors " and leaping at one another " like fighting cocks . " More than 25,000 curious Parisians had watched them last fortnight in the Parc des Princes . Gendarmes were called out to handle 2,000 people who tried to crash the gate . " The giants kneeled down and tried to frighten one another with grimaces , then rushed headlong at one another . . . . Legs and arms got so mixed that the field , strewn with wounded players , looked like a battleground after the charge . " <P> These 22 " rugbymen amricains , " led by a onetime Notre Dame Horseman named Jim Crowley , had been imported by the Paris-Soir to demonstrate their outlandish game- " a game so brutal that it was banned in the U. S. by the first President Roosevelt , and finally universities were allowed to play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunting season . " <P> Sportswriters agreed that " rugby amricain " would never catch on in France because " it was too much like an autobus collision . " The part of the game the Parisians liked best was the huddle , " when they gather to cheer . . . before each play . " At the opening game confused spectators , uncertain when to cheer , decided after a few plays that the huddle was the logical one . The equally confused U. S. footballers , who-unable to hear their **26;8239;TOOLONG their signals , wondered whether the acoustics would be better in Toulouse , Marseille , Bordeaux .
