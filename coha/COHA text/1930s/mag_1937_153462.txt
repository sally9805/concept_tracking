The three subordinates on whom President Roosevelt depends to win his Senate victories are Majority Leader Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas , the bull-voiced , heavy-fisted field commander ; Pat Harrison of Mississippi , the shrewd committee and cloakroom horsetrader ; and James F. Byrnes of South Carolina , the suave personal envoy . All three were present one noon last week when Senator Robinson summoned newsmen to his office to discuss the President 's breathtaking proposal for rejuvenating the Judiciary ( TIME , Feb. 15 ) . Talk skimmed over various features of the plan . " Speaking solely for Joe Robinson . " the 64-year-old Majority Leader , who hopes his next step up will be to the Supreme Court bench , observed that justices might well be superannuated at 75 instead of the President 's 70 . <P> As the interview ended , one reporter lingered to suggest that the public would view the plan more favorably if it were assured that the Supreme Court might be increased to 15 only temporarily . That , declared Senator Robinson , was exactly what the President contemplated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictate a statement making the point entirely clear : " Any increase above nine in the membership of the Court can exist only so long as there are judges eligible for retirement . When judges retire the number is reduced by the number retiring . The purpose is always to keep nine members of the Court who are under the retirement age . " <P> All the President would say in regard to the Majority Leader 's statement was : <P> Look at the bill . Correspondents looked , found in Subsection A the proposal to add a new judge for each one past 70 . In Subsection B : " the number of judges of any court shall be permanently increased by the number appointed thereto under the provisions of Subsection A. " <P> The astonishing misapprehension of Senators Robinson , Byrnes &; Harrison was typical of the confusion which prevailed in Washington last week after the first shock of the President 's proposal had passed . California 's Hiram Johnson , Missouri 's Bennett Champ Clark and Montana 's Burton K. Wheeler made up their minds against the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 30-odd remaining Senators who held the balance of power were lying low , waiting to see how the wind blew . Letters from constituents and memorials from State Legislatures were mostly pro-Court , but there were enough pro-President to give Congressmen pause . Asked why he had suddenly canceled plans to introduce two non-controversial items of the President 's program in a separate bill , Chairman Hatton W. Sumners of the House Judiciary Committee spoke the troubled mind of many another Congressman : " The visibility is poor , it 's foggy , the barometer is too low and the wind is not in the right direction . So I decided not to take off . "
