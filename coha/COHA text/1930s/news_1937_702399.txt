txt Although John L. Lewis . bead of the Committee for Industrial Organization , has declared his union is ready to take up the " Ford problem , " now that the General Motors strike is settled , Henry Ford is not troubled over the automobile industry labor situation , it is known here . Always a high wage payer , Mr. Ford long ago set up minimums of pay that have not been equalled by other manufacturers . Although Mr. Ford has long been silent on the question of wage rates in his company , it is known that his wage bill was increased by more than $13,000,000 last year , or an average of $141 a workman . This Is exclusive of a rise in the payroll of around $30,000,000 occasioned by the increased number of workmen employed , and lifts his average wage rates for production workers to 83 cents an hour . In connection with Mr. Ford 's attitude on the labor situation it is interesting to observe that he refused to take advantage of General Motors ' plight when that company 's production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed his plant managers not to increase daily output beyond the 6,000-a-day mark where it was before the G. M. strikes began and held firm in this position despite protests of the Ford staff that General Motors had large stocks of cars on hand and was not losing any sales , whereas Ford stocks were low and orders were going unfilled . Now that all automobile manufacturers are again approaching full-scale production , it is considered likely that Mr. Ford will order his plants to step up production to a 7,000-a-day level . Such a rate of output is now possible because of expansion in the company 's production facilities in recent months . On February 1 of this year 128,916 workmen were employed in the Ford plants here at The Rouge and elsewhere over the country , an increase from 108,250 on February 1 , 1936 . Ford continues to pay a minimum of $6 a day for eight hours , although many more thousand Ford workers are now above this minimum than at this time a year ago . Production rates go up to as high as $1.55 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 12,800 highly skilled production workers who are ? employed on salaries ; if their salaries were computed on an hourly bash and added to those production workers employed on this basis the company 's average hourly rate would be above the 83-cent an hour figure . About 10 years ago , Mr. Ford discontinued the payment of bonuses to workmen . Instead of bonuses he ordered the weekly wages to be increased so as to spread the bonus over the year , after becoming convinced that such a method was more satisfactory to his workmen . Convinced that higher wages malce for better workmanship , Mr. Ford also has been influential in lifting of wages to new heights by his suppliers . Indicative of Mr. Ford 's attitude on the labor situation is an incident that happened here a short time ago . One of his officials , becoming jittery over rumors of labor troubles , ordered a gate put up at an entrance to the Rouge plant where no gate had been before . Mr. Ford heard about it several hours later and ordered the late removed .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
