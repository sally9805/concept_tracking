Disgruntled Dutchmen settled down grimly last week to face the gravest crisis in the 45-year reign of their beloved Queen Wilhelmina . <P> Though Her Majesty has been called " middle class , " the fact is that the Royal House of Orange is on top of the Netherlands to a degree not achieved by royalty anywhere else . Rich men in other countries fawn socially on their sovereigns , never think of the Crown as an economic power . Dutch millionaires doubt if any of them is richer than their Queen . Her ancestor , William I , subscribed $1,600,000 to the original $14,900,000 capital of The Netherlands Trading Society for exploitation of his Indies . Few investments have ever been more fabulously profitable or more tightly held . As the profits rolled in , the House of Orange has invested in nearly every good thing in The Netherlands . And Queen Wilhelmina never speculates but holds . Last week , therefore , Wilhelmina viewed with no airy royal detachment the appalling fact that one-fifth of The Netherlands Bank gold reserve had been withdrawn in the frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Petrus Josephus Mattheus Aalberse might succeed in forming a Cabinet and might then take the guilder off the gold standard . <P> Catholics , Bolsheviks &; Calvinist . The moneyed Queen was credited by many of her subjects with taking Professor Aalberse neatly into camp and preserving her money on gold by the following maneuver : Her favorite statesman , ruthless , eagle-beaked Premier Hendrikus Colijn , who speaks English with a crusty Scottish accent , suddenly announced that he was not receiving adequate support from the Catholic members of his coalition , abruptly resigned . Thus ambitious Professor Aalberse was confronted with a surprise opportunity to form a Cabinet before his Catholics had time to organize a coalition . It turned out that Professor Aalberse would have to take five Communist Deputies into coalition to get a majority , and from such Bolsheviks the Catholics instinctively recoiled . Back in as Premier popped Calvinist Colijn . Last week aroused Dutch opinion was branding the Catholic Party as a pack of villains or fools responsible for the flight of 131,000,000 hard , heavy , gold guilders from The Netherlands Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but Dutchmen fearfully wondered last week how often the Queen &; Colijn may have to repeat a master stroke involving one-fifth of the nation 's gold reserve . Amid Depression 's typhoon , as the Dutch guilder is threatened in crisis after crisis , The Netherlands Bank frantically hoists its discount rate to 6% during the storms to attract as much gold as possible , then hastily reefs it down to 2% during the lulls to give Dutch business the benefit of " cheap money . " Inevitably such desperate sailing scares the passengers half out of their wits . Last week Premier Colijn , as Captain of the gold standard galleon of The Netherlands , stepped to the microphone and cried with more courage than veracity : " Conditions in our country are much better than in most other countries ! " <P> Yellow Emperor v. White Queen . Conditions in The Netherlands are sane , as that term is understood by Queen Wilhelmina , who said in her last Speech from the Throne , " This country stands for sanity !
