On New York 's lower East Side 93 years ago , twelve public-spirited Jews , headed by one named Henry Jones , met in Sinsheimer 's Essex Street barroom . Before the matzoth crumbs were swept away they had established a philanthropic society known as B'nai B'rith ( Sons of the Covenant ) to establish orphanages , run schools and convalescent homes . Originally a secret society , B'nai B'rith came into the open in 1920 with publication of its ritual . Today over 600 lodges of B'nai B'rith exist in 30 countries . <P> Last week armed German police smashed their way into Berlin's-B'nai B'rith lodge , arrested the members , cleared out the premises and seized the property . All over Germany other B'nai B'rith lodges were raided , seized and evacuated , as were children 's homes , sanatoriums and homes for the aged supported by the society . Though most of those arrested were later released , the entire organization was ordered dissolved and its funds seized , on the pretext that one of the 14,000 German members of the B'nai B'rith had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures in Germany have averaged a million marks a year . Three weeks ago an order was issued forbidding Jewish organizations of any sort to hold any meetings whatever for 60 days .

This was amplified by newsreel shots of Sit-Down strikes . And Schwarze Korps , organ of Hitler 's special guards , was able to do its bit . It filled a front page with pictures of U. S. female wrestlers , headlined it : AMERICAN LADIES . <P> Not forgotten was the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Mayor LaGuardia . With great disregard of time &; space , the Berlin press picked Borough President George U. Harvey of Queens to be its candidate this autumn for Mayor of New York . All but annihilating Mr. Harvey 's chances before the race began , Berlin newspapers solemnly declared : " If he is elected Mayor , Mr. Harvey has promised to eradicate Communists from New York in two weeks , with rubber hoses . " In many ways Adolf Hitler 's toughest opponent remained the Catholic Church . <P> Pope Pius ' pastoral letter of last March , which took Germany sharply to task for persistent breaches of the Vatican-Nazi Concordat of 1933 , had been answered by a rude peremptory note . Read the official resum : " The Vatican applies to the new Germany , democratic and parliamentary standards which are not applicable . . .
