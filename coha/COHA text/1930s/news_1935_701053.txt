txt Having failed so far to bring any appreciable public pressure against the Senators who voted the " prevailing wage " amendment into the $4,880,000,000 work relief resolution , Democratic leaders in the Senate looked to President Roosevelt today for some cue as to how to proceed with the measure , progress on which has been halted . Senators against whom it was hoped that the public would exert pressure were , if anything , more adamant . Certainly , they were not any more inclined to give way because the executive council of the American Federation of Labor voted unanimously this afternoon to stand firm in the fight for the " prevailing wage " amendment . It was this provision which prompted an immediate warning on the Senate floor that President Roosevelt would veto the measure and caused it to be recommitted to committee . The action taken by the labor leaders was reported on Capitol Hill by Senator McCarran , author of the " prevailing wage " amendment , to hearten the forty-four Senators , including twenty-one Democrats who had voted for it last Thursday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purpose to offer the amendment to any work relief proposal that might be laid before the Senate , and expressed confidence that an even greater vote would be piled up for it . Works Planning Proceeds . The Public Works and Federal Emergency Relief Administrations , apparently ignoring the legislative turmoil , continued today their plans for administration of what the President hopes will be a work relief law . PWA , through its district supervisors , in cooperation with county engineers , speeded up a census of potential projects which it is said will number 90,000 by the end of this week . The Senate leaders are expected to take their problem to the President immediately upon his return here Thursday . The Senate was adjourned until Thursday after a little more than an hour of routine work this afternoon . Senator Glass , chairman of the Appropriations Committee , to which the resolution was recommitted , stated flatly that the matter would rest at least until the President returns from Hyde Park . The fear of the leadership , both in the Senate and House , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining proposals to be submitted at this session . Committees are at work on the four-point program for social security , on a resolution to extend the National Industrial Recovery Act , and on utility holding company and transportation legislation . Each of these bills is filled with controversial subject matter . Not only is it regarded absolutely necessary to work out the relief problem so that these measures can be brought forward , but the Congressional leaders count it as equally important that the administration know its ground before proceeding . Move to Force Action Is Halted . A move to force the work relief measure back to the Senate floor was started this afternoon by Senator Borah and several independent Democrats . At first they intended to move on Thursday to discharge the committee and thus force the issue . They were not so sure about such a step , however , when informed by Charles L. Watkins , parliamentarian , that the Senate 's action in recommitting the resolution had vacated all amendments , including the McCarran amendment , and that the measure thus would be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . Other Senators had begun today to talk of compromise . Many considered it obvious that the President and labor both could not win . They insisted that the leaders in- quire of the President when he returns Thursday what concessions , if any , he might make . Meanwhile , another group , composed of about thirty " conservative " Democrats and Republicans , was silently standing by awaiting an opportunity to present the Adams-Byrd-Copeland plan for more direct relief . This plan now proposes that the appropriation be cut to $1,880,000,000 , with the idea that the President would be forced to lean more on direct relief than upon the more expensive public works . Senator McCarran said he would support the lower appropriation . Senator Townsend . representing the conservative Republican group , said that " there wo n't be a vote against it . " Hyde Park Despatches Questioned . " Personally , I am not willing to have the bill die because of the adoption of one amendment , " said Senator Borah . " The argument that the McCarran amendment would necessitate adding one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senators who voted for the McCarran amendment expressed amusement at the apparent failure of the leaders ' strategy to arouse the country against them . They joked about reports from Hyde Park , which seemed to them to originate from the President 's secretariat , to the effect that " thousands " of protests were flooding Washington . Senator Borah said he had received two letters on the subject of the McCarran amendment and both commended his stand for it . Senator McCarran said he had received more than 200 letters , and only one criticized him . Senator Bulkley reported twenty letters with fourteen protesting his vote and six supporting it . Other Senators reported substantially the same as they stated yesterday , that they had had a minimum of response from home and it was about evenly divided , for and against the amendment . By proceeding with plans for putting into effect the administration 's $4,880,000,000 relief measure , public works and relief officials indicated plainly today their faith that , despite the President 's difficulties on Capitol Hill , he would in some way force through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Work Relief Bill to go through , and I think it will be passed without the preveiling wage amendment , " Secretary Ickes , the Public Works Administrator , said . " We have received a good many letters from people all over the country in the last few days . " State PWA engineers have been instructed by Mr. Ickes to make intensive reports to headquarters on every possible work relief project within their jurisdictions and have passed the word along to State officials . These in turn have enlisted the aid of the county engineers all over the country in lining up possible projects . FERA Assumes That Dole Is Ended . Through the machinery thus set in motion , proposals for several thousand projects , many of them of the " self-liquidating " nature mentioned by President Roosevelt in his work relief message to Congress , are received daily by the State engiheers , PWA officials said . The State engineers are expected to send the reports to Washington headquarters Friday , when it is thought that the 60,000 projects on file at PWA headquarters here will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties in all parts of the nation were described as desiring to cooperate in an expanded works program . Federal Emergency Relief officials also were reported to be acting on the assumption that there would be a work relief program , and that the " dole " would be discontinued . One PWA official suggested that the resolution be modified to include general specifications as to the type of projects for which the 1 appropriation could be spent , This , he said , would remove the objections in Congress to granting a huge sum to the President " with no strings attached , " and would be acceptable to prospective administrators , who thus would avoid criticism on the type of projects se-1 lected . No fewer than thirty-six of thirty-seven slum clearance and lowcost housing projects already decided upon are jeopardized by the possibility that an acceptable program may not pass Congress , Secretary Ickes revealed . Although the PWA housing program has been in operation eighteen months , only 124 dwellings are completed and occupied . Only $2,500,000 of the original PWA Housing Division allotment of $148,800,000 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been spent or pledged through loans and grants to Limited Dividend Corporations . Binding contracts have been signed for but $3,500,000 more . Sites have been acquired for a university housing project at Atlanta , for two projects in Montgomery , Ala. ; one at Cleveland , one at Indianapolis , and some land has been acquired for the Williamsburg project in Brooklyn . At the Juniata project in Philadelphia sixty homes are occupied , Fifty are completed and occupied at Alta . Vine. , Va. , and fourteen are occupied at Euclid , Ohio . Secretary Ickes explained this apparently slow progress on low-cost housing by saying that the program did not really get under way until Colonel Horatio B. Hackett took charge of it in June , 1934 , and that land purchase had been made difficult by existing laws . Unless the $95,000,000 of PWA housing funds lent to FERA for immediate relief purposes can be repaid after passage of a works relief bill , the housing program will have to be scrapped , Secretary Ickes 's aides said .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
