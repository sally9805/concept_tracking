Last week the personification of Birth Control visited Georgia . Mrs. Margaret Sanger arrived in Atlanta to argue her cause . Up to debate with her arose lean-faced , white-haired Richard Brevard Russell , 70-year-old Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and father of 18 children . <P> Judge Russell 's son and namesake is Governor-elect of Georgia . Declared the tobacco-chewing jurist , who still works on the State road for fun : <P> " Everyone in Georgia who needs to know about birth control already knows it . Furthermore its practice is common . Otherwise , how would the State have lost two Congressmen as a result of the last census ? It 's not the self-sacrificing , home-loving , man-making woman who wants birth control but the so-called ladies who want to attend the theatre and the club instead of staying at home caring for their children . . . . Birth control matter is cesspool literature and I do n't want the mails in my State opened to injurious matter to be placed before the immature minds in the home . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to tell Him that , whatever shortcoming I may have had , I have at least obeyed His commandments about producing children . " <P> Retorted Mrs. Sanger : " Absurd ! "
