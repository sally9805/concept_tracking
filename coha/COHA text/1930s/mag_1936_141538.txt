A bad August means a big cut in the growing cotton crop . Worst August that anyone in Wall Street remembered was 1927 when the Government 's Sept. 1 crop estimate fell a whopping 800,000 bales below its August estimate . Since the official estimates largely determine cotton prices there is big money in guessing right what the next estimate will be . Fortnight ago more than a dozen cotton brokers and experts began this guessing game . Most of them daringly went out on a limb , estimated a record drop of 500,000 to 700,000 bales below the Government 's August estimate of 12,481,000 bales . One noon last week they had the shock of their lives . Trading stopped as usual as the Government 's Sept. 1 cotton estimate came over the wires : 11,121,000 bales- down 1,360,000 bales in one month , an alltime record drop . <P> Wires flashed the news around the world . For 15 minutes commission men in New York , cotton mill operators in New England and the South , spinners in Manchester , in Bombay and Osaka , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 minutes when trading was resumed in Manhattan , brokers ' hands were full of large and small orders from all over the world . Before noon anyone could have bought U. S. cotton for future delivery at about 11 Ib . An hour later none could be had under 12 , a difference of $2.50 a bale . <P> Curious part of the decreased crop estimate was that in the Eastern half of the cotton belt , cotton prospects had improved during August to the tune of 264,000 bales . In the Western half cotton conditions had gone from bad to worse . In August Oklahoma had only one twenty-fifth of its normal rainfall . That cut 226,000 bales off its estimated production . Texas , which normally produces one out of every three bales , had less than half a normal August 's rain . That cut off 814,000 bales . Other Western states accounted for the rest . <P> Chief significance of 11,121,000 bale crop is that : 1 ) the world will probably consume at least 600,000 bales of U. S. cotton above this year 's production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bale carryover ; 2 ) Commodity Credit Corp . which still holds 3,028,675 bales as security for loans to farmers can partly bail itself out ; 3 ) a price rise of $2.50 a bale will mean $28,000,000 more income for U. S. farmers ; 4 ) many U. S. cotton mills will show good ' profits as a result of the increased value of cotton they have already bought for future use . <P> *AAA has already sold over 2,000,000 bales bought in its 1934 cotton pool .
