 | The Awful English of England Condensed from The American Mercury H. W. Seaman Member of the London " Sunday Chronicle " staff EnGLISH AND AMERICAN idiom and vocabulary have been drawn together in recent years by the radio , the talkies , Edgar Wallace P. G. Wodehouse Sinclair Lewis , Will Rogers , and many other agencies . We import racket from America , and export gadget in return . You send us high hat , hokum , getaway , panties , and hangover , and we send you swank , spoof , click , the wind up , and tell of . In this as in other commodities our imports exceed our exports . I can now write in any English newspaper of a man holding down a job or being dropped from the payroll , without benefit of quotes . The Prince of Wales , on the air , speaks of getting away with it . We no longer care a damn ; we give a damn . Everybody in England under the age of 55 now knows what a derby hat is , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be underpants only , now include trousers . The butcher 's boy still wears a blue striped apron and rides a bicycle , but he says Sure ! Says you ! You 're telling me ! And how ! and What will you use for money ? Many English newspapers now use hoodoo , chores , and spat ( noun ) , without inverted commas . Newspapers that held out for years against radio , preferring wireless , have been forced into line . Poloney has become boloney . Maybe is used as often as perhaps . Englishmen wipe off their chins , brush themselves off , and loan money . In one short con-  | versation T have heard nothing to write home about , in the bag , be said plenty . The adjective like is now used adverbially , as in the American vernacular ; an advertisement for a patent aerial says , " It picks up radio like a sponge picks up water . " Say has driven I say ! out of business in England , and bum and bug have their places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke of a man who took insect powder and aspirin together for a lousy headache . There are gaps , of course . To the Englishman in the street a faucet is still a tap . The top of a car is still its hood , and the hood its bonnet . A mutt is a boob , never a dog , and a dog is never a pooch . But only such trifling differences now separate the idiom and vocabulary of urban England from that of urban America . I should like to mid in this apparent rapprochement genuine signs of a better understanding between the two peoples . Alas , the trouble is not what we say but how we say it . In accent and intonation we are farther apart than ever . In spite of the earnest if commercially inspired efforts of Hollywood and Elstree to turn out talkies acceptable on both sides of the Atlantic ; and in spite of broadcast relays from both sides , accompanied by much talk of hands across the sea and a common standard of speech , you still sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a mauve , Episcopalian , and ephebian ring . At a movie , an actress on the screen says " I jest kea n't go through wuth u.t ; I jest kea n't , " A young man behind me says to his girl , " I daow n't mawnd the blinkin ' sleng ; it 's the neyesal tweng I caw n't stick . " The most formidable barrier to perfect accord between the two great divisions of the AngloSaxon race ( begging your pardon , Mr. Roosevelt , and yours , Mr. MacDonald ) is speech . My friends and neighbors here in England , on meeting Americans , are deeply wounded by their delivery , taking it to be a crude and malicious caricature of their own ; while Americans , on hearing , for example , in London or Oxford , the letter o pronounced as an oval diphthong instead of roundly , as in nearly all tongues of Christendom , hesitate between kicking and kissing the offender . Personally I deplore the Englishman 's backhanded crack at the lands where English is spoken in accents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American notion that because many Englishmen pitch their voices in the head register we are a nation of pansies . But I know just what is meant by an Englishman 's accent , and I am bound to confess that it  | produces precisely that effect on me . The sensation is difficult to analyze , but everybody who is not an English public school boy , an Oxford man , a clergyman of the Establishment , an announcer of the British Broadcasting Company , a West End actor , or of cognate species , must have experienced it often . I speak for millions of Englishmen when I say that we are as sick and tired of this so-called English accent as you Americans are . It is notable that few of the older members of our ancient aristocracy sissify their tongues ; most of them are farmers . There is more of the pansy twang in the House of Commons than in the House of Lords . For ninetenths of the people who speak the dialect called English Standard speech it is indeed a snobbish affectation , consciously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting a man from Liverpool , Manchester , Edinburgh , Newcastle , Dublin , or Plymouth , using his own natural speech , would set him down as a sissy on the evidence of his tongue . It is London 's Cockney accent that has set itself up as the nation 's standard speech , and it is deliberately fathered by the universities , the clergy , and the speech experts . Long , long ago , when the first talkies came to us from America , the chief argument of Englislh critics who predicted a short vogue for them was that they were delivered in a tongue not understanded of the people . In the same breath , however , these prophets assumed that British talkies would proceed forthwith to drive the American product off the screen . " Hollywood , " they said in effect , " has played into the hands of Elstree . Nobody will wish to listen to American speech when he can hear the pure English of our own players . " At about that time I heard the leading woman of a stock company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was rally quate shaw that the public would refuse to listen to the abominable American accent , and that the Americans themselves would soon welcome the opportunity to hear the matber tongue in all its peeawrity . As a patriotic Englishman , I deeply regret that this glorious British victory on the celluloid front has failed as yet to come off ; and I fear that it never will . It seems , indeed , that the mass of British people actually find the most god-awful Yankee twang more tolerable than the simpering falsetto of some of our juveniles and ingenues , and the drawl of Will Rogers less foreign to their ears than the hot-house Cockney of Chelsea , Mayfair , and Bloomsbury .
