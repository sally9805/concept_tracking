txt Dr. FOSDICK , in the pulpit of the new Riverside Church , stressed beauty as one of the forms in which the Church must express itself for the enrichment of life . With that in mind the builders of the Riverside Church chose for their model the Cathedral at Chartres . They provided it with a site as lovely as can be found in New York City . That view up and down more than a score of miles of the Hudson and across the mile-wide stream to the Palisades is without parallel in any other metropolis . It takes on the character of grandeur . With all deference to the tide of fashion which has been flowing for some years toward the East River , the residents of the Riverside section can not but smile at the expedients to which the modish migrants are driven in order to make out a case for their new homes in terms of beauty . With the kindly aid of night draped over Welfare Island by a dexterous hand in charcoal or wash , and with the further aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens where are now chiefly smokestacks , it is possible to say something for the attractiveness of the East River . But the west riparian region of Manhattan does not have to wait for some day to be beautiful . Never by taking thought can the East River add a cubit to its moderate width , or build upon the opposite bank a backdrop of green and dun ramparts like that across the Hudson . Beyond beauty this RiversideMorningside district has the promise of permanency above any other section on the island . Its character is guaranteed , as the real estate descriptions say , by the nature of the improvements so far made . In an area slightly more than half a mile long , from 110th Street to 122d Street , and slightly less than half a mile wide , from Morningside Avenue to Riverside Drive , are situated , in the order of acreage , Columbia University with Teachers College and Barnard College , the Cathedral of St. John the Divine with its attendant group of buildings , St. Luke 's Hospital , the Union Theological Seminary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. FRANK DAMROSCH 'S music college . Toward the north , beyond the dip of Manhattan Valley across which the British and the Americans fought the battle of Harlem Heights , but near enough to merge into the general picture of a neighborhood dedicated to aspiration and learning , are City College and , at a further remove , the majestic lightbrick outcropping of the Medical Centre . Even without padding the returns the one-quarter square mile of Morningside Heights proper would seem to be committed for many generations to its present uses and under its present semblance . The Financial District and the railway terminals will probably be in 1980 where they are today , though it is by no means certain in their present aspect . But the great cathedral , which has been nearly forty years in the building on Morningside Heights , and the new Riverside Church , which has captured much of medieval beauty with modern speed , will certainly be there in half a century , together with the buildings of Columbia University .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
