O.P. &; M. J. Railroad <P> Having learned how the greatest private banking house in the U. S. operates , the members of the Senate Banking &; Currency Committee learned last week how a great railroad system may be put together . <P> Because one of J. P. Morgan &; Co. ' s deals was the financing of Alleghany Corp. , Mr. Pecora sent to Cleveland and brought the bachelor brothers Oris Paxton and Mantis James Van Sweringen posting to the Capital , put " O. P. " upon the stand and kept him there four solid days . <P> No wholly tractable witness was " O. P. " His memory of figures and dates was defective , he refused consistently to " guess . " Time and again he answered , " I do n't know . We will get that figure for you . " or " You can get that from the records . " Caustic comments about the quality of his memory did not move him . Yet at the end of four days ' testimony the committeemen could get a good idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step by step from a " shoestring " of $1,000,000 . <P> Step I was taken in 1916 , when the brothers-two farm boys who went to the city and spent their savings buying empty lots-were already successful real estate operators in Cleveland . They had a suburban development called Shaker Heights which needed a rapid transit line to the heart of the city . For a rapid transit line they needed a right of way . They thought of hiring one from the nearby Nickel Plate Road . They went to the New York Central ( which owned more than 50% of the stock of the Nickel Plate ) and came away not only with a right of way but with a majority interest in the Nickel Plate-the famed New York , Chicago &; St. Louis Railroad , built in the 1880 's at so great a cost per mile that financial wags of the period said that its rails were nickel plated . In 1916 , the Nickel Plate ( with 523 mi. of track connecting Buffalo with Chicago ) was not in the forefront of railroads . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Central was glad to sell its majority interest for $8,500,000 . <P> The Brothers Van Sweringen did not have $8,500,000 but they had a vision of the Nickel Plate as a profitable road . With two chief associates , Charles L. Bradley , who owned the Cleveland baseball team , and Joseph R. Nutt , chairman of Union Trust Co. , and with several lesser associates , they gave the New York Central ten notes for $650,000 payable one a year for ten years , and they also paid down $2,000,000 in cash obtained as a loan from Cleveland 's Guardian Savings &; Trust Co. by putting up the Nickel Plate stock as collateral . So the original deal was financed entirely on credit and borrowed capital . They presently formed Nickel Plate Securities Corp. , which assumed liability for the notes and the loan . It issued $2,000,000 worth of preferred stock to which the Van Sweringens subscribed about $500,000 in cash . They also got most of the Securities Corp . ' s common stock . With the $2,000,000 the Security Corp . paid off the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could pay out of earnings the $6,500,000 in notes still owed . ( The notes were all paid off by 1923 , three years ahead of time . ) This was the first profitable deal .
