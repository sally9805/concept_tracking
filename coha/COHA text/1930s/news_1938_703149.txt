txt A generally favorable ruling shortly after March 1 on the railroads ' rate increase proposals was forecast last night in well-informed quarters as the Interstate Commerce Commission concluded final argument in the 15% case . Hopes for an earlier decision were dimmed somewhat by a general expectation that the commission will attach certain conditions to its order to force the pooling of revenue derived from specific rate increases . Whether such conditions would be extended to increases on any commodities other than coal . commission observers were reluctant to predict at this time . However , it is felt certain the ICC will make such a stipulation with respect to any further coal rate boosts and will give serious consideration to various methods of pooling . This will lengthen the time required for a decision . Present Pooling Proposals Criticized Recognizing the intense interest the ICC now has in pooling , R. V. Fletcher , general counsel for the Association of American Railroads , severely criucized current proposals for the general pooling of revenue from rate increases . He told the commission . however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue from coal rate increases so that the major share would not go to the more prosperous Pocahontas lines . Mr. Fletcher explained later that such a plan would extend to the coal rate increases allowed last fall , which expire at the end of this year unless the revenue is pooled , and also to any further coal rate advances allowed . The plan , he made clear , will only embrace individual railroads and their connections . Mr Fletcher declined to amplify this statement and said the plan would be submitted to the ICC " in due course . " In two hours of rebuttal argument . Mr. Fletcher made an impassioned plea to the commission not to " close the door of hope " for the railroad industry . He deplored the attitude of certain shippers and others that the railroads , in seeking rate increases , are " asking . for a favor or a subsidy , when they are only asking their constitutional rights under the law . " Attitude Appears Favorable Attitude of the various commissioners appeared generally favorable , although their interest in pooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail attorney . indicated considerable interest in the extent to which obsolete equipment and various types of facilities are included in property investment on which the carriers are seeking a ' proper return . " The rate increases now proposed , if allowed in full . would only yield the railroads a return of slightly less than 4% on a valuation as low as $20,000,000.000 . Mr. Fletcher told the commission . Explaining his statement , Mr. Fletcher pointed out that the most the railroads can expect for 1938 is a traffic volume about equal to that handled in 1936 . The net railway operating income , when adusted to the basis of present operating costs and the present level of freight and passenger charges , would be $365,000,000 . On the basis of the 1936 volume of traffic , he pointed out , it is estimated the proposed freight rate increases would yield added revenue of $437.337.000 and the increase in passenger fares in the East would yield about $30,000,000 . Reducing the resulting total of $467,000,000 by $49,000,000 to take care of Federal income taxes thereon , the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adding the latter figure to the adjusted NOI for 1936. the amount of $783,000,000 is arrived at as the approximate maximum annual NOI that can reasonably be expected to result from the increased charges . This would represent a return of 3.01% on the 1936 property investment , and only 3.91% . of ? a valuation as low as ; 20,000,000,000 , the railroad attorney explained . Improvement in Traffic Needed Pointing out that the railroads ' pending petition was drawn prior to the current business recession , Mr. Fletcher told the commission that If the slack in business continues " we may have to recast our lines entirely . " He said the railroads were not assuming present conditions would continue and admitted that a 15 ' rate increase would not solve their problems unless there is improvement in traffic . Citing consolidations. coordinations , and " this , that and other improvements " which many persons " who know exactly how to save the railroads " have proposed . Mr. Fletcher said : " The ICC knows that you can not solve this problem by putting the railroads through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them in a position where they can borrow no money . " That , he asserted , " is a nonfinancial man 's view . He added that he did not think that these many proposals were sound and said he doubted the value of consolidations and coordinations which have been studied . Criticizes Opposition Calling attention to the fact that other industries are free to increase their prices when costs rise , Mr. Fletcher criticized the arguments advanced by various shipping interests against rate increases . Coal costs , for example , he declared , recently have been increased by orders of the National Bituminous Coal Commission more than they will be increased by the rate boosts now proposed . " Consistency is not always a jewel , but it Is hard to reconcile these conditions , " he asserted . The deficit of $137,000,000 for 1938 predicted by Mr. Fletcher if the 1936 volume of traffic is handled without further rate increases includes allowance for fixed charges of roads now in bankruptcy , he admitted under questioning by Commissioner Mahaftle . Commissioner Eastman , after having the speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than cancelled out by the fixed charges on bonds . of bankruptcy roads not now being paid . Property Investment and Valuation On the matter of property investment and valuation , Commissioner Rogers asked Mr. Fletcher if it were not true that several thousand locomotives and many other types of facilities , now obsolete and unusuable , were not included in property investment . Mr. Fletcher admitted that this might be true to a certain extent and that such facilities should be " written off " , but - added that the railroads were required to maintain the same plant and equipment to handle thin traffic as well as the peak volume . When water navigation is impossible because of frozen rivers and lakes and other methods of transport are not available , he pointed out , the railroads are required to be in a position to handle whatever business is offered them . - When asked by Commissioner Rogers if the Pocahontas roads needed additional revenue and whether he thought the ICC should allow those . roads further coal rate Increases , Mr. Fletcher said the carriers have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from coal rates will not all go to these carriers . He said he was not prepared to put the plan in the current record , but In " due course " would offer a plan for dividing coal revenues as suggested by the commission in its rate decision last fall , Balls In " Dire Need " In a 170-page brief supplemental to his argument , Mr. Fletcher asserted that no argument , " however industrious " can " break down or explain away " the fact that the railroads are in dire need of additional revenue .
