Illustration : The two fighting men circled warily . In the Orbit of Saturn By R. F. Starzl * * * * * Sidenote : Disguised as a voluntary prisoner on a pirate space ship , an I. F. P. man penetrates the mystery of the dreaded " Solar Scourge . " The Celestia , gliding through space toward Titan , major satellite of Saturn , faltered in her course . Her passengers , mostly mining engineers and their wives , stockholders , and a sprinkling of visitors , were aware of a cessation of the heavens ' apparent gyrations , due to the halting of the ship 's rotation on its axis . At the same time the ship 's fictitious gravity , engendered by the centrifugal force of its rotation , ceased , so that passengers , most of whom were assembled in the main salon , which occupied the entire midship section , drifted away from the curved floor , whose contour followed that of the outer skin , to flounder in helpless confusion . A woman screamed . A rasping sound , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the circumference , and here the portholes were obscured by a dark mass that blotted out the stars . An old man , clinging to a luxuriously upholstered chair , and pale with fright , cried : " It 's those damned pirates . If they find out who I am it 'll break the company to ransom me . " " If the company thinks it worth while to ransom you , " retorted his youngish , saturnine companion , who seemed less scared than annoyed . Questions darted back and forth . No word came from the control room forward , and little of what transpired outside could be seen through the thick glass ports . The pirate ship loomed over them like a monstrous leech , its bolts sharply etched in black and white by the sunlight from their stern . Beyond that was only the velvety darkness -- the absolute vacuity of space that carries no sound , refracts no light . A battle was raging out there , but of that nothing could be seen or heard in the salon . Only a dull , booming vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a useless effort to shake off their captor. * * * * * Of all the passengers , none understood the situation as well as Quirl Finner . In imagination he followed the desperate struggle that was going on out there , for the men who were selling their lives were his companions in arms , the ship 's guard of the redoubtable I.F.P. , the Interplanetary Flying Police who carried the law of white men to the outermost orbit of the solar system . Quirl bristled , but he maintained his pose of indifference -- of the sightseeing passenger who depended blindly on the ship 's crew for his own safety . In appearance he might easily have been the pampered son of some millionaire that he impersonated . His close-fitting silken tunic of blue , with its bright yellow roll-collar , the turban of fine yellow lace , the close-fitting trousers that showed his lithe yet powerfully molded legs , the thin-soled low boots -- all proclaimed him the typical time-killing dandy of the times . His superb proportions made him look smaller , lighter than he really was , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked hawk-like , were sufficiently like the patrician fineness of the character part he was playing . Young men of means in the year 2159 were by no means without their good points . They indulged in athletic sports to counteract the softening influence of idleness , and so Quirl Finner had no misgivings about the success of his disguise . Yet he could not refrain from listening intently for every sound that penetrated the hull . His part was to be captured by the pirate , who had been named " The Solar Scourge " by sensational newscasters , and to learn all he could , and eventually to be ransomed by a " wealthy father " with his priceless information . So he waited , chafing , while men he knew , men who had faced the perils of space with him , met their death . After a time there came the sudden crackling of the air-tight bulkhead which separated the salon from the forward sections . Quirl knew what this meant . The pirates had succeeded in breaching a hole through the ship 's skin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was sickening to think of those brave men up there caught in the suddenly formed vacuum . Long before the bulkhead had ceased crackling he knew they were dead , and that the pirate crew had entered , wearing vacuum suits , and was even then replenishing the air so the passengers could be taken alive . * * * * * They had been in the prison hold of the pirate ship for five days , terrestrial time . This was nothing like the spacious quarters they had occupied before . A cross-section of their prison would have looked like a wedge with a quarter circle for its blunt end . The curved wall of the great cylindrical projectile , nearly a hundred feet in diameter , was their floor , on which they could walk like flies on the inside of a wheel rim . The walls of the room , on two sides , converged toward the top , until they joined the sides of a well-like tunnel that ran from the nose of the ship to its tail , where the rocket nozzles were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was a metal platform , from which one could either climb into the passage or down a ladder into the hold . A pirate guard held this platform , from where he could peer over the top of a curtain which gave scant privacy to the men and women prisoners on either side of it . On the floor-plates , without even the meager comfort of the dried Martian weeds that had been given to the women , sat or lay the men . They showed their dejection , their faces covered with new growths of beard , their clothes crumpled and torn . The only furniture consisted of a long , light metal table on the women 's side , securely bolted to the floor . The prisoners were obliged to stand at this when eating their meals . The whole cheerless scene was coldly illuminated by a single light-emanating disk just under the guard 's platform . Steps echoed hollowly metallic from above . Quirl wondered if it was already time for the galley boy to bring the immense bowl of hot stew for the noon meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Moby Gore , the huge and overbearing first mate of the pirates on his daily mission of inspection and prisoner baiting . Quirl crept further into his corner . It would be fatal to his plan for him to attract the attention of this petty tyrant . It was hard enough to keep away from him -- to crush back the almost overwhelming desire to fly at him , fists hammering . Gore came down the ladder deliberately , pausing on the lower steps to look around with his little , pig 's eyes . His head was set well forward on his thick , muscular neck , so that he had to look out from under his beetling brows in a manner peculiarly ape-like . His heavy face was smooth-shaven , and his blue-black jowls and chin looked painfully smooth . His coarse , black hair was brushed back and plastered firmly to his bullet head . His body was heavy , but moved with deadly smoothness and precision . The customary harness which passed around his naked torso supported a double-barreled ironizing electrocution pistol , and also a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist were short pants , which displayed the thick , hairy legs with their cable-like muscles . On his feet were thick socks , so that his toes were able to curl around the rungs of the ladder . Satisfied with his quick , darting inspection , Gore now came all the way down . At the foot of the ladder lay an elderly man in the oblivion of sleep . Gore 's foot came down on the thin chest . With savage pleasure he bore down , so that the old man 's startled squawk ended in a fit of coughing . Gore cuffed him aside roughly , growling : " Old squiffer ! Let that learn you to sleep out of the way ! " He laughed coarsely when one of the prisoners , with the temerity of anonymity , started to boo , but received no support . * * * * * Carelessly Gore passed among the prisoners . Here and there he halted , snatching some article of finery or inconspicuous bit of jewelry that he had overlooked before . They shrank from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next unfortunate . " You , there ! " Gore rasped , indicating Quirl with his stubby forefinger . " Come on out o ' there , you ! " Quirl hoped that the brutal mate would not hear the thudding of his beating heart , or that if he did , he would take it for fear . He came slowly toward Gore , who was greedily eyeing the young man 's brightly colored and valuable tunic . Quirl came too slowly . " What do you take me for ? " Gore bellowed in unreasonable anger . He strode forward , the prisoners scattering before him . His large , knotty hand closed on Quirl 's arm , and jerked , with the intention of whirling this reluctant prisoner across the room . But Quirl was heavier , and his arm harder , than Gore had supposed . The hand came away , and with a tearing scream , the beautiful silk garment ripped off , ruined , disclosing Quirl 's white and well-knit body . " You done that a-purpose ! " Gore roared , and then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break his back . But that seemingly slight body would not bend , and , as much as Gore might tug and heave , he could not force Quirl back . The little pig-eyes glared , and there was death in them . Suddenly Gore let go . His hand leaped to the short club at his side , and he swung the weapon in a vicious arc . Quirl 's relaxed forearm met it , sapping most of its force . Yet when it struck his head it seemed to burst like a ball of fire . He crashed against the wall and sank to the floor only half conscious . " Gore ! Gore ! " yelled the guard from the platform , " ' member how sore the Old Man was about the last terrie you killed ? Better lay off . " " Shut yo'r damned mug ! " Gore yelled back . But he gave up his idea of kicking the prisoner , and with a menacing glare for the guard , passed on . * * * * * As Quirl 's mind slowly cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Gore his hand had come in contact with the butt of the mate 's electrogun . He could easily have pulled it out of its holster and turned it against its owner . But this hasty action would not only have assured his own death , but would have destroyed the only chance the I.F.P. had of learning " The Scourge 's " secrets . Gore slowly worked his way to the women 's side of the hold . Here , much to the amusement of the guard and himself , he began stripping off their long , flowing robes , disclosing their nude bodies . He seemed to see particular humor to heaping indignity on the older women , commenting coarsely on their shortcomings . The men viewed this with set , pale faces . But none dared to interfere . In their midst was an object lesson , his head swathed in bandages . He had been the first to resent this exhibition , an almost daily event , when the mate 's roving eye had happened to alight upon his wife . All at once Gore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terrifying intentness at the girl who had until that day managed to escape his notice . Gore had torn off a nondescript black cape that had covered her head and face , and the golden silk robe she wore . To Quirl , watching from a space of some sixty feet , her beauty came like a shock . He remembered her as Lenore Hyde , whom he had seen only once before as she emerged briefly from her stateroom . About five feet , six inches tall , her slim figure was dwarfed by the huge bulk of the mate . Her golden hair tumbled over her slim shoulders , almost to her waist , where a tasseled cord held the clinging silk close to her . Her face , so white that it seemed like silver in that gorgeous setting , was cold and defiant . There was no fear in those deep blue eyes under the straight brows -- only loathing and contempt . Gore was not concerned with the personal feelings of his prize . He licked his wide , cruel lips , seizing the girl 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand slipped into the collar of her robe . * * * * * But the ripping of fabric did not come . Instead there was a sharp crack , and Gore , too surprised even to move , stared at the little man who had hit him . Again crack ! The impact of fist on jaw . The blow was too weak to hurt this toughened veteran of countless battles . But slowly a tide of dull red welled up over the bull neck , turning the blue-black jowls to purple , and the walls echoed to Gore 's roar of anger . Again the fists of the smaller man smacked , this time drawing a trickle of blood from Gore 's mouth . Then the thick fingers closed on the brave passenger 's wrist , and the tremendous muscles swelled as , with a quick movement , Gore thrust his adversary back of him , grasping the other wrist also . Then with slow , irresistible motion , he began drawing the thin arms forward , stretching them , until the unfortunate man , drawn against the barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still Gore pulled , grinning evilly , and his victim 's shoulder blades lifted under the tight skin of his back as they took the strain . Shriek followed shriek , until the guard on the platform glanced furtively out into the central well . There came a dry , tearing crackle as the bones of the arms were drawn out of their sockets , and then the shrieks ceased as merciful unconsciousness came . Gore tossed the limp body carelessly away . " The beast ! " Quirl gritted his teeth . But he stayed where he was , hiding his clenched fist , for his was a specific assignment , and men of the I.F.P. know the meaning of the word " duty . " In a better humor again , Gore looked around . " Come on , you little ginny ! " he chortled . " I see you ! Come to Moby , my beauty . You 'll be queen of the hold , and this scurvy litter will kiss your feet every day . " * * * * * He pursued her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners as they tried to scramble out of his way , men and women alike . But she made up in agility what she lacked in strength , lifting up the hem of her robe so that her legs twinkled bare , ducking under Gore 's outstretched arms , or leaping over the fallen form of some stumbling , panic-stricken unfortunate . Only in her eyes was there a true picture of her terror . Gore 's uncertain temper was changing again , and in a few moments he was cursing foully , his little red-rimmed eyes glistening , as he dashed after her with short , boar-like rushes . Again she skimmed past where Quirl cowered in simulated fear , and the look she gave him struck straight at the disguised officer 's heart . So it was that when she slipped and fell to her knees , and Gore charged in with a triumphant laugh , Quirl met him with no thought of anything , no feeling but the joy of battle , the delight of a strong man when he meets a foe whom he hates . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of a lovely face whose obvious fear was somehow tempered by hope and confidence -- in him ! As Gore lunged past , Quirl struck him . It was a short , sharp , well-timed jab that would have knocked out an ordinary man . But Gore was by no means ordinary . The blow laid open his cheek against the jawbone , but Gore scarcely slowed as he swerved . With a bellow of rage , he came straight at Quirl , arms outstretched . Philosophers have said that no matter how far the human race advances in the sciences , its fundamental reactions will still be atavistic . Gore could have dispatched Quirl in a second with his ray weapon , with perfect safety . Yet it is doubtful that the weapon even entered his mind . As he came to the battle he was driven only by the primitive urge to fight with his hands , to maim , to tear limb from limb like the great simians whom he resembled . * * * * * To Quirl , coolly poised , the picture of Gore did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They saw a brutal giant , gorilla-like , and roaring like a beast , charging at a half-naked youth apparently only half his size . It seemed that those tremendous arms must break him at the first touch . But the grasping hands slipped off the lithe body as if it were oiled , leaving only angry red welts along Quirl 's ribs . As the officer edged away he planted two blows on Gore 's nose , which began to bleed freely . Again Gore rushed , and spat ! spat ! two seemingly light blows landed on his face , opening a cut above his eye and another on his cheek bone . In a few seconds of battling he had become a shocking sight , with his features almost obscured by welling blood . Again Quirl measured him , and this time , instead of evading the grasp of the mate 's eager arms , he stepped right between them . Like a wraith he slipped into their embrace , and before they could grasp him , standing so close that his chest almost touched his adversary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the kind of punch that makes champions , a whiplike lash of the forearm , with relaxed muscles that tighten at the moment of impact . A punch with " follow-through " fit to knock out ninety-nine men out of a hundred . But it did not knock out Gore , and Quirl had to pay dearly for his error . Gore was staggered , but his mighty arms closed , hugging his slighter opponent to his hairy chest so that the breath was choked out of him , and the metal studs on his harness gouged cruelly into Quirl 's flesh . His face was blue before he could work his arm loose , and begin to prod with stiffened fingers at Gore 's throat . Gore had to let go then , and Quirl broke away , boxed for a few moments until he had recovered , and then proceeded to chop Gore 's face beyond any semblance of humanity . The mate had dropped his ray weapon , and now searched for it with blinded eyes . He flung his riot club , and it flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be beaten into insensibility. * * * * * The guard on the platform , seeing the trend of the battle , shouted hoarsely up the well , and in a few minutes four men , hard-bitten , villainous looking fellows , tumbled down the ladder and joyously joined in the fray . It was then only a matter of seconds before Quirl lay on the floor-plates , battered and bleeding , but still feebly fighting , while Gore sat astride him , seeking with vicious fingers for Quirl 's eyes . At the same time his men were kicking at the helpless man 's body wherever they could reach him . At the sight of this brutality the other prisoners , forgetting for the moment their own cowed condition , set up such a bedlam of noise that the guard began to look furtively up the passage , and to shout at the ruffians . Suddenly he was whirled aside , and a figure in uniform , moving with uncanny speed for a man so massive , appeared upon the platform and bounded down the ladder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and became a maze of flailing arms and legs . Like ten-pins the pirates scattered , and the giant pulled off the mate . Gore could not see , but as he writhed he knew he was in the grip of the pirate captain . Captain Strom 's harsh , ascetic face was dangerous , and his steely gray eyes compelling . The men managed slovenly salutes . " Gore , " Strom snapped , " have your men get some water and mop up this blood . How many times have I told you to quit mauling the prisoners ? D'ye think I 'm in this business to provide amusement for you ? Henceforth keep out of this hold . Hear ? " " Yes , sir , " Gore muttered sullenly . " Took five of you bums to handle him , did it ? " Strom remarked sardonically , stooping to pick up the unconscious Quirl . He carried him easily , up the ladder . As they disappeared Strom 's voice boomed out : " Dr. Stoddard ! Stoddard ! Messenger , have Stoddard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The mate was wiping the blood off his face with a rag . " I tried to call yer , " the guard whined . " That tears it ! " Gore exclaimed fiercely , bursting into a string of abuse . But one of his henchmen nudged him . " Keep yer tongue in yer face , Gore , till the time comes . " Gore said nothing , but glared savagely at the prisoners . " Get the buckets and mops ! " he snarled at his men , and they fled precipitately . A long , wailing noise came through the hatch : " Soopson ! S-o-o-pson ! " " Here comes yer grub , damn you , " Gore growled at the prisoners in general . A shuffling sound followed the singsong call , and then a " galley boy " of forty years or so , badly crippled by club-feet , shuffled up to the hatch and laboriously let himself down to the platform . The huge bowl of stew he was carrying was far too heavy for him , and his strained , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Sorko ! " Gore bellowed up at him . " Get your swill down here . Some o ' these swine are goin ' short this time , anyway . " Sorko set the big bowl down at the top of the steps and began to descend backward . Then he resumed his burden . But he was nervous , and had barely started when his crippled feet , far too big for his thin shanks , became entangled . He gave a giddy shriek and fell over backward , landing on his back , and lay still . His pale , freckled face became greenish . But the bowl , filled to the brim by its greasy , scalding hot contents , flew in a sweeping parabola , tipping as it fell , so that the entire contents cascaded on Gore , drenching him from head to foot . Howling with rage and pain he danced around . He was utterly beside himself . When he was able to see he rushed for Sorko , who was moaning with returning consciousness , and picked up the frail body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you 're dead ! " * * * * * That voice , so incisive and clear , was a woman 's . Gore found himself looking into the little twin funnels of his own ray projector . They were filled with a milky light , and the odor of ozone was strong . The girl had only to press the trigger and a powerful current would leap along the path of those ionizing beams . And Gore would murder no more . Stupidly , he let Sorko slide to the floor , where the poor fellow recovered sufficiently from his paralyzing fright and his fall to scuttle away . Looking past the menacing weapon , Gore saw the girl , Lenore Hyde . Her limpid eyes under their straight brows were blazing , and he read in them certain death for himself . " Up that ladder ! " she ordered sharply , " and stay out ! Guard , when this beast is gone I will give you this weapon . Now , connect up your skipper . " Too surprised to disobey , the guard threw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face appeared on the screen . He comprehended the situation immediately . " Do as she says , " he ordered brusquely . " Stoddard is coming to take care of that man of hers that Gore beat up . " A few minutes later she was tearfully assisting the ship 's doctor to put the man with the dislocated shoulders on a stretcher . " Your husband ? " asked Stoddard , who resembled a starved gray rat . " My brother , " she exclaimed simply . " Want to take care of him ? " And at her eager assent , he said , " Ca n't afford to let him die . Your family got money ? " " Yes , yes ! They will pay anything -- anything -- to get him back safely . " The doctor grinned with satisfaction . * * * * * Memory returned to Quirl with the realization that he was lying on a metal bunk in an outside stateroom , where he could see the orderly procession of the stars through the floor ports as the ship rotated . His body was racked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation , he discovered , was due to a thick swathing of bandages . As he stirred something moved in an adjoining bunk , and Dr. Stoddard 's peaked face came into view . " How do you feel ? " he asked professionally . " Rotten ! " " We 'll fix that . " He left , returning a few minutes later with a portable apparatus somewhat resembling its progenitor , the diathermy generator . He disposed a number of insulated loops about Quirl 's body and head , connecting them through flexible cables to his machine . As a gentle humming began , Quirl was conscious of an agreeable warmth , of a quickening all over his body . A great lassitude followed , and he slept . When he awoke again Captain Strom was standing beside him . He had taken off his coat , and his powerful body filled the blouse he was wearing . He had evidently just come off duty , for he still had on his blue trousers , with the stripes of gold braid down the sides . " It may interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the chosen , " he remarked casually . " One of the chosen what ? " " The chosen race . You did n't take me for an out-and-out damned pirate , did you ? " " Excuse me if I seem dumb ! " Quirl hoisted himself on his elbow . " Yes , I figure you 're a pirate . What else ? " * * * * * Strom 's stern face relaxed in a smile . It was a strange smile , inscrutably melancholy . It revealed , beneath the hardness of a warrior , something else ; the idealism of a poet . When he spoke again it was with a strange gentleness : " To attain one 's end , one must make use of many means , and sometimes to disguise one 's purpose . For instance , it is perfectly proper for an officer of the I.F.P. to disguise himself like a son of the idle rich in order to lay the infamous ' Scourge ' by the heels , is n't it ? " Quirl felt himself redden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that Strom was a zealot , and he knew he would not hesitate to kill . This prompt penetration of his disguise was something he had not bargained for . " What makes you think , " he asked shortly , " that I 'm an I.F.P. man ? " " The fight you gave Gore and his men . Do you expect me to think that a coupon clipper could have done that ? I know the way of --  " He checked himself . Quirl said : " My people have money . I do n't know what you mean about --  " " Oh , yes , you do , " Strom interrupted . " If you were what you claim to be perhaps I would let you go for the ransom , though you took my eye from the first . " " The ransom will be paid . " " It will not . You will be one of those who do not return . There is only one price I will accept from you . " " Yes ? What is that ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know the I.F.P. secrets . I told you that . " " You know how to operate the ray . All its men do . I want you to tell me what you know . I can deduce the rest . " * * * * * Quirl thought rapidly . Strom was right . The I.F.P. had developed a new ray that was far superior to the ionizer ray , for the latter required an atmosphere of some kind for its operation , while the new one would work equally well in a vacuum . " I never heard of any , " he lied stubbornly . " Anyway , what do you want a ray for ? Your guns , with no gravity to interfere and no air to stop the bullets , have just about unlimited range , have n't they ? " " Spoken like a soldier ! " Again Strom permitted himself a brief triumphant smile . " And we have the further advantage of invisibility . The ship is surrounded by a net of wires that create a field of force which bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never caught us . But to get back to our subject . I will tell you something . Do you know who I am ? " Quirl looked at him . Strom appeared to be at least sixty years old . But the fine , erect figure , the rugged features told nothing . " Did you ever hear of Lieutenant Burroughs ? " Strom asked casually . " Burroughs -- the man without a planet ! " Quirl ejaculated . " Are you Burroughs , the traitor ? " Immediately he regretted his heedlessness . Strom 's face darkened in anger , and for a moment the pirate captain did not reply . When he did he was a little calmer . " Traitor they called me ! " he exclaimed vehemently . " I a traitor -- the most loyal man in the solar system guard . Surrounded by rottenness and intrigue --  " But you would n't know . You were but a lad learning to fly your first toy helics when that happened . Years later the Martian Cabal was exposed , and the leading plotters -- the traitors -- were punished . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree against me had been carried out . I , the unsuspecting messenger , the loyal , eager dupe , was made the cat's-paw . I was put on an old , condemned freighter , with food and supplies supposed to last me a lifetime , but with no power capsules and no means of steering the ship . I was set adrift in a derelict on a lonely orbit of exile around the sun -- the man without a planet ! * * * * * " Picture that , lad . That rusty , dead old cylinder , coursing around and around the sun , and inside , sitting on his bales and boxes , a young man like you . A young man in the pride and prime of his life , expiating the treason that had betrayed him . Day after day , through the thick ports , I saw the same changeless scene . And every two years , when I drew near the Earth , I watched the beautiful green ball of it , with what bitter longings ! As I watched it dwindle away again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , selfish , stupid and cruel beings who lived on it , and hated them . They had banished me , an innocent man , to whirl forever and ever around the sun , in my steel tomb ! " But that cruel judgment was never executed . Seven years ago this Gore found me . He is an escaped convict , and he came in a little five-man rocket he had stolen . We loaded up all of the supplies the little ship would hold , for Gore had no food , and escaped to Titan , landing on an island on the side opposite to where the mines are . " Gore wanted to become a pirate , and as he could get men , I consented . He scraped them up , fugitives from justice , every one of them . We built this ship , and I invented the invisibility field of force --  " " Just a moment , " Quirl interrupted , vastly interested . " I saw your ship through the ports that day . " " True . The presence of your ship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at all other times -- right now -- we are utterly invisible . One of the I.F.P. patrols may pass within a mile of us and never see us . " As we raided the interplanetary commerce , I began to weed out the people we captured . Those that showed the highest intelligence , sense of justice and physical perfection I selected to be the nucleus of a new race , to be kept on Titan for a time and then to be transplanted to a new planet of one of the nearer solar systems . " My principal trouble is with the crew . They can collect ransom only on those I reject , and there are constant clashes between me and Gore . It is now my intention to let them go their way , and to fit out a new ship , with a new crew . I offer you the place of first mate . " " No ! " Quirl replied crisply . " You say you understand the honor of the Force , and then offer me a job pirating with you . No , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burroughs , made no attempt to conceal his disappointment . The recital of his wrongs had brought out the bitter lines of his face , and the weariness of one who plays his game alone and can call no one friend . " I should have known better , " he said quietly . " There was none more loyal to the I.F.P. than I -- when I still belonged to it . Yet , I thought if I laid all my cards before you -- You realize what this means ? " " Yes , " Quirl replied soberly . " It means you will never dare to let me be ransomed nor to free me among your selected people . It means -- death ! " " Not death ! I will parole you . " Quirl felt an overmastering surge of sympathy . He saw this pirate as later historians have come to see him -- a man of lofty and noble purpose who was made the victim of shrewder , meaner minds in the most despicable interplanetary imbroglio ever to disgrace a solar system . The thought of his own fate , should he refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of heaping more disappointment on this deeply wronged " man without a planet . " " Captain , " he said slowly , with deep regret . " You remember the I.F.P. oath ? " And at the other 's flush he hurried on . " Knowing that oath you know what my answer must be . Put me in irons or kill me ! " " I know , " Strom added wistfully . " Would you -- if I could just once more shake the clean hand of a brave man and a gentleman --  " Quirl 's hand shot out and gripped the long , powerful fingers of the pirate captain . * * * * * Quirl was willing to compromise to the extent of not revealing anything to the other passengers , for the privilege of being kept in the prison hold rather than in solitary confinement . Here he would be under the vigilant eye of a guard , with possibly less chance of effecting an escape in some way , but he felt a great desire to be near the girl Lenore , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fastened him by means of a light chain and hoop that locked around his waist to a staple set in the floor near one wall . The other prisoners regarded him as a hero , for since the day of the epic fight the mate had kept away , and they had been treated with tolerable decency . Quirl was able to cheer them up with predictions that the most of them would be eligible to ransom . But as he looked at the pale beauty of Lenore he felt grave misgivings , for he knew that a man of Strom 's discernment would want her for his projected Utopia without question . She did not speak to him while the hero-worshipping crowd were fluttering about him to their heart 's content . When they finally left him alone she came up to him silently , and sat on the floor beside him . " I want to thank you , " she said quietly , clearly , " for what you did for me and my brother , Mr. --  " " Finner . Quirl Finner . I have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long has it been since they took me out ? You see --  " he grinned , " I was asleep . " " Five days . At least , they turned off the lights five times for the sleeping periods . " " The man who fought for you -- how is he ? " " My brother -- is dead ! " Quirl looked away so that he should not see the quick tears springing to her eyes . But a few moments later he felt her cool hand on his scarred forehead , and she was smiling bravely . " Tragedies such as these , Quirl , were common in the lives of our ancestors . They were able to bear them , and we can bear them . All his life my poor brother has lived as a gentleman , sheltered , protected by class barriers . When he died of pneumonia caused by the jagged end of a broken rib -- so Dr. Stoddard says -- I think he had a lively sense of satisfaction that he should end in such a way . If it had not been for me --  " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , to sit quietly by his side , and to bring his food to him from the big community bowl which even the most fastidious of the prisoners had come to look forward to . She told of her life as the daughter of a capitalist who owned large mine holdings on Titan . It would be about time for the Celestia to reach Titan , and her non-arrival would be causing anxiety to Lenore 's father awaiting her there . The void would be swarming with I.F.P. patrols , but as the pirate ship was invisible nothing would be found but the mysteriously looted and abandoned Celestia . There was no longer any reason for concealing from her the fact that he himself was a member of the I.F.P. , and Quirl told Lenore of the adventurous life he and his companions had led . Of forays to far-away and as yet undisciplined Pluto , of tropical Venus and Mercury , where the rains never cease , of the hostile and almost unknown planet of Aryl , within the orbit of Mercury , where no man has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupendous and never-ending mirages . As time passed they were drawn together by the bonds of propinquity and mutual interest -- this obscure police officer and the daughter of one of the most powerful men in the solar system . But Quirl did not name his love , for always there was the grim present of their captivity , the ghastly uncertainty of the future . The little " galley boy " Sorko seemed daily more frail . Apparently the fall he had sustained had done him some internal injury . Often the guard , with many a ribald comment , had to help him get his emptied bowl back up the ladder . * * * * * One day he seemed overcome by great weakness . Staggering , he held his hand to his sweat-dewed forehead . Erratically he waltzed across the floor , to crumple in a heap where Quirl and the girl were sitting . Moved by compassion , Lenore composed his body in a more comfortable position , and with a bit of handkerchief moistened the pirate 's wrinkled , old-young face with some of Quirl 's drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Quirl shouted . " He 's going to die . Come and take him to the lazaret . " " Sez you ! " returned the guard callously . " Me , I stay on post till relieved . Sorko 'll be all right . He 's been throwin ' them fits right regular . " Sorko 's lips moved feebly , and Lenore bent down to catch his words . They were barely audible : " I 'm all right , lady . You done me a good turn when you made Gore put me down , and I 'm doin ' you one now . I would n't do this for no one else . " He gasped . " Water ! " Lenore exclaimed sharply , and Quirl handed her the rest of his cup . " Ai n't water he wants , " the amused guard observed . " The blighter 's playin ' for a good chew of merclite ! " 1 Footnote 1 : Merclite , a highly stimulating gum . It was prohibited by interplanetary proclamation , but was always obtainable through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't as bad as I 'm makin ' out , " Sorko whispered . " Got to do it to tell you this , ' cause you was square with me . Gore is fixin ' to have a mut'ny . Kill captain , kill all these dubs here -- this guy of yourn , too . He wants to take you for his --  " the weazened little face twisted in unwonted shy delicacy --  " take you for him , pretty lady . I do n't want him to . I 'm not -- a -- bad feller --  " " What the hell , Sorko ! " the puzzled guard exclaimed over the delay . " You bandy-legged rat , get up there , or I 'll give you a jolt . " Lenore looked up , indignant . " You heartless wretch ! Would you let this man --  " " Comin ' ! " Sorko scrambling to his feet , shuffling to the table , where he retrieved his bowl . Quirl and Lenore watched his painful progress up the ladder , until at last he disappeared into the passage . " Quirl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " take this . " He felt a small bit of metal , and looking at it cautiously , saw that he had a rough key , filed out of a piece of flat metal . " The key to that hoop around your waist . He copied it from the one the captain has , I suppose . " * * * * * His hopes high all at once , Quirl sought the compact little lock in the small of his back . It took a long time to get the key in , and then it would not turn . It had been unskillfully made , and was probably not a true reproduction . Nevertheless , by constant effort , he succeeded at last in turning it , and was rewarded by hearing a faint click . He tested the hoop , felt it slip , and knew that at any time he chose he could free himself . " Lenore , dear , " he told her . " Go with the other women now . We must do nothing to make the guard suspicious . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we are close to Saturn now ; it ca n't be long . Go now . " " Good-by , dear . Be careful ! " It seemed an eternity until the emanation disk became dim and went out and the prisoners made sleepy sounds . A relief guard took station , and the ship became silent , so that one could hear the rumbling of the propelling rockets . As there were no ports in this hold , there was no light whatever except the faint glow that came from the central passage above the platform . Against this the pirate was outlined as he sat on his stool . As Quirl 's eyes became accustomed to the darkness he could see the play of faint highlights on his muscular torso , and so he waited . He thought over the situation . The safest and easiest course would be to create such a disturbance that Captain Strom would be attracted to the scene . This would probably not involve anything more than a severe beating for himself , and he would then find opportunity to acquaint Strom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to deal with it he never doubted . Lenore might then still be forcibly impressed as a citizen of Strom 's new planet , but at least she would not be exposed to the infinitely worse fate of becoming the plaything of Gore and his villainous crew . * * * * * The flaw of this plan was that Quirl himself would still be under practical sentence of death . Strom would not let his gratitude carry him so far as to release a man who knew as much as Quirl did , and who would not promise to keep his secrets . The preferable , though far more dangerous course was to strike before the mutineers could . Quirl knew something about the structure of the ship . It was built around the tubular passage , and every hold or group of rooms opened on this well , from the bow where the navigators were to the stern where the rockets were located . Somewhere there would be a generating room where the invisibility field was being produced . If he could find this and wreck the generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space doubtless swarmed , would sight them , and after that everything was in the hands of fate . Quirl nervously waited for the guard to nod . At any moment he expected to hear a hellish bedlam break loose -- the beginning of the mutiny . And the guard seemed alert . There was nothing to do but take a chance . Quirl sighed as if he were turning in his sleep , so that the clink of the released chain would not seem out of place . The guard did not stir . Slowly , very slowly , Quirl crept across the floor . He had been robbed of all his clothing except his torn silk trousers ; and his boots were gone , so he was able to move as quietly as a cat . With tense silence he ascended the ladder , praying that his weight would not send up a warning vibration . But his luck held . He was nearly at the top before it broke . " Take him off ! Take him off ! " It was an eery , strangled shriek from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a startled curse the guard thudded to his feet , peered tensely into the darkness , his weapon sending twin milky beams of the powerful ionizing ray toward the source of the sound . * * * * * The dreamer had awakened , still gasping in the grip of fear , and other disturbed sleepers were grumbling . " Better go easy , you fools , " the pirate warned them . " Yer just in luck that I did n't let loose a couple bolts on ye . Got a good notion to do it , anyway . " He played the dangerous little spots of light around , amused as the prisoners scrambled for safety , but with no real intention of releasing the deadly electric charge along the paths provided for it . This cruel pleasure cost him his life . As he turned his back Quirl leaped . His iron-hard forearm rose and fell , and the edge of his hand came down on the back of the pirate 's thick neck . There was a muffled crack and he slumped to the platform grating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buckled it around his own naked chest . The electrogun had been uninjured , and hooked to the belt was also the riot club , a truly appalling thing at close quarters . Quirl carried the body down , laid it prone in the corner he had occupied , snapped on the waistlock , and threw a ragged old blanket over the hairy legs . In the forthcoming disturbance , if anyone looked in , he would think the inert form a sleeping prisoner , and that the guard had deserted post . Quirl had feared an outbreak among the prisoners , but they were so apathetic that they paid little attention . Perhaps they thought it was Quirl who had been killed , and he did not dare even a whispered farewell to the girl he knew was watching somewhere in the darkness . Much to Quirl 's delight , the long , tubular passage was deserted . Here the centrifugal gravity was less than it had been in the hold . A weird place , this central tube , where every direction was down , and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls with equal facility . No top nor bottom -- just a long , smooth tube with numerous enigmatic doors leading to -- where ? At least it was easy to tell where the bow of the ship was . A light shone through a transom over the door to the navigating room . Should he try to hold up the navigating officer ? He decided against that . There would be at least three men in there , and it was the custom to keep those quarters locked . " If only I knew where they generate the invisibility field ! " he muttered , as he stood irresolute. * * * * * Opportunity came at that moment . A crack of light appeared along the passage . A door was opening there . A moment later a head and shoulders showed . Someone was climbing up . Swiftly the officer ran to the place . The pirate did not even suspect anything wrong until he felt the spots of milky light on his face . He showed his terror plainly . " Get up ! " Quirl hissed . The man obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bunks , evidently one of the crew 's dormitories . He now turned to the cowering pirate . " I 'd as soon kill you as not ! " Quirl snarled . " You got me wrong , brother ! " the pirate whined . " I 'm with Gore in this deal . Lay off ! " " Where you bound for ? " " I have to relieve Burke at the ventilating turbines . " " Let Burke wait . Lead on to the invisibility generators . " " Oh , I ca n't do that , mister ! I got to have a pass . Say , mister , I was just kidding about being one of Gore 's men . I 'm for the cap'n , yes , sir ! " " You lying scum ! " Quirl barked impatiently . " Get going ! " The white-faced and bewildered pirate led the way down the tube to the after end . He unlatched a door and tried to enter , but as soon as he had dropped through to the platform he was met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he started to explain . But Quirl dropped after him and gave him a powerful shove , so that he crashed into the guard . The latter pulled the trigger , and the unfortunate pirate crashed over the platform 's edge to the floor . Quirl had out his own electrogun and dispatched the guard . At the same time he felt a stunning shock . His senses reeled , but the grating had taken part of the discharge loosed by a pirate electrician at the foot of the ladder . Quirl threw his riot club and followed that up with another lightning bolt . * * * * * He was then the only living person in the room , in which two generators hummed softly . Connected to them was a bank of U-shaped tubes , each as tall as a man , which were filled with silent livid fire . Quirl picked up a wrench and started hammering at the thick tubes until the glass cracked . Each time he was engulfed by a wave of heat , and the tube became black . The great generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain now that the pirate ship would be visible , but the position of the captives was still desperate . He hoped that none of the surviving pirates would think of calling at the generator room , or find out in some other way that they were now visible in the eternal day of space . Quietly he climbed back to the passage and closed the hatch . He cast about for his next move . He was looking toward the bow , but on hearing the subdued clink of metal on metal , he turned . A dozen of the pirates were coming toward him . It would have been useless to draw his weapon . Theirs were out and could have burned him to a crisp before he could move . Silently and with deadliness apparent in every move they approached him . " Hope they try to capture me alive ! " he thought . " What a dog-fight that 'll be ! " Now they were nearly up to him . " Come along , you fool ! " barked the leader of the group as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the whole game away . " Quirl could have laughed . This was evidently part of the mutineers ' crew bent on their errand of murder . In the dim light they had taken him for one of their number . He went with them , meekly . " Unlocked ! " The leader whom Quirl had not seen before , exclaimed with satisfaction . He pulled the hatch open softly and the hinges had been oiled . Quietly as panthers they descended the ladder . They stood at the bottom . Still another door barred the way . Quirl now realized that they were attacking the captain 's quarters . But the leader produced a key , and silently swung the door open . " So , you dogs ! You 've come ! " * * * * * Like an infuriated bull Captain Strom charged them , a riot club in each hand . He could have killed them all with a ray , but he chose to vent in physical action his consuming anger at their treachery , which he had in some way anticipated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others sought shelter behind tables and chests , and began stabbing at him with their electroguns . Electricity crackled , and the air became pungent with ozone . A pair of the twin rays struck the captain 's gold braid , and he went down . With a triumphant yell a man dashed at him , murderous club up-raised . But Quirl was faster , and the pirate fell dead with a crushed skull . Strom was up again , fighting beside Quirl . The pirates remaining fell under their furious blows , and the two dashed out . Strom said nothing , and Quirl was not sure that he had been recognized . The captain charged straight for the navigating bow . Here , unless he should be attacked by the I.F.P. he could still control the situation . He was perhaps still ignorant of the ship 's visibility . But Quirl made for the prisoners ' hold . They would be cowering there , probably in darkness , not knowing what was going on . It was his intention to rally them , provide them with the weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to advantageously make terms with whoever was victorious in this battle . He saw , as he approached that the light was on . He was hardly a dozen feet away when the door was darkened . Quirl did not have to hear her cry to know that Gore had Lenore. * * * * * Running with remarkable speed , the mate carried his prize toward the after end of the tube . A hatch stood open there , and he dropped through , slamming it after him . Quirl picked up a bar that someone had dropped . It was but a matter of moments to break the lock and pull open the hatch . The hold was lighted , and empty . In its middle , holding the helpless Lenore , stood Gore , the electrogun in his hand covering the platform . " Boy scout to the rescue again ! " Gore sneered . He was even more repulsive than before , with the marks Quirl had left on him in the last battle . But he was fearless and utterly reckless . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a fellow 's done he do n't care what happens . So here 's the lay : When I get out of here , I 'll be dead . And she 'll be dead , or you 'll wish she was . Get it ? She 'll be killed , too , if you jolt me -- the shock 'll pass to her . And the first man-jack who crosses that grating 'll get his from me . Now then , go ahead and pull ! Goin ' to kill us both , or leave her to me ? " He laughed defiantly , like one who counts himself already dead . Quirl tentatively placed one foot on the platform . Instantly a fat spark jumped from the metal to his foot , and sent him sprawling into the tube . He saw Strom coming toward him . He had killed his enemies in the control room and was now on the hunt for more . " Thanks for what you did , " he grunted . As a forlorn hope , Quirl explained the situation . Strom smiled a rare smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildly . " Quirl , you 're a square man , and I 'd rather do something for a square enemy than a false friend . Oh , I can do it cheaply . The jig 's up for me , anyway ! " Quickly he dropped through the door and launched himself . Gore saw him coming , and Strom 's body shuddered as the bolt struck squarely . He was dead when he hit , but his great weight knocked Gore down . * * * * * Quirl had time to jump after him , knocking the wind out of Gore before he could rise . Lenore picked up Gore 's weapon , but dared not use it for fear of injuring her lover . As the two fighting men circled warily , seeking openings in this battle that must be fatal to one of them , they did not see the slight , shadowy figure that dropped down to them . There was a flash , and Gore slumped , a knife in his back . " I done it ! I done for him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , Lenore , let 's get up to the bow before the pirates think of it . " They dashed up the ladder . Some more of the disks were out , and it was nearly dark . Three sinewy forms pounced on Quirl the moment he entered the passage . The girl , too , was caught , though she fought and bit . " Lights ! Let 's have some lights ! " commanded an authoritative voice . " Coming , sir ! " came a far-away answer . The passage became bright , and Quirl looked into the faces of his captors , in the uniforms of the I.F.P. " Got you , you dirty pirate ! " gloated the husky young man on his chest . " Mike ! " Quirl gasped , " do n't you know me ? How 'd you get here ? " " Dog-gone ! Finner ! Leggo his legs , you eggs . " " Trailed you , " he added . " Glommed our magnets on the navigating bow . Expected a fight , but some big guy let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done plenty of scrapping -- all the clothes torn off him . Half a dozen dead pirates in there . Who is he ? " Quirl thought of the stiffening body of Lieutenant Burroughs , alias Captain Strom , who had just purchased his life and that of Lenore at the cost of his own . Was his undeserved shame now to follow him to his grave ? Quirl was no lawyer , and he decided not to take any chances with the law 's mercy . He said : " I do n't know his name . A prisoner from some other ship , I think . He was very homesick for Earth , and I 'll see he gets a decent grave on Earth . He died to save me . " " As for the lady , " he added , " let her go . She 's a captive . And , anyway , I think she is the future Mrs. Quirl Finner . " She smiled , and the men of the Force looked somewhat enviously at Quirl . " Say , " Quirl said , taking Lenore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if you find a little monkey-faced guy down in that hold , go easy with him . He 's a good man , too , and I 'm going to recommend his pardon . " * * * * *
