At his desk in Washington last week Executive Secretary Joseph Green of the State Department 's National Munitions Control Board signed a license for the shipment to Germany of 2,000,000 cu . ft. of helium for Nazi dirigibles ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) . For making the first break in the U. S. Government 's virtual monopoly of the world supply , the Board forestalled anti-Nazi criticism by explaining : 1 ) that U. S. stores are adequate for several hundred years ; 2 ) that the U. S. could not morally prevent the distribution of a gas with important laboratory and medical uses ( notably in oxygen tents ) ; 3 ) that for the 17,900,000 cu . ft . Germany will receive in 1938 there will be a formal quid pro quo-two naval observers will ride on each German Zeppelin using the gas , thus get valuable training in lighter-than-air navigation which the U. S. , with all its big dirigibles wrecked or grounded , no longer provides .                 @ @ @ @
