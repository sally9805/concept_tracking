The Wizard of Oz ( M. G. M. ) should settle an old Hollywood controversy : whether fantasy can be presented on the screen as successfully with human actors as with cartoons . It can . As long as The Wizard of Oz sticks to whimsey and magic , it floats in the same rare atmosphere of enchantment that distinguished Walt Disney 's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . When it descends to earth it collapses like a scarecrow in a cloudburst . <P> Producer Mervyn Le Roy 's 1939 version of this childhood classic follows with reasonable accuracy L. Frank Baum 's original story ( first published in 1900 ) that sold over a million copies , his stage adaptation that ran 18 months on Broadway with Fred Stone. * Dorothy ( Judy Garland ) gets blown away in a twister from her home in Kansas , finds herself in the Technicolor land of Oz . Homesick , she goes in search of the Wizard of Oz to ask him how to get back to Kansas . Along the way she meets a Straw Man ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a Cowardly Lion ( Bert Lahr ) . They too want to see the Wizard . The Straw Man seeks a brain , the Woodman a heart , the Cowardly Lion , courage . <P> Secret of the Wizard of Oz is that there is no such person : there is only Professor Marvel ( Frank Morgan ) , a kindly , bungling old carnival seer . But the resourceful Professor has a bit of homely chicanery for each of his applicants , gives them all what they desire . No children 's tale is Hollywood 's Wizard of Oz . Lavish in sets , adult in humor , it is a Broadway spectacle translated into make-believe . Most of its entertainment comes from the polished work ( aided by Jack Dawn 's expert makeup ) of seasoned Troupers Lahr , Bolger and Haley . <P> Metro put $3,000,000 into The Wizard of Oz , left out only the kitchen stove . Its tornado rivals Sam Goldwyn 's The Hurricane . Its final sequence is as sentimental as Little Women . Its Singer Midgets , most publicized of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bored , sophisticated air of slightly evil children . <P> The Old Maid ( Warner Bros. ) is a drama of anonymous mother love , circa 1861-80 , outwardly as dated and dusty as a daguerreotype . To bring Edith Wharton 's old-fashioned story to life on Broadway four years ago required the highly finished services of Actresses Judith Anderson and Helen Menken , oldtime Playwright Zo Akins . To make it live on the screen , Warner Bros , teamed their pop-eyed Bernhardt , Bette Davis , with an equally fiery filly from off the home lot , honey-haired Miriam Hopkins . The result flounces its skirts a little more boldly than the stage show but , like it , is hardly more than the sum total of two good , sometimes brilliant , performances .
