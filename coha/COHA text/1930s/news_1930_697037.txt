txt New York State 's hospitals are institutions for the care of the insane . The bill just passed at Albany under an emergency message from Governor ROOSEVELT appropriates the sum of $18,300,000 for , the estimated addition of 6,000 beds . The emergency message was necessary , because it was a case of anticipating action on the executive budget and not because there was opposition from any source to be overcome . The state of affairs revealed in the course of Lieut . Gov . LEHMAN 'S tour of inspection last Summer was enough to sweep aside doubts of the need for immediate relief . The need for a special session of the Legislature was removed by the action of the party leaders in unofficially authorizing the Governor to proceed with the preparation of plans for hospital extension on the assurance that the appropriations would be forthcoming . This promise has now been redeemed . When the 6,000 new beds have been provided , the State will be sheltering very close to 60,000 patients in its institutions for the mentally sick . In 1928 the patients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional 1,750 . Counting patients iii private institutions , the total number of insane was close to 52,500 . The rapid upward swing during the last twenty years is a matter of common knowledge and concern . In 1910 the number of non-criminal patients in the State hospitals was about 22,000 ; it went up to nearly 38,000 in 1920 . In that year the State expenditure was about $13 , - 000,000 . In 1927 , counting maintenance and additions , it was $25,500 , - 000 . The percentage Of aliens , a much-discussed factor in the problem , declined from 27 per cent in 1918 to 24 per cent in 1927 . At the same time the insanity ratio for the population of the State as a whole has been steadily mounting . It rose from 358 per 100,000 in 1910 to 390 in 1920 and to 450 in 1928 . This would indicate that the strain of modern life takes at least as heavy a toll from the children of the foreign born as from their parents , in whose case dislocation and the new environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our new immigration policies were established much was heard of the hardships worked upon the taxpayer by the large proportion of alien insane in our institutions . The fact that so little is now heard of the argument is not to be explained entirely by the removal of immigration from controversy . In the long run it is not in the American temperament to grumble at an existing state of things , but to turn in and help . Thus at the present moment , while the State is setting out to spend nearly $20,000,000 on new housing for its mental unfortunates , New York City announces a program of hospitalization for the physically ill , to cost some $60,000 , - 000 . At the same time the members of the United Hospital Fund point to a program , completed , under way or projected , of $50,000,000 . Even then , according to a recent estimate of the Welfare Counci.l of New York City , we have only about 40 per cent of the needed tuberculosis accommodations , enough cancer beds for only the most acute cases , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half the needed accommodations for general convalescence cases .
