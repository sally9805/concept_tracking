Came last week the first Italian radio broadcast to the U. S. , and the first broadcast by Signore Benito Mussolini in English - a language he learned on a promise. * <P> " LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ! " - so loud , so clear , so utterly without a trace of accent were the Dictator 's opening words that thousands of Americans jumped , marveled . <P> Accent came with the next words . Try ' as he might Il Duce could not keep up the pace he had set with " ladies and gentlemen . " His Italian larynx clipped " people " first to " peepl " and finally to " peep . " His " the " gradually became " t . " <P> Frenchmen were listening in , listening hard . To them the speech was far more important than to Americans . Italy is their potential enemy and vice versa . Next day the entire Paris press betrayed profound relief at the quiet tone of Il Ditce 's speech , the solemn , personal nature of his long keynote : <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day I should like to contradict the many rumors spread abroad about Fascism and the danger it is supposed to represent for the peace of the world . Such accusations are groundless . Neither I nor my government nor the Italian people desire to bring about a war . <P> " I fought in the War as a soldier in the ranks . I know what war means . Terrible memories of those years when whole generations of the youth of so many countries were laid low by the hail of lead have not been canceled from my mind . I myself was seriously wounded . In the years that have since elapsed and at the present time , both as man and as head of the government , I have had before me a panorama of political , economic and moral consequences of the War , and not in Italy alone . <P> " How can anyone suppose that with this two-fold experience I would consider with anything but horror the prospect of another war ? Even if it were to arise between two countries only , a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be endangered . New discoveries of science would make a future war even more dreadful than the last . The danger of death would not be reserved for fighters , but whole populations would be imperiled without the possibility of effective protection . <P> " Italy - let me repeat it - will never take the initiative of starting a war . Italy needs peace ; Fascism desires to secure for the Italian people in co-operation with all other peoples of the world a future of prosperity and peace . " <P> Friendship , Progress , Prosperity . Before preparing his speech to U. S. citizens 77 Duce studied carefully recent radio speeches made by Herbert Hoover . As a knowing Roman official put the matter last week , " His Excellency was careful not to talk explosively , like your Al Smith . " <P> Points from Benito Mussolini 's speech in Herbert Hoover 's vein : <P> Friendship : " The friendship felt in Italy for the United States has its roots in history . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
