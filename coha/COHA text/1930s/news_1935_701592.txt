txt Graham Land means less to one who is not a geographer than Iceland did to the Vatican before COLUMBUS sailed on his historic voyage . For there was even then a Catholic Bishop of Iceland , whereas Graham Land is the name of a desolate Antarctic island of interest only to a few whalers . Why , then , did LINCOLN ELLSWORTH and his pilot , HERBERT HOLLOCK-KENYON , risk their lives in attempting to skirt the blizzard-swept chain of islands of which Graham Land is one in a flight to Ross Sea , a distance of over 1,400 miles ? Graham Land is so obviously a continuation of South America that geographers call its lofty mountain ranges the " Antarctic Andes . " What becomes of these Andes ? On the opposite side of the Pole lie New Zealand , Tasmania and Australia . But their ranges bear no resemblance to those of South America . Hence the great geographic problem of Antarctica is the relation of South America to the land that lies beyond the Pole . Are there perhaps two Antarctic continents , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ScoTT 's last Antarctic expedition , has suggested  --  two continents separated by seas and archipelagos ? Or do the Andes melt away into the Australian plateau ? Thus regarded , ELLSWORTH 'S flight is seen in its true light of a scientific expedition of first-rate importance . It would be rash to draw conclusions from his dispatch in yesterday 's NEW YORK TIMES . Yet he more than faintly confirms the long-held theory that the mountains of Graham Land as well as the new peaks discovered in the region of Hearst Land in the Antarctic Archipelago are indeed part of the Andes . For the moment these purely scientific questions are eclipsed by the human aspects of Dr. ELLSWORTH 'S adventure . There are what Admiral BYRD has called " the eternal fog and cloudiness " and the gales and other vagaries of Antarctic weather . " Where " we need a clean stretch of only 400 " miles or so , they ELLswoRTH and " BALCHEH3 need clear weather be " tween two hemispheres , " wrote Admiral BYRD of the similar attempt that came to naught nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them if they come down in the interior , " he added , thereby leaving us to conjure up an image of jagged ice and a snowy wilderness , with a base so far distant that certain death awaited the men who tried to traverse it on foot . Only eight years ago Dr. R. N. RUDMOSE-BROWN , an authority on Antarctica , while admitting the value of the airplane for surveying the region around the South Pole , rightly stressed the need of a ground organization , in an address delivered before the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Leeds . Since then the engineers have made astonishing progress . Because of their marvelous engines , it is not ground organization but storms that stand in the explorer 's I way . And even storms have lost some I of their terror . It was not so much the icy blast that drove ELLSWORTH back as the clouds . An explorer must see . And because he could no longer see , ELLSWORTH returned . If he decides that another attempt will be futile , geographers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that he has thrown on their problems .
