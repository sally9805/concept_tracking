T HE first time I heard Wrack 's and Ruin 's bells I thought it the singing of the teakettle , the sound was so high and clear , so thin and far away . But it drew near rapidly . I was sitting on the corner of the wood-box , watching Swartwout , the camp cook , peeling potatoes for the next day . It was already past my bedtime . The day crew had long since gone to the bunk-house . Through the still , cold night air ? it was close to thirty below outdoors ? we could hear the intermittent whine of the saw , the accompanying thunder of the exhaust , the steady burring snarl of the planer , and , now and then , the screech of the trimmer as the fireman cut slabs for the engine . The mill was close to a quarter of a mile west , and there were barns and haystacks and a good stand of timber in between . The timber was still with winter stillness . If the mill had not been running I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills above Battle Lake two miles to the south . Sitting there in the kitchen on the corner of the wood-box , I was well aware of the stillness of the timber . To the north it stretched away toward the plains of the Peace River country , and west to the foothills of the Rockies . South more than a hundred miles was Calgary , and east over forty miles was Wetaskiwin . East was our only way out . East , somewhere , hundreds of miles , the Battle River struck the Saskatchewan . Though I was only eleven , there was never a waking moment , day or night , when I was not aware of the bigness of the timber . I liked to stay in the cook-shack and watch Swartwout . He had a dueling scar on one cheek . He said , shaking his head , " The man who made that scar sleeps under a tree . " He told me of student days in Germany . Besides his shift in the Landsturm , he had been in the Imperial army . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage-coach driver in Kansas . For all his fat , he was a romantic person in my eleven-year-old judgment . The price I paid for being allowed to stay in the kitchen was to crawl into the potato-hole under the dining-room floor and claw out potatoes each night for the next day 's meals for the thirty men in our little camp . The hole was dark . Some of the potatoes were rotten . I loathed it . This evening I had got through in good time . There was still a hot fire in the stove , for Swartwout was baking bread . The flour sack he had tacked over the open window beside the stove to get ventilation without a freezing draft was motionless . The teakettle was on the back of the stove . He had just filled it with water which still had chips of ice in it . Much to my astonishment , it began to sing . I leaned forward and stared at it for several moments before the truth dawned on me . It was n't the kettle . It was sleigh-bells.  |p484  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bit , wooden latch so hard that it flipped clean over , yanked the door open ? it was always frosted tight in such cold weather ? and ran outdoors . I was barely in time . Some team was coming in along the trail from the southeast . I knew the bells of all the teams in the bush . These were strange . They came faster than any others I had ever heard . I was barely out on the path before I jumped back onto the step . The team shot round the corner of the house , across the yard , through the gate , and down to the barn , the bells ringing madly , steam pouring behind them in a cloud , their swift feet sounding on the glare ice of the path . Lanterns came out from the barn where the skinners were bedding down their teams . I could hear voices and see the team rearing and plunging darkly about . Then I recognized my brother 's voice . Shivering with excitement as much as chill , I ran back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got a new team . They 're white . " I was at the door when my brother came in . He drew off his mittens and his gauntlet gloves , caught me by the arms and swung me up over his shoulder , rubbed the frost off his eyebrows against my cheek , set me down , and said : " Well , Tommy , I have got a new team . " " What are their names ? " I cried . He took my place on the wood-box while I started working with the lacings of his shoe-packs . He slapped his gloves against his leg . They were new , of yellow leather , with red stars and fringe on the gauntlets . He smiled . " Wrack and Ruin . " Mother had come in . At those names she sighed . She , too , must have heard the bells come through the timber so madly . " I hope you have n't got some more wild horses , " she said . Joyce was an excellent horseman , fond of too spirited horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yep , " he said , full of a horseman 's pride on making a good buy . " They have been standing in the livery stable with their harness on for three weeks . There was not a man in town with nerve enough to go in and take it off . " " And so you had to , I suppose , " Mother chided . " They have still got it on . But I am going to go out and take it off of them as soon as my fingers limber up . " It was then I realized that it was really his hands he had been slapping and working as much as his gloves . " Came out from town in five hours . That is nine miles an hour . Had all four traces down most of the way . " Swartwout said supper was ready . I tagged Joyce to the table . I knew that it was forty-four miles to town , that all four traces down meant the weight of the sled had been on the lines all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then one second 's slack on the lines means the tongue down too , and the driver over the dash-board , trying to stop a sharp-shod team on an ice trail . I must have gone to sleep while Joyce was eating , for it was long past my bedtime , though I remember one of the other men coming in to rub Joyce 's arms and shoulders , and that Joyce said he had driven Ruin to a single cutter thirty miles during the day , and the team the forty-four miles home that evening , which made seventy-four miles that day for Ruin . The first thing in the morning I exacted a promise from Joyce to bring the team to the house to let me see them by day ? I was forbidden to go near the barns ? and I scratched a hole in the frost on the dining-room window and waited patiently . Presently I  |p485  saw the team led out of the barn , though there were so many men about that I could see little of them , except their tossing heads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . Then the men leaped away , the horses came toward the house , their manes and feet flashing . I ran outside . It had taken four men to hitch them , but Joyce , with scarcely a word , pulled them down in front of the house . I experienced a moment 's disappointment . I had thought them white , they had been so covered with frost the night before . They were not white , but a dark brown , not quite black . They were not beautiful . They were something far more interesting , almost terrible . There was something lean , sharp , weaponlike about them . Shivering with cold , blowing rainbow breaths , they danced , restively a-tiptoe , on the long sharp caulks of their steel shoes . They were lean with a leanness I had never seen in any other horses . Even their winter coat , every hair rigid in the cold , could not soften the sharpness of their bones , the stringiness of their muscles . They had the slender legs and flanks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ewed necks held their bony heads at a serpentlike angle . They were speed incarnate . Joyce differentiated them for me . Wrack , the taller by half an inch , was on the right . He had two white hind feet . Ruin 's off hind foot only was white . Suddenly Wrack reared . Ruin plunged . In a shower of sound they were off , down the knoll from the shacks , and out of sight beyond the first bend in the timber road , their little red cutter whipping behind them . Joyce ran on an errand down the valley . Returning in the late afternoon , he stopped at the post office , four miles from home , to see a friend , the postmaster 's son , who was ill . While he was there two lumberjacks on their way to camp came in . Joyce told them to take the camp mail and Wrack and Ruin and go on to camp . He would stay the night with his friend . He saw them in the sled and off . Not quite an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the barns alone . Burrus caught them and put them up . Not even a whiffle-tree had stayed with them . Burrus started down the trail to look for Joyce and met the two men coming . They were unhurt . When Burrus asked about the sled they merely shrugged their shoulders . It snowed that night . For weeks after the spring thaws came we children , on our way to and from school , found bits of red cutter along the trail . We never found even one piece big enough to make a fair-sized paddle . Wrack and Ruin had literally kicked the little red cutter to splinters . Joyce got a new sled , a double-bob . II From then on the team was the most important thing in my world . I listened for their bells as one might wait for magic creatures . I ran out every time I could to catch a glimpse of them . I listened for every word I might hear about them . Joyce was the only man in the camp who would harness and groom them , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose width was almost as great as his height , and whose amiability was as great as his girth , attempted to walk behind Ruin one day . Ruin speedily and firmly placed a foot in his solar plexus and lifted him across a twelve-foot alley . None of the other men bothered the team after that . Then I heard the story of their origin and found them more romantic still .  |p486  One of the teamsters said he had known the team when they were colts , and pointed out a little knot on Ruin 's throat , evidently a barbed-wire scar , to prove it . They had been born and raised on a ranch in Montana . They were brothers . They had a good cross of bronco and standard-bred blood in them . According to his count , Wrack was nineteen and Ruin was seventeen years old . Indeed , the slant of their teeth and the hollows in their temples put them definitely somewhere in their teens . They had been broken together and had earned their names then . It had taken three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . They had been roped , thrown , hog-tied , harnessed , hitched to a buckboard and , with a man on the seat , let up to run their terror off on the open prairie . They ran themselves free of buckboard and harness at least . It took another fortnight of hard riding to catch them again . The marvel was that they had stayed together as a team all these years and had kept their names . Gradually my admiration turned to a deep sympathy . It filled me with pity to see them come in after forty miles in the cold ? cold so bitter that most horses labored along with nostrils like brimming cups of blood ? their heads still high , and their feet still full of rhythm , though they were white from head to foot , except where their steel caulks had ripped their ankles and the blood hung in scarlet icicles . Twice during the cold weather I was allowed to ride behind them . The first time was New Year 's Day . The temperature had dropped another twenty degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weeks . We were invited to go to our neighbors ' , the Bunnys ' three miles away , for New Year 's Day dinner , and we were going , cold or no cold . The Bunny children had spent New Year 's Eve with us . By ten o'clock we were ready . The sled-box was filled with hay covered with blankets and cowhides . We climbed into the box of the sled , sardine fashion , and pulled the blankets over all but our noses . Only my brother Burrus , who was to drive , stood up in the front end . There were six of us altogether . We were to go two miles straight south to the lake , then up the lake on the ice perhaps a mile to the Bunny homestead , which lay a quarter-of-amile back from the shore . As usual , the team went out of the yard running on their hind feet . It was later that I understood why . The miles and the years had stiffened their shoulders and forelegs . In the morning they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But to Wrack and Ruin harness and the trail meant only one thing : to run ; and run they would , their hind legs driving like pistons . When at last they settled into their trail gait I knew a deep pleasure that nothing else has ever given me . Each had a rope of small silver bells about his girth . It was these which made the high clear chiming . But their feet made another music . The trail was packed . The ice rang hollowly . They would run six steps in unison , break on the seventh , and be together again in three strides . I never figured out which horse it was that took the hitch step , but I think it was Wrack . It was counter-point of which I never wearied . I have often wondered why no realistic-minded musician has put the sound of the horses ' feet into a sleighbell piece . And then , too , there is the chink and jingle of clips , snaps , and buckles . Wrack and Ruin 's harness of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sleigh-haul  |p487  teams . No brass or silver mountings , no tassels , no red and blue spreader rings . The new sleigh was of steelbound oak , so light I could have run with it alone . All went well for the first half mile along the accustomed trail in the timber . Then we came out into the brush . The trail dropped steadily , with a fall of perhaps four hundred feet in two miles . In a few moments all four traces were undone . How the horses ran ! The last descent to the lake was down a frozen spring in a poplar-picketed canyon bed . Then the lake , barren snow-white under a frost-black sky ! By the time we reached the Bunnys ' my brother 's mittens were frosted to the lines , and his hands were so cramped the others had to help him loose them . I do n't remember the trip home that night . I must have been asleep . It was February when I rode behind Wrack and Ruin again . The bitter weather had given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time my sister and I sat on the seat in front with Burrus . It was just before noon when we started . The sled ran easily on the softening snow . The horses ' breath floated past us in rainbow colors . Sunlight and shadow flickered over us as we sped along beneath the heavy spruces . We were going to Ferguson 's mill , which lay across a divide , and on Pigeon Lake . At the end of the first mile we swung east from our road . The next two miles were hard going , mostly up hill on an unused trail , the winter 's snow crusted by repeated thawings and freezings . At last we topped the divide and struck the Ferguson logging trails . Almost as wide as a city street they seemed to us , banked and iced . From there down to the very mill-yard was a glassy glorious run . The sawmill lay in a dark jumble at the edge of the white lake . Pigeon Lake was nine miles wide . If it had been cloudy we might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow was too blinding for more than a moment 's glance . The timber as we approached the mill grew thinner , for it had been logged more closely . After we had eaten and Burrus finished his business we started back . It was a relief to our eyes to return to the heavy shadow of the uncut timber . III I should probably never have known either of the team any better had not misfortune fallen upon them . The weather turned cold again . Joyce was away from home with one of the big freight teams . The bookkeeper , a young Englishman , hitched Wrack and Ruin to the light bob-sled , and with the sleigh full of lumberjacks who wanted to enliven a week-end , drove to town . There were half a dozen men , all of them big , sturdy fellows . They ran the team the fortyfour miles into town , tied them to a telephone pole , and went to find a bar . It was thirty-below weather . The team was lathered from head to foot . A livery stable man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They got hay and water , but no grain . Three days later the week-enders who were not too tipsy to stand got the others into the sled , and with a supply of whiskey on which to sober up started back to camp . Wrack and Ruin set out at their usual gait . Some fifteen miles out from town the team got off the tote-road and ran for hours over strange trails , their drunken driver as careless as they must have been bewildered . In the afternoon they finally got back onto the road . As they approached a place where they had other times stopped for feed they turned in . As they drew  |p488  up at the barn door Wrack fell and could not get up . They dragged him into the stable , hired another horse from the owner of the stopping place , and started on home . They were within a mile of camp when , as they climbed a little rise , Ruin slipped , fell , and could not get up . The driver , beginning to sober up now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured it down Ruin 's throat until he got to his feet and staggered on again . Burrus heard them as they came in late at night . He jumped up and ran out to take the team . He had been worried ever since he learned they had been taken , and now , hearing the bells of a strange horse , he was frightened . Ruin , shivering and blowing , was weaving in his tracks . Burrus unhooked the team and left the sled beside the shack . He thought Ruin was sick , and got him to the barn and to bed as fast as he could . The next morning Ruin could not rise . It was a week before he could walk at all and then only with the most pitiful hobbling steps . As Joyce was returning from his trip , the men at the stopping place hailed him and asked him if he did n't want to take his horse home . And there he found Wrack , still lying in the stall where he had been left days since , the lather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and after a time got him up , and led him home behind the plodding freight team . On his next trip to town , before a new snow fell , Joyce discovered the tracks where the team had left the trail , and where they came on again . Their detour , all on unpacked trail , had taken them an extra twenty miles out of their way . The snow was thawing almost every day now . A night with brilliant northern lights , or a three-day chinook would be followed by a driving snow , and then another thaw . There was an Englishman , a Mr. Stelfox , who came to the mill once in a while . He had a homestead on the far side of Battle Lake . One day he saw Wrack and Ruin . The team was still useless . Some thought they should be put out of their misery , for hay and grain were expensive and had to be hauled some distance . But to mother and the boys it seemed a shameful thing to do . Spring would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bush . Mr. Stelfox saw Wrack and wanted him . Mother refused to sell a horse so crippled as Wrack . He must have made some agreement with the boys , for one sunny spring day he called mother to the door . He was sitting on Wrack 's thin back , holding the reins of a bridle he had evidently brought for the purpose . " I 'm taking Wrack , Mrs. Thomas , " he said , smiling jovially through his red beard . Then , touching his stetson hat , he rode the poor hobbling creature from the yard jauntily enough , his puttee-clad legs gripping the bony barrel in precise military fashion . It was shortly after that that I first touched Ruin . Both Joyce and Burrus were away . I was again at my old pastime of watching Swartwout in the cook-shack . It was a sunny morning . Swartwout came back from a trip to the barns to empty a pail of swill . His scarred face was troubled . I had not realized till then that he loved Ruin , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , no one had gone near the horse either to feed or water him since the morning before , and there he was tied in his stall . Swartwout went ahead getting dinner . I reconnoitered and ascertained that mother was busy . Slipping out of the door , I sped to the barn , lifted the big latch , and peered in . The big  |p489  barn seemed dark indeed after the sunlit snow . I could hear Nig , one of the skidding horses which was lame , chewing lustily in a back stall . A hen , cackling , flew out of a feed-box and dashed past my legs and outdoors . Ruin was in the stall next the door . He was standing quietly , one foot a little forward . He swung his head about and looked at me . In the dark his eye glowed red . I hurried . I did n't want any of the teamsters to come in and catch me on forbidden ground . I scrambled to the loft , pulled loose a great lot of hay , pushed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I loaded up my fork with all the tines would hold and so , hidden behind all the hay I could lift , I struggled across the alley and into Ruin 's stall . I thought , " Even if he does kick , he 'll hit the hay and the tines of the fork before he hits me . " But I really had no idea that he would kick . I was sure , even then , of his understanding my love for him . And I trusted perfectly that he would come to love me too . I put the hay in the manger . He fell to eating immediately . " Whoa , Ruin , " I said , with my voice as deep down as I could put it , and I walked out of the stall and to the grain bin , and came back with a bucket of oats . He left the hay for the oats . I put my hand on his throat latch and rubbed it gently , and felt the little knotted scar on his windpipe . He paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt more daring . I untied his halter-rope , said , " Come on , Ruin , " and led him out of the barn , down to the well , drew water for him , led him back , and tied him up again . That evening Joyce came home . I told him what I had done . " Good for you , Tommy , " he said . " Do n't you want to take him out this evening and lead him along the skidding paths to give him some exercise ? I have n't time . " I was happy those evenings , walking along the narrow hollowed-out icy paths , leading old Ruin . Usually he walked with his nose against my shoulder , the lead-rope slack . Sometimes I walked beside his neck and reaching up , held onto his mane . But I was undersized , even for eleven , and to reach his mane was not easy for me . Sometimes our dog , Rats , walked with us , padding along on the trail in front of us , the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white moth , his shirtfront gleaming when he swung partly toward us , listening with contemptuous silence to the coyotes howling beyond the lake . Low down through the dark spruce trees , red triangles of afterglow burned , while the snow paths held all the blues and lavenders in exquisite and subtle blendings . From then on Ruin limbered up rapidly . Before the snow was gone he was on the trail again . But they could find no other horse to keep up with him . We had one two-year-old colt , Dan , a thoroughbred seventeen hands high , with splendid withers , chest , and legs . He came nearest to staying with Ruin , but he was still leggy and thundered along beside Ruin 's bladelike grace so awkwardly that we were afraid he would injure himself . Because he was still growing , the boys hated to shoe him , and so he went barefooted behind . Spring came . The crews left the woods and the mill . April with silver pussy-willows instead of snow , and birch and poplar catkins swinging against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests between the south roots of poplar trees , and new green in every little open glade . May , and mosquitoes and rain and cowslips in sheets of gold across every slough , and an endless chorus of frogs . June , with johnnyjump-ups and daffydowndillies in the  |p490  timber and tiger lilies and bluebells on every slope and wild roses , vetch , and pea-vine . July , with bear-trampled vines in the berry patches . Ruin lost his shaggy winter hair . His coat grew black , shining , with a deep bronze-brown inside his ears and the turn of his flanks . He even rounded out perceptibly . After the snow went he stopped being a harness horse . The trails were all but bottomless with thick black mud . It was too hard for his slender body to drag the heavy lumber wagons through it , though I never saw him balk at any pull , either quick or prolonged . His fragile legs would weave in and out , bending till one feared they would snap . In harness a fury always possessed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started with the first mild weather in March . As long as the ice trails lasted we children could often catch rides with the lumber haulers . When the camp shut down we were sometimes permitted to ride some of the big horses , often two or three on a horse . I was never happier than when I was permitted to ride either Bay Dan , or Ruin . My sister usually got Ruin , for she was afraid of tall , swaying Dan . Then Burrus found out that Ruin was an excellent cattle pony , and from that time on we other children saw little of him . Sometimes , if I could get out of the yard on him without either saddle or bridle , I could have him , for Burrus did not like to hunt cows bareback . Clasping Ruin 's thin ridgepole between my legs , I could ride him kneeling , guiding him by my hand on his neck , or stopping him by a word . He had corns in both fore feet and on hard ground he limped pathetically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths he was still delightfully agile . He would jump a sizable barrier . He could either follow or pick a trail . His canter was sheer pleasure , but his running walk was his most enjoyable gait . I studied more than one lesson with my book on the pommel before me . Riding so I memorized Scott 's " The train from out the castle drew ? " and any number of other poems . I remember the feel of him beneath me , gliding almost soundlessly along a mossy trail , the sunlight filtering down through the trees , in wheels of green and gold , shimmering on innumerable little spider webs thrown across the path during the night , while I learned , " To him who in the love of nature holds communion with her visible forms ? " I often talked with Ruin , told him how fine he was , how much I cared for him . I had never heard of free verse , but I scarcely ever rode him anywhere alone that I did not make some verse and whisper it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timber . It was all too awesome a place . He would weave along , his head turned slightly to the left , his brown eye limpid , cool , and immeasurably sad . While I dreamed him a splendid mount and me a brave hero , the futility and courage of all living things swung before me in every line of his lean bony head . I depended on him utterly . I had no doubt but that if we met a springhungry bear he would save me , that if we were lost he would find the way , that if any danger threatened he would sense it and forewarn me . Once he brought me home through a sleet storm so cutting that I turned about and sat backwards in the saddle to be able to bear it at all . Another time he walked calmly and unafraid through a thunderstorm that frightened me till I was almost ill . The night was so black that I could see nothing at all between the blinding lightning flashes . Thunder shook the forest . Great limbs and whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by  |p491  fallen timber . He left it and picked out his own way home . With any other horse I should have ridden with my feet drawn up under me to keep them from being scraped by the snags and rough bark of the trees . But his slender body would sway aside just enough to give me an inch of clearance . And once , hunting cattle , we loped into a little glade and he found himself belly-deep in slime that had been coated with a deceiving , thin green sod . Any other horse would have reared and floundered . He simply lifted his legs clear , one at a time , laid them full length on the quivering sod , and crawled carefully out . Most cows know how to worm flat-legged across a muskeg , but few horses possess the trick of it . In August I was visiting at Bunnys ' . Madge and I were playing in the shade of the house . I heard the quick staccato sound of a single-footing horse on the hillside road that was now packed and dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed on his stetson , his leather puttees , burned in his short red beard . It flashed on the mane and tail and flanks of his black horse . I stared . I could not believe my eyes . The horse was sleek , fat , nimble , and utterly without a limp even on the hard packed road . Yet it was , undoubtedly , Wrack . I never saw him again . That winter Ruin served as a trail horse again , but one day shortly after the freeze-up Bay Dan fell on the ice and came up dragging a broken hind leg . He had to be killed . After that we never had a horse that could pace with Ruin . One absurd little cayuse after another loped beside him , with Ruin a neck ahead . Spring came , and summer . We moved to The States . IV As we left the homestead the last time I was permitted to ride Ruin to Fullerton 's mill where our possessions were to be sold . It was July . There had been a short rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poplars and willows , all the brush , were in an ecstasy of shimmering and dancing . Innumerable wildflowers were out . Every leaf , bud , fern , and grass blade had its own keen scent . The trail was neither too hard nor too soft ; though Ruin , probably from habit , chose the grass at the edge . I did not talk . It was the last time I should ride him . I gripped him with every inch of my legs , felt every pull and movement of all his lean muscles through all my body at every step . I listened to every little gradation of sound in the creak of the saddle and bridle , and of his feet on the ground . I leaned forward and put my hands in his mane , the short gray-sprinkled collar-worn mane already growing longer since spring . I was full of feeling . I was leaving the timber to go out into the world . Yet I had a sort of awed fore-knowledge that I was leaving behind the most real thing I would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten again . The timber and Ruin were indelibly and forever in me . His head , his left eye that I could just see were as sad , as hopeless , as gallant as ever . As we topped a knoll I looked back . The timber still towered above the brush , a black green rampart , the edge of immensity . When we went to town to take the train Ruin , hitched to a light buggy , took mother and the baby to town ahead of the heavy team and wagon carting our belongings . The last I saw of him he was going over a hill , mane and tail lifting in the sunlight , his flanks flashing , his lean hind legs thrusting splendidly , his nose out , the old fury of the trail in every line of him . We had been in The States over a year when Joyce , who had stayed in  |p492  Canada , wrote , in one of his letters , " You will be interested to know that Wrack is dead . A lumberjack out on Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single cutter to bring him in . Wrack dropped dead when they stopped in front of the hospital . " Buck Lake is about seventy miles from town . He wrote too , " I have seen Ruin several times . He is in good shape and seems well taken care of . " A year later he wrote that Ruin , too , was dead . He died in harness , running .  |p493
