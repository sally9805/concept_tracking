 | Talk of the Town Excerpts from The New Yorker BOON TO TRAVELLERS . A couple of years ago , Mr. A. A. Preciado had to make a business trip to Los Angeles , and decided to go by motor . The idea of driving all that way alone seemed rather gloomy . None of his friends happened to be going in that direction , so he advertised for a travelling companion . More than roo people , all wanting to go to Los Angeles , phoned , wired or wrote him . He chose a young graduate student of philosophy and drove out to the Coast . Before returning , he advertised again , in the Los Angeles papers . Two hundred , replies came in . Mr. Preciado drove home , with an aviator this time , thinking hard . The upshot was that he took an office at 11 West 42nd Street , and opened the Auto Travel Bureau , a clearing house for motorists with vacant seats and for travellers to fill them . He 's had to expand his quarters and take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well worked out . Motorists now , instead of splitting the cost of gas and oil with their passengers , charge them on a mileage basis : ys to Chicago , $45 to Los Angeles , and so on . Mr. Preciado gets a commission . Odd things happen , of course , when total strangers set out together on cross-country tours . One young lady and gentleman , who met as passengers in a car bound for California , had fallen in love before they crossed Alleghenies , were engaged in New Mexico , and sent Mr. Preciado an announcement of their marriage the day they reached Los Angeles . Philately . Have you heard the one about the young fellow in Washington who was sent out to buy a sheet of air-mail stamps for the office he worked in ? Well , when he got it , he was surprised to notice that on every one of the stamps in the sheet the airplane in the center design was upside down . He showed it to the clerk and a great hullabaloo arose . Postal inspectors were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destroying those that were faulty . They wanted back the sheet the young man had bought , too , and even threatened arrest if he did n't give it up , but he knew his rights and stood firm . He knew something about stamp-collecting as well , so he pocketed that sheet and bought another ( correctly printed ) for his firm . Next day he @#  | sold his find for $i2 , ooo . Now : : days a single stamp is quoted at 3300 . The first stamp ever issued for air post was put out by the Italian government in 1917 , for a flight between Turin and Rome . They 're only worth ? o cents unused , and 75 cents used . Another early one was issued in 1919 , when the Newfoundland Post Office printed 200 three-cent stamps for mail to be carried to England in the plane piloted by Hawker and Grieve . They did n't go all the way by air , you remember ; were forced down off the Irish coast and picked up by a tramp steamer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1000 , used , today . The Byrd flight for Paris was another that ended in the water . Just the same , $150 for the stamps . Real enthusiasts in philately , especially at the opening of a new air-mail route , often get the pilots to autograph the letters ( called " covers " by collectors ) they 're sending . People who did this got a lucky break at the opening of Air-Mail Route 2 , from Chicago to St. Louis , in 1926 . The autographed covers were priced at a dollar or so apiece until the spring of the following year , when - well , you 've guessed it . That pilot was Lindbergh , and those souvenirs of his air-mail days are now worth 45o each , Shoemakers . They are proud and temperamental Italians who make shoes at the Delman ' tories on 45th Street . Their shoes are all hand-made , and handmade shoes are fairly - rare . It 's a difficult business - they make a shoe upside down and then turn it inside out ( you 'd have to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of weeks to make one pair . Mr. Delman started his shop eight years ago and attracted attention by fixing . it up like a parlor , with an open fire , and cigarettes lying around . He made highly colored shoes , introducing gold and silver piping on street shoes ( lie makes women 's only ) , aluminum painted shoes for dark nights , shoes ornamented with ground . glass . He sold two pairs of sapphire shoes for $1000 a pair to an Italian countess . At the beginning he could n't afford charge accounts and even Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt used to come in and pay cash . Among his customers have been Madge Kennedy , Adele Astaire , Alice Brady , Jane Cowl , Mary Pickford . Some of Delman 's customers refuse to buy shoes unless the pattern they choose is discontinued thereafter . Mrs. Iriing Berlin bought 26 pairs of shoes before going abroad recently ; Richard Croker 's widow once bought $5000 worth in one month . Mr. Delmati , still in his early thirties , has a workshop ill his Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the night to jot down a design he has dreamed of . He sells 2000 pairs of shoes a week . Mary . It 's a real chimpanzee , and not a figment of people 's imagination , that you 've heard about , partaking of a chocolate soda in the drugstore on Fifth Avenue near 31st Street . Mary is her name . Mary was born in Africa but now resides at the London Dog and Bird Shop , which is just two doors from the drugstore . Mary is for sale , and has been for six months , but nobody seems to want her . The drugstore clerks and regular customers are crazy about her , though . She has a soda there every two or three days . The druggist does n't charge for the soda : it 's a pleasure - and an ad . Crowds gather and gape and here and there someone denies the whole thing . It 's all straight , however . Mary can use a straw and spoon and always puts the glass carefully back on the counter when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At ten-thirty every morning Mary is unleashed and allowed to go visiting . If she does n't visit the drugstore , she calls on Mr. George Tsutsos of 18 West 34th Street . Mr. Tsutsos runs a fruitstand . To get to it , Mary has to cross two streets , but she always waits for traffic to change , and has never even come close to being hurt . Arriving at the fruit stand , she selects a banana , peels it , and eats it . Then she goes back home . " Very good fella , " says Mr. Tsutsos of Mary . Another prominent monkey is one named Freda , an orang-utan , who has lived in Vincent Astor 's Port Washington house for the past five years . At night she crawls between the folds of a blanket , and tucks herself in . In the morning she invariably rips the blanket to pieces . This indicates that keeping a monkey may run into money , as does her glassware bill . After taking a drink out of a glass , Freda always tosses the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeccable , except once a week or so when she reaches out and sweeps practically everything onto the floor . Illuminators . Illuminating manuscripts is the specialty of Ames and Rollinson , who have been at the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street for more than 60 years . They turn out 10,000 handilluminated diplomas a year . Their 25 artisans work in the best tradition of the ancient art as practiced by the monks centuries ago . Each man has a system of his own and hence a private office , so that nobody can spy on him at work with his colors , gold leaf , etc . Some of the workers have  | spent a lifetime developing their art . The company gets gold leaf for them from Italy and tiny bricks of solid gold and platinum from France . The head of the diploma department always refers to parchment as sheepskin and vellum as calfskin because of the highgrade-paper imitations of the two which have come into use in recent years . Ninety per cent of American colleges use the genuine . The company does a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Telephone and Telegraph Company gives to employes who stick to their posts during fires or floods or gun battles . Ames and Rollinson made the pretty check for $25,00o which Raymond Orteig presented to Lindbergh for the Paris flight . It is five and a half by eleven inches , on real parchment , and is illuminated in color and gold leaf . The value of the materials in the check is about yoo . After Lindbergh cashed it , it went back to Orteig and now hangs in a frame in his apartment at the Brevoort . The firm refused to accept any pay for the work . Mr. Rollinson , the present head of the firm , entered the illuminating business when he was 18 - back in 1873- One of his forebears , William Rollinson , engraved the buttons for George Washington 's uniforms . The word " illuminating " once led to his going on a wild-goose chase over to New Jersey . A man had phoned from Newark saying he had a big job for the concern . It turned out that the big job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being erected in Newark . Reweaver . Mr. Henry Taft Wright ( how we do run into these novel specialists ! ) is head of the biggest of those concerns which repair rents in garments by weaving fabric over the hole . He 's rushed when people unpack their clothes after the long moth season , and also after Christmas holidays because evening clothes show up then with cigarette burns and other souvenirs of the season . On the average Mr. V'right fixes up garments for some I 5,00o customers a year - some of them pretty famous too . When President , Theodore Roosevelt was in New York to deliver a speech , and in the afternoon his valet burned a hole in his evening pants while pressing them , Mr. Wright fixed them in time , and Mr. Roosevelt never knew anything about it . The Coolidges have been customers of his ; Jack Johnson , the boxer ; A1 Smith , and Sousa . Wright says the size of some rents he mends would surprise you .
