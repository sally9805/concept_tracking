txt Women Know Better . At the Yankee Stadium this week I had the pleasure of enjoying the doubleheader between the Yankees and Detroit . Men discarded their coats and hats . Every one , apparently was fairly , comfortable . considering the high temperature . Arriving at Forty-second Street , I was amazed to find very few pedestrians coatless . At a restaurant on Forty-second Street the manager , evidently noticing my lack of manners ( not being burdened by a coat ) , rushed me to the extreme end of the dining room , apparently not wishing to refuse serving me in my coatless attire . Women present were not burdened with more apparel than the law permitted . Their spines were on display . A healthy sneeze by any of the modern damsels would have put shoulder straps to a precarious test . Is it false pride that compels men to suffer and become irritable during hot weather by wearing a coat on all occasions ( except ball games ) ? JAMES J. RYAN . Passaic , N. J. , July 26 , 1935.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
