Cardinal principle in comic-strip cartooning : Never permit your characters to change . <P> Most notable violator of that rule is Frank O. King , who draws " Gasoline Alley " for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate . Fourteen years ago grey-haired Cartoonist King singled out his favorite character , fat Bachelor Walt Wallet , surprised him one morning with a fondling infant on his doorstep . Thus Skeezix . As years rolled by Frank King let Skeezix grow out of babyhood . Meanwhile Walt had become prosperous , married his comely neighbor Phyllis Blossom . With careful delicacy Cartoonist King shielded her form and feelings during pregnancy until , six years ago , Baby Corkleigh ( " Corky " ) was born to the Wallets . While Skeezix lengthened into gangling adolescence , " Corky , " too , outgrew his infant tricks . <P> Last week , after days of rigmarole surrounding a " mysterious woman in black , " Cartoonist King completed the cycle back to the patter of baby feet . In his parked automobile Walt Wallet discovered a new baby and a note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confident it will be cherished and cared for . I know all about Skeezix . . . and the love and devotion he has had at your hands for long years . . . . There is nowhere else in the world I would leave such a treasure . . . . <P> " Anguished Mother . " <P> Frank King last week left Walt &; Phyllis debating whether or not to " take on such a responsibility . " But no reader who knew his comic strips expected for an instant that the baby would wind up in an orphanage . Also , since " Anguished Mother " stuck to the neuter gender in referring to " it , " all odds pointed to a foster-sister for Skeezix &; Corky.
