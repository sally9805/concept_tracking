In Madison , Wis. , slightly less than four months ago , a jury , mostly made up of farmers , began to listen to complicated legal arguments , conducted furiously by a total of 66 attorneys . In succeeding weeks , marching in twos and vigilantly guarded , the twelve jurymen and two alternates were occasionally taken out to exercise on the shores of Lake Mendota . For Christmas they had a tree in the juryroom and as a special favor they were allowed to speak to their families . Their mail was carefully censored . They were not allowed to see The Life of Emile Zola because of the courtroom scenes . But in 16 weeks they had gained a total of 220 Ib . <P> The little courtroom was packed when Colonel William J.

" they raised the price of the small quantities of gasoline they bought from the independents , thereby raising the price of the large quantities of the gasoline they sold to the jobbers , which in turn raised midwest retail prices . <P> Wild Bill Donovan and 56 other high-priced oil company attorneys said that that was precisely what they had been told to do by the NRA . <P> At last Colonel Donovan called the roll of the defendants . One by one they stood up and faced the jury , an imposing array . In a voice wringing with pathos and indignation , Colonel Donovan demanded : " Are these men who would sell their souls at any price ? " The jury contemplated judiciously :
