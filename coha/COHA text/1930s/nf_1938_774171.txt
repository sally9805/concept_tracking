txt  | of this development ? without parallel in contemporary Christendom ? is not difficult to find . To begin with , pilgrimage for the Mohammedan was obligatory . Unless he were incapacitated by illness or circumstance , he had to make the journey to Mecca before he died . Accordingly there flowed into Arabia a continual stream of visitors from every corner of Islam . Some of them came from Central Asia and beyond , others hailed from the western end of the world . To all of them were offered unrivalled opportunities for the friendly exchange of opinions not only in the sacred place itself but in other Moslem cities as well as along the pilgrim way . Few travellers , needless to say , were so narrowminded that they thought only of their main object . The pilgrimage was the accomplishment of a religious duty , but it was also a unique vacation , an initiation into the great world of Islam , and for scholars , the exact equivalent of our journeys for study abroad . ' 1 For this reason it became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in strengthening the ties of commerce between all Mohammedan countries and in disseminating a knowledge of all parts of the world . The itineraries and topographical description of the ninth and following centuries were therefore a natural by-product of the hajj ' , as the pilgrimage was called . Broadly speaking , these works contain accurate and interesting eye-witness information about the countries visited . One of the earliest of them was the Book of Roads and Provinces of Ibn Khurdadhbih ( fl. c. 850 ) . The author , an official in the Central postal service at Samarra near Baghdad , was commissioned to undertake its compilation by the Caliph Al-Mo'Tamid . In addition to describing the trading stations , post-relays and revenues of each province in Islam , it contains a geographical preface of a more general character . Quoting from an earlier Arabic source , Ibn Khurdadhbih assures us in this preface that the earth is round like a ball and placed in the centre of the heavens , just as the yolk is in the middle of an egg . . . . It is 9,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the globe is inhabited , while the southern is desert , because of the great heat that prevails there . The other half of the earth , opposite to ours , is uninhabited . The northern and southern quarters are divided into seven climates . Ptolemy says in his book that in his time there were 4,200 towns in the world.2 Similar works followed : the Book of Countries of AlYaqubi ( c. 891 ) , which struck a new note in emphasizing topographical and economic detail ; the Figures of the Climates of Al-Balkhi ( 921 ) , consisting chiefly of regional maps ; the Routes of the Provinces of Al-Istakhri ( fl. 950 ) , really a more elaborately illustrated edition of the former . This was further revised and enlarged at Al-Istakhri 's request by Ibn Haukal ( c. 977 ) under the name of Book of Roads and Provinces . To the same category belongs the more original work of AlMaqdisi ( Al-Muqaddasi ) entitled The Best of Classification for the Knowledge of Climate ( c. 985 ) . In the following century , Al-Bakri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have survived , continued the sequence by writing The Book of Roads and Kingdoms ( c. 1050 ) . The system initiated by Ibn Khurdadhbih and Al-Balkhi paid little attention to countries outside Islam and made the text largely a description of the accompanying maps . A perusal of these works makes it clear that the authors took great pains to obtain in each locality accurate information concerning the climate , the products , the state of trade , the coinage , weights and measures and the general characteristics of the inhabitants . Ibn Haukal puts his aim thus : to describe the various climates and regions of the face of the earth , comprised within the circle of Islam , or Mohammedanism , and their several divisions , in such a manner that every remarkable place belonging to each region shall be noticed , and all the boundaries and territories depending on them , their districts , cities , Footnote  | mountains , rivers , lakes , and deserts . . . and to delineate them on maps ) . That he achieved his aim may be surmised from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caspian Sea region . The Western side of this sea belongs to Deilman and Taberistan and Gurkan , and its borders ; and part of it is bordered by the deserts of Khuarezm . On the Eastern side is Aran and Moukan and the territories of Serir and part of the deserts of Azziah : and on the north it has the desert of Azziah , to the territories of Siah Kouh : and on the south , Bakeil and Deilman and the neighbouring places . This sea is not connected with any other ; and if a person wishes to make a tour completely round it , nothing will impede him but a few rivers which fall into it from various quarters . The waters of this sea are bitter and dark-coloured : its bottom is a blackish sea , differing in this respect from the Sea of Kolzum 2 or of Oman or of Pars.3 This sea of Pars is of such clear water that one may see the white stones at the bottom ; but the waters of this Sea of Khozr 4 are dark-coloured , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or coral or similar marine productions . It is , however , much frequented by the ships of merchants who traffic from one town to another : and it affords much fishing . In this ocean there are not any inhabited islands as in the Sea of Pars or of Roum 6 : but there are many trees and forests . One island is considerable , with a spring of water , and many trees : and there is another large island on the borders of Lekzan , which also has fresh water . To this island they bring cattle from Berdaa in boats , and turn them out to graze and leave them until they become fat.6 Al-Muqaddasi is even more ambitious . Not content with recording the results of his own observations , he also puts down what he has heard from trustworthy people and what he has read in books . He attaches , however , a greater value to the Footnote  | first than to the rest , for he maintains that the only real knowledge is that gained by research and inquiry , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly , such things as the faulty geographical statements of the Koran he explains by the limited physical horizons of the early Arabs , to which Allah must have seen fit to adapt himself . From itineraries to text-books , utilizing both the old academic studies and the new eye-witness narratives , was no far cry for the Arab scholar-pilgrim ; at least , not for a man of the calibre of Al-Masudi , for here is a man of the tenth century with a fifteenth-century renaissance mind . He is interested in and appreciates everything that concerns humanity . Everywhere he is learning something from the things he sees and the people he meets ; he records information about events and views of men without fear or prejudice . As a result of his travels ? travels stretching from Galicia to China and from Madagascar to the heart of Russia ? Masudi finds himself compelled to question not only many of the accepted facts of his day , but the theories also , particularly Ptolemy 's . He asks , for instance : Is Africa surrounded by sea e What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown Southern Continent With commendable courage he discards the Ptolemaic concept of an Africa linked by land with South-East Asia , and regards it as sea-girt and separated by a narrow strait from a southern landmass ? the terra Australis nondum cognita ' of later days . All the seas , he avers , are connected and uninterrupted . The first is the Abyssinian Sea , then the Mediterranean Sea , the Pontus , 2 the Mayotis , 3 the Khazarim , 4 and the Ocean which is also called the Green Sea , the surrounding sea and the Dark Sea . ' S On the purely descriptive side , Masudi 's work is remarkable Footnote  | for some rather paradoxical things . On the one hand , there is his catholicity ? he neglects no source of information and describes Moslem and non-Moslem countries with impartiality ; and his scientific curiosity ? he describes the earthquake of 955 , the waters of the Dead Sea , and the origin of seas in general with the detachment of a present-day observer . On the other hand , he repeats , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpably erroneous estimate of the earth 's size : Men who are possessed of an extensive knowledge of our globe say that the Abyssinians and people of Sudan occupy a country which is seven years ' journey , that Egypt forms the sixtieth part of the country of the Sudan and that the country of the Sudan forms only a small portion of the surface of the globe , the dimensions of which are equal to five hundred years ' journey . One-third of it is inhabited , one-third is desert and the remaining third is sea-covered.l A similar fusion of ancient tradition and modern knowledge is attempted by several other Arab geographers of the time . Here , for instance , is Al-Biruni 's 2 discussion of the limits of contemporary knowledge . The Western Sea which we call Ocean has been named the Environing Sea , because in effect its shores commence at the extremity of the countries which it touches on the southern side , opposite the Negro lands and runs past successively the shores of Audagost , Sous-Alacsa , Tanger and Tahurt advancing towards the shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , in turning north , it goes round the inhabited world and countries behind unknown mountains and lands desolate because of the cold and flows east by an unsuspected route as far as the Oriental Sea which marks the limit of the inhabited world . It has not been Footnote  | described with the same exactitude as the Ocean . ' We know , however , in a general way , that it continues towards the south just as the Ocean continues towards the north . The Southern Sea commences at China and flows along the shores of India towards the country of the Zendj.2 The coasts to the north are inhabited but those which border it on the south remain unknown , for they have not been visited by any navigator and the people who live in the adjacent isles have not furnished us with any knowledge on this point . The extreme part which has been visited by the people in the Southern Sea on its west side is Sofala , in the country of Zendj . Navigators have not passed this limit , the reason being that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . while on the south-west , as if by way of compensation , the continent projects into the sea . This region is inhabited by the Negroes of the West and it stretches beyond the Equator to the mountains of Comr where the Nile has its source . Beyond this point , the sea penetrates between the mountains and valleys which alternate with one another . The water is continually set in motion by the ebb and flow of the tide , the waves for ever surging to and fro , so that ships are broken in pieces . This is why the sea is not navigated . But this does not prevent the Southern Sea from communicating with the Ocean through a gap in the mountains along the south coast of Africa . One has certain proofs of this communication although no one has been able to confirm it by sight . It is because of this inter-communication that the habitable part of the world has been placed in the centre of a vast area environed on all sides by the sea.3 The general meaning of this passage being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. That , by the eleventh century , the Arabs were in possession of information about the east coast of Africa to at least 2o ? S. , i.e. as far as Sofala. 2 . That statements concerning regions to the south are entirely conjectural . At the same time , the mention of ships being broken in pieces may imply a second-hand acquaintance with the Mozambique channel . Footnote  | 3 . That the peninsular nature of the African continent was maintained despite opposition from the followers of Ptolemy and the lack of confirmatory evidence . 4 . That the existence of a southern antipodal landmass was unquestioned. 5 . That very little was known either of Northern Europe or of Eastern Asia by the Arabs of this period . Elsewhere in his writings Al-Biruni discusses intelligently such wide-ranging topics as the earth 's rotation on its axis , the working of natural springs by the hydrostatic principle , and the origin of the Indus valley which he rightly surmises to have been an ancient sea basin filled up with alluvium . The most notable example of the fusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al-Idrisi , a man whom genius and circumstance served right royally . Born in Ceuta in 1099 , this great geographer travelled widely in Europe , Africa and the Levant , before being persuaded by Roger II , the Norman King of Sicily , himself a man of some learning , to settle at the court of Palermo . While there , he undertook to write a geographical treatise entitled , rather fulsomely , Amusement for him who desires to travel round the world . ' About the same time ( c. 1154 ) he also made a celestial sphere and a representation of the known world in the form of a disk , whereon was inscribed all the circuit of the known world and all the rivers thereof ' . He was obviously in a very advantageous positionfor carrying out all this work , as Sicily was the rendezvous of navigators from Mediterranean , Atlantic and Northern waters , and so was in closer touch with contemporary life than most of the Islamic centres of culture . A typical instance of his knowledge of current events is supplied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to its intrinsic value as being the earliest recorded voyage after the rise of Islam , deliberately undertaken for the purpose of exploring the Western Ocean , provides an interesting sidelight upon the breadth of the writer 's outlook . But in coming by Footnote  | such knowledge he owed a very great deal to the generosity of his patron , who employed men in almost every part of the civilized world to glean materials for him . The plan of this work is simple , though somewhat artificial . After a brief description of the earth as a globe , which he computed to be 22,900 miles in circumference and judged to remain stable in space like the yolk in an egg ' , and of the hemispheres , climates , seas and gulfs , he launches out on a lengthy account of the regions of the earth 's surface . Taking the seven main Ptolemaic climata in order , he divides each of them into ten longitudinal sections , a fashion started by earlier Islamic astronomers . These seventy sections he describes in detail , illustrating each description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rectangular world map much after the Ptolemaic pattern.2 Notwithstanding the arbitrariness of the divisions , his description of them is of exceptional merit when contrasted with the Christian , or for that matter , with the other Moslem literature of the period . This is due partly to the wealth of detail he furnishes ( especially in connexion with Africa ) , but mainly to his scientific method , the co-operation of numerous observers , and his critical correlation of their observations . We will examine his knowledge of Africa by way of example . The first division of the first climate commences to the west of the Western Sea which is called the Sea of Darkness ' . In this sea are two islands named Al-Khalibat 3 where Ptolemy began to count longitudes and latitudes ( sic ) . . . nobody knows of habitable land beyond that . ' 4 In this southernmost section he places a number of important towns including the problematical Oulil 5 which , he tells us , is situated in the sea Footnote  | not far from the shore ' and is renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Sudan was done with the help of ships which carried it from the town of Oulil a day 's journey to the mouth of the Nile and mounted the river as far as Silla , Tacrour , Barisa , Ghana . . . and to all the Sudanese towns . The greater part of the country is only habitable on the borders of the Nile for the rest of the country . . . is desert and uninhabited . There are arid wastes where one must walk two , four , five or twelve days before finding water . . . . The people of Barisa , Silla , Tacrour and Ghana make excursions into Lamlam 2 bringing the natives into captivity , transporting them to their own country and selling them to the merchants . In the second section of his first climate , he describes , among others , the lost city of Ghana , farther to the east , as the most considerable , the most densely peopled and the largest trading centre of the Negro countries . . . . From the town of Ghana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This country is renowned for the quantity and the abundance of the gold it produces . It forms an island 300 miles long by Igo miles wide : this is surrounded by the Nile on all sides and at all seasons . ... The greater part of the gold is bought by the people of Wargalan 3 and by those of Western Maghrib.4 Following the Nile still eastwards , we find the nomadic Berbers who pasture their flock on the borders of a river flowing from the east , debouching into the Nile stream ' . Beyond , in the fourth section of his first climate , we come to the place where the two Niles separate , that is to say , first , the Nile of Egypt which crosses the country from the north to south , and second , the branch which flows from the east towards the Footnote  | western extremity of the continent . It is on this branch of the Nile that most of the large towns of the Sudan are situated . ' These few extracts are characteristic of Idrisi 's method and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Ptolemy 's authority no longer commands unreserved approval ; Ptolemy places the source of the Nile south of the Equator , in the Mountains of the Moon , and has no sympathy with the idea of a dual Nile . We see , further , that there was already , by the twelfth century , a regular commercial exchange between the Mediterranean Sea and the Sudan , and that authentic information concerning these southern lands was beginning to filter through to the European centres of learning . When we recall that the exact hydrography of the land of the Western Nile ' was not discovered until the nineteenth century , Idrisi 's narrative assumes a profound importance . The authenticity of many of the places he mentions is indisputable . Thus Ghana ( situated near Timbuktu ) , Silla ( possibly Ysilgam of the Valseccha Portolan chart of 1434 2 and Tacrour ( Tekrour on the Senegal ) were , for a time , flourishing centres of Moslem culture . The reference to Wangara implies a knowledge of the flood region of the Niger above Timbuktu , 3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were , in Europe , faint glimmerings of knowledge about the Senegalese coast , even as early as the mid-twelfth century . In view of its modernity ' and high intrinsic worth , it is difficult to understand why Idrisi 's work , composed as it was at the chronological and geographical point of contact between the Islamic and Christian civilizations , remained so long unutilized by Christian scholars in Sicily , Italy or other Christian countries , until we remember that the primary ? we might almost say the sole ? interest of the Latin West in Arabic literature centred in the preparation of calendars , star tables Footnote  | and horoscopes , and the recovery of ancient lore . It was not much concerned in the twelfth century with the descriptive geography of Africa or Asia . After the time of Idrisi , Arab geographical literature ? excluding purely travel literature 2 ? can not claim any great originality . Ibn Said ( 1214-74 ) spends his time recording other people 's travels ; Al-Khazwini ( fl. c. 1250 ) writes a natural history in the Plinian tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographical Dictionary based largely on the writings of earlier geographers , and Abu'l Fida ( fl. c. 1300-25 ) produces an encyclopaedia . This last work is typical of the geographical thought of the period and provides good evidence of the persistence of the higher Moslem culture amidst intellectual depression . As a Sultan ( of Hamat ) it is to be imagined that Abu'l Fida was in fairly close touch with contemporary happenings , and so was able to gather at first hand his material for a geographical treatise . But this does not appear to have been the case , for we find him drawing largely upon earlier authorities . Of those he mentions by name ? no less than thirty-six ? Al-Biruni is easily the most revered . Yet Abu'l Fida did not hesitate upon occasion to revise and amplify the theories of his authorities . Thus he was disinclined to follow Al-Biruni in his theory of the habitability of the Southern Hemisphere . The Equator and the Great Circle passing through the two Poles divide the earth into four parts . It is one of these quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other three-quarters are unknown to us and it is widely held that they are covered with water . ' 3 He verifies this statement , adducing as a proof the fact that ' only in a very small area do the shadows at noon , with the sun overhead at the Equator , fall to the South , ' e.g. in the country of Zanzibar . Footnote  | The sea he regards as surrounding the earth on all sides . We know the North-West and South-East coasts , but nobody has ever visited the South-West , and we still have no exact idea of the lands to the North-East . ' The Southern quarter is not inhabited by reason of the proximity of the sun ' , but Abu'l Fida admits that this view is not shared by all the astronomers . From his description of the Environing Sea , we gain some insight into his conception of the southern limits of the oikoumene . The west coast of the Environing Sea . . . carries the name of Ocean . Here are found the Eternal Isles 1 at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea stretches from the coasts of Magreb-Alecsa 2 towards the South as far as the desert of Lamtounas . This desert which is occupied by the Berbers extends between the limit of Magreb and that of the country of the Negroes.3 Then the sea continues South along uninhabited and unfrequented shores , as far as the Equator . Then it turns towards the East behind the Comr Mountains 4 where the Nile takes its source , and washes the southern coasts of the world . Thence it continues in the direction of the East past uninhabited countries , behind the country of Zendj.5 There it takes a North-East direction and stretches to the sea of China and India . . . . According to the Sheriff Idrisi , the water of the Environing Sea , on the South coast , is viscous and this , he says , is because the sun . . . evaporates the volatile atoms in the water.6 The above quotation ? and it is fairly typical of Arab geography in the later Middle Ages ? shows that traditional ideas were still crippling the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally clearly , that Abu'l Field 's ideas on the southern extension of Africa are a retrogression upon those of Al-Biruni already set out . The latter advances the not unreasonable postulate of inter-communica-Footnote  | don between the Abyssinian Sea ' and the Ocean ( i.e. Atlantic ) in the region of Madagascar . For this Abu'l Fida substitutes the resuscitated and partially modified Ptolemaic theory ? a theory completely at variance with the same scholar 's opinion expressed elsewhere . For in the section on Bilad Al Soudan ( the Country of the Blacks ) he says the town of Daghouta is the last in the country of Sofala and the most remote of an inhabited part of the continent ? zo9 ? long 12 ? S. ' 2 The ascription of habitable land to Africa south of the Equator is , of course , not readily squared with the statement that the Environing Sea turns towards the East ' along the latitude of the Equator.3 Such was the confused state of Arab geographical thought in the early fourteenth century . During the next hundred years or so there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing reluctance to accept classical authority . Ultimately this brought about the overthrow of the Ptolemaic tradition . By a strange and unfortunate coincidence , at the epoch when this courageous move was being made , Western scholars were ceasing to hold Arab scholarship in as high regard as hitherto . For Ptolemy 's Geography and Almagest had been rendered accessible to them in Latin , and these treatises , so far superior to anything they yet possessed , won their allegiance and thereby helped to retard the growth of accurate geographical concepts . Until then ( i.e. c. 1410 ) , Christendom had accepted the Moslem views with deference , though not without a certain amount of disinclination , born of religious antipathy . Henceforth she was determined to cull her knowledge from the Ancients at first-hand . The original contributions of Arabic geographers to their science during these centuries were confined mainly to the Footnote  | mathematical side , for , apart from an elaboration of the ancient theory of cosmic cycles , i they consisted of improvements in the technique of astronomical observations and cartography . The Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if for no other reason than that the correct orientation of their mosques depended upon such knowledge . According to Mohammedan law , these had to face towards Mecca . Astrology , which was held in high esteem in Islam , also encouraged the same type of investigation , for , in order to cast a horoscope , it is necessary to know what stars are overhead at a given moment , and , to ascertain this , it is necessary to know the latitude and longitude . Accordingly , many a Moslem scientist gave himself to the improvement of methods of finding these geographical co-ordinates , and with commendable results , for the figures normally employed in their tables are considerably more exact than those given by Ptolemy . Al-Zargali , a Spanish Moslem of the twelfth century , gives the length of the Mediterranean Sea in his commentary on the Toledo Tables , 2 as 420 , which is almost exact , 3 while Al-Marrakushi gives a list of 135 co-ordinates which , for accuracy , deserves to be regarded as one of the most important contributions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al-Zargali are set out in the Canones , or Canons , as his commentary was called in its Latin form . They are twofold : in one case the sun is used , in the other a fixed star . The solar method is as follows : When the sun is overhead at the Equator , the observer must measure its elevation in degrees above the horizon at noon with the astrolabe . This figure subtracted from 90 ? will give him the latitude . If , however , he wants to find the latitude at some other time of the year than that of the equinoxes , he must ascertain the number of degrees separating the sun from Footnote  | the celestial equator for that particular date . ( This was easily found in the solar tables which were part of the astronomical tables on which Al-Zargali 's Canons were a commentary ) . By adding this number to the number of degrees of the sun 's elevation when the sun is south of the celestial equator , and by subtracting it when the sun is north of that equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be at the equinox . From this the latitude can readily be found by subtracting from 9o ? as we have just seen . The method of observing fixed stars is even simpler . All the observer has to do is to determine the elevation of the celestial pole above the horizon . To find this he selects some star which never sets and measures the elevations above the horizon of the two points where this star cuts the meridian at its upper and lower transits in its circular course around the celestial pole . The pole , obviously , is half-way between these two points and the elevation of the pole in degrees above the horizon is the same as the latitude.l An ingenious , if somewhat more elaborate , method of calculating latitude was used by Al-Haitham , 2 who recommended using a bright fixed star for the precise determination of the altitude of the celestial pole , a star which in its upper culmination reached the zenith or at least came very close to the zenith . Then , very near the zenith , two so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken with the astrolabe . In , this way the influence of refraction , known to affect the measured altitudes of stars at greater distances from the zenith , could be eliminated . The time which elapsed between the moment the fixed star left its eastern altitude and the moment when it reached its western altitude was measured as accurately as possible with a waterclock . When the two observed heights , the interval between the observation , and ( in case the star did not culminate in the zenith ) the altitude of its culmination , had been measured , the Footnote  | latitude of the place of observation could be calculated . It is not known how many calculations were made by such methods , but certainly some of the Arab findings are strikingly near the truth . The latitude of Baghdad was found by the sons of Musa Ibn Shakir to be 33 ? 20 ' N. ? a figure that is correct within a minute . For the calculation of longitude the Arabs relied very largely upon eclipses of the moon . That the moon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Roger of Hereford , who adapted the Tables to the meridian of his own city , tells us that the time of the eclipse of II78 was observed in Toledo , Hereford and Marseilles , and their longitudes in relation to Arin , the Arabic world centre , were in that way determined.2 Only in one place is the so-called terrestrial ' calculation of longitude mentioned . This is in the work of Al-Biruni , who describes how , having determined accurately the shortest linear distance between two points , the latitudes of each and their mutual bearings , he proceeded to calculate the difference in longitude from the data thus acquired . The one result which Al-Biruni claims to have arrived at by this method is remarkably good , for the figure given for the difference in longitude of Baghdad and Ghazna is 24 ? 20 ' .3 The eclipse method is clearly set out for us in the Hakimite Tables of Ibn ) ( Onus , but the results were generally unreliable . Thus Hereford , London , Paris and Marseilles are given the following longitudes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | While the Arabs were good astronomers they were poor cartographers . When they strayed from Ptolemy , as they frequently did , their maps became the vehicle for fancies rather than facts . Even the world-maps attributed to Idrisi , carefully drawn as they were , and owing much to Ptolemy , betray a sad ignorance of the meaning of geographical coordinates as understood by the Alexandrine master . ' Speciments of their map-makers ' art , of both earlier and later date than his , are cast in an even cruder mould . They owe more to the late Latin school than to the Ptolemaic and are more akin to diagrams than maps . But in qualification of this indictment it is only right to say that their authorship is , almost without exception , disputable , and that there is no certain proof that any one of them is the work of the author in whose writing it occurs . Notwithstanding , it is now possible , thanks largely to the untiring researches of Konrad Miller 2 and Prince Youssouf Kamal , 3 to arrive at an estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by most western scholars . In general , their worldmaps subscribe to the old classical notion of an ocean embracing the habitable earth which commonly assumes a circular form . Following Ptolemy , the habitable earth is divided into climata , or latitudinal zones , and extends only 1 In his scholarly work , Mappae Arabicae ? Arabische Welt and Lander Karten des 9-13 . Jahrhunderts , Konrad Miller is of the opinion that the Ptolemaic influence has been very much exaggerated . Thus , for example , although Idrisi adopted the climata system of regional treatment , in detail it has very little in common with Ptolemy 's . Again , the whole delineation of the south coast of Asia and Malay differs widely from that of Ptolemy , most noticeable perhaps being the omission of any indication of the Malay peninsula , which is shown in exaggerated dimensions even by Ptolemy . Footnote  | a little way into the Southern Hemisphere . Africa , thus foreshortened , is given an eastern prolongation , which , however , does not completely land-lock the Indian Ocean.l Communication is maintained between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel ? as described by AlBiruni . Many maps reveal the Ptolemaic influence still further in that they show the sources of the Nile in equatorial latitudes , 2 but some others favour the Plinian idea of a western branch of the river rising in the Sahara . Other common characteristics are the disproportionate size of the inland seas and ocean gulfs , the frequent disagreement between the text and the drawing where the geographical location of towns , rivers and mountains are concerned , the habit of orientating maps with the North at the top and writing all the rubrics from the northern side , the absence of lines of latitude and longitude , the adoption of a datum point ? under the appellation of Arin ? through which passed the prime meridian , 3 and , occasionally , the placing of Mecca in an orbo-centric position . Towards the end of the fourteenth century the influence of the Portolan chart began to be felt and it was not long before the Arabs were drawing copies of the standard Italian and Catalan models.4 Brief as this survey has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority of Arabic geography over the Footnote  | contemporary geography of Christendom . The explanation of this contrast would seem not to be difficult . During the Middle Ages , as we have already observed , the Greek tradition of disinterested research was stifled in Western Europe by a theological dictatorship which bade fair , for a time , to destroy all hope of a genuine intellectual revival . Further , the Latin West had gradually drifted apart from the Greek East , thereby widening the already-present cultural cleavage . Meanwhile the Moslems were slowly unearthing the treasures of Greek and Persian wisdom , and in so doing they became fired with an enthusiasm to study them . Aided by their own native genius , by the keenest inter-regional competition ? for Moslem culture radiated from . a number of centres distributed all the way from Seville to Samarkand ? and the stimulus of the classical models , they succeeded in advancing the cause of every known science before being overtaken by a tyrannical obscuranticism.l About the same period , scholarship in Christendom was undergoing a similar fiery trial from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thenceforward Experiment ' , not Submit ' was the guiding principle of seekers after knowledge . The Moslem Orient , on the other hand , succumbed to the ordeal and so the supremacy in matters of scholarship gradually passed to the Christian Occident . Footnote  | 11 the intellectual task of the Dark Ages was to save what it could from the wreckage of ancient learning , that of the first succeeding centuries was to master what had been recovered and adapt it to the requirements of the Christian From the tenth century onward we may watch this process at work , and there the intellectual revival of the Middle Ages may be said to begin . This revival was so remarkable that it behoves us briefly to inquire into its origin . Until recently it was popularly supposed that the Crusades were the main single factor . It was argued that these expeditions , by bringing the men engaging in them into touch with new , and , in a sense , more ancient civilizations , possessing d i f ferent outlooks and traditions , provided at once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus to the intellect . Nowadays , however , it is generally recognized that a distinction must be drawn between the Crusades and the Age of the Crusades . The Crusades were only one expression , and that not the earliest ? for the Renaissance had begun before the first Crusade ? of the life of a vigorous new epoch . They brought East and West into closer contact , stimulated trade , transportation , and the use of money , and helped to accelerate many tendencies already at work . But that was almost the full extent of their influence , for their specifically intellectual consequences were less apparent , if indeed they are not largely hypothetical . Nor should this greatly surprise us . The Crusaders were fighters , not scholars . They were in no mood to carry on intellectual traffic with  | the Saracens , their enemies and the enemies of all that stood , in their view , for culture . Nevertheless , cultural relations with the Arabs of Syria were not wholly lacking . Early in the twelfth century Adelard of Bath is known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear to what extent his acquaintance with Arabic science was gained there , while , towards the close of the Crusading epoch , Frederick II of Sicily included the Levant in the distribution of his questionnaires , and , when in Syria , came into direct contact with Mohammedan philosophers and scientists . While the Crusades , per se , may not have had very much direct influence on this renaissance , their indirect influence was very considerable . Through the Crusades Christendom came into contact with a civilization different from its own . New fields of study were suggested as , for example , the oriental languages , from which , of course , many words passed into the western tongues , just as new plants and fruits and handmade wares passed westward . Then again , the Crusading tales of valour and chivalry could not fail to inspire the literature of the time . The cycle of the Crusades enriched the store of narrative poetry , while the Historia Transmarina of William of Tyre is second to none among medieval histories . Nor must we forget the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that foreign travel was nothing new in Christendom . - Pilgrimages as well as diplomatic and religious missions had been made ever since the new era came in . None the less , with the steady improvement in the means of communication , in the safety of travel and in the government of Europe , it came to assume a much greater significance about this time . Now all the great religions , Judaism , Buddhism and Christianity , as well as Islam , have always had this in common , that while they were universal in scope , some places on earth were particularly sacred to them . To visit these places was the ambition of every devout follower . The Christian , Footnote  | unlike the Moslem , was not obliged to go on pilgrimage , but all the same he was given ample inducements to do so in the guise of plenary absolution and indulgences . Rome , Santiago de Compostella , Tours , Chartres , Canterbury , Assisi , as well as Jerusalem , for the few who could afford it , were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly shown by the creation of hospices along the regular routes at such places as Roncesvalles in the Pyrenees and at the top of the St. Bernard and Septimer passes in the Alps . In some cases , no doubt , the immediate motive for travel was not religious , but a desire to gratify the spirit of Wanderlust , or simply to see the world ' . Many a knight who won honour and renown in Palestine had more of the pirate than the saint in him . But we are concerned less with their motives than their movements . In following these we are ui i fortunately hampered by the fact that the pilgrims , always on the alert for the miraculous and the mysterious , did not often trouble to record systematically either what they saw or where they went . Consequently , their itineraries have little geographical value , and we shall therefore treat them with scant courtesy . The most notable records of Christian pilgrimages to Palestine are those of John of Wiirzburg , Joannes Phocas , Richard Cceur de Lion , Sigurd of Norway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mount Sion in the thirteenth century . A comparison of the following extract from John of W iirzburg 's Description of the Holy Land ( he did not describe his journey thither ) with any of the contemporary Arabic documents already described will suffice to impress upon us the superiority of the latter . It commences thus : Now because our redemption was begun in the city of Nazareth through the incarnation of our Lord , whereof annunciation was pule by an angel , we propose to begin our description with this Ilene city which is about sixty miles distant from Jerusalem and b touch briefly and compendiously upon the places which lie between it and the Holy City . . . this same city , which is ten  | miles distant from Tiberias , is the chief town of Galilee and is properly called The City of the Saviour ' because He was conceived and brought up within it : wherefore He was called a Nazarene . Nazareth is , being interpreted , a flower ' or a shrub ' and is justly so-named , because therein grew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . In Nazareth runs that little fountain ( legendary e ) from which Jesus in childhood was wont to draw water and take it to his mother . A mile from Nazareth to the southward is the place which is called the precipice ' down which those who found Jesus wished to cast him , and to this day it is commonly The Lord 's Leap ' . At the second milestone from Nazareth is the city of Sepphoris , on the road which leads to Accon . Anna , the mother of Mary , who was the mother of our Lord , came from Sepphoris ... 1 And so on , until the writer reaches Jerusalem . Here he describes the holy places in the Sacred City , starting from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and going round about , through the Gate of David ' , till he returns to the same place . Throughout , the narrative is devoted to the description of biblical topics and topography , and is singularly devoid of eye-witness information . There is scarcely a sentence that could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some road-map . The contemporary pilgrim narrative of Joannes Phocas is similar , but on the whole , more secular in outlook ? witness the following description of Lebanon : Mount Libanus . . . is a very great mountain clad in a robe of snow , hanging from it even as ringlets , overgrown with pine , cedar and cypress trees and adorned with numerous fruit-bearing trees of various kinds . The side thereof next the sea is inhabited by Christians , while the Saracens dwell on the side that looks towards Damascus and Arabia . From its ravines and hollows many rivers gush forth into the sea , beauteous and excessively cold at the time when the snow is melting , and chills the streams which feed them . At the foot of this mountain is Tripolis , which was built by its founder upon a peninsula ; for a small spur , Footnote  | branching out from Libanus , runs out into the sea in the shape of a tongue , rising high at its eastern end . Upon the summit of this rising ground the builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least makes more interesting reading than John of Wiirzburg 's narrative and it has the added virtue of being refreshingly geographical in content . More effective than the pilgrim literature , and perhaps even more effective than the pilgrimages themselves , in remoulding current thought were the travels of scholars in search of learning . One of the distinguishing features of Western Europe about this time was an increased mobility in all classes of society . No kind of men were more quickly touched by the new mobility than the thousands of youthful learners who desired to extend their knowledge , or , in some definite field , perfect their education . In the eleventh century such would commonly have sought a monastery , near or far . In the twelfth and then in the thirteenth century they followed the human current to the cities , where knowledge flourished as well as trade , and tolerable accommodation might be had for teachers and students.z Certain towns , some for more , some for less obvious reasons , became homes of study . Bologna , Paris and Oxford are the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study Roman law came to Bologna , those who sought to read philosophy and theology were drawn to Paris ( e.g. Abelard , Hugo , Peter Lombard , John of Salisbury , Alhertus , Thomas Aquinas , Roger Bacon ) . What first In ' night masters and students to Oxford . . . is not so clear .... One hypothesis is that it was a colony from Paris , shaken off by some academic or political disturbance ' .3 Finally , in assessing the factors contributing to the energetic human advance of western civilization at this epoch , we must not forget the significance of the re-conquest of central Footnote  | Spain from the Moors in the eleventh and twelfth centuries , and the contemporary occupation of Sicily and Southern Italy by the Normans . More than any other happenings , these paved the way for the acquisition of Arabic and Greek learning by Christian scholars . Now , as we have already remarked , Western European scholarship in general was crippled down to this time by its ignorance of the Greek language . Even the alphabet was lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval scribe Greek characters are gibberish , the word grecum commonly being inserted in its place ? it was all Greek ' to him . As late as the twelfth century we find the leading humanist , John of Salisbury , never quoting a Greek author unless he was available in a Latin translation . In Eastern Europe and in Sicily the situation was different . There , with Constantinople and Palermo as their intellectual foci , the Greek traditions lived on . The Greek language remained the medium of law and government , civil as well as ecclesiastical , and the language of literature . And as the Byzantine Church was , at that time , well established in Asia Minor and Syria ( whither Constantinople was drawn by strong geographical affinities ) , Greek culture enjoyed a wide vogue in the Levant , long after the Greek language had ceased to be the lingua franca . Here many of the classics ' were translated into Arabic and Aramaean , sometimes directly , but more commonly by way of Syriac and Hebrew . With the territorial expansion of Islam along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mediterranean went the rudiments of Arabic culture , to such good effect , in the case of Arabic letters , that , by the eleventh century , the libraries of Palermo and Toledo were almost as Arabic in language as those of Alexandria and Antioch . In composition , they consisted very Footnote  | largely of commentaries on the classics rather than translations of them . Prior to the twelfth century the intellectual contacts between Christendom and Islam were few and fitful . Gerbert 1 in the tenth century , and Constantinus Africanus in the eleventh , are conspicuous as students of Arabic scholarship more for their solitariness than for their accomplishments.2 With the steady recovery of the lost European territory , especially of Moorish Spain , the Latin world gradually began to appropriate this neglected legacy . Toledo had become part of the kingdom of Castile in zo85 . When the town was taken by Alfonso VI , it was made the capital of his kingdom . The Moslem inhabitants of the city soon found themselves living side by side with infidel ' Christians , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King , the royal court and the Primate made a deep impression on the new-corners , who began to take a lively interest in the intellectual life of Islam . Early in the twelfth century , Raymund , the reigning Archbishop , founded a college of translators there , and entrusted it with the task of preparing Latin translations of the most important Arabic works on philosophy and science . Once the fame of its libraries had spread north of the Pyrenees , it was not long before all roads led to Spain . Adelard of Bath , Plato of Tivoli , John of Spain , Robert of Chester , to name only a few , played leading parts in this migration . Tired of editing and re-editing the aphorisms of the Church Fathers , they set about acquiring a working knowledge of Arabic and then applied themselves to the task of translation . Some settled down in Barcelona , others in ' T'aragona , Leon , Segovia , and Pamplona , but Toledo was the chief attraction . The most important meeting place of ancient and medieval t tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of Sicily , for only there did Greek , Latin and Footnote  | Arabic civilization live side by side in peace and mutual toleration . The three languages were in current use , both for tongue and pen , so that knowledge of more than one of them was a necessity for the officials of the Royal Court , where men of learning from every land were welcomed . The production of translations was almost inevitable in such a cosmopolitan atmosphere , especially as it was directly encouraged by the Sicilian kings , from Roger to Frederick II and Manfred , as part of their policy for the spread of culture . Little is known of the great majority of these translators , domiciled in Spain and Sicily , beyond their names and the names of the books they translated . Fortunately , fairly full details are known of Gerard of Cremona who can be regarded , with some justice , as their doyen . From these details , furnished by his pupils , we learn that he went to Toledo in search of Ptolemy 's Almagest , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from literary references . He not only found it , but discovered also a multitude of Arabic books in every field , and , pitying the poverty of the Latins , learned Arabic in order to translate them . His version of the Almagest bears the date 1175 . Before his death , which occurred at Toledo in 1187 at the age of seventy-three , he had turned into Latin at least seventy-one books . This number of works is catalogued in his version of Galen 's Tegni . Three of them are on logic , several are on mathematics , including Euclid 's Elements , and many are devoted to astronomy and astrology , while his list of Aristotelian translations is only exceeded , for length , by his medical translations from the works of Galen and Hippocrates . It is no exaggeration to say that Gerard did more than any other single person to render Arabic lore available to the Latinreading world . In the following centuries his pioneer work was carried on by such men as Alfred the Englishman , Michael Scot and Herman the German . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the West that Renan 1 maintained that it divides the history of science and philosophy in the Middle Ages into two distinct periods . In the first , the human mind had , in order to satisfy its curiosity , only the meagre fragments of the Roman schools heaped together in the compilations of Martianus Capella , Bede , Isidore and certain technical treatises whose wide circulation saved them from oblivion . In the second , ancient science came back once more to the west , but this time more fully in the Arabic commentaries or the original works of Greek science for which the Romans had substituted compends.2 Yet this recovery of ancient learning could not have operated as it did but for the antecedent intellectual development . Before the first half of the twelfth century had passed , the patristic material had been mastered , along with the current notions of ancient philosophy , for the most part contained in it . The assimilation of this classical lore supplemented by what the Arabs had gained both from the Orient and their own observation led , in the twelfth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse without parallel in the earlier period . There are manifestations of it at every turn . Adelard of Bath , for instance , blessed , it is true , with an inquisitive turn of mind , early found himself becoming deeply interested in what he was translating and it was not long before he was challenging many of the longaccepted principles of knowledge . Then we find him favouring scientific investigation rather than unquestioning faith , and setting reason above authority . In his Natural who translated a number of the works of Aristotle at the instance of Thomas Aquinas ( c. 1263 ) , in order to make good the inadequacy of the Arabic translations of Aristotle . Vide F. Ueberweg : Grundriss der Gesch. der I'hilosophie , z Teil ( 11th ed. , 1928 ) , pp. 348 et seq . Averroes et 1'Averrotisme : p. zoo . Footnote  | Questions , one of two important original works of his , he tells his hypothetical questioner I learned from my Arabian masters under the leading of reason ; you , however , captivated by the appearance of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority be called than a halter ? Just as brute beasts are led where one wills by a halter , so the authority of past writers leads not a few of you into danger , held and bound as you are by bestial credulity . ' In this same work , we find Adelard discussing questions which , for their diversity and sanity , give the book an extraordinary air of modernity . The following selection illustrates something of their scope : Why is the earth suspended in mid-air , and how is it maintained ? Why is sea-water salt ? What is the cause of earthquakes ? thunder ? lightning ? Why do winds travel along the earth 's surface and not in an upward direction ? If the earth were pierced , how far would a stone , thrown down the hole , fall ? How do rivers succeed in maintaining a constant flow ? While few of the questions asked by him were original , 2 no small credit attaches to him for his cool , unprejudiced treatment of them . He has little of the vested interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time he is no novelty-monger , for in one passage of another work of his ? De Eodem et Diverso ? he speaks impatiently and indeed contemptuously of those who harass our ears with daily novelties ' and of the new Platos and Aristotles to whom each day gives birth , who with unblushing front proclaim alike , things which they know and of which they know nothing and whose supreme trust is in excessive verbosity ' . s For us his own work is important mainly as exemplifying another phase of the intellectual awakening and as revealing a hitherto almost unsuspected awareness of the importance of investigation into the cause of natural phenomena . Footnote  | William of Conches , a contemporary of Adelard 's , is important for much the same reason . He is essentially an apostle of reason in matters of natural science . To him the argument of his obscurantist co-religionists that we do not know how such a thing can be but we know that God can do it ' calls forth the contemptuous answer that God can make a cow out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore show some reason why a thing is so , or cease to hold that it is so . ' 2 It is not difficult to see why the attempt to put this precept into practice should have brought William into conflict with the ecclesiastical hierarchy . Under pressure he withdrew some of his more heterodox contentions , such as his rejection of a part of the Genesis account of the Creation , including the miraculous birth of the first woman , but he never seems to have given up his views concerning the superiority of reason over authority in matters of scientific speculation . In spite of the clerical strictures his work Dragmaticon 2 enjoyed a wide circulation , as is attested by the number of manuscripts of it at Vienna , Munich , Paris , Canterbury , Oxford and other European centres of learning . It was , moreover , frequently cited by writers in the next century . The inspiration of this new intellectual movement did not immediately permeate the geographical literature of the period . We shall look in vain for radical changes either in the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Liber Floridus of Lambert of St. Omer and the anonymous De Imagine Mundi ( c. zroo ) are both in the orthodox tradition . The author of the latter treatise states that he has placed nothing in his work except that which is approved by the best authorities ' who , needless to say , are men like Isidore and Orosius . Lambert acted upon the same principle.3 Footnote  | By the thirteenth century the new leaven of experimental method was visibly working upon the old lump of patristic learning , and , although it would be untrue to say that the latter was transformed by it , a perusal of the geographical writings of such men as Thomas of Cantimpre , Bartholomew of England ( Anglicus ) , 1 Robert Grosseteste , 2 John of Holywood ( Sacrobosco ) , Vincent of Beauvais , Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon can not fail to convince us that an intellectual renaissance is in progress . The Tractatus de Sphaera of John of Holywood ( Joannes Sacrobosco , as he styled himself ) reflects the changing times as well as any work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely slight , comprising four chapters , which treat respectively of the terrestrial globe , of circles great and small , of the rising and setting of the stars and of the orbits and movements of the planets . Moreover , it is an entirely unoriginal work , adding nothing to Ptolemy 's Almagest and his Arabic commentators . But by reason of its very simplicity and respect for authority , new and old , it achieved a remarkable popularity during the later years of the Middle Ages , and was still studied as the classic textbook on the subject long after Barozzi in 1570 had pointed out its numerous errors . It ran through no fewer than twentyfive printed editions before 1soo , and another forty editions appeared before it was finally voted to be out of date . Equally popular , but very far removed from it in size and content is the work ( c. 1250 ) of Vincent of Beauvais . Finding the multitude of books too great for the ordinary reader , this Dominican Friar decided to collect certain extracts from the existing body of literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Speculum Doctrinale and Speculum Historiale , treating respectively of natural science , philosophy and history . The result is an encyclopaedic work of a size hitherto unparalleled . It fills four large folio volumes in the early printed editions as against one octavo volume of Isidore 's Etymologiae . Almost half of the Footnote  | work , amounting to some 3,000 folio pages , deals with scientific topics . It is essentially an encyclopaedia culled from existing encyclopaedias . In the words of his generalis prologus the work is a collection of certain flowers gathered according to my modicum of faculty from every one I have been able to read , whether of our Catholic doctors or the Gentile philosophers and poets . Especially have I drawn from them what seemed to pertain either to the building up of our dogma , or to moral instruction , or to the incitement of charity , or to the mystic explanation of its truth . At the same time , the Speculum draws on more sources than any of its predecessors . Besides the ever-present Isidore and Pliny , the newly recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. Avicenna and Averroes ) , and , significantly , quite a number of more recent writers , such as Adelard of Bath and William of Conches , are cited . An even more significant sign of the times is the fact that his geographical data on Asia include the contemporary narrative of John of Plano Carpini and Simon of St. Quentin . The arrangement of the Speculum is , however , in the accepted tradition , not only in its minutely scholastic classification and subdivision ? the Speculum Naturale alone is divided into 32 books of 3,718 chapters ? but in the subordination of everything to the biblical sequence of events . Thus the Speculum Naturale treats of natural science in accordance with the order of the six days ' Creation ; the Speculum 1 ) octrinale starts with the fall of man and discusses the various forms of philosophy by which he may rise again ; the Speculum Historiale deals with the story of Adam and his descendants . ) The topographical chapters of the Speculum Naturale , with the exception of those on Tartary , are thoroughly historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . Frequently Vincent does nothing more than excerpt passages from his authorities . Thus , in speaking of the Ocean , ' he first of all cites Aristotle 's opinion , then Isidore 's , that of the De Imagine Mundi and finally Adelard 's . Similarly his treatment of the River Nile is simply a compilation of the relevant passages from the works of Isidore , Solinus , Comestor , Plato , Deuteronomy , Avicenna and Seneca , in that order . Here and there the Speculum savours rather strongly of plagiarism , whole sections being taken from the works of previous compilers like Bartholomew of England and Thomas of Cantimpre , while a large portion consists of verbal repetition of Pliny 's Natural History . On the other hand , his work does not include everything that is in previous medieval writers on nature , and the assumption made by many specialists in the study of medieval culture , that the Speculum Naturale is an adequate reflection of medieval natural science and that Vincent is sure to mention any previous writer or treatise , is far from true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkly and not face to face . ' 2 In the almost contemporary work of that great Dominican Friar , 3 Albert the Great ( Albertus Magnus ) , 4 there is much more originality . We are assured by one writer that he is original even when he seems to copy.5 The spirit of inquiry Footnote  | is also more generally active . Thus , as a commentator of Aristotle , Albert is quite ready to question the validity of his master 's arguments . I think that Aristotle must have spoken from the opinions of his predecessors and not from the truth of demonstration or experiment . ' He who believes that Aristotle was God , ought to believe that he never erred . If one regards him as man , then surely he may err as well as we . ' 1 In sentences such as these incidentally , Albert adumbrates the principles which informed his mind . As he puts it in another place : It is not the business of natural science to accept implicitly whatever may have been said , but to search for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experience is the best teacher of all such things . ' 2 His very chapter headings frequently suggest an antithesis between ancient authority and modern experimental method , e.g. , Concerning the Iris of the Moon and what the Ancients have said of it and what the Moderns have tested by experiment ' . Albertus lived in an eager age ; it was importunate for the enlargement of its knowledge . At the same time , it badly needed an interpreter , one who would attempt to expound the newly-acquired knowledge and fit it into the scholastic Christian scheme . This was Albertus ' great accomplishment . It is our intention ' , he wrote at the beginning of his exposition of Aristotle 's Physics , to make all the said parts intelligible to the Latins ' . And he did it , not only for this single work , but for many others as well . Herein lies the main value of his work . On the purely experimental side , he achieved very little ; even his own personal observations of natural phenomena do not seem to have led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work Footnote  | ( contained in Tractatus III of De Natura Locorum ) , it tells us little that is new , and its statistics , impressive in their verisimilitude , merely deceive.l It is when confronted with controversy that Albert is seen to best advantage . Thus , in discussing the question of the habitability of the Southern Hemisphere , a subject which never failed to appeal to the medieval scholar or to reveal his intellectual calibre , Albert shows an unusually clear perception of the problems involved . Having satisfied himself that there is ample evidence , such as the presence of cities in southern India and of Ethiopian tribes near the Equator , for believing that the region which seemed to the Ancients to be a Torrid Zone is habitable ' , 2 he proceeds to investigate the question of whether the quarter of the earth which stretches from the Equator to the South Pole is habitable ' .3 He considers , first of all , the arguments against the theory . His chief opponent amongst the Ancients is , of course , Ptolemy . The arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these is the straightness of the course of the sun round the southern tropic in its approach to Sagittarius and in its progress in Capricorn . The second cause is the perpendicular fall of the sun 's rays on those parts . . . and the third is the proximity of the mass of the sun ... . He disallows the validity of these arguments , countering them with the Aristotelian view that between the heat of the equatorial zone and the cold of the southern polar zone there must be a mean temperate zone which is habitable as in the northern hemisphere . Then , assuming that there must be inhabitants in a habitable region ? ' for if it can be inhabited , then it would be vain unless it were inhabited by plants , animals and men ' 4 ? he attempts to anticipate the oft-raised Footnote.  | objection that there is no first-hand evidence of such men ever communicating with those of the northern hemisphere , by suggesting two possibilities . In the southern part of the Torrid zone ( according to a certain philosopher ' Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be magnetic . The quality of the magnetism is such that it holds back flesh and blood ( carnes humanas ) just as the ordinary magnet holds iron . It is on this account that no one can cross them . But Albert continues I do not think that this hindrance is operative everywhere , but only in certain places . Now in the survey of the world carried out under Caesar Augustus , we read that Augustus sent messengers to the kings of Egypt and Ethiopia who were to secure ships and the expenses necessary for those whom he had sent to make the expedition . When they came near the Equator , they found marshy places into which the Nile flowed and stony places which they could cross neither by ship nor on foot . They therefore returned without accomplishing their errand . I myself have seen some men who give as a reason why the mountains are not crossed the barren and precipitous nature of them , but it seems incredible to me that they should be impassable everywhere . I believe it is truer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this , on account of vast deserts of sand rendered waste by the fierceness of the sun ; this makes the undertaking impossible unless provision is made for a long journey . It is for this reason , I think , that there is little or no intercourse between the men who live beyond the Equator in southern climes and those who live with us in the northern hemisphere.l In his critical attitude towards authority and in his wide and discriminating use of sources of information , the Dominian Albert the Great is equalled only by the Franciscan Roger Bacon . Although the two men do not seem ever to have had any direct contact , they had much in common intellectually , and this notwithstanding Bacon 's contempt of the rival order . In his Opus Tertium he speaks of a great man in Paris ( Albert ? I homas Aquinas ? ) who is set up as an authority in the schools , Footnote  | like Averroes or Aristotle , but whose works merely display infinite puerile vanity . . . superfluous verbiage and the omission of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's judgements on the fallibility of the ancients might well have been delivered by Albert . Consider , in this connexion , the following appraisal of Aristotle 's work found in the Opus Majus . Of all famous philosophers Aristotle alone , with his followers , is stamped with the approval of all wise men , since he organized the branches of philosophy , as far as was possible in his age ; but nevertheless he did not reach the limit of wisdom . ... 2 Or again : Not the philosophers only , but even the sacred authors have been subject to some human infirmity in this respect , for they have retracted very many of their own statements . . . . Even Paul withstood Peter , as he himself confesses . Augustine finds fault with the views of Jerome : and Jerome contradicts Augustine in many places . . . . Since , then , the facts are as stated , we should not give adherence to all that we have heard and read , but we should examine most carefully , the philosophical statements of older writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their errors.3 In view of this we are not surprised to find that Bacon shares Albert 's willingness to depart from the narrow path of patristic orthodoxy when the occasion seems to demand it . Here , for example , is what Bacon says of the extent and geographical position of the habitable earth . Ptolemy , in his book on the Arrangement of the Sphere , maintains that about a sixth part of the earth is habitable , due to the water , and that all the rest is covered by water . Therefore in the Almagest in the second book , he states that habitation is not known except in a quarter of the earth , namely , in that in which we dwell ; whose length is from east to west and is one half of the Footnote  | equinoctial circle ( i.e. equator ) and its width is from the equinoctial circle to the pole . . . . But Aristotle maintains at the end of the second book of the Heavens and the World ( i.e. De Caelo et Mundo ) that more than a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sea is small between the end of Spain on the west and the beginning of India on the east . Seneca in the fifth book on Natural History says that this sea is navigable in a very few days if the wind is favourable . And Pliny teaches in his Natural History that it was navigated from the Arabic Gulf to Cadiz . . . therefore the width of the earth through which the Red Sea 2 extends is very great ; from which fact it is clear that the beginning of India in the east is far distant from us and from Spain , since the distance is so great from the beginning of Arabia toward India . From the end of Spain beneath the earth the sea is so small that it can not cover three-quarters of the earth . This fact is proved by the weight of another consideration . For Esdras states in the fourth book that six parts of the earth are habitable and the seventh is covered by water . . . therefore , according to these facts the extent of the habitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be small.3 In other words , Bacon accepts the specious continental ' , rather than the orthodox oceanic ' theory of the distribution of land and water.4 Continuing , he argues that toward the poles of the world the water must abound because those parts are cold , owing to their distance , but cold multiplies moisture , and therefore from pole to pole the water runs down into the body of the sea and extends for no great width between the end of Spain and the beginning of India , and is called the ocean ) Now , although the acceptance of this unorthodox theory implied belief in the existence of land ? as Bacon himself readily admits ? south of the Equator , he is careful not to oolirnd the susceptibilities of the Church by postulating an antipodal landmass . Indeed , he appears to be aware of the i.e. Quaestiones Naturales. 2 i.e. Indian Ocean . Footnote  | danger of departing too far from the path of orthodoxy , for he proceeds , painstakingly , to convince his readers that his view was not only essentially reasonable ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was even compatible with certain statements of the Fathers themselves . In speaking of the land in the southern hemisphere , he confesses that it has not been measured in our times , nor have we found it attested , as it should be , in the books of the ancients ; nor is this strange , since more than half of the quarter of the earth in which we are , is unknown to us . . . . Similarly , if we speak about the two other quarters , and consider natural processes in accordance with natural philosophy , we find that those quarters are not covered by water as the majority of mathematicians estimate . For since the Poles and regions near them are of the same remoteness from the sun and the planets in accordance with the relative position of the poles to the paths of the planets at the middle of the world , between the two tropics , there must , in accordance with these facts be equal dispositions of land and water in our quarter and in the quarter beyond the equinoctial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter beyond the equinoctial circle there must accordingly be much land that is habitable ; at least as far as the regions whose latitudes reach 66 degrees , just as is the case here.l But how did Bacon know that these lands were habitable ? Pliny and Ptolemy among the ancients and Ambrose and Basil among the Fathers had said so . We discover from Pliny that there is habitation on the tropic of Capricorn or beyond it . For a region in India is called Pathalis with a very noted port , as he says , where the shadows fall only in the south ; therefore dwellers here have the sun always to the north . He states the same thing in the Sixth book of the Natural History respecting the island of Taprobane in India . . . . But not only the philosophers , but also the sacred writers like Ambrose , in the Hexaemeron , and Basil , agree in the matter of this diversity Footnote  | of shadows . For in the fourth book Ambrose says There are people located to the south in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south ' . Because he speaks expressly of shadows to the south , he can be understood to have reference to those who have shadows falling to the south only , namely , dwellers on the tropic of Capricorn and beyond it ; because the sun is always north of them except at one time when it is over their heads on the tropic of Capricorn . ) We see , then , that although Bacon occasionally parts company with the Fathers , he is far from being a rebel against ecclesiastical authority . On the contrary , he asserts categorically , at the beginning of the Opus Majus , that there is no fundamental opposition between pagan and Christian wisdom , for there is only one perfect wisdom . . . and from the roots of this wisdom all truth has sprung ' .2 If Bacon shares the intellectual outlook of Albert , he is equally heir to his limitations . With the exception of a reference to the Rubruck expedition , his regional description of the world is essentially the same as Albert 's , and , consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and this notwithstanding his assurance that he went over sea and to various lands and to annual fairs ' , 3 in order that he might see the things of Nature with his own eyes . Here and there Bacon appears to have known less than some of the Ancients . Concerning Ethiopia , for instance , he knew considerably less Footnote  | than Ptolemy . We quote his account as showing the historical ' nature of his geography . Between the straits of the Red Sea and the Sea of Ethiopia , l Ethiopia begins . Where the latitude of the region is about sixteen degrees and the length of the longest day about thirteen hours according to Ptolemy in the Almagest ? Pliny also is in practical agreement in his Sixth Book 2 and his second chapter ? is Saba , an island formed by the Nile , the royal city of Ethiopia , concerning which we read in Isaiah the labour of Egypt , and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans ' .3 This is Meroe which is at the remotest point in Ethiopia and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... 4 and it is mentioned in Ezekiel xxvii . . . . This city is distant from the sea of Ethiopia about 700 miles according to Pliny in the sixth book . It is situated upon the first climate from which the climate receives the name of Diameroes.5 Candace , a woman , was ruler there.s . . . Where the latitude of the region is about the same on the shore of the Red Sea is the city of Ptolemais , founded by Ptolemaeus Philadelphus for the earliest hunting of elephants . . . . Then beyond , in the same latitude but towards the west , between Meroe and Ptolemais , 4820 stadia distant from Ptolemais , as Pliny states and Bede confirms . . . is Berenice , the city of the Ethiopian Troglodytes . Scripture mentions these Troglodytes in the second book of the Apocrypha. ... 7 According to Isidore , in the ninth book , there are three principal tribes of Ethiopians , the Hesperi , Garamantes and Indi . The Hesperi are in the west , the Garamantes in the middle , the Indi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , many other Ethiopians joined to these tribes in different places , much degraded also from that which human nature should be , whose names , localities and manners it is not within the scope of the present plea to give ... . Ethiopia terminates below at the Red Sea eastward , with Africa to the west and Egypt in the middle between these extremes . In this middle division is the city of Syene , of which Ezekiel speaks Footnote  | expressly in chapters xxix and xxx . . . . Syene is the lower limit of Ethiopia and the remotest part of Egypt . . . but Meroe is the upper 1 limit of the known inhabited portion of the earth , according to Pliny . . . . From Syene to Meroe according to Pliny .. . are 5,000 stadia . . . . Syene is located on the Tropic of Cancer.2 Fortunately , Bacon 's fame as a geographer does not rest solely upon descriptions such as these . As with Albert it is his methods rather than his materials that are valuable . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than constructive , we must recollect that in medieval times there were plenty of wrong ideas to combat . It was not easy to find a firm foundation on which to build or materials without some hidden defect . So Roger Bacon and Albert the Great , by devoting much of their space to the collation and criticism of earlier works , avoided novel theories ? a wise precaution for their times . While both men urged the value of personal experiment in scientific pursuits , neither of them appears to have been a great experimenter . One of Albertus ' biographers declares : I do not know of his undertaking a single experiment in order to solve a physiological or physical problem . ' 3 Of laboratory experiment , of scientific instruments , of exact measurements , they had no more notion apparently than their contemporaries . Consequently , to regard either of them as a pioneer of unfettered scientific research is to give credit where none is due . They were essentially exponents of scholasticism , standing firm for the truth of the Christian revelation , and seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was understood by the Church . They never attempted to exercise , nor did they permit others to exercise , that wider rationality which seeks to embrace the whole of human experience without such arbitrary boundaries as dogmas prescribed by authority . They wrote as clerics for clerics , to promote the welfare of the Church and Christianity , and their sole motive in writing Footnote  | was to promote a sound and saving knowledge of God . For this reason their discussions do little more than confirm the evidences of a changing outlook on life and learning which we have obtained from other and earlier sources . Neither man had many immediate followers . No doubt the paralysing mists of Scotian dialectic ' , which enveloped the study of Greek science in the following century , had something to do with it , as Bridges surmises , l while it may well be that the relatively belated publication of their works , ' after the invention of the printing press , provides a contributory reason of some relevance . At the same time it would be an error to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to posterity . Here and there throughout Europe the memory of it survived as a stimulating force , and kept the spirit of scientific inquiry alive until the Renaissance of the fifteenth century . We must never forget , of course , the link ' between the Opus Majus and the discovery of America.3 The arguments used by Bacon to establish the existence of habitable land at no great distance westward from the coast of Spain were repeated almost verbatim by Pierre d'Ailly , and , however uncertain the premises and unsound the conclusions may appear to a modern reader , they were seized on by Columbus and his contemporaries and stimulated exploration to the west and south . As Bacon 's arguments reveal , King Solomon 's Mines were located in the far distant S.E. extremity of India , and Columbus ' belief that he had come within reach of them , first in Espanola and later in Darien , was not an absurd one in the light of current theory.4 Footnote.  | teaching as to the importance of applied mathematics and of the experimental approach to science profoundly influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the pioneers of the English geographical Renaissance . ' Once the Greek and Arabic classics ' had been translated into Latin , their further translation into the vernacular was only a matter of time . Latin , then as now , was an unknown tongue as far as the masses were concerned , and so the spread and popularization of knowledge was dependent upon oral communication and translation into the spoken languages of the day . In the ninth century King Alfred was lamenting that , although the Churches throughout the whole of England stood filled with treasures and books , and there was also a great multitude of God 's servants , yet they had very little knowledge of books , because they could not understand anything of them because they were not written in their own language ( i.e. Anglo-Saxon ) .2 It was because of this that he set about translating some books which are most needful for all men to know , into the language which we can all understand . . . ' 3 In the same century Raban Maur , for all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encouraged preaching in German . With the aid of his favourite pupil , Walafrid , he prepared German glosses and Latin ? German glossaries for Scripture . Before his death popular translations of the Gospels had appeared . Then , in the last part of the tenth century and the first part of the eleventh , Notker the German , 4 a monk of St. Gall , made German translations of Boethius , Virgil , Terence , and Capella ( De Nuptiis ) . And before the tenth century was out , Bede 's De Natura Rerum was translated into Anglo-Saxon . ' Footnote  | By the end of the twelfth century these languages were being increasingly employed , not only for speech , but for professional and diplomatic uses . But scholarship was still largely the monopoly of the clergy . As they continued to write in the language of their liturgies , they did nothing to promote the laicization of learning . Consequently , few classical works made an early appearance in vernacular tongues . However , several geographical works of a semi-popular character found their way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among these are the Image du Monde , commonly attributed to a certain Gossuin of Metz , and the Norwegian Konungs Skuggsjd ( = The King 's Mirror ) , of unknown authorship . The former , originally composed in metrical form , but almost immediately turned into prose , is the work of a well-read man . Many authors , both classical and medieval , are quoted and sometimes copied word for word . Notwithstanding , it is more than a compilation and contains sufficient of the grotesque 1 and unexpected to assure for itself a long-lived success . So popular did it prove , in fact , that it was soon re-written in prose form and translated into a number of other spoken tongues , including German and English.2 The latter work of approximately the same date , viz. c . I250-60 , is geographically of much greater value . In spite of his remoteness the author was better informed than his French contemporary and he was obviously far more intelligent . Although well acquainted with much of the earlier mediaeval literature , he has liberated himself to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many fabulous people who were still common amongst much later authors , nor about whirlpools , nor the curdled and dark sea , but instead we have fresh and copious information about the Northern regions ... 3 On subjects of special interest to northern dwellers , such as Footnote  | glaciers , icebergs and geysers ( the author had lived in Iceland ) the King 's Mirror is without rival . He writes of Greenland in the following authentic terms : There are small portions of the land which are thawed , but all the rest is covered with ice , and the people do not know whether the country is large or small , since all the mountains and valleys are covered with ice , so that no one can find his way in ... . Men have often tried to go up the country , upon the highest mountains in various places , to look around them , to see whether they could find any part that was thawed and habitable , but they have not found any such , except where people are now living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The land is cold , and the glacier has this nature , that he sends out cold gusts which drive away the showers from his face , and he usually keeps his head bare of cloud e . But his near neighbours have to suffer for it , in that all other lands which lie in the neighbourhood get much bad weather from him and all the cold blasts that he throws off fall upon them.2 In view of such descriptions as these , and they abound on the pages of the Mirror , we are hardly surprised to find Dr. Sarton hailing it as the most important geographical work of Christendom in the first half of the thirteenth century ' .3 Remarkable as it is geographically , the Konungs Skuggsjd can hardly claim to be the most famous medieval vernacular writing , for none is so well known as that curious English document entitled The Travels of Sir John Mandeville . ' While it is probably true that all but a few pages of it were plagiarized from existing literary sources by a certain doctor , Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's having seen with his own eyes all the countries he describes is very remote , the work has unquestionable value as illustrating the fourteenth-century layman 's idea of the world . The earth he tells us is full large and full great , and holds in Footnote  | roundness and about environ , by above and by beneath , 20,425 miles , after the opinion of old wise astronomers 1 ; and their sayings I reprove nought . But , after my little wit , it seemeth me , saving their reverence , that it is more . And for me to have better understanding I say thus . Be there imagined a figure that hath a great compass . And , about the point of the great compass that is clept the centre , be made another little compass . Then after , be the great compass devised by lines in many parts , and that all the lines meet at the centre . So , that in as many parts as the great compass shall be departed , in as many shall be departed the little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less . Now then , be the great compass represented for the firmament , and the little compass represented for the earth . Now then , the firmament is devised by astronomers in twelve signs , and every sign is devised in thirty degrees ; that is , 36o degrees that the firmament hath above . Also , be the earth devised in as many parts as the firmament , and let every part answer to a degree of the firmament . And wit it well , after the authors of astronomy , 700 furlongs of earth answer to a degree of the firmament , and these be 87 miles and four furlongs . Now be that here multiplied by 36o sithes , and then they be 31,500 miles every of eight furlongs , after miles of our country . ' So much hath the earth in roundness and of height environ , after mine opinion and mine understanding.3 Footnote  | On the question of the Antipodes he affirms : I have gone toward the parts meridional , that is , toward the South , and I have found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far I have gone more further in those countries that I have found that star more high ; so that toward the High Lybia it is eighteen degrees of height and certain minutes ( of the which sixty minutes make a degree ) . After going by sea and by land toward this country of that I have spoken , and to other . isles and lands beyond that country , I have found the Star Antarctic of thirty-three degrees of height and more minutes . And if I had had company and shipping for to go more beyond , I trow well , in certain , that we should have seen all the roundness of the firmament all about . . . . I say you certainly that men may environ all the earth of the world , as well under as above , and turn again to his country , that had company and shipping and conduct .

For all the parts of sea and of land have their opposites , habitable or trepassable , and they of this half and beyond half ... 2 Strangely similar in its implications is the contemporary Latin work entitled Directorium ad Passagium Transmarinum.3 Without attempting to substantiate or refute the claim it makes to be an authentic travel narrative , we may use it as revealing some of the more popular geographical notions of the time . Like the Travels , the Directory clearly postulates a habitable equatorial zone and a southern landmass of considerable proportions . Thus the writer speaks of having passed the equatorial regions into a Southern latitude where he no longer saw the arctic Pole Star , but in its place the Antarctic ' Footnote  | at an elevation of 24 ? , while he avers that certain merchants penetrated to a point where the elevation became S40.1 As Beazley demonstrates in his edition of this work , it is not beyond the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madagascar was already known through the writings of Marco Polo , 2 so that the author may conceivably have penetrated to a point in the South of that island where the Antarctic star would have an elevation of 24 ? .3 Whether he did or not must ever be a matter of conjecture , but it does at least point to a belief in a traversable and habitable torrid zone . That the writer was himself out to prove this hypothesis is plain from another passage of the document , wherein he concludes that there must be more habitable land to the South and East than is commonly supposed , and that the concept of the Antipodes is neither frivolous nor false . Exactly where fact ends and fiction begins in these narratives we have no means of telling ; nor does it matter materially , seeing we are more concerned with popular beliefs than with the precise determination of world horizons . What is important is that stories of this kind exerted a profound influence upon the laity of the late Middle Ages . Travellers ' tales ' have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , if for no other , that men universally have a natural tendency to assert , and a liking to hear , things that smack of the sensational , the extravagant and the incredible , and to fly in the face both of reason and experience . Lord , I believe , help Thou my unbelief , ' expresses a common attitude of mind , in things material as well as spiritual , and in ancient and modern times alike . It requires little imagination therefore , to conjure up the impact of such tales as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville upon the minds of men living in an age that was supremely the age of faith . The reading of them , as also of the Mirabilia ( or wonder books ) , the Bestiaries 4 ( or animal books ) and the Footnote  | Lapidaries ( stories of the properties , mostly magical , of gems ) thrilled not only the common people but men of education as well , and inspired the pictorial illustrations of many famous mappaemundi.l Indeed it would be difficult to over-emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval and renaissance thought , whether in geography , natural history or zoology . As late as 1505 , we find Duarte Pacheco , the great Portuguese navigator and scientist , speaking one moment with the exactitude of a modern pilot ' book and the next about the existence of mile-long serpents ! 2 When we recollect that Pliny 's Natural History , Solinus ' Collectanea ... and the anonymous Physiologos ( a collection of stories based upon the marvellous peculiarities of animals , composed c . A.D. 200 , to which Christian allegories were subsequently added ) , were three of the chief source-books of the Middle Ages , the domination exercised by these teratological traditions is readily inderstood.3  | THE travellers ' tales ' and wonder-books of the fiction monger paved the way for the even stranger stories of the explorer . The apathy of the scholar notwithstanding , these stories had a large currency and gradually succeeded in moulding geographical opinion , learned and popular alike . It was from the South that the first reports of exploration came . Soon after the time of Al-Masudi , Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lands south of the Sahara . By 1x76 the Sudanese kingdom of Ghana ( now one of the lost cities of Africa ) had come to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Moslem Empire . This rendered free movement across the Sahara possible and opened up the way for the commercial exploitation of the Negro lands . Many years elapsed , however , before the peoples of Christian Europe figured directly in this trade , partly from their anti-Moslem prejudice , and partly because any organized participation in that trade would have evoked the bitterest opposition of the Moor . It was not until friendly intercourse with Moslems in Spain and Sicily during the twelfth century had revealed to Christian peoples the existence of a civilization in the interior of the continent , that they began to show any lively interest in the Sudan . Then arose the desire , above all , to penetrate into the country of Wangara , where , it was said , there was much gold . The first indisputable indication of this interest dates from the year 1223 when the Genoese erected a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders from  | Timbuktu . We may take it that first-hand European contact with the Sudan was established not long afterwards . The earliest authentic eye-witness account of the region , by a Christian , was given in the year 1283 . It was then that Ramon Lull wrote in his Blanquerna about the messenger of a certain cardinal having undertaken a journey southwards across the Sahara . He found a caravan of 6,000 camels laden with salt leaving a town by name Tibalbert and going to that country wherein is the source of the River Damiata.l So many people did this messenger find there that in fifteen days all the salt was sold : and these men were black and adored idols . In that land is an island in the middle of a great lake and on that island there lives a dragon to whom all people of that island do sacrifice . . . and the people marvelled greatly at the messenger , because he was a white man and a Christian : for never before had they heard of any Christian coining to that land . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knowledge of the Sudan was then beginning to filter through to southern Europe . There entered the Papal courtl a Gentile who came from a southern land which lies within the regions of the desert and from a city which is called Ghana . In that land there were many princes who adored idols and likewise adored the sun and stars and the birds and beasts . ' The stranger goes on to relate how that is his quest for the true religion he journeyed through divers ds to inquire what that thing might be which was worthy adoration above all things else ' , and how that eventually had arrived at Rome . As a result of his mission , the ire sent friars that had learnt Arabic , the which friars t to the Saracen king . . . and , by the grace of God , converted the Saracen king and a great number of plc ' It is highly tantalizing that the narrative should stop short  | with such a brief notice of these lands , but it must be confessed that Lull 's interests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Sudan we have to look to the next century and to an Arab , not to a European . He was Ibn Abdallah Mohammed , surnamed Ibn Batuta ? ' the traveller not of an age , but of Islam ' .1 Born at Tangier at the beginning of the fourteenth century , he manifested his zeal for travel at an early age , for when only twenty-two he undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca , visiting at the same time the Arab colonies on the East African coast . In this , of course , he was merely following the trail of Masudi . After eighteen years of almost continuous journeying in China , Malay , Sumatra , Central Asia and , perhaps , in the Arctic , he returned in 1352 to his native land , only to set out shortly afterwards for the Nile of the Negroes ' . His narrative , written presumably on his return from the Sudan , is rich in the lore of the times , and throws considerable light upon the question of the medieval knowledge of Africa . The following quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved in Cambridge . Having followed the regular caravan route across the Sahara from Sigilmesa to Tagaza , Batuta fords himself in a country where , owing to the exigencies of the climate , there is neither water , bird or tree , but only sand . . . blown about by the wind so that no vestige of a road remains . People can travel , therefore , only by guides from the merchants , of which there are many . . . . We passed it ( i.e the desert ) in ten days , thence to Abu Latin . . . . This is the first district of Sudan . . . . The native 's clothing is all brought from Egypt . The greater part of the inhabitants are merchants . . . . I then proceeded . . . to Mali , 2 the distance of which is a journey of 24 days , made with effort . . . . After ten days from leaving Abu Latin we came to the village Zaghari which is large and inhabited by black merchants . Among these live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote  | then left this place and came to the great river which is the Nile ( i.e. Niger ) ; upon it is the town of Karsanju from which the Nile descends to Kabara , then to Zaga , the inhabitants of which were the first to embrace Islam . . . . From this place the Nile descends to Tambucutu , then Kawkaw , l and proceeds to the town of Muli , which is the extreme district of Mali 2 ; it goes on to Yuwi 3 the greatest district of Sudan . . . no white man can enter here .... The Nile then descends from this place to the countries of Nubia , the inhabitants of which are Christians , then to I ) ongola .... The Nile then descends to the Cataracts which terminate the regions of Sudan . ... 4 And so the narrative continues , carrying throughout unmistakable signs of its being the work of an eye-witness . ' I'hc writer is content to describe what he has seen and seldom , if ever , allows his imagination to have free rein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niger , and so makes it impossible for us to envisage his idea of the continent as a whole . That his silence is to be construed as arising from ignorance is clear from a little passage dealing with the eastern coasts of Africa . In speaking of Kulwa ( Quiloa ) , Batuta says : A merchant told me that the town of Sofala is half a month 's journey from Kulwa and one month 's journey from Yuwi , in the country of Limiyin , 5 and that gold is brought from Yuwi to Sofala ' 6 While it is true that this statement is made in the name of a fellowtraveller , there is little reason for supposing that it was not 13atuta 's own view . At all events , he makes no criticism of it . Three things , in the main , emerge from the reading of I3atuta 's African travels . In the first place it elicits the fact of extensive and far from inaccurate knowledge of the Sudan . Footnote  | His theory that the Niger flows eastwards is a distinct advance upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrates that there was commercial and religious traffic across the Sahara on a big scale at this time , and that north African and possibly European Moslems were actually in residence at the chief marts of the Sudan . Thirdly , that the negro converts to Islam were regularly undertaking the pilgrimage to Mecca . At last , therefore , the agelong speculations concerning tropical Africa were being replaced by authentic accounts of civilization in a region which , by many , had been thought to be uninhabitable ? a belief which was fondly held by the schoolmen long after this time . In view of the vitality of these Senegal-Niger peoples , it is a matter for some surprise that so little knowledge should be forthcoming about the regions beyond them . In none of the geographical writings of the Middle Ages is mention made of Arab or Christian contact overland with the Gulf of Guinea . This circumstance can hardly be fortuitous . The most obvious explanation is furnished by the climate and natural vegetation of the southern Sudan . Once in the savanna zone the camel ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desert , while the fly-infested swamps with their unwholesome miasmas effectively barred the progress of the unacclimatized Arab . Even so , it will be objected that these facts alone can not explain the erroneous information that was in general circulation regarding these lands . So far were some travellers from knowing what physical conditions obtained there that they conceived them to be desert , and , without exception , travellers had only the vaguest and most fantastic notions about the inhabitants of that zone . As late as the sixteenth century they were described , by Duarte Pacheco , as having the faces and teeth of dogs and tails like dogs ' .1 As for the location of their gold marts , where the 1 Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis , op. cit. : I , 29 and Appendix No . III . The pre-dynastic Egyptians ornamented themselves with tails , as do some modern Negro tribes for ceremonial occasions , while the prognathous negro frequently admits of the description dog-like ' .  | exchange of salt for gold was carried out silently and often without any direct intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . Pacheco could only give the distance they were from the coast , but not the direction . Al-Idrisi only tells us that they were eight days ' journey from Ghana ? which is a lost city ? again without indicating the direction . Cadamostol is scarcely more helpful . However , when it is recalled that these frontier ' negro tribes were frequently being raided by their northern Moorish neighbours and sold into captivity , it is small wonder that they should prefer to remain unseen when bartering gold , or that they should misrepresent the character of their mineralproducing hinterland ? when caught . Repulsed , but nothing daunted by the geographical obstacles to their overland advance , traders soon turned their attention to the navigation of the adjacent seas . In this the Arabs were to play but little part , for they had an ingrained horror of the Atlantic ? ' the Green Sea of Darkness ' . Even Idrisi dwelt at length upon the thick and perpetual darkness brooding over the Western Ocean . The doctors of the Koran held that a man mad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . Ibn Said went further , asserting that no one had ever done this for fear of the whirlpools which would most certainly destroy any adventurer.2 As late as the generation immediately preceding that of Prince Henry the Navigator , another light of the Moslem world declared that the Western Ocean was boundless , so that ships dare not venture out of sight of land , for even if the sailors knew the direction of the winds , they would not know whither those winds would carry them . As there is no inhabited land beyond , they would run the risk of being lost in mist , fog or vapour.3 All the same at least one Arab , Ibn Fathima by name , ran Footnote  | that risk and lived to tell the tale . Since the account of his voyage , which , paradoxically enough , is reported by Ibn Said , is circumstantial and not without its significance for the history of African exploration ( for Cape Branco was rounded on the voyage ) , we will quote it at length . Ibn Fathima relates how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamtha near the shores of the Environing Sea and embarked upon a waiting ship . The vessel was eventually shipwrecked , going ashore on some shoals . The sailors had lost their way , and not knowing where they were , they abandoned the ship and went in a row-boat to reconnoitre . At times the boat made its way through patches of marine plants ; at others it was raised out of the water by the oars ( sic ) . Having arrived in the middle of the Gulf of Arguim , the sailors were astonished at the great quantity of tunny which were living in those parts . They had not yet sighted land when they found that their provisions were exhausted . On reaching the White mountain some Berbers of the tribe of Godala made signs to them not to approach the mountain ; the sailors did not understand the motive of this action . Nevertheless , they turned northwards and succeeded in rounding the mountain . Then a man appeared who could speak two languages , Arabic and Berber . . . They recounted what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief town of the Godala tribe . This is the town of Tegazza , 11 ? of longitude and 200 north . Following Ibn Fathima , the country occupied by the Godala , although similar to other parts of the Sahara and sandy countries in general , is very suitable for sugar-cane . Indeed the country is watered by five rivers which descend from the White mountain . Ptolemy has made mention of these southern rivers . ' The grounds for identifying the White mountain ' with Cape Branco ( or Blanco ) are these . There is no other cape along the desert coast that in any way merits the appellation of mountain ' .2 Further , the colour of the cliffs is distinctly Footnote  | white and shoals are a feature of the immediate vicinity . ' Again , the Gulf of Arguim to the south-east is a notable tunny ground , the tunny trade having supplied a livelihood for a colony of Moors there from time immemorial . ' The reference to the wealth of marine plant-life strengthens this identification still further , for the sea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants to such an extent that it is hardly an exaggeration for Ibn Fathima to speak of the boat 's progress being impeded . It was on this account that the Portuguese later gave the name of Sargaco ' 3 to this coast . Fathima 's achievement does not appear to have been followed up . His contemporaries , we may take it , were frightened by the perils , rather than stimulated by the prospects of reward . Although he does not point the moral , it is more than probable ? in view of the above-quoted warning ? that Ibn Said reported the voyage with the object of deterring any emulators . Plainly , the Moslem kingdoms had their hands too full with the pursuit of trade and converts to have much time or inclination for solving mysteries that might , after all , prove to be mere will-o ' - the- wisps . In consequence , we must look elsewhere than to the Arabs for the urge to explore . This was supplied to the maritime peoples of Europe about this time by a variety of circumstances , among which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acre to the Saracens in 1291 . This meant the final destruction of the hopes and schemes centring in a Latin land-dominion in the Levant . New outlets , in consequence , had to be found for the spirit of adventure and Wanderlust engendered by the Crusades . Secondly , the quest for the River of Gold ' , the illusory El Dorado of the Middle Ages . The popularity of this subject with the map-makers of the fourteenth and Footnote  | fifteenth centuries is plain testimony to the importance which it assumed ) . Thus the Norman Bethencourt 's professed object in exploring lands to the south of Cape Bojador was , with the help of God , . . . to open the road to the River of Gold . . . ' which , if he succeeded in doing , would have been greatly to the honour and profit of the kingdom of France ' .2 Thirdly , the growing menace of Islam to the peace and prosperity of Christendom . This was making men more and more desirous of finding the realms of the Christian king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject with cartographers . With his aid it was hoped to frustrate the designs of the Moslems . Zurara lays it down as one of the avowed purposes of Prince Henry 's maritime enterprise to seek to know if there were in those parts any Christian Princes , in whom the charity and love of Christ were so ingrained that they would aid him against those enemies of the faith ' . g What evidence is there of European enterprise along the West African coast in the pre-Portuguese period e The obscure thirteenth-century voyages of the Vivaldi brothers need not detain us long , for the information is fragmentary and , in part , unreliable . These men , it is said , set out in I291 in two ships to go by sea to wards the parts of India and bring back useful things for trade ' .

None of the members of the expedition ever returned , but Usodimare who met Cadamosto on his first Footnote  | voyage declares that he spoke to the last surviving descendant ! 1 It is evident that very little weight can be attached to evidence of this sort . Beazley says of it that it looks like an attempt by Usodimare to amuse his creditors with interesting adventures ' .2 We may pass over the voyage of Jaime Ferrer in 1346 to the River of Gold ' for no record of the expedition survives beyond the notice of its departure and purpose.3 We may also dismiss the hypothetical French voyages of the same century , for the fabrication of the evidence for these has been proved once and for all by La Ronciere 4 We come , then , to the anonymous fourteenth-century Spanish Franciscan , 5 about whose work Libro del conoscimiento de todos los regnos y tierras ( c. 1350 ) opinions have differed greatly . Major , who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Conquest of the Canaries , called it a confused compilation of the geographical traditions of the time and a rechauffe of Edrisi ' , 6 while Beazley holds it to be largely a record of an imaginary journey ? La Ronciere says very much the same thing.8 Markham , on the other hand , declares in his Introduction to the Hakluyt Society 's edition of the work that there was nothing within his reach , from which the Franciscan could have pirated his narrative ' .9 In order not to misrepresent the claims of the Friar in the field of African exploration , we will cite his narrative in some Footnote  | detail . He has just returned to Gazula ( the Vivaldi 's Gozora ) from an extensive tour of Northern Africa and the Canaries when he finds some Moors who have armed a galley to go to the Rio del Oro , for there they make great profits . I went with them on account of something they said to me , so we left Gazula in that galley . Always keeping along the shores of the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bin and Buyder ( Bojador ) , all an uninhabited coast , and came to the Rio del Oro , already mentioned , which is a branch of the Nilus rising in the lofty mountains of the Antarctic Pole , i where , it is said , is the terrestrial paradise . . . . We went on , after leaving this river , for a very long distance always keeping in sight of the coast , leaving behind us the Islas Perdidas and came to an island inhabited by many people . They call this island Gropis.2 It is a well-supplied island but the people are idolaters . They took us before their king and wondered much at us and our language and customs . The merchants who armed the galley made much profit . . . . We left the island of Gropis and shaped an eastern course towards the Southern Sea until we found another island called Quible.3 This island . . . is in the South Sea and is peopled by Negroes . We left it on the right hand , keeping along the coast and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there and found it inhabited by many people . There rises from it a river 5 which becomes very large and flows through a fine country . Here the galley turned back and I remained for some time . Afterwards I departed from Alboch with some people and went to another mountain called Lirry . A river rises from it called Enalco . I left this kingdom . . . and went to another called Gotonie consisting of some very high mountains . They say there are no others so high in the world . They are called the Mountains of the Moon . ' The Friar continues his narrative by telling of his travels in the land of Prester John , Ethiopia , Mesopotamia and the Far East . Footnote  | A cursory reading of the Conoscimiento would lead us to believe that the Franciscan was nothing more than a second Mandeville ? a wholesale and unprincipled plagiarist . Major , Beazley and others , realizing that no man could possibly have accomplished all that the writer professes to have done , have been led to discredit the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that such a judgment fails to do justice to all the facts . In the first place , the Conoscimiento is not a mere recapitulation of existing travel books , for it is impossible to find parallels for many of the descriptions in contemporary or earlier literature . Secondly , the narrative bears the stamp of credibility which is so often lacking in works like The Travels of Sir John Mandeville . There is , as in Ibn Batuta 's travels , only the most economical use of the miraculous : thus , the Friar does not people the interior of the continent with Sciapodae or Monoculi ? a feature all the more commendable in view of the appeal which the relation of such wonders made to the reading public of his day . Thirdly , the work is characterized by a bond fide mode of expression which seems to belie the charge of fabrication , witness such natural touches as I went with them on account of something they said to me ' , and They took us before their king and wondered much at us and our . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed the galley made much profit . ' In addition , it must be admitted that his description of the Guinea coast has the important quality of verisimilitude . The information advanced , while it is slight , points to a knowledge only to be derived at or near the locality in question . To reject the claims of the narrative is to create as many difficulties as it solves . For how could the knowledge have been transmitted to the Friar To say , as La Ronciere does , that the Franciscan collected his material from Arabs , is to be at variance with the general tenor of Arab literature on West Africa . This is conspicuous for its ignorance of the Footnote  | southerly part described by the author . Moreover , he reveals a strange lack of knowledge of the interior of the continent , a particularly curious fact if his informants were Arabs . Markham suggests , alternatively , that the knowledge may be due to contact with members of Genoese and Venetian caravans which penetrated far into the interior from Cairo ' .1 This lays itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate notion of the lands to the south of the SenegalNiger system , or of the sea coast beyond , comes down to us from the accounts of medieval travellers and merchants in Africa . Neither Anselme d'Isalguier of Toulouse , who lived at Gao from 1405 to 1413 , nor Antonio Malfante , the Genoese who wrote a description of the basin of the Niger in 1447 , possessed any knowledge of the lands to the south . Malfante records that he had endeavoured to ascertain the place of origin of the gold , but he was always unsuccessful.2 Setting these considerations aside , there can scarcely be any quarrel as to the extent of the Friar 's knowledge of West Africa . Briefly stated it is this : ( 1 ) A fairly intimate knowledge of the western sea-board to Cape Bojador. ( 2 ) A less certain ? but still indisputable ? knowledge of the coast beyond , possibly to some such island as Sherbro ' , and the region of Sierra Leone . ( 3 ) A shadowy ? perhaps wholly speculative ? idea of the Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easterly trend . ( 4 ) An almost complete ignorance of the interior of West Africa ; thus the Senegal-Niger country is passed over with the barest mention . A most illuminating commentary on the Conoscimiento is found , about fifty years later , in the work of Bontier and Verrier , historians to Bethencourt 's Norman expedition to the Canaries in 1402 and following years . In this ? The History of the Conquest of the Canaries ? the Franciscan 's state-Footnote  | Expanding Horizons ? Africa meats , so far from being called into question , ar , in good faith and made to serve as the raison examination of the country from Cape Cantin half-way between the Canaries and Spain to Cape a promontory to right of the Canaries extending or side to the Rio d'Ouro ' .1 Thus it is apparent that the Conoscimiento had cl regarded , within the space of a single lifetime , as a text-book of African geography . From this Hi comes clear testimony to the feasibility of the Fri prise , for the writers speak of those who have expl parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bethen tention to open the road to the River of Gold evidence against an antecedent discovery of the Sent It is true that this statement militates against t : a fourteenth-century French discovery of the Sell on the other hand , it is no evidence against an exi another nation having succeeded in attaining the A further proof of the credence attached to th miento is forthcoming in the Este World Map of c there can be little doubt that the delineation of coast of Africa south of Cape Verde is there b data supplied by the Franciscan 's narrative.4 Summing it up , it would appear that the do evidence for such a voyage , admittedly slight , i than the cumulative evidence which can be advant it . It is perhaps not even too fanciful to suppoE Friar made the expedition in company with Jair whose goal was that of the merchants mentior narrative ? namely , the River of Gold . In any ca. ! faring activities of the Moors along this coast ai known that there is no room for a dogmatic reject entire narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa as disclosed by the mappaemundi , we find difficulty , once again , in making any useful generalizations . It is possible , however , to be dogmatic at least on two points . In the first place , Cape Non ceased to be Caput finis Africa ' about the middle of the fourteenth century . Secondly , the ocean coast as far as Cape Bojador ( more correctly as far as the cove on its southern side ) was known and mapped from the time of the Pizzigani Portolan chart ( 1367 ) . Of more extensive knowledge we can not be so certain , though various claims have been put forward . Dr. Hamy , for instance , in a memoir on the Dulcerto Portolan chart of 1339 declares that it shows the Majorcans possessed relatively exact knowledge on the ocean coasts . . . to the south of the Bay of Arguim which the Portuguese did not reach for 107 years afterwards ' . The arguments for this conclusion are of the flimsiest . The African coast , south of Cape Non , is indicated only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only very general information accompanies this shoreline ' . Thus : the whole of this coast is uninhabited except by fishermen . ' The occurrence near the southern extremity of the map of the word felle ' , which Hamy identifies with Tafouelli , a region of the Senegal basin , has little , if any , significance , since we find that the Pizzigani chart has the kindred legend fele Ganuya ' north of Caput finis Africallor is Dulcerto alone in this delineation , for the Catalan Atlas of 1375,2 the Viladestes map of 1413 , the Valseccha map of 1439 and others , adopt a similar convention for their African coasts beyond Cape Bojador . The explanation is simple . Land exploration had , for a long time , outpaced maritime exploration , and so , as we shall see later , the map-makers of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries knew much more about the Sahara and the Sudan than they did about the Atlantic coast . Accordingly , in their efforts to indicate the great trans-Saharan caravan routes as accurately as possible , they found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cape Bojador . By a fairly general consensus of opinion it was given a southsouth-east direction . The most extravagant claims put forward concern the Laurentian World Map of c. 1351.1 For us its immediate source of interest lies in the delineation of the southern shores of Africa . Alexander von Humboldt , Baron Nordenskiold , La Ronciere and Von Wieser all aver that the map exhibits in a greater or a less degree a foreknowledge of the continent 's true shape . Santarem , on the other hand , finds in it proof of the indubitable priority ' 2 of Portuguese discovery along the African coast . The following facts emerge from a study of the African portion . Firstly , all details such as legends , rivers and towns stop short of the parallel of Mos Lune ' .3 Secondly , this parallel coincides with a defmitely marked line of juncture , south of which it is possible to detect , despite the mellowing influence of time , a difference of shade and brushwork . Now , as is well known , the territory of the normal Portolan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not extend farther south than Sierra Leone . The opinion that this line of discontinuity is more than a figment of the imagination is strengthened on a scrutiny of the northern portion of the map . Here , the author , instead of essaying to solve the problem of the Arctic , terminates his work in the latitude of central Sweden , i.e. just where his knowledge of the North might be expected to cease . The region north of this latitude is left entirely blank ? a fact suggesting that the African side of the map may have terminated originally on its southern Footnote  | front , in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone . It is only fair to point out , however , that the break is not continued eastwards across southern Asia . In the third place , the map carries a second outline of the shape of the continent . This gives an entirely different conception of Africa , one , indeed , that is more nearly in agreement with medieval map-practice , as exemplified in the Sanuto and Mauro planispheres . As this outline seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be regarded as having been drawn after the world map first appeared . Which delineation was first in point of time can hardly be decided from inspection . How are we to regard these interpolations Are they the work of an editor , or editors e The merchants of Genoa , it goes without saying , would evince the greatest interest in the matter of the southern extension of the continent , particularly as their land intercourse with the East was being interrupted by the Turks . Consequently , the portrayal of south Africa may conceivably be an attempt on their part to solve the age-old question of ' Africa nondum cognita ' . Alternatively , it may be that the editing , or part of it , was done at the Portuguese Court in the following century , after Prince Pedro , brother to Prince Henry the Navigator , had returned from Italy . On that occasion he brought home a number of maps by which he was much helped and furthered in his discoveries ' .1 It has even been suggested that the Laurentian World Map was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given to it in Portugal , at the time when the true shape of the continent was being disclosed . In deciding about the outline map we are helped by an early fifteenth-century map ? the world map of Albertin de Virga , dated 1415.3 A comparison of the two maps seems to indicate that the Laurentian editor , or author , was conversant with the later work and that he was sketching his outline either from memory or directly from this map . The former is Footnote  | the more probable since the correspondence between the two outlines is not very close , but any suggestion that the similarity is adventitious is seen to be unlikely when we realize that no other medieval world maps introduce the Terrestrial Paradise under exactly the same guise . There is no need now to go into the arguments that have been advanced in favour of a later date for the map.l Investigation shows that there is ample reason for retaining the date of c. 1351 , and for regarding the two interpretations of the African outline as later emendations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virga map in 1415 and the second at considerably later date , presumably when the Portuguese were well on their way to the Cape.2 Apart from such an explanation the Laurentian World Map would remain an enigma , for neither the fourteenth nor early fifteenth century holds any record of achievement which can account for such a revolutionary change in geographical ideas as this map exhibits in its modem ' delineation of the African continent . Almost equally modern ' in outline , however , is the Africa of Fra Mauro 's famous Planisphere of 1459,3 for , putting aside for the moment questions of interpretation , it is impossible not to be struck by the illusion of accuracy which the general shape of the continent produces . More than one student of cartography has shared Alexander von Humboldt 's conviction that the southernmost point , called Cavo de Diab , ' is none other than the Cape of Good Hope made known by some daring expedition similar to that which Mauro himself Footnote  | speaks of as having taken place in 1420.1 But an analysis of the features of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south Africa , for the Mareb and Tagas rivers with their affluents , Mana , Lare and Abavi , can be none other than the Abyssinian rivers , Mareb , Takkazye , Menna , Tellare and Abbai ; while flumen Xebi ' and flumen Avasi ' are traced with such extraordinary fidelity that they can be readily identified with the Ghibie and Hawash rivers of Southern Abyssinia ? a region not thoroughly explored until recent times . The fact that these rivers are the southernmost feature of the map ? they are placed in the same latitude as Cavo de Diab ' ? makes it almost impossible to believe that Mauro knew anything of Africa south of the Equator . How , then , are we to interpret Diab , the hinterland of the Cape , described by the map-maker as a very fertile region which was recently conquered by the great King of Abyssinia , c. 1430 ' ? The only region with which it is at all comparable , within the limits imposed by Mauro 's knowledge of the interior , is the Somali peninsula , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Michele at Murano we are told that Diab is a great province , in parts of which there is an abundance of every good thing , its principal town being called Mogadis ' 2 which can be none other than Magadoxo of the Somali coast . Cavo de Diab , ' in that case , becomes Cape Guardafui.3 Consequently , the degree of verisimilitude Footnote  | possessed by the southern portion of African coastline is due largely to the exigencies of the map 's circular form.l In conclusion , then , it may be averred that , despite the dearth of confirmatory map evidence , and the firm Portuguese belief to the contrary , the medieval knowledge of Africa , especially of the coasts , extended to well within tropical latitudes . Measured solely by the criterion of mileage these early explorers can not be said to have added very much new territory to the map of the world . Certainly their voyages do not compare with those of the following age , but without their pioneers the achievements of Columbus , da Gama and Magellan would not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no pilot-books and few charts , their only instruments a compass and an astrolabe , these unknown mariners were responsible , perhaps more than anybody , for the passing of the Middle Ages and the coming of modern times . Footnote  | IN the literature of the early Middle Ages nowhere is the poverty of geographical knowledge more apparent than in regard to the Far East . Whereas in the writings of the Ptolemaic era we are furnished with relatively precise information on such topics as the mountains of Central Asia , the characteristics of the Chinese people and their silk trade with the West , in the centuries that follow the text-book frontiers of Asia are withdrawn to the Ganges , and in everything but name China is unknown . Asia writes Orosius in the fifth century begins in the East where lies the mouth of the River Ganges , facing the Eastern Ocean . On its left is situated the promontory of Caligardamia I which is hard by the island of Taprobane.2 Here the sea begins to be known as the Indian Ocean . On the right 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself the headland of Samara.5 Adjoining this to the north is the mouth of the River Octogona.6 From this point the sea becomes known as the Seric Ocean . Within this area lies India ; on the west it is bounded by the River Indus which flows into the Red Sea ; on the north , by Mount Caucasus ; the rest of India is circumscribed by the Eastern and Indian Oceans . This country has 44 different peoples ( if we include the island of Taprobane which has io states and the many other habitable islands ) . From the River Indus which is in the east to the River Tigris which is towards the west , there are the following districts , all of them mountainous and rugged : Aracosia , 7 Parthia , Assyria , Persia and Media . On the north these are bounded by the Caucasus Mountains ; on the south , by the Footnote  | Red Sea and the Persian Gulf . The chief rivers flowing through the midst of these countries are the Hydaspes i and the Arbis.2 Here there are 32 peoples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now usually called Parthia ) . Between the River Tigris and the River Euphrates lies Mesopotamia , a country beginning in the north midway between the Taurus and Caucasus Mountains ; in the south it is succeeded by Babylonia , then by Chaldea and finally by Arabia . This stretches eastwards in a narrow strip of land between the Persian and Arabian Gulfs . In these countries there are 28 different peoples.3 Set beside Ptolemy 's Geography , Pliny 's Natural History or even Ammianus Marcellinus ' History , 4 statements of this kind ? and they are quite representative of their century ? invite unfavourable comparisons.5 The loss of knowledge in the interval comes as something of a surprise when we recollect that the Byzantine Empire was still in touch with Turkish tribes of Central Asia in the fifth century , and that under Justinian the overland traffic in silk was almost as flourishing then as it had been in the first century.6 The explanation lies , it would seem , with the changed mentality of the times . Christendom was preoccupied with strengthening the faith of its converts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance . Shortly after the smuggling of the first silk moths into Europe had been accomplished in the middle of the sixth century , the trade with China ? always hazardous and slow ? began to dwindle and intercourse between East and West Footnote  | became , consequently , exceedingly uncommon . Between the seventh and twelfth centuries , with a solitary exception , there is no Latin or Greek work which reveals a living knowledge of China . The exception is provided by Theophylactus Simocatta , an Egyptian Greek who , writing c . A.D. 628 , speaks of the land of Taugas ' bordering upon that of the nomadic Turks . The people of Taugas , 2 he tells us , are one of the greatest nations of the world in power and population ; they are idolaters , but possess just laws ; and they produce silk and carry on a great commerce . He speaks further of their land being divided into two parts by a mighty river , 3 and of a recent war between rival states on either side of the river ending in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed little or no vogue and so the textbook geography of the Far East remained historical and out of date . Bede in the eighth century , Dicuil in the ninth , Gerbert in the tenth , Adam of Bremen in the eleventh and numerous other Christian writers in the twelfth century merely retell the Orosian tale . Meantime the Arabs were beginning to busy themselves with missions and merchandise in India and the lands beyond . These activities soon produced a literature which , for size and merit , equalled the later narratives of the Polos and their compatriots . The precise date of the entrance of the first Arabs into China is not known , but it may reasonably be assumed that it was not later than the beginning of the eighth century , for by A.D. 758 their numbers at the port of Canton alone were such that they were strong enough to attack and Footnote  | pillage the city . In the same century Arabs also began to trade with northern China by an overland route , as well as by the sea route . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the systematic description of the new lands , for the earliest account extant is a compilation dating from the middle of the ninth and the beginning of the tenth centuries . The first part of it consists of a collection of notes about India and China , ' based upon personal experience in the case of India and upon hearsay in the case of China . There is practically no geographical material concerning the latter country in this part of the work beyond the mention of Tibet as one of China 's western neighbours and the presence of some islands ? called Silato the east of the country.2 The second part of the compilation was written by a certain Abu Said and is notable , inter alia , for its acquaintance with Khamdan , 3 the tenth-century capital of China , and with the overland route between Sogdiana and China proper . According to Abu Said 's account , the frontier between these two countries was a two-months ' journey distant over a waterless terrain . The difficulty of crossing this desert , so his informants maintained , had alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A friend of the author 's had told him , however , that he had seen a man at Khanfu 4 with a bagful of musk on his back , who , he found , had come all the way from Samarkand on foot.5 Footnote  | More methodical , if at the same time more ambiguous , is the almost contemporary account of China by Ibn Khurdadhbih . In his Book of Routes and Provinces ' he tells us much that is self-evidently true of the life and commerce of the country . Thus : at Al-Wakin which is the first port of China 2 ... you find excellent Chinese iron , porcelain and rice . You can go from Al-Wakin , which is a great port , to Khanfu in four days by sea or in twenty days by land . Khanfu produces all sorts of fruits and vegetables , wheat , barley , rice and sugar cane . . . . In all the ports of China you find a great navigable river affected by the tide ... 3 The length of coast-line from one extremity of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The country can boast of 300 prosperous and famous cities . It is bounded by the sea , by Tibet and by the country of the Turk . . . What is beyond China is unknown . But in front of Kantu 4 rise high mountains . These are in the country of Sila which abounds in gold . . . The products exported include gum , aloes , porcelain , satin and cinnamon . . .5 Whether Khurd-adhbih actually visited China is not clear , but there can be no doubt from these extracts that he was in possession of authentic information concerning that country . All the crops catalogued by him were characteristic of the medieval marts of the Far East . With so much already known by the Arabs in the tenth century , we are encouraged , not unnaturally , to expect that subsequent writers will be able to add further details . But neither Al-Masudi , Al-Idrisi nor Abu'l Fida succeeds in telling us much that is new . Masudi claims to have visited Siam , Java , China and even Turkestan , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Footnote  | As for Idrisi , his account is disjointed and not always easy to follow . Moreover , while professing to give exact distances between places , he generally underestimates them . His references to Chinese commodities of trade agree , substantially , with those given by Khurdadhbih . So , too , do those relating to the chief ports ; on the other hand , some of his placenames are more reminiscent of Ptolemaic than of contemporary geography . ) Abu'l Fida is hardly more helpful . His knowledge of the Far East is , as he himself complains , very much restricted and is derived chiefly from books written long before his time . They are a strange mixture of obsolete statements of earlier Arab geographers and fragments of recent history . He tells us , for example , that China is bounded on the west by desert lands separating it from India ; on the south by the sea ; on the east by the eastern Atlantic ; on the north by the lands of Gog and Magog and other regions respecting which we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those parts , such as might furnish us with intelligence respecting those places . . . we forbear to detail them . . . Khanfu is one of the gates ( i.e. ports ) of China and is situated on the river . . . Ibn ( i.e. Abu ) Said says it is mentioned in books and it is situated on the east of the river of Khamdan . Ibn Khurdadhbih says it is the greatest commercial port of China and abounds in fruit , vegetables , wheat , barley , rice and sugar-cane.2 In Ibn Batuta 3 we have a writer of a different calibre . A great traveller , as we have already seen , he recorded his observations on the celestial ' Kingdoms of Cathay and Manzi , 4 and the romantic Middle East without undue re-Footnote  | course to legendary embellishments . At the same time , his narrative is lamentably poor in geographical understanding ; to look for systematic regional descriptions ? even for itineraries which respect chronology ? is to be disappointed . The travels were the thing , their description an afterthought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geographer , it is in spite of himself . His observations on China are typical of his style and method . It is a land , he tells us , of vast extent and abounding in produce , fruits , grain , gold and silver . In this respect there is no country in the world that can rival it . ' The port of Zaiton 1 is , in his view , one of the largest in the world , or perhaps the very largest .. . It is formed by a large inlet of the sea which penetrates the land to the point where it unites with the great river.2 In this city , as in all Chinese towns , a man will have a fruit garden and a field with his house in the middle of it . . . For this reason their towns are extensive .... Cathay is the best cultivated country in the world . There is not a spot in the whole extent of it that is not brought under cultivation ( sic ) . The reason is that if any spot is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land-tax due thereon . Fruit gardens , villages and fields extend along both banks of this river without interruption from the city of Khansa 3 to the city of Khan-Baliq 4 which is a space of 64 days ' journey . . . I have never seen anything in the world like it , except a space of four days ' journey between Anbar and ' Ana ( in Iraq ) . We used to disembark every night and stay in the villages . ... 5 Although Ibn Batista is obviously giving us some authentic information about this era it is not entirely free from error , for China boasts of no river flowing from north to south across the plains of Kiang-su and Shantung , but only a canal which no one who had ever sailed on it was likely to mistake for a river . So confused , indeed , are his ideas on inland Footnote  | China that he informs us in another place that there is a river called the Water of Life which rises in some mountains ... near Khan-Baliq and flows through the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it finally reaches Sin as-Sin ' , ' i.e. Canton . Again , he assures us that elephants are used as beasts of burden in Cathay ? a fact which has led one scholar to conclude that Ibn Batuta never went to China at all.2 It needs to be borne in mind , however , that Batuta does not lay claim to have visited all the places he himself describes . Supposing , as seems not improbable , that he only visited the coastlands of China , his misrepresentation of the hinterland becomes understandable , for it would be easy with his imperfect interpretation of Chinese reports ( themselves not always reliable ) to confuse the Grand Canal system linking up the Hwang-Ho and the Yang-tse Kiang with a north-south flowing river system . Be this as it may , there can be no doubt as to the genuineness of most of his travels . As we have already seen in connexion with Africa , Batuta 's descriptions of that continent have every appearance of accuracy , and the same is certainly true of India and even of such inconsiderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best wine until last . After Batuta they can boast of few Oriental travellers or writers of repute . Significantly , this sudden termination of their activity synchronizes with the fall of the Mongol power and the rise of the Ming Dynasty which resumed the traditional anti-foreign policy of the Chinese and made it practically impossible for foreigners , Moslems and Christians alike , to enter the country . Disappointing as this turn of events was to the aspirations of the West it did not come before Christian travellers had emulated the Moslems in traversing the entire length of Asia and in revealing to Western Europe the glories of India and Footnote  | the Celestial Empire . Thanks largely to the conquests of Chinghiz Khan and his immediate successors , it became possible in the thirteenth century to travel across Asia from the banks of the Volga to the Yellow Sea without much more danger than normally attended the progress of the Christian pilgrim from Canterbury to Compostella . At first there was a certain excusable reluctance on the part of Europeans to use a route which passed through the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge Christendom into a new barbarism . Later , when the fear of invasion had abated , the impression seems to have gained ground in Europe that these barbarians were ripe for conversion . Doubtless there was an ulterior motive here , for the greatest need of the Church at the time was to find a counterpoise to the Saracen power , and who could suit her purpose better than these fighting hordes from the steppes ? Arguments , aimed at giving effect to such an enterprise , were not difficult to find . In the first place , it was discovered that the Mongols were quite tolerant of Christians residing in their territories . Then rumour had it that some of the Khans and their captains already professed the rudiments of the Christian faith . Thirdly , there were the stories of the Priest-King Prester John . In their earliest form , these located him in the Indies ' . Now India had always held a peculiar charm for medieval men , being associated in their minds with fantastic wealth , natural wonder and magic . It was said by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried there . Accordingly , the twelfth- and thirteenth-century stories about an Indian ruler who combined the piety of the Apostle with the wealth of a Croesus simply served to corroborate the romantic inventions which already fed the imagination of Europe and figured in the contemporary world-maps . ' Such Footnote  | was the trust put in these stories that it is no exaggeration to say that the quest for the realms of Prester John soon became , as it was to remain for more than a century , a major factor in promoting Asiatic enterprise . For this reason , it deserves our more detailed attention ; indeed , many a real character in the history of exploration has less claim to it than this halflegendary figure . The earliest authentic reference to the Prester in Western literature occurs in the Chronicle of Otto , Bishop of Freisingen . Here it is stated that when he was at the papal court in 1145 he met the Bishop of Gabala 1 who related how not many years before , one John , king and priest ( rex et sacerdos ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was with his people a Christian , but a Nestorian , had made war against his brother kings the Medes and Persians , who were called Samiards 2 and captured Ecbatana their capital . After this victory Presbyter John ? for so he was wont to be styled ? advanced to fight for the Church at Jerusalem ; but when he arrived at the Tigris and found no means of transport for his army , he turned northwards , as he had heard that the river in that quarter was frozen over in winter time . After halting on its banks for some years ( sic ) in expectation of a frost , he was obliged to return home.3 It was further said that the Presbyter was descended from the race of the Three Wise Men , that he ruled over the same nations that they ruled and that he had such wealth that he used a sceptre of solid emerald.4 Footnote  | Considerable as was the impression which this report made upon the leaders of the Western Church , it was far exceeded , twenty years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Prester John to the reigning Byzantine Emperor Manuel I. It represented this monarch as ruling over the three Indias and described his powers and possessions in the most flamboyant terms . It began thus : John , Priest by the Almighty power of God and the strength of Our Lord Jesus Christ , King of Kings , Lord of Lords . . . ' Continuing , the writer claimed that he was the greatest monarch under heaven , as well as a devout Christian . The letter dealt at length with the millennial glories of his territory : Honey flows in our land and milk everywhere abounds . In one region there no poison exists and no noisy frog croaks ; no scorpions are there or serpents creeping in the grass . . . In one of the provinces flows a river called the Indus which , issuing from Paradise , extends its windings by various channels through all the province ; and in it are found emeralds , sapphires , carbuncles , topazes . . . and many other precious stones . ' How great was the popularity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , from the fact that Zarncke , in his treatise on Prester John , gives a list of nearly one hundred manuscripts.2 Incredible as it may seem to us , the genuineness the acceptance of this identification is that there was no profession of Christianity on the part of Gur Khan : in fact he was a Buddhist . ( But according to Sir Henry Yule there were constant confusions of rumour between these two religions as they existed in Central Asia ; vide Cathay and the Way Thither : Vol . III , p. 22 . ) Bruun , on the other hand , thinks that he finds a warrior answering better to the indications in a Caucasian prince of the twelfth century , John Orbelian by name , who was a Christian . Vide Yule-Cordier : The Book of Ser Marco Polo ( 3rd edition ) , Vol . I , pp. 232 et seq . Footnote  | of the document was never impugned by the great majority of people . At the same time , it did not produce any immediate response and when , in 1177 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Master Philip , to find the PriestKing , it was not so much in answer to the letter as on account of reports received from Philip and others to the effect that Prester John was anxious to be instructed in the true Catholic faith . The letter borne by the doctor is preserved for us , in slightly varying forms , in the chronicles of several annalists , for example Matthew Paris 1 and Roger Hoveden.2 In this the Pope recites how he had heard of the monarch 's Christian profession , his pious desire to have instruction in the faith and to possess a church in Rome and an altar in Jerusalem . He found it impossible , on account of the length and difficulties of the way , to send any one a nostro latere ' , but he would send Philip to communicate instruction to him.3 It is not stated that Philip had actually been to the Prester 's court , but only that he had heard of his majesty 's pious wishes from conversation with honourable persons in his kingdom , whom the physician had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last phrase is a matter for doubt . Sir Henry Yule accepting Baronius ' interpretation of the letter ? Hoveden 's version ? that the King of the Indians , vulgarly called Pretejanni , reigning far and wide over Ethiopia ' was the King of Abyssinia , is of opinion that the phrase may refer to Egypt or to Palestine , where Philip might well have met with Abyssinian pilgrims . The weakness of this contention , as Yule is quick to point out , is that the application of the title Prester John to the Abyssinian King was probably a good deal later . Further , in a letter reproduced by Matthew Paris Footnote  | ? written by the Dominican Prior in Palestine in 1237 ? We read of one whose prelacy extended over India the Greater and the Kingdom of Prester John and other realms still nearer the rising sun ' .1 Nothing more is heard about the Prester legend until 1221 . In that year news came out of the East that a great Christian monarch was fighting the Moslems and sweeping away their power . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son , others the grandson , of Prester John of India . Actually , this new conqueror was none other than the Tartar emperor , Chinghiz Khan . The delusion was speedily shattered , but it did little to damp the spirits of those intent on finding this vast monarchy . Popes and kings went so far as sending Franciscan missionaries to the Mongol hordes . While these messengers of the Gospel did not find their quarry , they made other discoveries which , from the standpoint of the extension of geographical boundaries , brought them ample compensation . The credit for these discoveries rests , primarily , with two friars , John of Plano Carpini and William of Rubruck , in that they blazed the overland trail to Tartary . Although Carpini says next to nothing of Prester John , he speaks at length of the supposed piety of the Cathayans 2 who were said to have the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments . They have also recorded in histories the lives of their forefathers : and they have hermits , and certain houses made after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They adore and reverence Christ Jesus our Lord , and believe the article of eternal life , but are not baptized . They do also honorably esteem and reverence our Scriptures ... 3 Footnote  | The narrative then goes on to portray the habits and commerce of the people . William of Rubruck , on the other hand , speaks more explicitly and declares that the stories about King John ' were grossly exaggerated by the Nestorian Christians whose king , so he maintains , the Prester had been . They report ten times more of him than was true . For so the Nestorians which come out of those parts use to do . For they blaze abroad great rumours and reports upon just nothing . . . Howbeit , when I travelled along by his territories , there was no man that knew anything of him , but only a few Nestorians.l After Rubruck , came Marco Polo of Venice , 2 the greatest traveller of the Middle Ages , and perhaps of all time . But his mission to the Far East was diplomatic rather than religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legend . In fact he only repeats , in the most guarded of terms , what he had been told about him.3 This was by no means complimentary , for in Polo 's day the honour of identification with Prester John , after hovering over one head and another , had finally rested upon Un-khan , the king of the Nestorian tribe of Kerait . By all accounts this man was a tyrant , exacting tribute where he could and reducing the Turks around him to slavery . As would seem to befit such a despot , he fell by the sword in battle against Chinghiz Khan . After the time of Odoric of Pordenone , 4 who has a single sentence to the effect that the empire of Pretegoani ' was fifty days ' journey to the west of Cathay , 5 the priest-king ceases to have any pretensions to historical existence in Asia . When Footnote  | next we hear of him ? c. 1340 ? it is as an Abyssinian king.l The real purpose of these missionary expeditions was more ambitious than that of tracing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the conversion of the Tartar hordes . Although it was not accomplished , the Franciscans achieved a very great deal . Not the least valuable part of their work , from a geographical point of view , was the correspondence arising out of their diplomatic and missionary activities . From the letters of John of Montecorvino , a Franciscan who left Rome in I291 and worked among the Tartars for thirty-six years , we derive information , for instance , about such matters as the best overland route to Cathay ( he was anxious to have reinforcements for his great task from the Papal See ) , the kind of vessel employed on the Indian Ocean ? ' flimsy and uncouth , without nails or iron of any sort , sewn together with twine like clothes ' , 2 and the commerce of the Malabar coast . In fact , in his Indian letters 3 we have the first good picture drawn by a Latin Christian , for it was penned before Polo 's account . Other medieval ambassadors of the Gospel to leave accounts of the Orient were Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John of Cora , Odoric of Pordenone and ? lastly in point of time ? John Marignolli . Unfortunately , the writings both of these men and of their predecessors were not fully appreciated by the educated men Footnote  | of their day . Marco Polo was branded as an impostor , ' and the true stories of Carpini , Rubruck and Odoric were less well known in the later Middle Ages than the fictions and plagiarisms of Sir John Mandeville.2 And yet these works constitute the most important medieval contribution to geography . So expansive is the field of their observations that we can not attempt here to do more than outline the major achievements . These are remarkable when measured by any criterion , not least by mileage . Down to the year 1245 few , if any , Europeans had travelled farther east than Baghdad.3 Then in a single expedition an elderly and corpulent friar , by name John of Plano Carpini , penetrated into the very heart of Central Asia , reaching Karakorum , situated 3,000 miles east of the meridian of Baghdad . Ten years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the summer capital of the Grand Khan in the hill country behind Peking . Still more remarkable , they returned to tell the tale . But even this feat was overshadowed by that of the younger Polo , Marco , who , in the course of twenty-four years ' sojourn in Asia , travelled no less than 30,000 miles , at least 10,000 of which no European had previously followed . These men , diplomats , traders and missionaries alike , were not only great travellers ; they were great observers . Their Footnote  | narratives abound in descriptions which are self-evidently honest and unadorned , a truly remarkable quality when we recall the indifferent standards of the earlier travel literature , with its disregard for accuracy , and the popularity of the contemporary wonder-books ' . From the standpoint of physical geography , these expeditions were particularly notable for their disclosure of the complex mountain system in the heart of Asia . In the writings of the later travellers the Tian Shan , the Pamirs , and the Hindu Kush are recognizably described and given an approximate orientation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and west across the continent had prevailed . Even Rubruck did not get beyond it , for when in the neighbourhood of the Tian Shan Mountains he inquired what mountains they were , and from the answer received he understood them to be the mountains of Caucasus which are stretched forth and continued on both parts to the sea , from the west unto the east ' 1 ... The feature of Central Asia to attract most attention was the Gobi Desert , which had to be crossed , or at all events skirted , by travellers making their way to Karakorum , the capital of the early Khans . The accounts of it left by Carpini and Marco Polo were scarcely bettered until the nineteenth century . Quoting Carpini , the desert lay in that part of the world which is thought to be the most northeasterly . . . In some part thereof it is full of mountains , and in other places plain and smooth ground , but everywhere sandy and barren , neither is the hundredth part thereof fruitful . For it can not bear fruit unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare in that country . Whereupon they have neither villages , nor cities among them , except one which is called Cracurim 2 and is said to be a proper town . . . And albeit the foresaid land is otherwise fruitful , yet it is very commodious for the bringing up of cattle . In certain places it is altogether destitute Footnote  | of woods . Therefore the emperor and his noble men and all other warm themselves , and dress their meat , with fires made of the dung of oxen and horses . . . There is never any rain in winter , but only in summer , albeit in so little quantity that sometimes it scarcely sufficeth to allay the dust , or to moisten the roots of the grass . . . 1 The great Siberian lowland was obviously off the beaten track ' of the travellers making for Karakorum and Khan Baliq , 2 so that we shall not expect them to be so exact in their accounts of it . Polo comes as near the truth as any when he says that , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance of about forty days ' journey . . . It borders on the Ocean at its northern extremity . ' 3 The inhabitants of this plain live upon the flesh of animals . . . they have neither corn nor wine ; and although in summer they derive substance from the chase , yet in winter the cold is so excessive that neither birds nor beasts can remain there ' .4 On the hydrographical side the contribution of the medieval travellers to the existing body of knowledge was far from negligible , in spite of the absence of useful maps and survey instruments . In the circumstances it is perhaps inevitable that no methodical treatment , say , of the river systems of China was undertaken . But we find it less easy to explain away the absence of any even approximately correct notions of their lay-out and orientation . Even Polo does not appear to have escaped entirely Ibn Batuta 's error in supposing that there was Footnote  | a major north-south system , for in speaking of the port of Zaiton , l he says that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which passes the city of Kinsai ' .2 At the same time he realizes that the Yang-tse-Kiang rises in the mountains beyond Sze-chwan , 3 and that the Hwang-Ho has its source in Central Asia.4 Neither he nor his contemporaries knew anything definite about the southernmost of the three great waterways ? the Si-Kiang . The honour of having made the most important contribution to the hydrography of Asia falls to Rubruck , for his re-discovery of the true character of the Caspian Sea . The River Volga , he tells us , runneth into a certain lake or sea , which of late they call the Hircan Sea . . . Howbeit Isidore calleth it the Caspian Sea . . . This sea . . . is compassed in on three sides with the mountains , but on the north side by plain ground . . . . A man may travel round about it in four months . And it is not true what Isidore reporteth , namely , that this sea is a bay or gulf coming forth of the ocean : for it doth in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all sides with land.5 Footnote  | Not only had Isidore held to the contrary opinion , but almost all the writers of geography since the enlightened days of Herodotus . Largely as a result of Rubruck 's re-statement of the true case the Caspian begins to be correctly represented on world-maps soon after his time.l Many of the most valuable observations made by these men concern the human , rather than the physical , aspects of geography . Almost without exception the narratives pay considerable attention to Oriental ways of life ; the nomadic life of the Tartars , their cart-borne tents , their wandering herds and their food and drink 2 ; the idol-worship of the Tibetans and their family camzibalism 3 ; the Chinese system of poststations and the provincial administrative boards 4 ; the agricultural economy ' of the Indians , their religious ritual , ox-worship , caste system and the practice of suttee 5 ; the pearl fisheries , the cultivation of indigo , ginger and pepper at Quilon , cotton in Gujerat and the huge ocean-going junks which crowded the harbours of the Malabar coasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quilon to Java and Sumatra , even to Indo-China and Cathay , thereby anticipating by more than a century the voyages of the Portuguese caravels ? While only Polo has left a detailed account of this maritime commerce with the Far East , several writers speak of the overland traffic and at least one , Francesco Balducci Pegolotti , an agent of the great Florentine house of Bardi , compiled a handbook 8 of the route to be followed in Footnote  | going from the Levant to Peking . His observations include the stages of the journey , the mode of transport appropriate to each stage , the time normally taken , the most suitable articles of commerce with the Tartars and Chinese and , not least , the profits likely to accrue from the enterprise . He assures merchants intending to make the journey that the road you travel from Tana i to Cathay is perfectly safe , whether by day or by night , according to what merchants say who have used it .. 2 For the greatest wealth of information regarding the economic activities of Eastern peoples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Travels are , in fact , so rich in allusions to these topics that judicious selection from them is embarrassing . To the student of geography not the least interesting passages are those where he alludes to the extraordinary density of Chinese population and the measures employed to cope with it . So great is it that no spot of earth is suffered to lie idle that can possibly be cultivated ' .3 Fortunately , the productivity of the soil is such that the three main grain crops : rice , panicum and millet . . . yield , in their soil , an hundred measures for one ' .4 Doubly fortunate are they in possessing a sort of black stone which they dig out of the mountain where it runs in veins ' , for when it is lighted it burns like charcoal and retains the fire much better than wood . . . It is true that there is no scarcity of wood in the country , but the multitude of inhabitants is so immense .. . that the quantity could not supply the demand . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population impressed Polo , he was even more astounded at the astronomical proportions of the cities . Occasionally his astonishment takes a rather extravagant turn , as in the case of Kinsai ? ' the celestial city , a name which it merits from its pre-eminence to all others in the world , in point of grandeur and beauty , as well as from its abundant Footnote  | delights which might lead an inhabitant to imagine himself in paradise ' .1 But there was some excuse for it , if , as he claims , the city was one hundred miles in circuit , 2 contained ten principal market places each of which was attended three days a week by an assemblage of from forty to fifty thousandpersons ' 3 and housed 1,600,000 families . In the light of such facts , it is not surprising to read that , then as now , famine was a periodic menace to the stability of life in China . To grapple with it the Khan sent out his commissioners everywhere to ascertain whether any of his subjects have suffered in their crops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by locusts , worms , or by any other plague ; and in such cases he not only refrains from exacting the usual tribute of that year , but furnishes them from his granaries with so much corn as is necessary for their subsistence , as well as for sowing their land . With this view , in times of great plenty , he causes large purchases to be made of such kinds of grain as are most serviceable to them , which is stored in granaries provided for the purpose in the several provinces , and managed with such care as to ensure its keeping for three or four years without damage.4 Another thoughtful undertaking of the reigning Khan 's , and one which has had a permanent effect upon the Chinese landscape , was the planting of large , tall trees along the high roads . Besides giving much-valued shade in summer-time , they served to point out the road when the ground is covered with snow ' .5 In the course of his long journeyings up and down the country no doubt Polo had continual reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for the posthouses situated upon every great high road , at the distance of twenty-five or thirty miles ' .6 Not a little to his astonishment , Polo found that even in mountainous districts , remote Footnote  | from the great roads , where there were no villages , and the towns are far distant from each other , his majesty has equally caused buildings of the same kind to be erected , furnished with everything necessary ... ' i Coming , as he did , of a merchant family , Polo may perhaps be forgiven for the strong emphasis he is inclined to give to Oriental manufactures and articles of trade . All told , he mentions over eighty different marketable commodities . Prominent among them is pepper , one of the most coveted spices in the medieval Western world , the possession of a few pounds of which spelt riches . We can well imagine Polo 's thoughts , therefore , when he learned that the daily consignment of pepper from Zaiton to the town of Kinsai alone was forty-three loads , each load being two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade of Zaiton , he surmises that the quantity of pepper imported there is so considerable that what is carried to Alexandria to supply the demand of the western parts of the world is trifling in comparison , perhaps not more than the hundredth part ' .3 Among the many other articles referred to by Polo , porcelain ware receives more than its share of attention , though this is , of course , hardly surprising in a Venetian . The method of its manufacture is described by him in detail , as also is the manufacture of wine , paper , indigo , woollen cloth and carpets , 4 but in a work of this compass it is not possible to do more than make a passing reference to them . Fortunately the Travels are available in so many editions that the study of them at first hand presents no difficulty . But enough has been said to indicate the character and the quality of these Asiatic narratives . Their authors were essentially reporters , content for the most part to describe what they had seen or been told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not describe all that they had seen . Thus an analysis of Polo 's Travels suggests that he withheld many of the more spectacular facts of his Oriental experiences , for fear , perhaps , of courting the scorn of his sophisticated compatriots .. There is , for instance , no mention of the Chinese wall , although it is quite clear that Polo travelled within sight of it , if not actually on it for a considerable distance.2 Similarly nothing is said about the compressed feet of the Chinese women , or the use of fishing cormorants , printing presses and the peculiar characteristics of Chinese writing . Only Odoric , among the Christian writers of the Middle Ages , refers to the compressed feet of the women , or to the cormorants . Seldom are these reporters ' disposed to examine the implications of their facts , or question the bond fides of their informants . Of scientific ideas , there is practically no trace . Polo solemnly assures us that a certain island in the Northern Ocean lies so far to the north that the polar constellation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a southerly bearing ' , 3 and in another place he estimates the latitude of a locality by counting the number of cubits high the Pole Star is above the horizon.4 As for the relationship of the new knowledge to the old beliefs , it is mostly avoided . However , Rubruck , in speaking of the Cathayans , surmises that they are the Seres of the Ancients , 5 and John Marignolli , in describing the confines of Europe , postulates a White Sea ' beyond ' Jacopo of Acqui , a contemporary of Polo 's , writing in a somewhat obscure chronicle called Imago Mundi declares that what he ( i.e. Polo ) told in the Book was not as much as he had really seen , because of the tongues of detractors who , being ready to impose their own lies on others , are over-hasty to set down as lies what they in their perversity disbelieve , or do not understand . And because there are many great and strange things in that Book which are reckoned past all credence , he was asked by his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went beyond the facts . To which his reply was that he had not told one-half of what he had really seen . ' Vide H. Yule-H . Cordier : Footnote  | Hungary and hints that there is no need to verify the fact for he had learned by sure experience that fully half the surface of the Ocean was unnavigable ' , adding that God did not wish the human race to sail round the world ' .1 For all the awareness he appears to manifest of the controversies of ancient and medieval geographers , Polo may well have been entirely ignorant of them . Thus , the fact that he found several well-populated islands in the uninhabitable ' Torrid Zone , e.g. Madagascar , Zanzibar , Java and Sumatra , occasions him no surprise and stimulates him to no further inquiry . His attitude towards the unknown and the problematical is admirably summed up for us in the passage where he speaks of the eastern ocean ' with its 7,448 islands.2 We shall cease , ' he says , to treat further of these countries and islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way , as of my not having visited them personally . . . ' 3 Even Japan ( Zipangu ) ? ' an island in the eastern ocean , situated at the distance of about lsoo miles from the mainland ' ? is dismissed in two short chapters , and these are chiefly concerned with the description of a Tartar expedition against the country and not with the country itself.4 The immediate results of these explorations upon geographical theory and cartography were as paltry as those for commerce were profound . Among the factors contributing to this misfortune , the unreal character attributed to the travel literature was most probably an important one . Moreover , we must not forget the imperfect nature of publication before the invention of the printing-press , the reluctance of the age to abandon traditional beliefs , and the absence of rigid scientific principles in the geography of the time . Whatever the true explanation , contemporary chroniclers are extremely reticent about the heroes of their age . Sir Henry Yule only succeeded in finding five references to Polo in the whole of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote  | number in the writings of the early fifteenth century.l Although there was a latin copy of his Travels in a Boulogne library from 1320 onwards , Pierre d'Ailly , the famous Cardinal and scholar , who lived in the neighbouring town of Cambrai , c. 1410 , never once cited the name of Polo , and did not even appear to know the name of Cathay . Again , although Prince Pedro , Prince Henry the Navigator 's elder brother , returned from Venice in 1428 with a copy of the Travels and a mappamundi , 2 neither Zurara nor Galvao ( who does tell how the Navigator was much furthered ' in his discoveries by the map ) makes any reference to the utility of the book . In fact , almost the only text-book of geography , prior to the great age of discovery , to allude to the Indian Ocean in a way suggesting that the author was not altogether ignorant of recent discoveries is the Tractatus optimus super totam astrologiam of Bernard of Verdun.3 In his discussion of the numerous islands located in that sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote from the mainland of Asia and having a circumference of some 3,000 miles , a figure which agrees exactly with that given by Polo for Madagascar . The world-maps of the period are little better than the text-books , for only occasionally do they show even a few of the new place-names and physical features . All the Hereford Map , c. 1280 , shows that is post-Dark Age in ancestry is the solitary name of Samarkand , and the Marino Sanuto mappamundi , c. 1320 , shows only the Caspian Sea corrected to agree with the findings of Rubruck and Longjumeau . The Catalan Atlas of 1375 goes somewhat further in its adoption of the new knowledge , but even here it is not always easy to understand the view of the travellers ' itineraries taken by the compiler . His names , moreover , are often unrecognizable , likewise his outlines : e.g. Malay lacks its peninsula . At the Footnote  | same time the chief regions of India and China and several of the more important East Indian Islands , notably Sumatra , are delineated in fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the distinguished fifteenth-century cartographers Fra Mauro and Martin Behaim 2 neither of them took the trouble to lay down the itineraries ( in as far as they allow of reconstruction ) , being content to combine the erroneous designs of incompetent older authorites . Paradoxically , the only map which does give all or almost all the information found in the various narratives dates from the sixteenth century , by which time it had become obsolete.3 In face of such apathy , it is small wonder that the glorious achievements of the Great Age of Medieval Exploration were short-lived . With the death of John Marignolli , Europe 's last ambassador to Peking , the Age drew to its close . Twenty years later , the Black Death began to scourge the West , reducing the population of Europe almost by half , disorganizing society and temporarily paralysing the energies of her peoples . Twenty years later still , the Mongol dynasty which for some time past had shown signs of weakening , fell before the rising power of the Mings . The new rulers of China reverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a respectful distance . Consequently , missionaries and merchants vanish from the Oriental scene.4 Darkness once more covers the face of the East , and both Manzi and Footnote  | Cathay are lost to European view . Even the memory of them becomes dim . But we should be wrong if we supposed that these calamities nullified the achievements of the Asiatic explorers . The immediate results upon geographical theory may have been small . The missionary results were certainly not startling , but the wealth of rumour and story was not quickly dissipated , nor was the memory of the lucrative trade in spices and precious metals soon forgotten . On the contrary , these things served to stimulate some , at any rate , of the disinherited peoples to find alternative routes to the Indies ' .1 So great , indeed , was the psychological effect of the discovery of the Far East that it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that it did more than any other medieval happening to change the Weltanschauung of European civilization . While it was not until the fifteenth century that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oceanic ' , a reading of fourteenth- and fifteenthcentury literature makes it obvious that the transition from the outlook which accounted all the world as tributary to the Mediterranean to that which admitted no limits to the oikoumene , had its origins at least two centuries before the time of Columbus.2 Fifty years of Cathay had wrought a bigger change in the outlook of the Western world than a whole cycle of medieval Europe . Footnote  | NO community , no matter how slight its hold upon the material foundations of life , or how remote it may be from the centres of civilization , can remain entirely uninterested in the surrounding physical world . If its people are valleydwellers , following a settled habit of life , they are of necessity interested in the behaviour of the river which fertilizes their valley . After all , asked the Egyptians , why should the Nile overflow its banks every summer just when the land is languishing under a burning sun e If its people live by the sea , they can scarcely refrain from speculating as to why its waters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ebb and flow , and why they are salt . As for people unfortunate enough to live within range of seismic disturbance , they need no encouragement to inquire into the cause of such sinister visitations . In short , we may say that interest in matters of this kind is elemental and almost as universal as man . Further , it has a habit of persisting even during those dark eras in the history of the race when worldly interest is small . This was certainly the case in the Middle Ages , for while it is the exception to find an intelligent curiosity concerning purely cosmographical topics , many a writer makes thoughtful observations on the behaviour and causation of natural phenomena . The primary reason for this circumstance rests , no doubt , with the impression made upon all peoples by such things as tides , thunder , lightning and earthquakes . Spectacular and unpredictable , for the most part ? at all events by unscientific men ? they command the attention more readily even than travellers ' tales ' . A contributory factor may be  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitude allowed by the early Church in purely physical matters . Whereas orthodoxy prescribed the acceptance of very definite ideas concerning the shape , movement and peopling of the earth , it had much less to say upon meteorology , climatology and oceanography ? doubtless because the Bible was less informative . This interest in the physical universe was , moreover , not confined to the intellectual giants of the thirteenth century ; it is even apparent in the writings of some of the early Fathers . Ambrose , among others , argues the connexion between tides and the lunar cycle . Augustine theorizes about the origin of springs and rivers . Bede and Dicuil debate whether volcanoes are burning mountains or vents for deep-seated terrestrial fires . Isidore explains why the seas do not overflow their banks , by pointing out that water is constantly being removed into the air and on to the land . It is true that these observations mark no development upon earlier ideas , that the Ancients had said it all before , and that , in most cases , they had said it better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of learning for its own sake ? an uncommon quality in the scholarship of that age . At the same time it has to be admitted that , even in secular matters of this kind , the scholarship of the Dark Ages was not completely free from the shackles of Biblical exegesis . ' When the Scriptures did speak of physical things , let God be true and every man a liar ' . The Biblical topic to cause as much confusion as any in the minds of the Church Fathers was the statement in the Creation story that God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from those which were above the firmament .... ' 2 Now there was nothing novel Footnote  | about belief in waters above the firmament ; it is found in the cosmogonies of the ancient Egyptians and the Persians as well as in Chaldean literature , where it is also associated with belief in a dome-shaped heaven . But it was very far removed from the views of the universe propounded by Aristotle and his followers . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the extent of imagining mountains at the extremity of the firmament and holding that the waters were contained in the hollows and valleys between them ) . Others thought that the waters were not to be taken as literal , but merely as being water-vapour , while some , including Jerome , Ambrose and Bede , held that the waters were crystal . Augustine was wiser than many in his generation and simply contented himself with collating the various views held on the subject . Where scientific arguments and evidence were lacking , the Fathers commonly fell back upon broad religious principles , maintaining that God 's relation to Nature is immediate and not conditioned by any observed rules . And so we find men denouncing the vain and curious desire ofinvestigation palliated under the name of knowledge and science ' , on the ground that it is apt to lead one into searching through magic arts to the confines of occult science ' .2 But even among the orthodox there was considerable diversity of opinion on physical matters . Thus the statement in the Psalter to the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was variously construed to mean that the earth was actually floating on water ( this was the orthodox view ) , that the land was established beside the seas ( the word super ' in the Vulgate being given the force of ' over against ' ) , that the land rises to a higher level than the sea , and that the statement was allegorical and never intended to be taken literally . As late as the fourteenth century the problem was still exercising men 's minds . The anonymous writer of an Footnote  | encyclopaedia entitled Lumen Animae or Book of the Moralities of Great Natural Things solves it to his own satisfaction by granting that in actual location water is above the earth but that virtually it supports the earth , because without water the earth would dry up and be dissolved into powder . Any suggestion that the Biblical text might not be verbally accurate appears to have been entirely alien to the mentality of the age . All the same , a mere passing acquaintance with the literature of the age makes it quite clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical knowledge were by no means incompatible . During the medieval period real progress was registered in almost every department of the physical sciences and Roger Bacon , the greatest of all medieval scientists , would have been the first to deny the imputation of unorthodoxy . This progress is a tribute in no small degree to the wisdom of scholars in refusing to fight over the bones of theological contention which they could not digest . To mark each step of this progress would be a long and tedious task , even supposing that it were practicable ? which is highly debatable ? since the spread of new ideas in the Middle Ages was slow and at best sporadic . The most we can hope to do within the compass of a single chapter is to indicate the main contributions to physical studies made through the centuries . METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATE At the commencement of our period the ideas in circulation about the atmosphere were classical in origin and were derived , almost exclusively , from Pliny 's Natural History and Seneca 's Natural Questions . Of the two works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily be seen by reading Isidore or Raban Maur. on such subjects as winds and climatic zones . Departures from the normal , when they occur , are more apparent than real , for they are usually made in favour of some later pagan plagiarist of Pliny , e.g. Solinus or Mela , for the very thought of originality is foolishness alike to pagan and  | priest at this era . The only kind of novelty to be suffered is an eye-witness observation , inserted parenthetically , or a denunciation of current magical practices . In the former category , we have Bede 's guide to weather forecasts ? based , no doubt , upon observations made in the then rural Jarrow . If the sun is blurred upon rising , or hidden behind clouds , then he contends a rainy day is indicated . If it is red , it will be fair . ' If it is pale , it will be stormy ; if it seems concave , gleaming so that in the centre it sends rays to the north and the south , then the weather will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north or thunder from the east portends a storm , while wind from the south portends heat . . . Again when at night water shines upon the oars , there will be a storm . And when dolphins leap frequently from the waters in which they are carried , then a wind will arise and broken clouds open up the sky.2 But lest we should imagine that observations of this sort are typical of the popular ' meteorology of the time , we need only refer to a treatise by Agobard , a ninth-century Archbishop of Lyons , entitled Liber contra insulsam vulgi opinionem de grandine et tonitruis ( Against the Absurd Opinion of the Vulgar touching Hail and Thunder. ) 3 In this the writer inveighs against charlatans who claim that they could control the weather , produce storms and hail at will . The wretched world , ' he declares , lies now under the tyranny of foolishness ; things are believed by Christians of such absurdity as no one ever could aforetime induce the heathen to believe . ' The general medieval view , sanctioned by Popes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely less foolish however . It is a dogma of faith , ' says St. Thomas Aquinas in his allauthoritative Summa Theologica , that demons can produce winds , storms and rain of fire from heaven . ' 4 By the side Footnote  | of such extravagances , Isidore 's physical explanations are the work of a modern rationalist ! Rain arises from an exhalation from land and sea , which being carried aloft falls in drops on the lands , being acted upon by the sun 's heat , or condensed by strong winds ) . Lightning is caused by the collision of clouds , 2 thunder by their bursting ; 3 the rainbow , by the sun shining into a hollow cloud.4 As the centuries unfold , the bias towards personal observation and experiment becomes increasingly more apparent . The works of Pliny and Seneca are still being read and referred to , but their authority no longer passes unchallenged . By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries almost every physical work exemplifies , in one way or another , this renewal of intellectual vitality . In the forefront stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conches . An early predilection for physics led him to examine the views of Seneca whom he thereafter held in high regard . However , his was no mood of servile acquiescence . Among other things , William had very definite ideas about the circulation and distribution of thermal conditions in the atmosphere . Recognizing that its density and humidity decrease progressively with altitude , he deduced that the sun 's influence on the denser air of low altitudes is far more potent than it is on the rarer strata above . Although heat is emanated from the sun , which in the nature of things is warm , it can warm nothing until it becomes mingled with humidity , which it transforms into its own nature . Hence in the mountains , because the air is rarefied owing to its very great distance from the earth , it can not be warmed by the sun ; instead , as a result of its lightness , it is driven here and there and consequently cooled . In the valleys , on the other hand , because the air is dense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and becomes ' hot.5 Footnote  | But if the atmosphere became increasingly rarefied with rising altitude , how was it that the upper levels are so often more cloudy than the lower levels i This question William of Conches rightly answers by arguing that clouds are not composed of air of greater density than the surrounding parts of the atmosphere , but of water vapour which rises up from the valleys ( owing to its greater warmth ) and is condensed into clouds and snow upon coming into contact with the cooler air of the upper atmosphere ' ? l Furthermore , he appreciated the fact that this process was frequently productive of rain .2 He also observed ( what is by no means as impossible as it seems 3 ) that little frogs and fishes had been known to fall with raindrops during whirlwinds and deduced from this fact that the water-vapour must have been whipped off the surface of lakes , swamps or rivers .4 To the medieval scholar the subject of rain was never very far removed from that of the Deluge ( of the Bible ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it need not be supposed that he understood the phenomenon of long spells of wet weather to which it was due ; but how could the whole of the oikoumene be inundated at one and the same time e and obviously the waters had flooded Footnote  | the whole earth , for , said Isidore ( and his numerous followers agreed ) we observe the proof of this even at the present time in the stones which we are wont to go and see in the distant mountains , which have mingled in them the shells of mussels and oysters and besides are often hollowed by the waters ) . Several hypotheses were put forward . Peter Abelard cited the theory ? which he did not hold ? that it was the purpose of the mysterious waters above the firmament to provide these waters.2 Peter Comestor and Gervase of Tilbury 4 were of the opinion that they came partly from the earth beneath and partly from the air above , a view that is in conformity with the statement in the seventh chapter of Genesis to ' the effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the windows of heaven were opened ' . Another theory based upon the express words of Scripture and also mentioned by Gervase is that no rain had fallen upon the earth until the Deluge came.5 The accumulated watervapour in the atmosphere might be held , not unreasonably therefore , to have supplied the necessary volume of rain . In dealing with the question of winds and atmospheric circulation in general , the writers of the later centuries were not so hampered by the dicta of theology . Some of their theories , in fact , are quite remarkable for their novelty . Thus , William of Conches submits 6 that the cause of the planetary wind system is bound up with ocean currents . He believed that in equatorial waters there are two counter-flowing currents each of which bifurcates at the extremity of the habitable earth . The resulting collision caused the generation Footnote
