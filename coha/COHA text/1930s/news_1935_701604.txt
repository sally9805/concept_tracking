txt Foreign-Made Toys . To the Editor of The Now York Times : I decided to take the afternoon off to do a little Christmas shopping for some of my young friends . After several hours of search in several toy departments I gave up in disgust . Practically every toy I examined was marked " Made in Japan . " . We have all those brilliant young men assembled in Washington figuring how to spend $4,800,000,000 putting 10,000,000 unemployed Americans to work and drafting laws designed to raise wages and shorten hours . Then we have the harassed business man wondering how he can meet the rising payroll , to say nothing of putting more men to work . And we have the women shoppers buying cheaply made foreign toys for their little American-born children , giving not a single thought to the taxes their husbands are paying to feed the unemployed , or the too distressing conditions of child and adult labor in foreign countries . GRETE STENCEL . New York , Dec. 2 , 1935.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
