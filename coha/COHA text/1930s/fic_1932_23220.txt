FRIEND OF THE FAMILY A STORY BY KAY BOYLE W HEN they were young they had a theater with men and women , and the shrubbery even , on wires they could shift about . They hung a curtain across half the room and set the stage up on a table in the middle . Thunder was there , in a thin piece of cardboard waved till it bellowed out behind the scenes . But the best play was the one in which the glass coffin with the princess visible in it was allowed to fall . " The coffin , " said the voice of one of the children , reading behind the stage , " fell and was broken into a-toms . " And then the coffin was whisked off , and hits of white cardboard were east in from the wings . At this moment the Baron always burst into applause , clapping and shouting to stamp out his own laughter , maybe , but even then the curtain was descending and the storm of his clamor fitted in very well . " Bis ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mouth . He stood up from his chair and held his hands up far and high as he applauded . They brought out the players and jerked them at him , and at mother , and at whomever else might be watching . A minute or two after , the Baron would go to the piano in the other room and sing the Glowworm song in German , thundering , thundering till the walls of the house fell in , and his voice went soaring away . He had a big dark voice that filled the spaces of concert halls and made the glass-sticks of the chandeliers shudder . Twice they were taken to New York , and there they heard him sing in the evening . The first time he wore tights and doublet and played stormily in the darkness . The second time he looked as they knew him : in an evening suit with a white flower in his lapel . But however he dressed , he remained a foreign young man to them , luxuriant and black as a bear , making all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albinos and as tasteless . He did not come often , only two or three times in the year maybe ; but mother had her ostrich feather dipped bluer and curled up fresh every time before he came . She bought him neckties and put them away in the drawer for him : as rich in color as she could find , because that was the way he liked them . He did not dress like any man they knew . This time he wore a snow-white overcoat of wool , and a heliotrope suit , and white spats over his shiny shoes . He stood on the step of the pullman car when the train came in and he jumped off shouting before it had even halted . His gloves were yellow chamois with black backbones , and he ripped them off when he kissed their cheeks and gave all the flowers to mother . " Good God , how are you all ? " he said with joy , while they stood looking speechless , because they had forgotten he was so beautiful . He was a Bavarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He walked out of the station to the car with mother 's arm in his and his foreign aspect like a bright cloak all around them . The Baron sat beside mother on the cushions , and the two little girls , in their patent-leather hats , sat erect on the side-seats with their hacks to the others and watched him in the strip of glass . " I miss my own mother so much , " he said , and there in the mirror they could see him kiss mother 's hand inside and out . She shook her blue feather at him , and his dark eyes were shining . and his gold face was filled with alien things . He changed into white flannels for lunch and came boldly out on the terrace . His voice hummed deeply in his throat , and his fingers danced on his open shirt , rapped quick and hard as if striking music from a shapely barrel of sound . He remembered everything that had been there , and what changes they had made . " Ah , the jump-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " You know , I 'll tell you something . I like it much better . What a good idea you had , Mrs. Mutter . " Even mother 's dress was changed . " It 's so hot , " she said when the children saw it with delight . " It 's suddenly so mild , " said mother , " that I slipped this one on . " " But it 's newl " said the little girls . " It 's awfully pretty : " " Yes , " said mother . " Now let 's show the Baron the baby doves . " " But what a beautiful dress ! " said the Baron . " I ca n't quite take my eyes off it . " He caught his clean white shoe in a croquet-wicket and must put out his hand and touch mother 's arm to keep himself from falling . " Did you hurt yourself ? " cried mother softly , and he stood still looking at her . " Yes , " said the Baron in his dark deep voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " He remembered the number of white doves there had been before in the autumn . The gladiola trees were blooming and now cast a blush and languor on the air . He remembered the exact proportion of gin and grenadine for father 's cocktail . When he came back to the table on the terrace , he rolled up his sleeves to make it , and the black silk hairs lay quiet on his arms . " Ah , ah , ah , AM " he sang , as though practicing his scales . The silver shaker was frosting over in his hands . " Here comes Mr. Mutter out of the car ! Hello , hello , hello ! " he cried . He went striding down the flight of steps in the garden . " Hello , hello , Mr. Mutter ! " he shouted . " Hello , " said father quietly . Standing beside the Baron , he looked like a small man , and all of a sudden the gray hairs seemed to spring out like magic all over his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming from the office , he had on his dark blue suit . " In time to make a cocktail for you ! " the Baron cried with a burst of laughter . " You 'd make a first-rate butler , " said father . but he did not smile . When they sat down to lunch , with the little girls at one end sitting quiet and respectful , the Baron began to tell them of what his own mother had meant to him . His teeth shone out like stars and he ate his food with gusto . The sun was on his face , binding great wreaths of beauty to his brows . " When you grow up , little girls , " said he , " it does a terrible thing to your mother . It wipes the light right out of her sweet face and puts something else you never thought of there . Brr-rr , rr-rr , " said the Baron , and he shook as if the cold had struck him . " It sometimes keeps me awake at night , the awful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She could n't get used to me being in the army . She thought she could persuade everyone that I was dressed up like an army officer just for the fun of it . When I came home to her , she would say , ' Now you will take off the uniform , ' as if that would make a little boy of me again ! " The Baron helped himself to the chicken and cream sauce sown with scarlet peppers . But in spite of his interest in this , his thoughts were elsewhere , for he was telling them of the first time he ran away from home . " My mutter , she looked in all the cafes for two days for me and she went to every musical revue in town where she hated to be . She waited outside the opera every night , because she could n't bear to go inside and see the stairs where my father dropped dead from his heart when he was a young man of thirty-five . Think of that ! Dead from singing too loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that 's a fine way to pop off , Mr. Mutter , what do you know about it ? My God , what a wonderful look that man left behind in my poor mother 's face ! " The Baron threw aside his knife and fork in his emotion . " My God , Mr. Mutter ! " he cried to father . " Sometimes I think I could talk for the rest of my life to your children here , saying , ' Be good , he good , be good to that wonderful thing that God gives you for a little while ! ' Sometimes I think I could go down on my knees , " said the Baron , " and ask them that they be good to their wonderful little mother ! " Father wiped his lips with his napkin and sat looking at the Baron . " You mean because of her resemblance to your own mother ? " father said politely . " My God , yes ! " cried the Baron . But he picked up his knife and fork again as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here we are , living men , Mr. Mutter , " he said in a moment . " But do you think that either one of us could bring that wonderful look to Mrs. Mutter that one dead man gave to my own mother 's face ? " " I 'm quite sure I could n't , " said father . " And all the time she was looking for me , the poor woman , " said the Baron , " all the time I was out of the city . I grew up over-night , and I went off with a soubrette into the country . I ? 91 Father laid down his napkin and pushed his chair back from the table . " After all , " he said , " there are children present whose development may be less precocious than yours was ? " The little girls did not lift their eyes . In a minute their father stood up and said he must be going back to the office . The Baron stood up and bowed a little over the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " father said . They all watched the limousine turn and saw father driven down the driveway . " What 's a soubrette ? " one of the children said . " It 's a kind of a frying pan , " said mother . She looked without smiling at the Baron . " Well , what happened next ? " she said . The Baron gave her a cigarette from his case and lighted it for her . " My God , " he said . " It was awful . " " I should have thought it would have been awfully nice , " mother said . " Two days in the country with a  --  with a ? " said the Baron . FRIEND OF " With a frying pan , " said mother smoking . " Do , please , go on . " But the Baron jumped up , as if in anger , and started pacing the terrace . Suddenly he came back and stood great and broad , towering and mighty over mother 's chair . " Two days , " he thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window to see the trees , or the sky , or the river , or anything that tasted fresh and good ! " " Just like a musical comedy officer ! " said mother lightly . " Very well , " said the Baron . The color ran up into his golden face . " Very well , " he said , and he turned and walked away . He went the length of the terrace and down the steps , and they could hear his feet crunching across the drive . The little girls , having finished their fruit , folded their napkins and followed mother to the balustrade . There they saw the top of the Baron 's head &sappearing; around the grape-arbor 's arch . " It might be almost anywhere , " mother said to them . Her voice was soft and filled with love for them . She stood looking out over the sight of the river and the thick curve of woods above the shining bands of blue . There were no barges or ferries to spoil it just at that moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay hidden not far beyond . " It might be almost anywhere , it 's so lovely , " said mother . She took the little girls ' hands and she said , " He 's such a little child , we 'd better go and see . " They found the Baron on his knees , looking for four-leaf clovers ; for things went in and out of his head and no auger fixed them there . Mother and the little girls sat down and spread out their skirts on the grasses . They saw mother 's crossed ankles and her little boots , and they saw with shyness their own and each other 's bare red knees sprinkled over with yellow hair . They tried to cover their knees , but could not . But the Baron , in any case , was talking about the new roles he was going to sing . In the afternoon he wrote a one-act opera for them . He sat in the music-room on the bench , rippling it out over the keyboard : songs and ballets that charmed them and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard before . All afternoon mother sat in the window , stitching new skirts and cloaks on the puppets . In the end it was an opera filled with humorous songs , written out nimble and fast by the Baron 's pen as he played with the other hand , preserved forever in notes with tails and without all over the ruled sheets . Mother accompanied them day after day , and in a little while the children knew it all , could sing out the parts without laughing , and could make the saucepan dance on its strings . " An opbra-comique in one act , " said the Baron , " entitled : ' The Soubrette , the Saucepan , and the Percolator . ' " He himself sang the coffee percolator 's part , striking his broad ringing chest and shouting with joy when they practiced it out together . The Soubrette was a flying-pan , very shiny and small , and mother had stuck a piece of her own blue feather over the painted eyes . On the night of the performance father sat down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : " The Soubrette looks like mother . " " How silly ! " said mother from where she was playing softly the opening bars . The children saw her turn her head in the candlelight and smile at the dinner guests who now made up the audience . The scene before them was the top of a kitchen stove , and in a moment the Percolator was jerked on to the stage , and the Baron began his stirring song . " Mai , le Percolator , perka , perka , perk ! " sang his rich wondrous voice . The song was the Toreador 's , but it did not matter at all . Deeply , widely rang out the bubbling voice of the Baron from behind the tall curtain , while the silver Percolator in a. purple cape strutted across the stove . " Je perk , je perk , je perk ! " sang the Baron , and now the little Soubrette suddenly leaped upright from where she had been reclining on the coals . Her mouth was painted open for singing , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . She uttered one phrase : " Quand to es a , je ne pense qu'a ton percolating ! " and then the Baron again burst into song ; his gay mouth opened wide behind the children , and his voice torrented out upon them , so close that it set their hearts to quaking . In his magic throat there swelled a breaking sorrow , a terrible , stirring sorrow that made their spines go cold with joy . Every other time , and all other music had been but a preparation for this wild moment . Surely the stones and the beams of the house must fall when his voice arched up as pure and strong as stone itself , and he called out , as though summoning someone to his side : " Soubrette , ma pale a frire , je t'aiirte ! " Everyone in the room burst into applause , but in a moment , when this was done , father said in a voice that could be heard very clearly : " I 've always liked my Bizet sung by the Italians or French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , like a little choir , the children 's voices were softly raised in song . Behind them hummed the Baron 's voice , tender , wooing as a cello , shaping them and guiding them towards love . Softly their mother played the breathless bars , and their own frail lungs went wide and piped all their mother 's loveliness to beauty for the world to hear . The Frying pan hastened across the glowing stage to the Percolator 's side and melted into his embrace . Spout to painted mouth , thus it was the Saucepan found them , and by a wonderful feat , steam exploded from under his lid . He sent them clattering apart , the Soubrette 's blue feather blowing in agitation . He tossed his tin cover down on the stove and minced his fury out . It was the Baron 's voice again that gave vent to a pompous , testy ire ; but the Baron 's voice turned light in spite , running shallow , and his mouth turned up to smile . " Je suis tine casserole pleine d'affaires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ les Codes , In Lai , Font toujours respect68 , grace a moi . Je n'ai pas le temps de rdammser Car je fais la cuisine , c'est 1a verite ! Je n'ai pas le temps pour quoi que co soil ! Je suis une casserole ! " The Saucepan began a pas seul across the stage , but suddenly father stood up among all the laughing people . " What is the matter ? " said mother 's soft voice across the dark as she played the music . " Have n't the time to be amused , " said father . There was a little stir of surprise amongst the guests . " Do n't be so silly ! " mother cried out , for now the Baron had ceased singing . " I do n't like the part that 's been given me , " said father loudly . He had brought the whole performance to an end . " But you 're not the Saucepan ! " cried mother , and everybody laughed . Even the Baron behind the stage stood shaking with laughter . " ila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his golden notes rang out . " My God , Mr. Mutter ! " he called out in his beautiful voice . " You do n't even look like a , saucepan ! " " I do n't suppose I do ! " said father savagely from the door . " It was just something that had n't occurred to me before ! " Sometimes at night the children remembered how the Baron looked when he was laughing , or how he threw his head up in the sun , or how his hands spread out wide over the keys of the piano . That was the last time he ever came to the house , but they remembered him for a long while after he went away , and how mother had lain on the bed , and how the wind or something else had moaned and sobbed at the window like a woman crying all night .
