txt It was taken for granted when suspension of gold payments was announced by the British Government that sterling exchange rates would depreciate . Wartime experience made this certain ; it also taught that such depreciation would roughly measure the decline in gold yalue of the paper currency . At the lowest point of the post-war period , New York exchange on London was depreciated nearly 35 per cent from the pre-war parity rate and exchange on Paris 90 per cent . Prices in both countries rose in approxi mate proportion . The " Index number " of British prices when sterling touched $3.18 in 1920 was something more than three times the average just before the war ; the statistical average of prices in France during the month of July , 1926 , when franc exchange went beLow 2 cents , was seven and one-half times what it had been in 1914 . In Slermany the " astronomical figares " to which paper inflation Nose during 1924 were reflected in prices for commodities and for Stock Exchange shares expressed n billions and trillions of marks . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as in our nvn Civil War period ; in the recent war the outright public bidding of ; uch a premium was prohibited . But the foreign exchange rate proved to be an equally accurate neasure of actual currency depreciation ; also , when free auctioning-off sf gold arrivals from the Transvaal was resumed , in 1919 , the price per qwq last-named yardstick has already been applied in the last two days . Yesterday 's cables reported that the bid for Transvaal gold in the open London market , which is normally about 84 shillings 11 pence per fine ounce , had been raised to 99 shillings 7 pence . That price , however , was arrived at only through , adjusting the bid for the gold in British currency to the depreciation in sterling exchange which had already occurred on the New York market , where the ruling ' rate for sterling was taken as $4.15 , a reduction not quite 15 per cent from parity . The interesting question of " the effect on British prices remains to be determined . Mr. SNOWDEN has expressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime course of staple prices yields no exact analogy , because markets were then under the special influence of enormous purchases by belligerent governments and blockade of numerous producing markets . That some effect will be observed in the matter of higher prices is at least an economic probability . There has as yet been scarcely any indication of such a movement . The London price of silver has indeed risen in the past two days from 12 15-16 pence per ounce to 15% , which is the highest since last December and which compares with a low price of 12 pence last February . But this bidding in the bullion market is still tentative and experimental , as indeed is the " offering-down " of sterling in the foreign exchange market . All movements of this kind , like the old-time " premium on gold , " are invariably shaped and modified , first by the scope of actual suspension of gold payments , next by the market 's view of its probable duration , and of the basis on which resumption of gold payments will be effected .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
