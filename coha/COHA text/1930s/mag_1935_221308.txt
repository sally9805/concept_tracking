The Bible 's sacred Ark of the Covenant , say Ethiopians , was abstracted by the Queen of Sheba 's son from King Solomon and is to be found today at Aksum , containing the tablets on which are inscribed the Ten Commandments . Last week correspondents removed their shoes and were led by High Priest Ghebezbe Tacle into Italy 's captured Cathedral of Aksum . <P> Peering intently into a small chamber indicated by their reverent guide , the correspondents agreed that none of them could see the Ark of the Covenant . <P> " Only a saintly man can see it , " explained the High Priest , adding with Ethiopian tact , " I have never seen it myself . "
