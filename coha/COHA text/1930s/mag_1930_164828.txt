Sadly six years ago the present " Son of Heaven , " athletic , scholarly Emperor Hirohito , stood on the ramparts of Tokyo 's Imperial Palace and saw a third of the city burning up and shaking down . Nero would have enjoyed the sight , not so Hirohito . But last week his Majesty ascended the same eminence and had proper cause for imperial joy . The whole area of the " Great Fire " ( see map ) which accompanied the quake of 1924 has been substantially if not elegantly rebuilt . <P> It was of course necessary to report minutely to the imperial ancestors at their shrines all about New Tokyo . With this duty in mind , the Emperor entered an open touring car and , followed by 29 carfuls of dignitaries , made the rounds of nearly all places key-numbered on the map . <P> Big Sumida River ( 1 ) and little Kanda River ( 2 ) , his Majesty can state as an eyewitness are still flowing . Buds are sprouting in the " Cherry Blossom Parks " : Shiba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5 ) , and Hama Rikyu ( 6 ) , which is every year the scene of the Imperial Cherry Blossom Garden Party . Different is Asakusa Park ( 7 ) , a " Coney Island , " incongruously surrounding the Sacred Temple of the Goddess of Mercy . <P> By no means without interest to the imperial ancestors is the Yoshmara or <P> " Abode of Daughters of Joy , " among the most sumptuous quarters in New Tokyo , and the first to be completely rebuilt . Not in the fire area was the smart residential district near the Imperial Palace and the Akasaka Palace ( 8 ) of Crown Prince Chichibu . <P> Famed is the " Sunrise Bridge " ( 9 ) from which all distances in Japan are measured . So sturdy was the Central Railway Station 's anti-earthquake bracing that it did not shake down ( 10 ) . The " Hall of the Nameless Dead " ( 11 ) commemorates 33,000 victims of the fire . Major Japanese banks : Bank of Japan , Mitsui Bank , Mitsubishi Bank cluster near each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York is aloof ( 14 ) . Number 13 is the lucky site of the Imperial Hotel , " most popular in the Far East , " refuge of Occidentals during the fire , completely proof against mere earthquakes , though conceivably the earth might open and swallow it .
