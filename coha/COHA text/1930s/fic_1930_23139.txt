THE JINX AND PHYLLIS A STORY BY ELMER DAVIS TUCK ? Yes , some people are horn with it and some are born to do without it ; but for most of us it pretty well evens up in the long run  --  especially if we take hold and help . For instance , there was the case of Phyllis Netherman . Phyl 's bad luck began a couple of years before she was born , when Henry Netherman met Esmeralda Ingoldsby . It was bad luck for Henry too , but lie was one of those people who bear bad luck so nobly that they attract it like a magnet . Esmeralda told him that she did n't love him and never would , and that she did n't intend to marry anyway . her life was devoted to her work , she said  --  the work of the Society for the Prevention of Something or Other and the Suppression of Something Else , of which she was founder , president , and guiding spirit . But Henry kept after her , with a perseverance worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when the heaviest contributor to her society died , leaving all his money to his familyEsmeralda allowed Henry to lead her to a marriage license bureau , and thence to a pastor 's study . Then in due Lime there was Phyllis ; and a few years later  --  the summer I was ten years old  --  they bought a cottage up here on Peatogue Lake . We 're an average lot , we of the Peatogue summer colony  --  none of us poor and none of us rich ( now that the Dillards are gone , who used to have that big estate down the lake shore ) ; just aslice of middle-class America , so much alike in race and background and temperament that newcomers complain that the summer is almost over before they can tell us apart . And we 're just like one big family ; most of us started coming here as children and grew up on the beach with the boys and girls we married afterward . But the colony took the Nethermans in , for they seemed like all the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was in the cotton business  --  going down to New York on Monday morning and coming back Friday evening , like all the other Peatogue husbands , and making an adequate but not an offensive amount of money . Even when we learned that this was the Esmeralda Ingoldsby Netherman who was so renowned for prevention and suppression nobody cared much till she started trying to prevent and suppress around Peatogue . Young as I was that summer , I remember the uproar . Esmeralda was n't one of these sour reformers ; she was large and bland and smiling . She was always having a lot of fun and she insisted that you must have a lot of fun too , or what she called fun . The old-timers could n't get rid of her ; but they made her give up trying to reform us . Everybody liked Henry Nether-man ; and if his wife did n't quite belong , she gave the impression that she was set apart by her fame , as was Mrs. Dillard by her money . Esmeralda could see the advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyl grew up on the beach with all the rest of us . When she came she 'd had the precise speech and quiet good manners of a child who has n't played much with other children ; but of course that did n't last . I was fifteen , Phyl was eleven , before it occurred to me that she was different from other girls ; and then only when I overheard mother saying to father , one Friday evening : " I had a long talk with the Battleship to-day . " ( Esmeralda was known around Peatogue as the Battleship ; and she was proud of it . ) " She 's quite worried over Phyllis 's romantic tendencies . It seems the girl is mad about stories of hights and heroes . . . . Poor Phyl ! She 'll need a hero . " " Why ? " I put in ; and mother glowered at me . " You are n't supposed to be listening , Benny . " So I pretended to read a book , but I kept my ears open as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to marry the poor girl , with that old dragon standing guard . " " She 'll meet somebody who does n't know Esmeralda , " father predicted . " Where ? The Battleship does n't trust schools and colleges . Phyl is to be privately educated  --  trained to carry on her mother 's work . Of course , says Esmeralda , marriage is an experience that should n't be missed , but it 's to be only an incident in Phyl 's career . Which means that the girl and her husband , if she ever gets one , will be nothing but slaves to that woman . I tell you , John , it 's terrible ! " " Lots of things are terrible , " said father , in what I had learned to recognize as his Friday evening voice . " Business , for instance . I 'm not going to waste worry on Phyllis Netherman . " " Every parent of a boy in Peatogue ought to worry about her ! She 's going to be a raving beauty , with that fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want your son to have Esmeralda for a mother-in-law ? " I thought that was nonsense ; Phyllis was only a skinny kid . Still , I remembered what I heard that evening . And I suppose in the next few years some such conversation took place in every cottage around Peatogue Lake , where there was a boy who was growing up on the beach with Phyllis . She turned out a raving beauty , sure enough ; but as she grew up we boys were all afraid of her . Like the Dillards ' bear , somebody said ; but she was worse than that . The Dillards ' bear cub had grown up on the beach with us , too . Now that he was a full-grown bear , strangers were afraid of him ; whenever he left the estate the Dillard boys came with him , or right behind . But to us who had grown up with him he was still one of the gang . But our mothers had managed to endow Phyl with an atmosphere of nameless horror  --  like that girl Hawthorne wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , too . When the crowd was lounging on the beach after a swim she 'd sometimes join in the chatter  --  and then all at once she 'd catch herself , and go off into a queer silence , as if she 'd remembered she did n't belong . She took to swimming alone at sunrise , by the big rock at the corner of the Dillard place ; to strolling alone on the beach , shy and stiff and proud . Somebody called her the Steep-walking Beauty . What 's that you say ? What was the matter with us boys ? Where was our spirit , that one of us did n't run off with her ? . . Well , our mothers had trained us early ; they did n't wait till Phyl was old enough to excite us . By the time she ripened , every boy in Peatogue had certain facts imbedded in his background of knowledge  --  toadstools were poison and so was she . And if we ever started to forget it , there was Esmeralda before our eyes . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the first boy who ever kissed Phyl . ( Oh , it 's all right to tell it ; she tells it herself , and laughs about it , damn her . ) Just before I went back to college for my junior year I somehow got up courage to take her home from the Saturday night dance at the club . On the porch , I forgot that she was poison ; she was Phyllis , so I kissed her . She took it open-eyed , reflective , wondering if she liked it . I kissed her again . . That time her eyes closed ; she certainly did like it . So did I. Then I let go of Phyl in a hurry , for the old Battleship was steaming out on the porch . " Come , Benny ! " She smiled like a hungry dragon . " You 're too big a boy to maul the girls like that , now . Besides , it 's time to go home . " Yes , I went home . So would you . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to college . I told her I 'd write to her , but she said it was no use  --  her mother read all her letters . I had n't meant to write anything her mother could n't read , but I was ashamed to admit it , after that . She said she might write to me , but she never did ; and that fall I met a girl named Lois McCarthy at the Princeton game ; and ? Well , that 's how it all began . My wife 's the salt of the earth ; I 'm glad I never got mixed up with Phyl . Though sometimes I 've wondered If I 'd known as much that summer as I think I know now . . . But I was telling you about Phyllis . I missed two or three summers at the lake , while I was getting my start in the office ; but after the baby was born Lois and I took the old cottage , and I began coming up on Friday evening , and getting up early Monday morning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:15 train back to town , just as father had done for twenty years . Peatogue was still the same , and most of the old crowd was there , including Phyl . She was her mother 's secretary now ; but the reform industry was feeling the post-war deflation , and Esmeralda apparently thought Phyl might as well get her experience of marriage in the slack season . At any rate , when Phyl 's fiance presently came up for a visit wecould guess that her mother had picked him out . We all met him at tea the day after he arrived . His name was Alfred ; he came of an old Brooklyn family , with money ; and the general verdict was that he was about as good as could be expected . But that evening Phyl took him for a walk ; and on the winding path beyond the Dillard place they met a large black bear . Phyl knew the Dillard boys would be right behind him , and she turned to tell . Alfred so . But Alfred had gone . I 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . He may have looked back and seen Phyl and the bear engaged in a friendly chat ; but he kept right on going . It was sixteen miles around the lake to the railroad station , over wooded hills where he did n't know the trails ; but he made it , afoot and in the dark , rather than go back to face Esmeralda . The Nethermans never spoke of him again ; but Phyl turned up with a new fiance next summer , and we could see she 'd picked this one herself . There was nothing the matter with Rudy , except that he did n't have any money . He was a Hungarian , an ex-war aviator ; not a nobleman , he insisted , just a country gentleman whose estates had been annexed and confiscated by the Rumanians . His manners were charming ; and Bob Dillard , who had lately bought a seaplane and started commuting by air from the lake to the foot of Wall Street , reported that he flew like a bird . But he had no money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tidy property invested in guaranteed first mortgages at five per cent ; but of course he 'd left it all to Esmeralda . The old Battleship took the engagement like a sportsman . The young people had surprised her , she admitted , but she liked Rudy . Only , she could n't think of letting her child marry an aviator ; and aviating was all that Rudy knew . But there was no hurry , said Esmeralda ; let Phyl and Rudy have a good time at the lake that summer , and maybe something would turn up . And so it did , after pictures of the engaged couple had appeared in all the papers  --  a suit against Rudy , by a manicure girl in a San Antonio hotel . Not breach of promise  --  non-support . He 'd married her when he was an enlisted man at Kelly Field , under another name . Some people will tell you that the other name was his real one ; that he 'd learned all his flying on stolen time at Kelly Field , and had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I believe he enlisted in the American army because he was broke , and changed his name because he was ashamed ; I believe he really thought that Mexican divorce he 'd got was good . Phyl believed that , too , and took him up to explain it all to her mother . . . . Well  --  poor Rudy . He 'd faced the Dillards ' bear without flinching , but he could n't stand up against Esmeralda . He went  --  God knows where , but 1 ' 11 bet he kept on going too . So people began to talk about the terrible luck poor Phyl was having . Even mothers who had taught their boys she was poison were sorry for her , now that their boys were safely married . But Phyl , naturally , began to think that maybe she was poison a jinx to every man who loved her . " Though , " she told my wife afterward , " it was partly my own fault . " My wife is Phyl 's best friend at the lake  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up on the beach with her , in the days when she did n't quite belong . " I 've always expected too much of men , " Phyl confessed to Lois the summer after Rudy went . " I expected a hero  --  but heroes are scarce . And I did n't know how to handle the men I had . It was Alfred 's legs that took him away from the bear , not his intentions . If I 'd given him another chance . . . And Rudy really did want me , notthat other woman . I told him I 'd wait till he got rid of her , even if it took years ; and he was all for doing it till mother lit into him . I ought to have known enough to run off with him , and never let him meet her at all . I guess I 'll have to try to make my own luck after this . In fact , " said Phyl , gallantly trying to laugh about it , " I 'm about ready to take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too damned reasonable , at that . But the men I meet in the winter , working for mother , are simply hopeless ; and here at the lake everybody knows I 'm a jinx now . " " You know what the jinx is as well as I do ! " said Lois fiercely . " Break away from your mother ! You could be somebody else 's secretary ? " " I could n't leave her , " Phyl sighed . " Mother 's feeling low , though she wo n't admit it . Five per cent 's a miserable income , she says , so last winter she took about half her money and put it into something that would bring her ten per cent with perfect security . She got ten per cent , all right  --  ten per cent of her capital back , when she finally sold out . And her reform society is n't doing so well just now ? " " What of it ? " Lois snapped . " You do n't care about the fool thing . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't let her down . " So we began to worry about poor Phyl , who was only twenty-three and more beautiful than ever , but had the manner of somebody 's maiden aunt aged forty-eight  --  pleasant but aloof , as if her life were all over . And then something incredible happened , which made the older people tell us sagely that everything came out right in the long run . Bob Dillard fell in love with Phyl . At first we did n't take it seriously . He flew up from Wall Street every evening , to stroll over after dinner and talk to her ; but they 'd grown up on the beach together and had always been like brother and sister . Then all at once they broke the news that they were going to be married in October . Lois claims that Phyl was never crazy about Bob , the way she 'd been about Rudy ; but she liked him a lot , and he was n't afraid of the jinx . And he promptly told Esmeralda she 'd have to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend their winters at Palm Beach . How did Esmeralda like that Nobody asked her how she liked it , but she took it . You do n't argue with ten million dollars . So all the women said it was too beautiful , the way poor Phyl 's luck had turned at last . She still swam before breakfast , by the big rock next to the Dillard place  --  just about the time Bob took off for Wall Street . You could see the rock from our house ; Lois used to get up and watch them from her window ? Phyl poised on the rock , lithe and straight against the sunrise , blowing a kiss in the air as Bob flew by ; and he answering her with a loop or a zoom or a barrel roll . So it was Lois who ran to the rescue the morning something happened to his engine in the middle of a stunt , two hundred feet above the lake . She was too late to help Bob ; he 'd been killed when he hit the water .. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew ; and Lois managed to drag her out of the lake  --  fighting and sobbing , begging Lois to let her die . After that , nobody doubted that she was a jinx . The Dillards moved away , and put up the estate for sale ; but Esmeralda and her daughter were back the next summer , and the next . They had n't been able to sell the cottage ; Esmeralda would n't rent it with her household treasures in it , and she could n't afford to leave it empty . She 'd been trying another of those ten-per-cent investments . The second summer she arrived in a wheel chair , and we 'd have given three cheers if it had n't been for Phyl . The old Battleship was n't sunk , but she was badly waterlogged . She 'd had enemies in her own organization  --  all these reformers seem to hate one another like poison  --  and they 'd got together and pitched her out . She always swore she 'd have turned the tables on them at the next meeting if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said so ; but she could still move , though not much , or suddenly ; when she went anywhere Phyl had to push her . Lois , whose father was a doctor , swore it was only a neurosis ; Esmeralda 's nerves had faked a collapse , to give her an excuse for not making a fight she could n't win . Maybe so . At any rate , newcomers always remarked on the brave way she bore her affliction ; she did n't look at all careworn . It was , as usual , the people around her who looked careworn . Not Phyl , particularly ; she was silent and withdrawn , but lovely . But she reminded me of the Dillard place  --  boarded up , untenanted , unwanted . There were no unmarried men at the lake ; and in the winter , chained to her mother 's wheel chair , she met no men at all . Her brown eyes were sultrier than ever ; somebody said she looked like smoldering dynamite . Some of the women were inclined to criticize her when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Bob had crashed . She told Lois she had had to do that  --  fight it out with her nerves , there on the spot , to save herself from complete collapse . But even to Lois she did n't talk much ; only , one evening , when Lois mentioned some inexpensive pleasure that Phyl might enjoy in town next winter : " I wo n't even be able to eat next winter , " said Phyl , " unless I can leave mother and get a job . We wo n't have a cent of income after October . She 's taken all that 's left of her money  --  all of it , Lois ! ? and put it into some new company that even the broker says may not pay a dividend for years . She thinks the stock 's going up , of course . " " You ought to leave her , Phyl ! " said Lois savagely . " Let her sink or swim  --  she 'd swim , I 'll bet  --  and look out for yourself . " " For myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm jinxed . " In August , when I got my two weeks ' vacation , I brought a guest up to the lake with me  --  a man I 'd known at college , named Neil Desmond . " What on earth did you do that for ? " my wife demanded . " Your one chance in the summer to be alone with your family . Just because he was an old college friend you had n't seen for years . . . " " It was n't just that , " I explained uncomfortably . " When I told him what a quiet place this was  --  nobody but peaceful married couples bringing up children ? he looked so wistful that I could n't help asking him . " " So men feel that in him too , " she mused . " We 'll be lucky if he does n't wreck a home before these two weeks are over . " " Not in Peatogue ! " I laughed . " Besides , he is n't interested in women ; he told me so . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the place . I forgot about poor Phyl . " " She 's the most attached of us all , " Lois sighed . " But when women attached to husbands who are in town from Monday to Friday see those eyes of his . . Oh , yes , my dear , even in Peatogue . I 'm not sure I like him , myself ; but if he were visiting somebody else , and you were n't here . . " You may think that 's comedy , " I told her , " hut I do n't . Anyway , Neil 's a poet . These women are literary ; they 'll envy his hostess . " " They would if he were Henry van Dyke , " she said , " or Robert Underwood Johnson . Or if you 'd stayed in town . " But Neil wrecked no homes ; he stayed away from women . He hardly ever went to the beach where the crowd gathered ; he used to put on a bathing suit after breakfast and go off to spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the settlement . But one morning he went out before breakfast ; and when he came back , tolook at his face was like listening to the Philharmonic Orchestra . " I 've seen a nymph ! " he burst out . " A bronze naiad with a torch of fiery hair , poised on a rock against the sunrise ! We swam together , in silence ; there was no need of words , in that perfect moment . But now I do n't even know who she is ! " he finished , petulant as a child . " Oh , that must have been Phyllis Netherman , " I told him . " Poor Phylno wonder she does n't say much . She 's had such hard hick . . . " A look from my wife hit me like a blackjack , and I said no more . " Lost her money , eh ? " said Neil . " That 's bad , but there are worse misfortunes . ? . Married ? No ? Thank God ! " He prowled off to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if you 'd said another word ! " Lois blazed . " Do n't you see that this is Phyl 's chance  --  a man who never heard of her jinx ? I 'll see that he does n't hear anything , either . " " If he meets Esmeralda , " I said , " he wo n't need to hear anything . " But Phyl had learned a lesson ; she never let him meet her mother  --  said she was too ill to see strangers , I believe . Neil went out at dawn next morning , to come back with that same melodious face ; and that afternoon he and Phyl strolled down to the beach and joined the crowd of bathers . It was her way of announcing that if anybody knew of any impediment to this affair , let them speak now or forever after hold their peace . Nobody spoke ; Lois had seen to that . Any woman who had given Phyl away would have been lynched by all the others  --  scratched to pieces with their finger nails . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , it was all of that , but that was n't all . Phyl did n't notice men , and there were no unmarried men at the lake for her to notice ; but a man did n't have to be unmarried to notice that she looked like smoldering dynamite . Mothers no longer worried about her , but a few of the wives were beginning to . ( No , not my wife ; at least she says not . ) There were husbands , I suppose , who thought Neil ought to be warned . You might marry a girl who had epilepsy in the family , but you 'd want to know about it first ; and Esmeralda was worse than epilepsy . But nobody warned him . We are experienced husbands up here in Peatogue . " At that , " I told Lois , " I do n't know how Neil could support a wife . There 's no money in poetry ; he barely makes his own living . If he had Phyl to look after  --  Esmeralda too , now that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if he only makes a thousand dollars a year ! " she said . " Phyl must have her chance ! She can earn her own keep as a secretary , and we 'll pass the hat for Esmeralda . If only nothing happens . . I do hope . . . Oh , it would kill her , if anything happened now ! " But nothing happened for a week or so , except that our guest was out every day , all day and all evening . One night , however , be came in before Lois and I had gone to bed , and tried to make conversation with us ; but he looked preoccupied . I began to talk about his work . " Hah ! " he snorted . " My work ! Everything I 've ever written has been damned with the same adjectives  --  wistful , haunting , tender ! They pop up in every review . And it 's true ! That 's the kind of stuff I write  --  all I 'm fit for . I 'd like to tunnel through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Pole ; but I ca n't even write about such things . All I 'm good for is a little verse  --  wistful , haunting , tender ! Bah ! " He stormed off to his room . Lois looked at me , rather frightened . " Ben , what do you suppose is the matter with him ? " " She 's promised to marry him , " I conjectured , " and now he feels all unworthy of the wonder girl . Do n't worry ; that mood will pass . " " Oh , it will , will it ? " said Lois . " Well , I hope it passes soon , whatever it is , I do n't like the way he acts , Ben . " " He 's all right , " I said , though by now I was a little worried , too . " There never was a poet who did n't secretly believe he was better than Shakespeare , no matter what he said . There ! " Overhead , we heard him walk to the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaked as he leaned on it . " He 'll write a poem , " I predicted , " and work it off . " " I do hope nothing happens , " said Lois uneasily . When we went to bed , she peered through the crack of Neil 's door . " He 's still writing , " she reported . " But I do n't like it . Nothing must happen , now ! " The next thing I knew it was daylight , and Lois was shaking me . " Ben Odwell , get up ! He 's gone ! . . . Who ? Neil , of course ! That miserable creature you called your friend ! Gone ! " " What of it ? " I asked , trying to prop my eyes open . " He 's gone for his regular sunrise swim with Phyl . " " He has not ! I saw him from the window . He was dressed and he had his suitcase and he was going the other way  --  toward the dock ! Going to take the ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for us ! " I read it , in the pink light of the rising sun . Dear Lois and Ben A thousand thanks for all your kindness ; a thousand apologies for this brusque departure . But I could n't let this go on ; it would have been too horrible . I 'll write you some day  --  from the desert , perhaps , or the South Seas . NEIL . " The rotten coward ! " Lois cried . " Somebody must have told him something ! I wonder who ? If ever I find out . . " She looked at the clock on the bedside table . " Ten minutes to ferry time , Ben ! You can still catch him and bring him back . " " Bring him back ? But , my dear , if he does n't want to come back . . " " Drag him back ! By the hair ! No , do n't stop to put your clothes on . If you ca n't go after him in your pajamas I 'll go in my nightgown ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed best . I got there with two minutes to spare ; and thank God this was n't Monday morning  --  there was nobody on the ferry but Neil . By that time I was about as mad as Lois . You 'd be mad , too , at a man who made you run a mile before breakfast . " You come back ! " I told him . " I do n't care what you 've heard  --  come back to that girl ! " He regarded me mournfully . " And wreck both our lives ? Ben , I 've glimpsed Paradise this last week ; but to ask that lovely girl to bear the burden that weighs me down . . . " " What burden ? " I asked . He heaved a profound sigh . " Ben , old man , I 'm jinxed . In all my love affairs some inescapable fatality pursues me . I ought to have told Phyl days ago ; but I could n't bear to wreck our idyll .

There was Mildred her father wanted me to go into his office . He said poetry was n't a business . I refused , so they sent her around the world . " He paused , shuddering . " What then ? " I asked sympathetically . " Did she ? Did she die ? " " Die ? Hell , no . She married the Governor of Hong Kong . Then there was Clarice . Her father said he would n't have me in his office .

Phyl had got his letter sooner than he had expected  --  she got up early these mornings , for that sunrise swim with him  --  and had decided to make her own luck . The ferry stopped ; Phyl climbed aboard , all dripping , and tumbled into Neil 's arms . What about his jinx that had worried him so ? Well , apparently he forgot that when Phyl kissed him . So would you . And then the dock behind me resounded with a majestic tread , and I turned to face Esmeralda . Yes , the old Battleship , steaming along at full speed .

Never shall it be said that the child of Esmeralda Ingoldsby Netherman was married in her bathing suit . " So you see it all evens up in the long run . What 's that ? You do n't see that marrying a crazy poet evens up for much ? Well , Phyl seems to think it does ; Neil 's quite sane , anyway , since she took him in hand . She was too wise to make him over ; he still writes poetry , which the critics still describe as wistful , haunting , and tender . But he never looks at another woman .

And she left Phyl the remnant of Henry Netherman 's money , all sunk in the stock of a new company that had never paid a dividend . That company was called the Radio Corporation of America , and Esmeralda had picked up a couple of thousand shares  --  old shares , long before the splitup  --  at thirty-four . I 'd say that evens up for quite a run of bad luck , would n't you ?
