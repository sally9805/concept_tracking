Last year Professor Ernst Alfred Hauser of Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered a new kind of wrapping material - odorless , tasteless , impervious to fire and corrosion by acids-made from bentonite clay and called " Alsifilm " ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) . Alsifilm is already being used to replace mica ( isinglass ) in electric motor and generator insulation . Last week Professor Hauser looked forward to a time when Alsifilm would free the U. S. of dependence on foreign supplies of mica , now largely imported from India . <P> The first Alsifilm was whitish and opaque , like a tough vellum paper . This quality suggested its use as a durable medium for writing and printing . Dr. Hauser is now making another kind , from a clay he discovered in California 's Death Valley , which is almost completely transparent and waterproof-usable as wrapper for tobacco and foods . He is also experimenting with this type as a possible material for photographic films and automobile windows .                 @ @ @ @
