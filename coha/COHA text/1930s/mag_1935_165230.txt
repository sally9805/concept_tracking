Last year it was Henri Cochet and Ellsworth Vines . Last week William Tatem Tilden II and his promoter William O'Brien had a new attraction for their annual tennis tour : the ' ' best doubles team in the world , " George Lott &; Lester Stoefen . <P> The tour opened in Manhattan . Lean , spidery , baldish but still as spry as ever , Tilden started the evening by beating Lott at singles . At doubles , Lott &; Stoefen won the first two sets , the second 16-14 . Apparently exhausted , Tilden suddenly came to life , helped his partner Vines pull out the third set , 13-11 . What happened then amazed a crowd of 15,000 who were getting ready to go home before midnight . Knowing as well as Promoter O'Brien that a victory for Lott &; Stoefen would help the tour 's gate receipts , Tilden &; Vines suddenly became invincible , smashed through the next two sets , won the match 3-6 , 14-16 , 13-11 , 8-6 , 6-4 . It was the longest professional tennis match on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nosed out Tilden in Los Angeles last year . Still fresh after it was over , Tilden and Vines repeated their victory in Philadelphia the next night and Washington the following night , lost in Pittsburgh night later . At singles , Vines beat Stoefen regularly . <P> Applauding Tilden for his endurance , Vines for his bulletlike speed , tennis critics last week were favorably impressed by Lott &; Stoefen . Given time to grow accustomed to canvas-covered courts , indoor lights , the behavior of spectators who do not feel obliged to remember their good manners . Lott &; Stoefen may yet win a majority of their matches on the current tour . Like last year 's , it will last 15 weeks , play in 74 cities . Next fortnight 's billings : Boston , Providence , New Haven , Cleveland , Detroit , Buffalo , Cincinnati , Indianapolis , Chicago , St. Louis . <P> In Melbourne last week Britain 's Fred Perry , currently the world 's No. 1 tennist , lost to Jack Crawford in the final of the Australian championship , 2-6 , 6-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match : " This may be the last time Crawford and I will meet . " Newshawks were quick to sense the implication : when Tilden 's tour starts next year , Perry may be star attraction .
