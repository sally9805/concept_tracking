FOREIGN NEWS <P> The event of basic world importance which took place last week occurred in China . It was as if Hitler had been kidnapped by Goring or Stalin by Voroshilov . In fact the most powerful man in Eastern Asia had been kidnapped last week by one of his potent and ambitious countrymen , a Chinese who not many years ago was under treatment in the Rockefeller Hospital at Peiping for addiction to opium . Kidnappee was the Premier of China , Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , the military conqueror of his country not many years ago ( TIME , April 25 , 1927 ) . Kidnapper was " The Young Marshal , " Chang Hsueh-liang , son of the late great War Lord Chang Tso-lin who was assassinated by Japanese agents in their greatest mistake of this decade ( TIME , July 2 , 1928 ) . <P> In China , nothing is ever exactly what it seems except an assassination , and the kidnapping of the greatest man in Eastern Asia , unless it should be followed by his assassination , lacked any quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the staggering news broke , as open to the highly probable suspicion that the Premier of China had had himself kidnapped from the noblest of motives . <P> Sian , whence news of the kidnapping was flashed , is almost as remote and centrally located in China as though President Roosevelt were kidnapped among the Rocky Mountains . The kidnapper , Young Marshal Chang , sent out over his military telegraph lines the only account of how his soldiers had detached the Generalissimo from his soldiers , an operation involving treachery by numerous persons , if not hundreds , for all soldiers in China ought to be the Premier 's . If the Young Marshal had demanded say $50,000,000 ransom money , the whole thing would have been orthodox , for Mme Chiang is of China 's great financial family , the House of Soong , and if they have not got $50,000,000 they know how to raise it on a few hours ' notice " for the welfare of China " from the country 's richest class . <P> The ransom asked , however , was not money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese filial piety , and perhaps with other motives too , that the Chinese Cabinet pay the ransom of declaring war on Japan " immediately , " and introducing these " reforms " : <P> 1 ) Abandonment of the internal war waged by the Government against Communist bands for many years in China , and reorganization of the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party of the Premier to include Communists , as it did up to 1927 . Up to that year the Kuomintang was subsidized openly direct from Moscow , and the generals who fought under the Generalissimo all had Soviet advisers and Communist propaganda staffs . <P> 2 ) A formal pledge by the Government to reconquer from Japan the part of China once ruled by Old Chang the War Lord , and bequeathed by him to Young Chang , namely Manchuria proper or " Manchu-kuo.
