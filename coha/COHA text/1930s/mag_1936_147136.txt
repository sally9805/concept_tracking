High over Berkane , border town in French Morocco , sounded the mighty roar of airplane motors last week . A flight of huge bombing planes was boring west toward the Spanish border . Suddenly engines choked , sputtered for lack of gasoline . One plane dropped into the sea . Another smashed up on landing , killing the pilot , two members of the crew and seriously injuring another . A third got down safely , but with empty tanks . <P> The planes were Italian Savoia-Marchetti bombers with their identification marks carefully painted out . Each was jammed with cases of machine guns , ammunition , hand grenades , machine-gun belts . Near one of the planes were found several knapsacks containing the khaki uniforms of Spain 's Foreign Legion . The eleven aviators arrested by the French were all in civilian clothes , carried civilian Italian passports , but in their pockets were receipted pay checks giving their names and rank in the Italian Air Force . Later reports showed that the planes were part of a flight of 21 that had tried to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in Morocco . Eighteen of them reached Melilla , Spanish Morocco , successfully . <P> Outside . Italy promptly tried to establish an alibi , claimed that the officers were not Italian , that the planes were private . The Savoia-Marchetti factory is an Italian Government factory . Il Duce , to whom no sin is greater than getting caught , demanded " an investigation . " <P> The affair of the Italian bombers was easily the outstanding event of a bloody and nerve-wracking week . It not only meant that Spain 's Civil War had now passed beyond the Pyrenees , but that for the first time , Fascism , like Communism , had become an international force . No labor struggle , no class warfare can break out anywhere in the world without expressions of sympathy , and sometimes cash contributions from Moscow 's Third International . Italy now was apparently undertaking to support a foreign outbreak of Fascism in the same way . Correspondents with the northern rebel armies near Burgos were quick to point out German steel helmets . Twice last week Russian freighters loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Government . In Moscow , 100,000 workers jammed the Red Square , pledged their aid in a campaign to raise 200,000,000 rubles for the Spanish Government .
