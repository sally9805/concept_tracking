While art shows to East and West of it volleyed and thundered in and around both World 's Fairs , Chicago 's Art Institute last week rummaged around and quietly put on nine first-rate shows of its own . The best show : 46 of its 329 lithographs by the late great French Artist Odilon Redon . The Art Institute 's collection of Redon prints , purchased from the artist 's widow when Redon prices were low , is the world 's best : it includes all of the first impressions . <P> Long considered an isolated figure in art , an independent who withdrew from the life and thought of his time to paint creepy , imaginary worlds , Odilon Redon ( 1840-1916 ) is often classed by critics with the 19th-Century romantics ; surrealists claim him as a pre-surrealist . In his melancholy youth Redon had tried architecture , sculpture , studying the old masters , imitating the Barbizon landscapists , copying the romantics . As far as he was concerned , nothing seemed to click . Then , one day , in 1875 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on to lithography . It had taken him 25 years to discover the proper medium for what he saw , and he scarcely dipped a brush in oils for another 20 years . <P> " Black , " wrote Redon , " is the most important color ; nothing can prostitute it . " Although he liked to call them his noirs , Redon lithographs run the gamut of neutral tones from rich black to glaring white , rely upon contrasts for their emotional effect . Typical of Redon 's noirs were the Chicago show 's mythical Pegasus , The Winged One , a Child 's Head with Flowers , and unearthly chimeras ranging all the way from The Head of the Infinite Suspended in a Dim , Precarious Light to a shocking confrontation that anyone who has ever had a hangover could understand at a glance , a boiled egg glaring out of its cup .
