txt Mayor La Guardia summarily supplanted Langdon W. Post as chairman of the New York City Housing Authority yesterday by swearing in Lester B. Stone , his secretary , immediately upon being informed that Mr. Post had said he would continue at work until his successor had been named . Mr. Post expressed strong criticism of the Mayor 's refusal to confer with ' Federal Housing Administrator Nathan Straus when he said last Wednesday that the Mayor 's attitude was disastrous for the whole cause of housing . City Hall reporters saw the Mayor early yesterday morning at his temporary City Hall in the Empire State Building and informed him that Mr. Post intended to continue until . his successor was named . " Is n't that interesting , " the Mayor remarked . Turning to his secretary , he said : " Stone , raise your right hand . " After administering the oath of office , the Mayor said : " That 's the end of that . Of course , Mr. Stone 's appointment as chairman will be for only a , few days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name the chairman , Mr. Mayor , " he was reminded . " The law provides that the chairman must be elected by the members of the authority . " They 'd better elect him or there will be a. new board , " the Mayor retorted . Mr. Stone said afterward that he had been in touch with the Rev. Father E. Roberts Moore and Mrs. Mary R. Simkhovitch , the only members of the authority now serving , and that his chairmanship had been agreed to by them . Mrs. Simkhovitch , who is vice chairman of the authority , said last night : " The Housing Authority has not yet met to elect its new chairman . The regular meeting time is Tuesday afternoon ; so far no special meeting has been called . " Mr. Stone 's appointment to the non-salaried housing post will not conflict with his duties as secretary to the Mayor and he will function in both positions . Mr. Post will remain as Tenement House Commissioner until the end of the year , when the Tenement House Department gives way to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charter . Informed of Mr. Stone 's appointment , Mr. Post said : " That means I 'm out . " Gives Out Mayor 's Letter He then made public the following letter , which he said he received last Wednesday from the Mayor : " Inasmuch as you expressed a desire at the conference the other day to take no active participation in the affairs of the Authority up to Jan. 1 , you will understand , I am sure , that at this time there are so many important matters coming up that the interests of housing would not permit holding any matter in abeyance . " Therefore , I am constrained to accept your resignation as of this date . With kind personal regards , I am , " Sincerely yours , " F. H. LA GUARDIA , Mayor . " Before he learned of the Mayor 's latest move , Mr. Post had written him a reply to his letter , saying that he had never tendered his resignation and that his status in the Housing Authority would not permit him to resign . Mr. Post 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued serving since that time under a legal provision which calls for continued service until a successor is appointed . If he had received a reappointment Mr .. Post said he would not resign by any means , because he felt the cause of housing was too important for him to quit at this time . " All I can say is that the Mayor ought to stop being silly about this thing , " Mr. Post remarked . " There 's about $40,000,000 waiting down there in Washington for New York City , and I am prepared to say that Mr. Straus is ready to make loans by the first of January , which is faster than any other Federal agency has ever moved . " At the same time he must know what New ; York City can and will do and what the needs of this city are . The refusal on the Mayor 's part to have the city do anything in the way of cooperating seems to me to be just absurd . " The Federal Housing Authority . already has an . application from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ready for presentation next week . Everything required under the Wagner-Steagall act has been complied with except for the 10 per cent of the initial cost of the project , which the city must find . That will be up to the Mayor and the , Board of Estimate . " We have very good reasons for believing that private capital is prepared to come into the picture on that basis . But if the Mayor jockeys around with the Federal Authority too much , those putting up this private capital will run like scared rabbits . " Asked whether the Mayor 's attitude would delay the granting of housing funds to the city , Mr. Post replied that Mr. Straus would want to know the composition of the new City Housing Authority before he made any commitments . At present , only two of the five members are functioning , while Mr. Stone 's appointment may be counted as that of a third member serving temporarily . " It is entirely possible and reasonable that Mr. Straus may be much stricter with one type of Authority than with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not see how SIr . Straus can make a loan to the City Authority until he knows definitely what its policies will be . That can not happen until all the vacancies are filled . " " If the Mayor wants action damned quick , ' as he puts it , he is taking the long route , " Mr. ' Post went on . " I am 100 per cent with Mr. Straus in his plan to get all the agencies set with definite knowledge and then help the local author7 ities . The usual procedure is to get things arranged behind closed doors and then open them with a blare of trumpets and the announcement that ' Here 's what we can do . ' " Mr. Straus is absolutely right in his procedure . For New York City to throw monkey wrenches into his plans is not only wrong but it is a great pity . It is ' not only wrong ; it is petty . " Mr. Straus worked in close collaboration with Mr. Post as a member of the City Housing Authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Housing Administrator in Washington . Mr. Post said he would remain at the Authority 's office at 10 East Fortieth Street as long as he could be of any help to the Authority .
