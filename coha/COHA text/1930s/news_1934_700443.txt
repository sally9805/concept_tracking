txt No audit has been -. made of revenue accounts in many city departments and county and borough offices for from five to seven years , with the result that the city may have lost as much as $1,000,000 through failure to check properly the collection of revenue , Paul Blanshard , Commissioner of Accounts , declared yesterday . Mr. Blanshard based his statemeht on a survey just completed by his office . He placed full responsibility for the situation on former Controller Charles W. Berry . Mr. Blanshard explained that most of this estimated loss was due to the failure of various city agencies to send out bills or to take steps to see that they were paid . Regular audits , he said , would have prevented the continuance of these practices . Sees ' Untold Sums Lost . " A survey recently made under my direction , " said Mr. Blanshard , " indicates that many of the most important departments of the city are five , six and seven years behind in the auditing of their accounts , and that untold sums of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two city administrations in checking the receipt of city revenues . " Many departments , county offices and courts have not been audited since the first two years of the first Walker administration , and more than three-fourths of , all the city departments , bureaus , institutions , county offices and courts are at , least three years behind in their auditing . The responsibility for this neglect rests squarely upon the former Controller , whose department under the charter should make a more careful check upon revenues . " It has been the practice of the r city government in recent years to use a " hit-or-miss-audit system , " in which the accounts department , undermanned and underfinanced , was called upon to do most of the work , said Mr. Blanshard . Often , he declared , the department made an audit only when a scandal developed or when the Mayor requested it . " When audits were made of various departments , " said the commissioner , " the audit would often run over a period of five , six , seven and eight years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished because of the statute of limitations . " The Dock Department , he said , was audited in 1932 but had not had its revenue accounts checked for five years before that . In this same year , he continued , audits were made of the revenue accounts of the Brooklyn Park Department , the first in more than five years ; the Examining Board of Plumbers , its first in seven years and seven months ; the Market Department , , for the first time six years and three months , and the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , for the first time in seven years . " The Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , which brings in many millions of revenue to the city , has been until recently the worst offender , " he said , " since no general audit has been made of its operations in all of the boroughs since the first Walker administration . " Revenue accounts of Borough Presidents ' offices were found to be almost as far behind . The offices of the Borough Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had such an audit since 1927 , and the Brooklyn Borough President 's office none since 1928 . As an illustration of the loss to the city through the infrequent auditing , Mr. Blanshard cited the case of a clerk of a Manhattan municipal court . About five years ago , he said , this clerk started to appropriate part of the fees he received , taking $200 the first year and each year increasing the amount , with the result that the city lost about $5,000 . " If this court had been regularly audited , " he said , " the theft would have been discovered at the end of the first year and the city ) saved nearly all of this money . Since the Statute of Limitations sets two years as the limit for the I prosecution of petty larceny cases and five years for a felony , the city may find illustrations of this type multiplied many times when it goes back into the unaudited borough offices , courts and departments .

Mr. Higgins , the Commissioner said , made further investigations and found that this shortage was increased to $65,245.25 in the years 1927 , 1928 and 1929 . Prompt Audits Ordered . " The present administration is determined to bring the auditing work of every department in the city up to date at the earliest possible moment , " he declared . " With that aim in view arrangements are being made now between the Department of Finance and the Commissioner of Accounts to transfer the routine auditing functions , formerly exercised by the Department of Accounts , to the Finance Department . This will place the auditing responsibility where it properly belongs in the Finance Department , and will release the Commissioner of Accounts office for the extensive investigations which have been ordered by the Mayor and the Board of Estimate . " Under this plan about thirty accounts will be transferred to the Controller 's office , Mr. Blanshard explained . He will then add about twenty attorneys , engineers , stenographers and process-servers to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift , he said , he expects to be able to cut about $25,000 off his department 's annual operating cost .
