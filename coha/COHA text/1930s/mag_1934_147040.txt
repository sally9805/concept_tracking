" Names make news . " Last week these names made this news : <P> Bright &; early one morning Alexis Mdivani , best married of the three marrying Georgian princelings , left his rooms in London 's swank Hotel Claridge and drove out to Ranelagh for some polo . No sooner had he left than his young wife , Barbara Hutton Mdivani , flounced out of Claridge 's too , and retreated to a private sanatorium . Her doctor announced that she could see no one , not even the Prince . Thus began the twelfth month of the Hutton-Mdivani round-the-world honeymoon . For the next two days Alexis allowed nothing to interrupt his polo ( on a magnificent string of ponies given him by his wife as a wedding present ) . Said he : " I am not worried about Barbara 's condition . I hope to see her as soon as possible . " Meanwhile Franklyn L. Hutton , Barbara 's father , was speeding for England aboard the S. S.
