It does not take long to change the fate of a nation . In Venice last week , grey and chilly in the early spring , sober , spectacled Chancellor Kurt von-Schuschnigg of Austria and his Foreign Minister Dr. Guido Schmidt sat across a table from Benito Mussolini and his Foreign Minister son-in-law , Count Galeazzo Ciano . Three hours later the conference was over and the world knew that the restoration of Archduke Otto to the Hapsburg throne was once more postponed indefinitely , that Germany was again closer to Anschluss with Austria than at any time since the assassination of Chancellor Dollfuss. and that Italy , who was once ready to defend Austrian independence with troops at the Brenner Pass , would do so no longer . Present in Venice at the time was Mussolini Mouthpiece Virginio Gayda , editor of Giornale d'ltalia . Quickly he filed the following inspired editorial : <P> " The Austrian Nazis will soon be called on to share the Fatherland Front 's responsibilities , which is the first step in their direct participation in the Austrian Government . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fatherland Front is imminent . He , together with Chancellor Schuschnigg and the <P> Secretary General Dr. Guido Zernatto of the Fatherland Front , will negotiate for a new settlement of all problems still outstanding between the two national political movements . " Symbolically , the German liner Milwaukee , decks jampacked with 600 Nazi tourists , had sailed through the lagoon right to the entrance of the Grand Canal , and dropped her mudhooks smack before the purple plaster walls of the Hotel Royal Danieli , reserved for the Austrian delegation . Grinning broadly Il Duce went out to the cruise ship to set foot for the first time on Nazi territory , drink a glass of champagne and toast the German merchant marine . Day after the fateful three-hour conference , pious Chancellor Schuschnigg went unnoticed and unattended to lay a wreath on the tomb of Austrian sailors killed in a submarine off Venice during the War . Only solace that Chancellor Schuschnigg could take back over the Alps with him was a few more commercial agreements with Italy . <P> Vividly this looked like the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country through many a losing streak before this , still had a two-spot up his sleeve : Czechoslovakia . <P> All things being equal Benito Mussolini would still like an independent Austria . <P> British and French rearmament have driven Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany together . The compromise that wiseacres have been predicting for months is that Germany will stick to a peaceful penetration of Austria , not try again a rude putsch as at the time of the Dollfuss assassination . Czechoslovakia on the other hand pokes a long territorial finger into Germany 's midriff , which finger supports a large German population . Caf gossips have convinced themselves that Germany is ready to march into Czechoslovakia within a month , the more dramatic-minded of them have even picked May 10 , two days before the British Coronation , as the probable date . Czechoslovakia has a large army , one of the greatest munitions plants in the world ( Skoda ) and a poor reputation as a fighting nation . Austrian backing , however , might hold the Nazi army at bay long enough to shame Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
