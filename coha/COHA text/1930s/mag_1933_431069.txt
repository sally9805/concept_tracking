ON A grim 13th of November , 1851 , twenty-four white pioneers 12 adults and 12 children ? disembarked from the schooner Exact at a lonely point on the shore of Elliott Bay , then a virtually unexplored arm of Puget Sound . Cheerless the new land looked , and the women and children , disconsolate , huddled under trees near the water 's edge , while the men scrambled to rescue their belongings from the fast incoming tide . As the schooner sailed away to carry a band of gold-seekers elsewhere , the little colony was alone in the unknown green land of mighty timber from which they were to hew their homes . One of the women , clasping her twomonths-old child , sat on a log and wept . To her the primeval evergreen forest , sweeping tip from the gray waste of the Sound to misted heights of snow-capped mountains , suggested only nostalgic longing to go back to the Illinois prairies . Had the young mother been able to envisage what the son she held in her arms was destined to look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wonder and delight ; for that son has lived to see the settlement of 24 grow to a city of nearly 400,000 ? Seattle . He can say truthfully that from the very beginning he lived off the country . Because the colonists had brought no cattle with them , there was no milk to give the baby that winter of 1851 , and he was fed the broth of clams dug from the beach . The diet must have been nourishing ; for to-day , a hale octogenarian , he still takes active part in the affairs of the city that he has watched spring from nothing to magnificence in the span of his years ( see page 135 ) . The story of Seattle mirrors that of the whole Commonwealth of Washington . In less than a hundred years the Evergreen State has emerged from wilderness to modern civilization , crowding three centuries of history into one . Spokane , largest city of eastern Washington , with a population of more than 115,000 , celebrated in September , 1931 , its 50th anniversary . The United States census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that of 1930 recorded more than a million and a half in the State . THE WINNING OE THE WEST STILL GOES ON The Evergreen State is so close to its beginnings that in parts of it frontier life , far from being a half-forgotten memory , is a thing of the living present . Within 5o miles of Seattle skyscrapers , hardy pioneers are wresting their living from the wilds of the Olympic Peninsula , just as did their fathers of the Oregon Trail . Many of them must back-pack supplies to their  | homes up mountain trails that wind through well-nigh impenetrable fastnesses of untouched forest . A State senator from Jefferson County , the son of one of the earliest peninsula settlers , bought an automobile only a few years ago and built for it as convenient a garage as possible ? 35 miles from his house ! To see Washington for the first time is to experience the thrill of discovering a new country . To live within its borders for eight years , as I ( lid : then to go away from it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thrill again . It was memory that directed my choice of a place at which to begin a recent survey of the State ? the memory of a glorious summer clay four years before and a boat excursion among emerald isles set in enchanted bays . Could the San Juan Islands really be as charming as recollection painted them ? I resolved to go and see . An hour before dawn of a gray day , Bill and I set out from Seattle in an automobile bound for Anacortes and the 6 o'clock ferry to San Juan Island , last stand of England in American territory and scene of the famous " Pig War " that very nearly set the United States and Great Britain at each other 's throats ( see page 134 ) . Bill was an ideal companion on the trip , for he has grown up , to a height of six feet four , in the steamboat business on Puget Sound and knows every one of the 172 islands of the archipelago . We drove across one of the four mighty bridges that span Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , passed through the sleeping university district , and sped away on a broad , paved highway to open country . EVEN THE HENS USE " WHITE COAL " Curiosity - exciting spots of light at frequent intervals not far from the road proved to be electrically lighted chicken houses . So plentiful and cheap is power in Washington that three-fourths of the farms in the coast country , more than half of those in the entire State , receive electric service . Hens enjoy artificially lengthened days for scratching and laying . Our way led through Everett . on the Sound , lusty young lumber city that has grown from nothing in 1892 to more than 30,000 in 1930 , and on into the seed , dairy , and poultry country of northern Snohomish and southern Skagit counties . There was light enough now to reveal herds of sleek Holstein cows wading knee-deep in luxuriant lowland pastures . Reflecting that they browse thus in green meadows virtually every clay of the year , one can readily understand why Washington is becoming world - renowned as a dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seed and flower-bulb gardens , poultry ranches , and model dairy farms stocked with blooded cattle spread out on the diked land that stretches from the road to the base of timbered hills . The ground is abundantly watered and its fertility is remarkable . A Skagit County farm holds a record for yield of oats -- 187 bushels from a single acre . The county grows three-fourths of the cabbage seed produced commercially in the United States , as well as important crops of pea , turnip , and other vegetable seeds . ROUGH WORDS BETOKEN ESTEEM There was much exchange of friendly abuse between my companion and the men on the dock at the brisk port city of Anacortes while our car was being put aboard the ferryboat in a position from which it could be driven off without delay at Friday Harbor . Every steamboat man on the Sound knows Bill and jokes with him . While the boat was moving out into its course , eye breakfasted in the little lunch room next to the cook 's galley and , hugely fed , mounted to the top deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence that Bill was forever making him violate all the admiralty laws , permitted us to ride with him in the wheelhouse . Comfortable on a padded seat , I listened while Bill and the captain exchanged stories of the islands . Tales were told of high adventure in fog " as thick as mush " of Friday . the Kanaka deserter from a British sailing vessel , who built a hut on San Juan Island and gave his name to the capital town of San Juan County ; of the establishment of Government lighthouses in 187 on Tatoosh Island , Dungeness Spit , and Smith Island . The story of the Smith Island beacon in the Strait of Juan de Fuca was particularly interesting . For several years after its construction , the lighthouse suffered frequent attacks by bands of Indians from  | the north , who battered unsuccessfully at the thick door with hatchets and heavy stones . The original door is still in use , a splintered panel showing how nearly the marauders once came to breaking in and killing the lightkeeper . Despite the sharp sand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls show ineffaceable scars of bullets fired by thwarted braves . RABBITS IMPERIL A LIGHTHOUSE One of the early light keepers , thinking to provide a permanent supply of fresh meat for his family turned loose near the house a few rabbit , of different specie : and colors ; and soot the island was over run with bunnies a : variegated as Joseph ' , coat . By 1924 the ) were undermining the lighthouse ! Swinburne 's 1 i n about " the golden , re mote wild West , where the sea without shore is. " certainly has nc application to Puget Sound , for this sea drowned v a 11 e y has 1,900 miles of shore and t h e San Juans , which geologists say are mountains stand ing shoulder-deep in water , furnish a large part of the total . They vary in area from nearly 58 square miles to patches of sand or mossy rock no larger than a blanket ( see illustration , page 138 ) Our boat threaded winding bays and tor tuous inlets , often so close to t h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck to e i t h e r shore . Once a fine antlered buck broke out of the brush to a rocky beach not a hundred yards away , plunged into the water , and swam smoothly across the course to another island . The scene was a fairyland of sea and sky , of forests , of vari-colored cliffs rising often hundreds of feet sheer from the water . I marveled at the narrowness of our way , and at Bill 's suggestion the captain took us around through Pole Pass , one of the narrowest navigable channels in the country . The pass seemed a snug fit for our small vessel , but the largest ferry of the fleet goes through it with a few feet of clearance . However narrow these water- ways , they are safely deep , in many places from 5o to 150 fathoms . ECHO SAILING CONQUERS FOG " It must be difficult sailing among these islands in foggy weather , " I remarked . " How do you keep off the rocks ? " " We steer by echoes , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I blow the whistle like this , the sound comes back from several points . I can tell by the length of time it takes for the different echoes to c o in e back just about where I am . " " But suppose you get too close for an echo ? " I inquired innocently , trying to remember the shortest distance at which an echo can be heard . The captain and Bill both laughed . " In that case , " said Bill , " the skipper just yells for the engineer to hold everything and prays that the ship wo n't make too big a hole in s o m e island . There are n't any b r a k e s on a steamboat . " For a half hour the captain tooted the whistle at intervals in an effort to demonstrate to me the art of echo sailing . I hope the other passengers did not know who was the cause of the din . To my untutored ears the sounds were meaningless . San Juan sailormen must be born with special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low to throw sounds back satisfactorily , the lighthouse service has erected echo boards . One such board is on Minor Island , a flat bit of sand just north of Smith Island , to which it is connected at low tide by a rocky spit . Were it not Tor the board , the skippers would hear echoes from the higher island only and might go aground on Minor Island or the spit . From time to time the boat put in at ferry slips , and near one of them , on Lopez Island , a modest signboard advertised a 32-acre island for sale . At my expression of interest , Bill explained that some of the smaller bits of the archipelago have been bought for country homes and hunting and fishing preserves .  | " Not so many years ago , " he said , " they were sold at auction in Seattle . " " Yes , " the captain put in , " my father traded one for a canoe and a grubstake and paddled to Alaska for the Klondike rush . They were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen ' and some of the buyers were stung . " We went ashore at Fridav Harbor and passed the rest of the day driving to places of interest . One would never suppose that there could be so many miles of road on an island 55 square miles in area . Graveled highways wind through laden orchards and green meadows where cattle graze , past pretty farmhouses , through dense woodland , around shoulders of mountainous hills . Once the car bumped over a one-way trail that clung to the edge of a bluff 50o feet above the sound . It was no road for careless driving . The Oceanographic Laboratories of the University of Washington are near Friday Harbor . Here a teaching fellow explained bewilderingly varied specimens of marine life gathered along the two miles of ocean front owned by the school . WHERE NATIONS QUARRELED OVER A PIG At Roche Harbor , a poet 's dream of white houses amid green lawns and flowers about a crescent beach , it was surprising to find one of the largest lime plants in Washington . Two places of historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " joint occupation " that resulted from a dispute between England and the United  | States over the strait meant by the treaty of 1846 as the dividing line between Canada and our own country . The trouble known as the " Pig War " began in 1859 , when an American named Cutler shot a Hudson 's Bay Company man 's prize pig which had been rooting in the Cutler garden , and did not end until 1872. when Emperor William I of Germany sustained the United States claim to the San Juans . The Hudson 's Bay Company 's demand that Cutler be taken to Victoria . British Columbia , for trial brought Capt . George Pickett , later leader of the famous charge at Gettysburg. to San Juan Island to establish a military post and guard American rights . Not to he outdone , the English set up a camp of their own . There was no bloodshed , though there was hard feeling at first . After a few months the men of the two camps began to fraternize and vied with each other in lavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mounds that were earthworks ; but the English camp , with its blockhouses , mess hall , officers ' quarters , parade ground , and elaborate rose gardens , is well preserved . Above the English camp , on the slope of Young Hill , commanding a glorious view of many islands , is a tiny plot of ground that still belongs to Britain , the burial place of seven British soldiers who died in the course of the twelve years of joint occupation . ON ORCAS ISLAND THE WORLD IS NEW In the evening Bill and I took the ferry through sunset-reddened bays to Orcas , and the next day explored this , the largest island of the San Juan group . Here are the port of Eastsound on a deep bay , the enchanting nook Deer Harbor , the " shipon-land " mansion of Robert Moran at Rosario , and the beautiful Moran State Park , gift of the retired Seattle shipbuilder to the people of Washington . In the Moran orchard 18 wild deer were so busy munching apples that they did not look up at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moran chuckled . " They are just poachers on my property . " The State park is a delightful bit of wilderness , stretching from Cascade Lake , at an altitude of 345 feet , far above lovely Mountain Lake . at 916 feet . toward the summit of Mount Constitution , 2,409 feet . the highest point in the San Juans . Scores of deer , bears , and other wild things find sanctuary here , unmolested as in the days before men came to the islands . Before returning to Seattle , we crossed the famous Deception Pass , baffler of early explorers , and drove the length of Whidbey Island , second island in size in continental United States . Fertile farms now lie where in 1857 Indians went on the warpath and beheaded Col. Isaac N. Ebey out of revenge for fancied wrongs . At Coupeville the women of the island had just restored and dedicated as a monument one of the blockhouses that sheltered besieged settlers in the early days . CONTRAST LENDS CHARM TO TRAVEL From islands to mountain heights is only a step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State 's perpetual charm . The day after the return from the Stria Juans and Whidbey Island was taken up by an automobile trip through cathedral aisles of towering fir and cedar to the-mile-high Heather Meadows , between Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan . Shuksan , 9,038 feet high , geologically one of the oldest mountains in North America , thrust its ragged pinnacles against a sky of perfect blue , vertical ridges and rugged crags of bare rock showing black among tatters of ice gorges and foaming cataracts . From the serrated peaks banners of snow were waving in a high , clean wind . while mists rose like smoke from the forests below the ice line , now wrapping a bold promontory in downy whiteness , now breaking free to fly away in clouds . A young brown bear was eating huckleberries in the valley not far from the road . When the little fellow saw the automobile , he ambled away in leisurely manner , pausing occasionally to investigate a particularly inviting berry patch . He must have been the redhead of his family , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . MOUNT BAKER SHOWS TEMPERAMENT After a picnic luncheon in a rustic cabin of Mount Baker Lodge ? the guest season had closed two weeks earlier ? came a climb to the top of a steep ridge for a near view of Mount Baker , called by the Indians Kulshan , " the Great White Watcher . " One of the last of five Washington volca- noes to fling forth its fires , Mount Baker still occasionally breathes smokily from several craters near its summit ; but its head , rising to an altitude of 10,150 feet , is turbaned with eternal snow , and vast fields of ice send 12 major glaciers coursing down its sides ( see Color Plate XIV ) . The mighty mountain was perverse that day and hid behind curtains of fog that streamed up constantly from forested slopes and deep gorges . Disappointed , my companion and I scrambled back down to our car . Mount Baker National Forest , 75,000 square miles of virgin wilderness , is a natural setting f o r the magnificent peak s brooding above it . Down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that nowhere presents a grade steeper than 8 per cent , as it winds around mountain sides , skirts breathless gorges , or follows canyons of turbulent streams ( see illustration , page 132 ) . Here is the boisterous Skagit , source of the power that supplies Seattle . White water is everywhere and , sheltering it all . the majestic Douglas fir and red cedar trees , many of them measuring more than io feet thick at the base , tower to heights of 200 feet or more . " THE HOLLAND OP AMERICA " From t h e sublime heights the road flows clown to pastoral lowlands and fertile fields . Whatcom County is known as " the Holland of America , " for it is the home of Dutch bull ) culture in the Northwest . For more than 20 years commercial bulbgrowing , which now is spreading throughout the entire Puget Sound area , has been an important industry there . The little town of Lynden shipped 14 carloads of bulbs in 1931 . When the tulips , daffodils , hyacinths , and narcissi are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor to fancy himself in the Netherlands . Dutch farmers and their wives and children , working in the gardens , were wearing ? I could scarcely believe my eyes ? wooden shoes . Many quaint old customs of the Netherlands are followed in the countryside  | about Lynden , where hundreds of bulbgrowers from the mother country make their homes . A jolly old Gelderlander fashions the shoes of alder wood , working with knives and chisels ( see page 141 ) . He can make six pairs a day to his customers ' measures . The wooden shoes are worn only in the fields . At night they are set in orderly rows on the back porches ? father 's , mother 's , and the children 's in graduated sizes like Goldilocks 's bears . Bellingham , the Tulip City . fourth in size in Washington , and seat of the largest of the three State normal schools . presents a kaleidoscope ( see page 153 ) . Its Chuckanut Marine Drive , a splendid paved highway hewed from the high shoulder of mountainous hills overlooking Bellingham Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonder roads of the State . Everywhere throughout the city are green lawns a n d flowers . They even display their restful charm along the water front . among industrial plants , and about the entrance of the coal mine t h a t supplies hundreds of industries up and down the Pacific coast . FISH HAVE A CLAIM TO ROMANCE Bellingham has one salmon cannery where , in the fishing season , more than a half mil lion pound cans are prepared for the market each day . The fish come in fresh from the waters of Puget Sound , pass through the " iron chink , " which cleans them at the rate of 6o to the minute , and then start along a system of carriers through machines that cut them up , place them in cans , cook them , and seal , label . and box the cans for shipment . In all the process human hands hardly ' touch the salmon ( see Color Plate II ) . The cannery is interesting , but what is more so is the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the end are known . Each summer , school after school of salmon come in from the sea , fighting on , never stopping to feed and seldom to rest , intent upon one thing : to reach the headwaters of the fresh streams where they were spawned from two to six years before . Once in the streams , they struggle against swift currents , leap over the crests of waterfalls , fight through swirling rap- ids , until at long last they reach the place of their birth . Here the females s c o o p hollows in the sand and deposit their eggs , to be fertilized by the males , and , having thus fulfilled their destiny , both males and females die . It is while the hordes of silver beauties are running toward spawning grounds that they are caught by trollers ' hooks , gill nets , purse seines , and traps . Fishermen go out into the Sound in small boats and catch them with hook and line . The hands of many of these men are scarred almost to the bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important source of income to many towns and cities about the Sound , but lumbering and agriculture hold the major positions . Near Bellingham is the Government experimental farm , where Dutch bulbs are cultivated and scientifically improved , and not far away is a large cooperative poultry hatchery devoted to building up superior chicken breeds . The poultry station boasts the champion laying hen of the United States , whose record of 350 eggs in 365 days is surpassed only by that of a Canadian hen ( see page 141 ) . Ten years ago Whatcom County imported most of its supply of eggs . Today eggs are among its principal exports . Dairying is no whit behind poultry raising , and sugar-beet culture is growing by leaps and bounds . The striking thing is that such diversified resources have been developed in a country whose greatest wealth has been and still is in its forests . About 8 o'clock one morning we left Seattle , only a few feet above the Sound : sped across the low Puyallup Valley , rich with broad gardens of head lettuce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers and bulbs ; and before noon were on the Sunrise Area in Mount Rainier National Park , 6,300 feet above the sea ( see Color Plate VIII ) . THE MOUNTAIN THAT WAS GOD Our day was perfect . The " Mountain That Was God " to Nature-worshiping Indians stood out so clearly in the glory of sunlight that its ice-crowned summit seemed almost within arm 's reach , though  | it was actually 11 miles away . To the north Mount Baker swam above the clouds . Mount Adams appeared in a fleeting glimpse , and Mount St. Helens towered white against the morning blue . Even Glacier Peak , in the distant Chelan country , revealed itself for a moment . The five extinct volcanoes of Washington were on display . So easily had the car climbed the twisting highway to the Lookout that it was hard to realize the height that had been attained . Looking back over the way , I could not even see the road , save in one place where for a little it emerged from the forest . To go down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park , and mount by another highway to Paradise Valley necessitated a drive of 145 miles . The park superintendent at Longmire , halfway up the Paradise side , showed us specimens of the varied wild flowers that garland Mount Rainier in spring and summer with a two-mile-wide wreath between the timber line and the glaciers . There are 50o flowering plants , including the grasses , in Mount Rainier National Park . Sunset at Paradise is glorious , touching the white summit of the mountain with magic colors . Long after black shadow has fallen in the valleys the snowy crest glows with splendor . We stayed the night at the Winter Lodge , about which workmen were building scaffolding to protect it from heavy snows expected soon ( see pages 145 and 146 ) . The following morning snow was falling on the mountain where 28 glaciers  | have their birth , in the ice-filled crater . A climb to a ridge afforded a view of one of the massive streams of ice , a slowly moving white river , relentless as fate , that plunges over cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freed in rushing mountain torrents . A NOVEL WAY TO GET RID OE BEARS On the way out of the park I asked my companion what had become of the bears . for not one of the inquisitive fellows had showed himself . " They got to be such a nuisance , " was the reply , " that we had to catch the worst of them and put them out of the park . It was all right to have them around so long as they confined their thievery to refuse put out for them , but they became so bold as to break into parked cars and steal picnic lunches " ( see page 144 ) . We baited large iron drums with sweets , and when the black robbers crawled in for a feast we clamped lids over them and hauled them off to a wildlife sanctuary . That was several months ago , and they have n't found their way back yet . There are still a lot of bears in the park , but they do n't come around the buildings often after the visitors go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise to Tacoma , " the lumber capital of : America , " a charming , Old-World -- seeming city on Commencement Bay , the famous deep-water harbor surveyed in 1841 by Charles Wilkes , the discoverer of the Antarctic Continent . Ships from many distant ports cone to the clocks for cargoes , not only of lumber and all sorts of lumber and timber products , but of flour , refined ores , and the abundant produce of the Puyallup Valley . Nowhere else in Washington is there more evidence of the bounties of the benign Puget Sound climate ( see Color Plate VIII ) . Point Defiance Park is a boo-acre playground that holds , besides formal gardens , a tract of unspoiled Northwest wilderness in a metropolitan setting . The whole city is a place of flowers , despite its industrial activities . In 1930 the Garden Club of America selected a Tacoma resident 's garden as the most beautiful in the country . There are even some thriftily growing palm trees , proof that the Japan Current , which sweeps along the coast , has brought to this  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAGIC CITY THAT LUMBER BUILT Though there are all manner of lumber mills in Tacoma , it seemed fitting to go to Longview , on the Columbia River , to see the lumber industry in all its phases , for lumber built Longview ( see page 148 ) . Buying 14,000 acres of farmland close to virgin timber , the Long-Bell Company cleared a townsite in 1922 , engaged nationally known experts to draw plans , and created a model city . In 1923 the first piece of property was sold : in 1930 the population of Longview was 10,562 . At the lumber mills huge logs , 70 feet or more in length and perhaps 6 feet in diameter , pass in endless chain from ponds , to which they have been floated or hauled by train from the forest , to the whistling saws that convert them into boards . The process is fascinating to watch . Moving claws seize the logs in the pond at the foot of the chute , carry them relentlessly up a long incline , and deposit them on a platform . Here iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bears them against the saws . In an incredibly short time they are sheared to square timbers , which now pass on to meet a hissing file of band saws that cut them  | into rough planks . These rumble away through planers and other refining machines to emerge as boards . Their progress thus far has been head-on . The boards go to a fast carrier which takes them sidewise under a battery of circular saws operated by a magician on a platform above them . Before him are levers with which he can raise or lower the saws and cut the boards into proper lengths . If a board shows knots near the ends , it is sawed short . The controller can drop a saw wherever he wishes . The boards are put through further finishing processes and finally are gathered into trim bundles and wrapped in heavy paper ready for shipment . Packaging of lumber is one of the more recent developments in the industry . Handlers need no longer fear splinters in loading and unloading the sawmill 's output . Not far from the sawmills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other waste of the industry . The wood is first soaked in huge vats of chemicals ; then , as pulp , is spread on wide belts of cloth which carry it through the first rollers until it forms a sheet firm enough to go on without support . On and on it goes through the files of spinning cylinders , to emerge finally in heavy rolls of glazed perfection , wrapped , sealed , and labeled , ready for transport to the thousands of users of pulp paper . REFORESTATION SAVES THE TIMBER Not far from the plants are nurseries , where seedling trees are grown to replenish the forests cut down by the timber operators . Reforestation has become a fine art in Washington , and the lumbermen are employing every means at their command to insure a permanent supply of timber . No longer do cut-over lands present dangerous fire hazards . Areas from which the virgin forests have been removed are soon clothed with the fresh green of young trees , which , in this subtropical climate , will grow to merchantable size in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington still the Evergreen State . One mill was breaking out seed of the fine trees for planting in the nurseries and for shipment to all parts of the world ( see page 167 ) . What an advance lumbering has made in the last 50 years ! Without these modern methods of conservation , the forests would disappear in a few generations . Along the valleys from Longview to Vancouver are acres upon acres of seed potatoes , mint patches , berry tracts , bulb and vegetable gardens , filbert and English walnut groves , and , finally , laden orchardof prune trees stretching from the highway to the edge of the virgin timber on the hills . Only a few miles away fishermen garner the riches of the Columbia River salmon : and , to make the kaleidoscope more varied , Mount St. Helens , southwest Washington 's own snow-capped extinct volcano . lifts its proud head against the horizon . VANCOUVER Is THE SITE or THE FIRST PERMANENT WHITE SETTLEMENT Vancouver , just across the Columbia from Portland , Oregon metropolis , is the center of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit from 7,000 acres of Clark County prunes . the rich produce of general agriculture . and the spoils of salmon fisheries , it manufactures linen and woolen goods in two of the largest mills of the Northwest . On the Lewis River , not far from the city , a power dam that eventually will exceed in capacity the Hoover Dam , on the NevadaArizona border , is utilizing the " white coal ' ' that works wonders in industry . Old Fort Vancouver , established by British forces in 1825 , when it was an important station of the Hudson 's Bay Company . claims attention because it is the oldest continuous settlement of the white race in the territory that is now the State of Washington . About it cling the fine traditions of pioneer days . A train ride of a few hours takes one from Washington 's oldest settlement to Seattle , the city that has sprung up within the lifetime of one of its original settlers . It was christened New York by its first colonists , but the pretentious name did not endure long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alki , meaning Bye and Bye . The spot where the settlers came ashore is still known as Alki Point , in proof that the pioneers could take a joke . When the town was incorporated , in 1869 , it was given the name of a friendly Indian chief , Seattle , who had taken the side of the white men in the Indian revolt  | of 1856 . That revolt might have proved disastrous had a United States warship not been present in Elliott Bay to drive off the attacking savages . The most important event in the commercial history of the city was the arrival of the first gold ship from Alaska in 1897 . From that moment Seattle became the outfitting point for the throngs that rushed to the Klondike . Its future as the portal of Alaska was assured . But now it has well-nigh forgotten its day as the gateway of gold . It is too big and confident and bustling to remember its beginnings . It even forgets the fire that virtually wiped out its business section in 1889 . It builds and tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a hill is in the road of its progress , it ruthlessly razes the eminence and clumps the earth and rock into Puget Sound . Its vigor is resistless . At Seattle is the magnificent State University of Washington , on a campus of 582 acres , its 70 buildings set in shady , flower-adorned lawns sloping to the shores of Lake Union and Lake Washington ( see Color Plate IV ) . Only a few years ago that campus was wild woodland , and out of sentiment a part of it has been left to natural timber that may remind some of the 7,000 students of the forests to which in large part they owe their opportunity of education . Seattle is built on hills so high and steep that cable cars are required to carry passengers up some of the streets in the heart of the business district . There is no monotony , but a scene ever changing and arresting . To stand on the summit of one of the hills at night and look down over the glittering sea of lights is a delightful experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dam makes the metropolitan area one of the best lighted in the world . FIRST ROUND-THE-WORLD PLIGHT BEGAN AND ENDED AT SEATTLE The city has 193 miles of frontage on salt and fresh water , and from the port go out 109 steamship lines to all parts of the world . In Elliott Bay 72 United States warships have been moored at one time , some of them within gangplank distance of the docks . The depth of the bay varies from 25 to 150 fathoms . By way of the Ballard Locks , ocean - going ships are brought into fresh-water Lake Union and taken on through a canal into Lake Washington , where the fresh water causes barnacles to die and drop from their hulls . Seattle began as a city of the forests , but it has become as truly a city of the sea ( see Color Plate III and page 165 ) . A short distance from the water front is the Boeing Airplane Company , with the largest exclusive airplane manufacturing plant in the United States . There nearly a thousand workmen are busy building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Navy , and sport models for amateur flyers . Spruce from the prodigal forests of the Northwest has been found the best material for making certain parts of the wings hence the rapid growth of an industry that did not come to Seattle until 1916 . One can fly almost anywhere from Seattle , as indeed from virtually every other city in Washington ( see page 164 ) . Mail and passenger planes maintain regular schedules from the municipal airport at Boeing Field not only to all important points on the Pacific coast in both the United States and Canada , but to the East as well . At Sand Point , on Lake Washington , adjoining the city limits , is the Seattle Naval Air Base , from which the first round-the-world flight began and to which the successful aviators returned . EVERYBODY LIKES THE PUBLIC MARKET The Pike Place public market , one of the largest in the country , blazes with color from its handsome entrance , hung with baskets of greenery and flowers , to the end stalls , several blocks beyond , where live Belgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Color Plate VIII ) .

Not far away is a chap with tearful eves , selling horse-radish , which he grinds while his customers wait . Fish merchants display smelt , trout , and other small fry swimming in tanks , and sell them alive in paper buckets holding water . Indians are scarce in Seattle streets , but a few squaws may be found squatting under market arcades beside  | woven-grass baskets and bits of beadwork . Steps lead down to the wharves , where fishing boats come in with salmon caught by trolling in the Sound . There is usually only one price for the choice of any fish in a lot . One day a large woman in black taffeta was leaning over the side of a skiff to reach a particularly large beauty in the wriggling heap between the thwarts . Alas , she leaned too far ! INTO THE " LAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Sound to continental America 's last frontier is only a few hours ' travel . The trip begins with a ferry ride to Bremerton and the United States Navy Yard , where giants of the Pacific fleet are overhauled each year and where several battleships have been built . Beyond Bremerton graveled roads lead to the wilderness of the Olympic Peninsula . This vast area of mountains , lakes , rivers , cataracts , virgin forests , and mystery primordial is almost as large as Massachusetts . It has lain in unsullied quiet for countless centuries , impenetrable to all save the hardiest pioneers , until the coming of the Olympic Loop Highway , which is now opening some of its fastnesses and making available a portion of its tremendous resources . A smooth highway goes from Bremerton southward around Hood Canal , slender arm of the sea , bordered by evergreen forests sweeping away to high hills . Pretty villages and farms and laden orchards lie along the road . Summer resorts and camp grounds nestle here and there along the beaches . Far to the north the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eternal snows . The road passes around the bend of the canal and turns toward the distant peaks . At Port Townsend , on Admiralty Inlet , is Fort Worden , the old coast-defense fort which mounts the only cannon in the United States that can hurl shells into Canadian territory . The town is a place  | of romance , once an important port of call for ships from Alaska and the far seas , but now content to go its way as a lumber and pulp-paper center . There is a brave tale of the contest between Port Townsend and Port Angeles for preference in the location of Government customs offices . Each had the patronage for a time , and Port Townsend finally won . PRESIDENT LINCOLN PLANNED PORT ANGELES The site of Port Angeles was set aside in 1863 under the personal direction of President Lincoln . The town manufactures lumber , shingles , paper , both glazed and newsprint , and paper-box board . Two unusual industries are a cedarshake factory and a bow-and-arrow plant . The cedar shakes , hand-hewn from stump wood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are becoming popular as roofing and siding material for bungalows of the rustic type . The bows and arrows are made of yew , which grows abundantly in the forests near by . In Port Angeles thrilling tournaments attract some of the famous archers of the country . Beyond Port Angeles to the west the country is more sparsely settled , and highways are cool and dim in the shade of forest giants that have grown straight and tall for centuries . The motorist is often startled by quail and pheasants flying tip before his car . On the hills occasional herds of elks may be seen ( see page 15o ) . WHERE WILD LIVE FEARS NO GUNS Past the Storm King Game Preserve leads the way where bears , elks , deer , and snarling cougars live in sylvan isolation . It follows for miles the Elwha River , a crystal mountain stream now turbulent over scattered rocks , now deep and still in quiet glades , now harnessed for power . From the heights little brooks tumble to join the Elwha , some of them leaping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . Cold springs bubble invitingly from roadside rocks .  | Fortunately Bill , who had deserted his busy office to go with me on the peninsula trip , is a skillful driver ; else the climb of a side road to Olympic Hot Springs might have been too much of a thrill . The excellent but narrow trail often makes sharp turns so high above the trees in steepwalled canyons that in passing them one hardly dares look over the side of the car . At an altitude of 2,100 feet 21 hot springs gush out of the mountains . Here a log hotel and a group of cabins surround a large concrete swimming pool , the only sign of civilization within a radius of many miles . The proprietor of the resort displayed skins of cougars killed by his wife 's father , a famous huntsman who had bagged 98 of these cats , and despite his years was intent upon a record of Too . Near the pool is a drinking fountain said to be a veritable fountain of youth . I took a mouthful of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chemistry laboratory at college when the hydrogen sulphide kip was leaking . Solduc Hot Springs , only a few miles to the west , are similar to the Olympic springs . Both places attract hundreds of health-seekers in the summer and both are in the midst of mountains that lure the feet of climbing enthusiasts . ' FADELESS BLUE IS DROWNED IN LAKE ; CRESCENT At nightfall it was pleasant to come to a rustic inn on the shore of Crescent Lake . This lake , the largest on the peninsula , is so blue from the cobalt of the overhanging hills that no cloud , however gray , can dim its-sapphire clarity . The home of the gamy Beardsley trout , it is a mecca for anglers . During the World War the United States Government mined manganese near the lake and constructed a railway along its shore , but the development has ceased and the wilderness has obliterated the iron trail . Our hostess , a white-haired peninsula pioneer , entertained a fireside group after dinner with stories of the early days that recalled for me the boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . " Though the time was early September , there was a bite in the air , and the warmth from the huge fireplace was welcome .  | After all , a wood fire is the truly romantic source of heat . Wood is the only fuel in the forest retreats of Washington , and the smoke from the clearings is really blue , like the well-remembered smoke of cottages in fairy tales . We had breakfast at an unearthly hour next morning and drove away westward along the shore of the lake . A busload of children bound for school passed us , reminding us that education has penetrated to the farthest frontier . Washington is rich in school funds , for much of its school land is in valuable timber areas . First-class consolidated schools have been constructed at convenient locations in all rural districts , and pupils are transported to classrooms from distant houses without charge . CURIOUS INDIANS INSPECT ALL VISITORS Only 1 per cent of the population to years of age or older is unable to read , and but three-tenths of 1 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the teachers of the State have prepared an elementary course of study that has worked wonders in education . On and on the restless roads wind through rich farmlands , past tiny hamlets with quaint Indian names , and off to the northwest to Neah Bay , near the ocean end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca . At the trading post gay baskets of grass and porcupine quills , beadwork , and miniature totem poles made by squaws from the Makah Indian Reservation are a medium of exchange like the wampum of early history . The trader accepts Indian handwork as cash ( see Color Plates VI and VII ) . From Neah Bay it is a short boat trip to Tatoosh Island and Cape Flattery , the northwest corner of continental United States . At the Quillayute Indian Reservation , adjoining La Push on the Pacific south of Neah Bay , an army of Indian children , calico-clad squaws , and swarthy men come out to inspect all visitors . There are 13 Indian reservations in Washington , with excellent schools and dwellings provided by the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man 's homes " vacant and the Indians for whom they were built living in shacks , tents , or wigwams.  | The supreme thrill of the trip was the recently opened section of road that completes the Olympic Loop from the Bogachiel River to Ouinault Lake . That road deserves a volume of description . It was wrested from mud so deep that materials for it had to be taken in from the coast by boats on the rivers and transported to the construction camps on railroads laid on log floats . The cost of the loop was S11,000,000 ? a considerable sum compared to the $10,000 appropriated for it at first . The Olympic Peninsula is the most heavily watered area in the United States , with annual rainfall ranging from 6o inches along the Pacific to 18o to 250 inches at the top of Mount Olympus . At some points along the new highway a reasonably strong man can plunge a crowbar eight feet into the soil with a single stroke . The road had to be stripped of surface soil and the material raked up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tons of gravel were brought to the camps by boat and dropped futilely into the mire . Many fills where the road skirts the coast slid into the ocean as fast as they could be built up . One young engineer , when asked why he could not hold the material in the fills , replied , " You could n't hold that stuff in a bucket . "  | But the job was done , and a broad highway surfaced with crushed rock made firm with heavy oil affords the means of communication with the outside world that peninsula settlers have been awaiting for 5o years . When it was opened , there was a celebration in which hundreds of Indians joined with their white neighbors . As the highway nears Quinault Lake , it passes through an area that was logged before the clays of forest conservation . One look at the scene of wanton waste is enough to explain why the State is seeking to pass a law prohibiting the cutting of timber along highways . From Quinault Lake trails lead to the high Olympics and trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a few miles by mountain paths from the lake is the Mount Olympus Game Refuge , surrounding the highest of the Olympic peaks . There are vast regions hereabout that have never been explored , and the forests constitute a magnificent stand of virgin timber . Beside a hotel fireplace at Quinault I listened to stories of the pioneers : the saga of John Huelsdonk , who carried unbelievable packs of supplies 30 miles or more up the mountains to his pioneer home ; the history of F ' . N. Streeter , who fought his way into the high Olympics with a mattock and a bag of potatoes , prepared a field and planted the potatoes , and then welcomed to his new home his wife , who had walked 6o miles along the coast and up the mountain trails , carrying their baby . It is little more than an hour 's drive from the wilderness , Quinault Lake to the twin cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam ,  | thriving lumbering and fishing centers separated by a street . Together they form the port outlet for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willapa Bay , besides all sorts of lumber and lumber products mills , are the newly developed beds of Japanese oysters . Deepsea crabs and razor clams are sources of profit also , and salmon and cod fishing is an important industry . PAST A FOREST FIRE TO THE STATE CAPITAL On the peat land which rims the coast south of Aberdeen , Finnish people have developed hundreds of acres of remarkably productive cranberry bogs . They haul sand from the beach to cover the peat land to a depth of 18 inches and plant the cranberry bushes in the sand ( see Color Plate IX ) . Bill and I left Aberdeen in midafternoon to drive to Olympia , the State capital . Soon after open country was reached , I exclaimed at a beautiful glow of red in the sky above timbered hills . Bill , however , did not seem pleased . " It may be the sunset and it may be a fire , " he said . A half hour later , when the sun had gone down , Bill 's suspicion was confirmed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " cloud " was smoke from burning timber . Our road passed so close to the burning area that it was fitfully lighted by the wild flames leaping from tree to tree . The spectacle was weird and awful . Magnificent firs and cedars that had grown half a thousand years  | leaped from the darkness as wildly flaming torches . At Olympia is the new State Capitol group of buildings , with the Soo-foot dome of the Legislative Hall rising at the center . Washington may be proud of its State buildings , constructed mainly of materials from within its own borders . Home of large woolen mills and a huge Douglas fir plywood plant , Olympia affords the visitor opportunity to see the process of plywood manufacture . Twentyfoot sections of logs , some of them six feet or more in diameter , are steamed in sealed rooms for periods of 48 to 72 hours . From these rooms they are taken to the mills , placed horizontally , like rollers in giant lathes , and unwound just as paper is unwound from a roll , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution ( see page 168 ) . The sheets of wood are often 200 feet long by 20 feet wide and only an eighth or a sixteenth of an inch thick . Cut into desired sizes , the pieces , some laid lengthwise , some crosswise of the grain , are glued together with water-resistant glue and passed between heavy rollers that make them into solid boards . These boards undergo further finishing and are ready for use in the building trades . THE END OF THE OREGON TRAIL The old Oregon Trail ends just one mile south of Olympia , where in 1845 Col. Michael Simmons and his little band of followers blazed the last section of this historic route to the head of navigation on Puget Sound . In the Sound near the capital the Olympia oyster has its natural habitat . A story is told of a traveler from the Chesapeake Bay country who ordered fried oysters in an Olympia hotel . He was reading his paper when the dish was set before him and did not notice for a moment what the waitress had brought . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young woman , I ordered fried oysters , not baked beans ! " Olympia oysters , cherished by epicures for their delicate flavor , are the smallest on the market . They have another peculiarity , in that each oyster becomes both male and female in the course of its growth , being self-fertilizing . The industry is thriving and bids fair to assume increasingly important proportions within the next decade . One hears a great deal in ' Washington about " the great Cascade barrier that shuts off the Puget Sound country from the eastern half of the State , " but the barrier exists largely in fancy . A motorist can drive from Seattle to Yakima over the 3,000-foot Snoqualmie Pass in six hours without the necessity of shifting to low gear , and any one not wishing to climb over this ridge may go around the south end of the range by way of the Columbia River gorge . Besides Snoqualmie , there are five or six other passes that present no great difficulty for automobile travel . THE CASCADE BARRIER PROVES A MYTH The Chicago , Milwaukee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains through Snoqualmie , and the Great Northern has driven a 7-mile tunnel through them farther north . Over the Cascades the Milwaukee is completely electrified for 220 miles , trolley wires carrying power for the huge electric engines . The Great Northern between Wenatchee and Skykomish employs electric motors to draw transcontinental trains for 75 miles . The mountains that constitute the barrier furnish the power streams to make easy their own conquest . On the Snoqualmie route from Seattle to Yakima one passes the beautiful Snoqualmie Falls in their sylvan setting , and the great artificial Keechelus Lake , which holds the water for the orchards of the Yakima valleys . It is something of a shock to come out of the green forests of the mountains into a brown and gray country of bare hills pierced by a smooth highway that sweeps downward for miles through desert . Along the road are concrete-walled streams carrying water to the valley . WATER MAGIC TRANSFORMS THE DESERT The Kittitas irrigation project , with its orchards and green fields spreading out as far as the eye can reach , bursts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahara . On grassy hills near the verdant valley thousands of sheep are grazing . Entering that scene is like coming from the Wilderness into the Promised Land .  | At prosperous Ellensburg , principal own in the Kittitas district and seat of a State normal school built among fine old trees on a spacious campus , it is hard to believe that only a few miles away is desert , and that the rich farming district hereabout was arid waste little more than a quarter of a century ago . The highway follows the Yakima River south of Ellensburg through an Eden of fruit trees and green meadows to Yakima . When I made the trip , the month was September , and the apple trees were aglow with red . Peaches , apricots , and other soft fruit had been gathered , but what was left was enough to tempt a world of Mother Eves . In 1930 , 52,000 carloads of fruit were shipped from Yakima , the amazing city that began with a single log cabin in 1864 , remained for years a tiny cattle town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . The Oblate Fathers established the first settlement in the valley in 1847 and ten years later planted the first fruit trees . In a 153-acre orchard I saw trees so heavy with apples that their branches were supported by scaffolding . There was a single 15-year-old tree that yielded 40 bushels of perfect Starking Delicious . HOW WASHINGTON APPLES ARE PACKED The great packing plants where the apples are sorted , wrapped , and boxed were humming . Ranks of machines were carrying the fruit on endless belts through alkali baths to remove the arsenate of lead with which apples are sprayed to discourage moths ; through waxing chambers ; past a corps of women sorters , who quickly placed the different grades on their proper carriers and the culls on return belts ; over trap scales that dropped all of each weight into their appointed bins ( see Color Plates X and XII ) . Women packers ' hands were flying , as they wrapped the red beauties in oiled paper and placed them in boxes . Carriers were moving the heaping boxes to machines that clamped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ready for labeling and transport to the storage plants , the boxes were rolling along on an automatic carrier . In another building , 1,200 white-gloved workers , mostly women , were sorting slices of apples poured out in fragrant streams from coring , peeling , and cutting machines . The selected fruit was cooked and canned within a short time after it entered the room . At the end of each four-hour shift the entire canning room was cleansed , first with steam , then with hot and cold water . Culled fruit was loaded upon trucks and hauled to the vinegar factories . THE APPLE CAPITAL , OE THE WORLD Yakima is famous for its apples ; but to visit the " Apple Capital of the World " one goes north , " over the hump , " to Wenatchee , the town of 12,000 population that has shipped 24,386 carloads of apples in a single year . Together , Wenatchee and Yakima shipped 45,221 carloads of apples in 1930 , more than 40 per cent of the country 's commercial apple crop , and , despite the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 193 Were : Wenatchee , 19,900 carloads ; Yakima , 12,500 . For 1932 the estimates were 17,000 carloads from Wenatchee and 10,000 from Yakima . Markets , not crops , declined . Irrigation at Wenatchee is not from Federal projects . The growers have constructed their own gravity system , drawing water from the Columbia River and from smaller streams and lakes tributary to it . The Puget Sound Power and Eight Company recently completed near the city the Rock Island Dam , first power development of the Columbia ( see page 194 ) . In 1902 Wenatchee shipped its first two carloads of fruit . At the close of the 19th century the area that now glows with pink blossoms in springtime and with the red of laden branches in autumn ( see page 192 ) was a sagebrush waste . Ranches about Wenatchee average only seven acres in area , for intensified cultivation makes larger orchards unnecessary . Pipes laid between the rows of trees carry the chemicals for spraying , and power pumps operated by electricity from the hills force the spray through nozzles , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not the number of acres but the yield of each tree that is of concern to the growers . Paved roads wind among the charming bungalows in all the orchard country , and farm women telephone to Wenatchee merchants for delivery of supplies . Stores make two deliveries a day , often to homes 15 to 20 miles from town .  | When Herndon and Pangborn completed their nonstop flight from Tokyo to the United States , in 1931 , fog prevented their landing at Seattle , and they grounded their airplane at the Wenatchee Airport . They brought with them little from Japan , but among the things they brought were , fittingly , a few apples ! Near Wenatchee , amid glaciers and snowy peaks in splendid array , is Lake Chelan , Washington 's largest lake , 6o miles long and from one-half mile to three miles wide ( see page 193 ) . Although its lower end is but three miles from its outlet , the Columbia River , the lake maintains a level of 1,0i9 feet above the sea into the very heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPITAL OF THE INLAND EMPIRE It is so deep that at some points its bottom goes down 400 feet below sea level . Beginning as low , undulating hills , the inclosing heights gradually narrow and rise until the beaches disappear and the shoreline becomes only a mark on precipitous cliffs , some of which tower to nearly 8,000 feet above the water . It is a half day 's train ride from Wenatchee to the easternmost , and in many respects the most interesting , part of Washington , the Spokane country ? land of crystal lakes and foaming rivers , pine forests and cattle-clipped plains , rugged hills and rolling wheat fields , gray and mysterious desert , and dreaming valleys of sunshine , fruits , and flowers . Here are the ruins of old Spokane House , fur trading post established in 1811 by the famous geographer of the Northwest Company , David Thompson ; here , also , the pioneer missions that brought the " Black Robes " to the Spokane tribes . When my father-in-law , who recently passed his 70th year , came to Spokane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spokane Falls . Wolves and bears preyed on livestock , and the men of the village took turns standing guard at night to warn their neighbors if hostile Indians approached . To-day the sparklingly bright city of Spokane , the Power City of Washington , sees Indians only when the tribes from the 190 reservations come to town to take part in a fair . The hills that once were the haunts of wild animals are crowned with parks and dignified homes surrounded by shady lawns and flower gardens . In 1889 fire destroyed 32 blocks in the business district , and the energetic citizens replaced ramshackle frame buildings with handsome structures of brick and stone . No trace remains of the frontier town in this metropolitan capital of the Inland Empire ( see page 177 ) . Spokane is in the center of a great playground . Within 5o miles of it are 56 lakes . The citizen who emulates Izaak Walton can fish in a different lake every week-end of the year and have some likely angler 's Edens left for holidays ; or , if he prefers fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of a hundred trout streams . NATURE 'S SPLENDOR IN THE HEART OE A CITY The turbulent Spokane River flows through the heart of the city , in time of flood flinging the spray of its lovely falls high over the rail of the Monroe Street Bridge , 135 feet above its rapids . In the very atmosphere there is something alive and vital . Power of the mountain torrents has made the city a manufacturing center , but with all its industry it is a home town , the very prototype of solid America and the warm-handed West . Its hominess and friendliness are evident to the visitor the moment he steps into the hotel about which social life centers . In the irrigated Spokane Valley , fruit , vegetables , and flowers run riot in teeming fields . Near the city limits are many lumber and paper mills , a large match factory , and Felts Aviation Field , from which the Spokane Sun God made its record nonstop refueling flight to the Atlantic seaboard and back in August , 1929 . Spokane has within its corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ; but , not satisfied with that , it has acquired a mountain , a rugged giant which towers above pine-clad hills , a few hours ' drive to the north ( see page 196 ) . " Baldy , " as the peak is called by the oldtimers , was presented to the city by some of its leaders and promptly rechristened Mount Spokane , no rival town demurring . The mountain is one of the finest show places in Washington , affording a view on a clear clay of 14 forest lakes and rivers . From Mount Spokane it is an interesting drive to Long Lake Darn , source of the power that turns the wheels of the city 's industry , one of the highest spillway dams in the world . A few miles below is the smaller Little Falls Dam . Either project in the East would create a manufacturing giant . WASHINGTON HAS POWER TO WASTE , There were 71 hydroelectric power projects in operation in Washington in 1931 , and by January I , 1932 , all the plants together had a capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixth of the total potential water power in the United States . At Metaline Falls , a district tributary to Spokane , rich zinc end lead mines have been opened recently . In developing one mine the engineers have sunk a 325-foot shaft into a mountain side and have taken out a block of zinc ore 99 feet thick over a surface area of more than an acre , without reaching either the bottom or the top of the deposit or yet its limit in any direction . The mines are located in wild and rugged country , on the Pend Oreille River , a region that compares in beauty with that around Lake Chelan . Cheney , 26 miles southwest of Spokane , gave Spokane Falls a great battle in the early days for the honor of being capital town of Spokane County . In the spirited contest there was gun play , and court records were taken from Spokane Falls by armed men and carried off to Cheney . It was not until 1887 that Spokane won undisputed right to the county seat . Cheney had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enrollment greater than the total population of the two towns in the days of the county-seat fight . A 50-MILE CHASM 1,000 FEET DEEP Of particular interest to Spokane and the Inland Empire , as indeed to the whole Northwest , is the Columbia Basin , in the channeled scablands southwest of Spokane . It is the proposed site of an irrigation project that will reclaim 1,883,000 acres of rich desert land for agriculture . The area centers about the Grand Coulee , a 5o - mile chasm , I , 000 feet deep , cut  | through solid basalt by a glacial stream of prehistoric time ( see pages 174 and 190 ) . United States Army engineers have surveyed the district and have recommended construction of a dam across the mighty Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee to impound in the gorge water for irrigating the largest area ever reclaimed and to furnish power for industries that will follow the settlement of the land . The Grand Coulee has its southern extremity in Dry Falls , one of the geologic wonders of the world . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prehistoric glacial stream once thundered with the roar of many Niagaras . Strata clearly visible on the coulee walls show seven distinct lava flows through which the stream bed was cut . In some of these layers standing petrified forests have been found , and at a level perhaps 300 feet above the floor of the chasm is a deposit of clam and other shells . Below the Dry Falls a chain of wilderness lakes remains as a memento of the floods that once poured over the precipice ( see page 190 ) . GHOST TOWNS REMIND OF BLIGHTED HOPES On the return drive to Spokane from Dry Falls one passes through the ghost towns of the Big Bend , towns deserted by the settlers who flocked to the opening of the well-watered Palouse area , and , failing to obtain land there , took up homesteads in the desert . To-day the farms established in high hope are wind-swept wastes of sagebrush and thistle , awaiting the life-giving water that will make them quick with green . The discouraged farm- ers have gone , leaving their villages groups of vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Palouse is a different sort of place . Winter wheat was greening on the hills as I drove from Spokane to Pullman , and the whole countryside was the scene of promise . In this district wheat yields average from 25 to 45 bushels to the acre . The great " combines , " harvesting and threshing machines in one , ride the golden seas of grain in summer sunshine to fill a ninth of the Nation 's wheat granary ( see page 188 ) . At Pullman the State College of Washington , its handsome buildings on a campus of hills , concentrates on the needs of the State ( see page 176 ) . Its engineering graduates have had a hand in most of the construction enterprises of the Northwest , and its agricultural departments have developed experiments that have meant prosperity to the farmers . At one station soil erosion by wind and rain is studied , at others new and better kinds of grain are being produced . Washington farmers have learned to accept the advice of the State College men . About Walla Walla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , monuments along the way marking points on the route of Lewis and Clark . It was at the Waiilatpu Mission , near Walla Walla , that Indians massacred Dr. Marcus Whitman and 13 of his people in 1847 . The murdered missionary 's friend , the Rev. Cushing Fells , founded Whitman College at Walla Walla in memory of Whitman 's heroism ( see page 175 ) .  | The Walla Walla Valley , where artesian wells furnish water for irrigation , is a rich fruit and garden area : but its main source of wealth is wheat grown without irrigation . It was wheat that gave southeast Washington its prosperity . In early days Dr. D. S. Baker built between Walla Walla and Wallula the first railroad in the interior of Washington , its purpose being principally to transport wheat to the navigable Columbia River . Report says that the surveyors , lacking a level , used a bottle half full of water to sight the grades . The road was 32 miles long . Its rails were of wood , with strap iron nailed on the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jesters declared that the strap iron was secured to the poles by rawhide thongs , which were eaten by hungry wolves every winter , so that the iron strips came off and put the road out of commission . Libel though it was , the story gave the " strap-iron " contraption the fun-poking name " Rawhide Railroad . " A 7 1/2-ton engine pulled open flat cars along the track . The passenger coach was known as " the hearse " because patrons sat around the outside walls like pallbearers in a funeral carryall . On the cowcatcher a collie was stationed to drive trespassing cattle off the track . Frequent delays were occasioned when the straps of iron came loose and rolled up under the engine . But the queer railway was a money-maker and brought a good price when its owner sold it to the Oregon Steam Navigation Company . The Rawhide Railroad was built in 1868 , when most of Washington was wilderness . What strides the Evergreen State has made since that time ! Progress does not come gradually in Washington . It bursts full panoplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement that very miracles are accepted as matters of course . The people have accomplished prodigies of development in the last few decades , but even now they realize only in small measure the resources that lie ready to their hands . Theirs is a young land , a good land , a land still for pioneers .
