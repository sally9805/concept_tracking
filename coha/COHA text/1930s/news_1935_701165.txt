txt The Metropolitan Museum of Art has added to its collection of Greek art an " Athenian column krater " ? as announced in yesterday 's TIMES  --  a mixing bowl on which is depicted a scene from the famous tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece . This ancient legendary researcher on the first ship to seek the gleaming fleece had already yoked the brazen-footed bulls " breathing fire from nostrils of adamant , " as OVID described them , at the touch of whose hot breath the very grass shriveled . He had ' also disposed of the soldiers armed with sharppointed spears that had sprung up from the dragons ' teeth which he had " sowed broadcast " in the plowed field . He Is now represented at his last of the three Colchian contests that were to determine his fate . He is shown in the very act of seizing the golden fleece guarded by the dragon . Jason appears so slight and " emaciated " a figure that the deed seems the more heroic  --  Athena and even the Argonaut sailor being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of him ( in Om ) , who was " touched by his beauty " as well as moved by his youth , his noble birth and his manhood . PINDAR is quoted by the Musetinl Bulletin as praising him in superlative adjectives . It is stated in one of the versions of the myth that Jason lulled the dragon to sleep by a few drops of a preparation which Medea supplied  --  suggestive of the " isomers " or " dream tablets " described by Mr. MIDGLEY in his address yesterday before the American Chemical Society forecasting the chemistry in the next century . Mythical Medea in magic surpassed even his " overnight solution " of our " most intricate " problems by the addition of chemical " compounds to the human system . " Jason has come to New York not only in this precious relic of a century when AESCIIYLUS was writing plays on the legends of the Argonauts . He has come as a chemist with his brother chemical explorers from every part of America , as the legendary Jason and his companions from every region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will not be difficult to identify the Theseus , the Meleager , the Peleus and the Nestor of this brave assembly  --  the modern Argonautae , in quest of that which is more valuable than " golden fleece . " Was not the story of Jason , after all , the glorifying of some prehistoric victory by man over the forces of nature , some Titan adventure and struggle out on the frontier of the  --  known world , a memory of the wrenching of a living from the stony earth in the face of its savage inhabitants , the employment of some new weapon , the taming of wild beasts , the distilling of some potency from herb or fruit , the necromancy of the primitive laboratory of the cave ? the earliest pioneering of the scientist ? The Jasons have come to town both in art 's triumphant resurrection and in science 's continuing adventurers . It is a happy augury of a more closely knit race of human beings that the women of the West and the East have met in conference in Istanbul over world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the circumference of the earth than this glorious city by the Golden Horn , where the shores of Europe and Asia face each other with just " a dividing line of silver thread between "  --  the " ordained seat " of a world consciousness . It was a fit preface for such a meeting that the women of Turkey were but a few weeks ago given the national franchise and consequent membership in the Grand National Assembly . One remembers the remarkable Lycian tomb , now in the Museum of Istanbul , around which the figure in marble of the wife of the unknown warrior ? marches in " sorrow 's every mood " ? " a pale procession of immortal Love . " Dr. WEIR MITCHELL , whose ode on this " fair worshiper of many gods " has been called the high-water mark in American verse , would find an even nobler them. - is the assembling of these rep- resentative women of the world of many faiths and varying traditions in making a. better earth , especially for children and so for oncoming generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
