In 1933 , the last effective year of the Versailles-League of Nations system , the world 's armies numbered 7,000,000 men , its navies totaled 3,000,000 tons , its military planes were 14,000 , and $4,000,000,000 was spent to keep the men and machines of war . Pacifists considered these figures pretty horrible . As it turns out they were small potatoes . <P> In 1938 , the year of Munich , armies had increased to 10,000,000 men , naval tonnage had jumped to 8,000,000 , military planes had possibly trebled in number and $17,000,000,000 went slithering down the gullet of the hungry god of war-to-be . This year , with Russia leading the Big Parade ( U. S. S. R. war budget for 1939 is $8,000,000,000 ) , these figures are again skyrocketing . <P> The only reason that so much of the world 's hard-earned wealth is poured down an uneconomic rathole is that men expect and fear the coming of a Second World War . That expectation and fear is the greatest political force in the world today . Horror of the war itself makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war and the fear of its outcome drive men to prepare for it . <P> What is the prospect of the war-not in terms of human , political or economic suffering-but in terms of its military factors from which all other consequences will spring ? No man can write its history beforehand . Yet an outline for its history has already been laid down in the armies and the armaments of Europe . <P> Great Unknowns . That outline is not yet definitive because there are several big imponderables . It is not known for certain who may fight whom ; in stacking up the armed forces of the world against each other it is not certain for example whether Japan is to be counted as one of the Axis powers , or because of her involvement in China she may remain neutral ; it is equally uncertain whether Russia may belong to the Democratic front or be a neutral ; it is even uncertain whether the U. S. will be a neutral or a member of the Democratic front . <P> If the nations which may be lined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a reasonably accurate estimate of their fighting strength in men , guns , ships , planes . But such an estimate though quantitatively correct may be in total error from the qualitative standpoint . <P> Quality oftener than not outweighs quantity in war - the best soldiers , the best guns , the best ships , the best planes mean more than mere big numbers . <P> Not least of the unknowns are the imponderables of strategy and tactics . Wars are fought by human beings as well as by machines , and , as Napoleon suggested , an army of lions that is led by a lamb can be beaten by an army of lambs under the leadership of a lion . Failure of leadership lost the World War for Germany at the outset when a timid High Command failed to keep the strength of its right wing up to the plan of Alfred von Schlieffen on the famed swing through Belgium . Conversely , the Japanese capitalized on brilliant chance-taking when they sent an army to the Asiatic mainland in 1904 with out first bothering to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast with the great imponderables are the undisputed facts :
