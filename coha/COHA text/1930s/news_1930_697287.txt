txt WORK AND WAGES . Moderation of Labor 's Views Might Relieve Unemployment . To the Editor of The New York Times : After the discouragement to business of November , 1929 , the President made an appeal to the country to make work to prevent and relieve unemployment .

An attractive bid by labor , by the unemployed , to obtain work at fair , not high , wages might have a wonderfully stimulating effect on " diminished volume of public works " and on the " general psychology of retrenchment . " As a capitalist and employer in a small way I have experienced this . I have work that could be done now or deferred . The probability of reduced income created the psychology of retrenchment , but offers of work at reduced wages , not by any means reduced to a mere living wage , have altered the situation to a psychology of the attractiveness of economy in construction .
