Czech and Slovak leaders , with the hardness and tenacity of their races , were busy last week ably playing the weak cards dealt to them at Munich . But in Prague , this unpleasant New Deal for Czechoslovakia had four anguished Britons pathetically wringing their hands . <P> The Lord Mayor of London , kindly Sir Harry Twyford , whose instant reaction to Munich was to start a charitable subscription for refugees from the Sudetenland , arrived in Prague beaming with the news that his British fund already had almost $200,000 in hand . Sir Harry was shortly told by Jewish , Communist and Socialist leaders among the Sudeten refugees that money was " almost no use " in the dire emergency they faced . Within 48 hours after a Sudeten refugee arrived in what remained of Czechoslovakia last week , he could count on being flung back into Germany . <P> " I ran over such a man-a Sudeten German Social Democrat-who stepped in front of my car , " radioed John T. Whitaker of the Chicago Daily News from Prague . " His head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking him to a hospital , but in giving the police a full record of the accident , he pleaded ' the police will be compelled to send me back and I will be beaten to death . ' He explained , this mild , reasonable little Socialist , that the Czech authorities had no choice . ' If too many Sudeten German refugees collected in Prague , Hitler would use that as an excuse to take the capital city over , too . ' " <P> To Prague had gone two British Labor Party henchmen , Messrs . Gillies and David Grenfell , especially to succor Social-Democratic Sudetens . " These people must be saved if we have to rouse the whole world " said Gillies and Grenfell in a joint statement . " The Czechs will now forfeit within a few days the claim to the worldwide sympathy they have deservedly won if they drive back to torture and death at the hands of the Nazis these front-line Soldiers of Democracy ... " <P> Sir Harry Twyford and Messrs . Gillies and Grenfell were joined by Sir Neill Malcolm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who appealed to the Czechoslovak Premier , tough , one-eyed General Jan Syrovy . " We Czechs are determined once and for all that there shall be no repetition of what we have suffered on the grounds of ' German minority questions ' " the Premier-General told the High Commissioner . <P> New Deal . Every unemployed Czechoslovak male aged over 18 was last week ordered to register for Labor Service , a program created by the Syrovy Cabinet to conscript in effect every jobless Czechoslovak to build new railways , highways and other projects necessary to get the dismembered Czechoslovak Republic reorganized and on its feet . As fast as they are mustered out of the Czechoslovak army , great numbers of recruits will be mustered into the Labor Service , and stern punishment was decreed for the new Czechoslovak crime of giving a man a " fake job , " thus exempting from Labor Service .
