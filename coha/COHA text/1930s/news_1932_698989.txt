txt Help for West Virginia Miners . To the Editor of The New York Times : West Virginia miners may seem a far cry to people in New York , where there is destitution aplenty ; but down here people are actually starving , and no relief agency functions . The special session of the Legislature has been sitting for two weeks , ibut as yet has voted no appropriations . Meanwhile , many efforts are being made to get county relief , with little success . So there are whole communities in the Charleston area that have gone without food for days . Naturally , all kinds of diseases due to malnutrition are breaking out in the mining villages . Many children , caught in the epidemics , have died , and adults too are succumbing . Unless help comes from the outside world it is hard to say what will happen to the miners in the Kanawha Valley . Every small check helps , though thousands of dollars are needed . Address Tom Tippett , Chairman of Relief , Room 9 , Old Kanawha Valley Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 26 , 1932.
