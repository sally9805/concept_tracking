THE CHRYSANTHEMUMS A STORY BY JOHN STEINBECK HE high gray-flannel fog of winter I closed the Salinas Valley from the sky and from all the rest of the world . On every side it sat like a lid on the mountains and made of the great valley a closed pot . On the broad , level land floor the gang plows bit deep and left the black earth shining like metal where the shares had cut . On the foot-hill ranches across the Salinas River the yellow stubble fields seemed to be bathed in pale cold sunshine ; but there was no sunshine in the valley now in December . The thick willow scrub along the river flamed with sharp and positive yellow leaves . It was a time of quiet and of waiting . The air was cold and tender . A light wind blew up from the southwest so that the farmers were mildly hopeful of a good rain before long ; but fog and rain do not go together . Across the river , on Henry Allen 's foothill ranch there was little work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the orchards were plowed up to receive the rain deeply when it should come . The cattle on the higher slopes were becoming shaggy and rough-coated . Elisa Allen , working in her flower garden , looked down across the yard and saw Henry , her husband , talking to two men in business suits . The three of them stood by the tractor shed , each man with one foot on the side of the Little Fordson . They smoked cigarettes and studied the machine as they talked . Elisa watched them for a moment and then went back to her work . She was thirty-five . Her face was lean and strong and her eyes were as clear as water . Her figure looked blocked and heavy in her gardening costume , a man 's black hat pulled low down over her eyes , clodhopper shoes , a figured print dress almost completely covered by a big corduroy apron with four big pockets to hold the snips , the trowel and scratcher , the seeds and the knife she worked with . She wore heavy leather gloves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the old year 's chrysanthemum stalks with a pair of short and powerful scissors . She looked down toward the men by the tractor shed now and then . Her face was eager and mature and handsome ; even her work with the scissors was over-eager , over-powerful . The chrysanthemum stems seemed too small and easy for her energy . She brushed a cloud of hair out of her eyes with the back of her glove , and left a smudge of earth on her cheek in doing it . Behind her stood the neat white farmhouse with red geraniums close-banked round it as high as the windows . It was a hard-swept looking little house , with hard-polished windows , and a clean mat on the front steps . Elisa cast another glance toward the tractor shed . The stranger men were getting into their Ford Coupe . She took off a glove and put her strong fingers down into the forest of new green chrysanthemum sprouts that were growing round the old roots . She spread the leaves and looked down among the close-growing stems . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut worms . Her terrier fingers destroyed such pests before they could get started . Elisa started at the sound of her husband 's voice . He had come near quietly and he leaned over the wire fence that protected her flower garden from cattle and dogs and chickens . " At it again , " he said . " You 've got a strong new crop coming . " Elisa straightened her back and pulled on the gardening glove again . " Yes . They 'll be strong this coming year . " In her tone and on her face there was a little smugness . " You 've got a gift with things , " Henry observed . " Some of those yellow chrysanthemums you had last year were ten inches across . I wish you 'd work out in the orchard and raise some apples that big . " Her eyes sharpened . " Maybe I could do it too . I 've a gift with things all right . My mother had it . She could stick anything in the ground and make it grow . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " " Well , it sure works with flowers , " he said . " Henry , who were those men you were talking to ? " " Why , sure , that 's what I came to tell you . They were from the Western Meat Company . I sold those thirty head of three-year-old steers . Got nearly my own price too . " " Good , " she said . " Good for you . " " And I thought , " he continued , " I thought how it 's Saturday afternoon , and we might go into Salinas for dinner at a restaurant and then to a picture show  --  to celebrate , you see . " " Good , " she repeated . " Oh , yes . That will be good . " Henry put on his joking tone . " There 's fights to-night . How 'd you like to go to the fights ? " " Oh , no , " she said breathlessly . " No , I would n't like fights . " " Just fooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see . It 's two now . I 'm going to take Scotty and bring down those steers from the hill . It 'll take us maybe two hours . We 'll go in town about five and have dinner at the Cominos Hotel . Like that ? " " Of course I 'll like it . It 's good to eat away from home . " " All right then . I 'll go get up a couple of horses . " She said , " I 'll have plenty of time to transplant some of these sets , I guess . " She heard her husband calling Scotty down by the barn . And a little later she saw the two men ride up the pale-yellow hillside in search of the steers . There was a little square sandy bed kept for rooting the chrysanthemums . With her trowel she turned the soil over and over and smoothed it and patted it firm . Then she dug ten parallel trenches to receive the sets . Back at the chrysanthemum bed she pulled out the little crisp shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scissors , and laid it on a small orderly pile . A squeak of wheels and plod of hoofs came from the road . Elisa looked up . The country road ran along the dense bank of willows and cottonwoods that bordered the river , and up this road came a curious vehicle , curiously drawn . It was an old spring-wagon , with a round canvas top on it like the cover of a prairie schooner . It was drawn by an old bay horse and a little gray-and-white burro . A big stubble-bearded man sat between the cover flaps and drove the crawling team . Underneath the wagon , between the hind wheels , a lean and rangy mongrel dog walked sedately . Words were painted on the canvas in clumsy , crooked letters . " Pots , pans , knives , scissors , lawn mowers , Fixed . " Two rows of articles . and the triumphantly definitive " Fixed " below . The black paint had run down in little sharp points beneath each letter . Elisa , squatting on the ground , watched to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . It turned into the farm road in front of her house , crooked old wheels skirling and squeaking . The rangy dog darted from beneath the wheels and ran ahead . Instantly the two ranch shepherds flew out at him . Then all three stopped , and with stiff and quivering tails , with taut straight legs , with ambassadorial dignity , they slowly circled , sniffing daintily . The caravan pulled up to Elisa 's wire fence and stopped . Now the newcomer dog , feeling outnumbered , lowered his tail and retired under the wagon with raised hackles and bared teeth . The man on the wagon scat called out , " That 's a bad dog in a fight when he gets started . " Elisa laughed . " I see he is . How soon does he generally get started ? " The man caught up her laughter and echoed it heartily . " Sometimes not for weeks and weeks , " he said . He climbed stiffly down over the wheel . The horse and the donkey dropped like unwatered flowers . Elisa saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and beard were graying , he did not look old . His worn black suit was wrinkled and spotted with grease . The laughter had disappeared from his face and eyes the moment his laughing voice ceased . His eyes were dark and they were full of the brooding that gets in the eyes of teamsters and of sailors . The calloused hands he rested on the fence were cracked , and every crack was a black line . He took off his battered hat . " I 'm off my general road , ma'am , " he said . " Does this dirt road cut over across the river to the Los Angeles highway ? " Elisa stood up and shoved the thick scissors in her apron pocket . " Well , yes , it does , but it winds around and then fords the river . I do n't think your team could pull through the sand . " He replied with some asperity , " It might surprise you what them beasts can pull through . " " When they get started ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get started . " " Well , " said Elisa , " I think you 'll save time if you go back to the Salinas road and pick up the highway there . " He drew a big finger down the chicken wire and made it sing . " I ai n't in any hurry , ma'am . I go from Seattle to San Diego and back every year . Takes all my time . About six months each way . I aim to follow nice weather . " Elisa took off her gloves and stuffed them in the apron pocket with the scissors . She touched the under edge of her man 's hat , searching for fugitive hairs . " That sounds like a nice kind of a way to live , " she said . He leaned confidentially over the fence . " Maybe you noticed the writing on my wagon . I mend pots and sharpen knives and scissors . You got any of them things to do ? " " Oh , no , " she said quickly . " Nothing like that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst thing , " he explained . " Most people just ruin scissors trying to sharpen ' em , but I know how . I got a special tool . It 's a little bobbit kind of thing and patented . But it sure does the trick . " " No . My scissors are all sharp . " " AlI right then . Take a pot , " he continued earnestly , " a bent pot or a pot with a hole . I can make it like new so you do n't have to buy no new ones . That 's a saving for you . " " No , " she said shortly . " I tell you I have nothing like that for you to do . " His face fell to art exaggerated sadness . His voice took on a whining undertone . " I ai n't had a thing to do to-day . Maybe I wo n't have no supper to-night . You see I 'm off my regular road . I know folks on the highway clear from Seattle to San Diego . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I do it so good and save them money . " " I 'm sorry , " Elisa said irritably . " I have n't anything for you to do . " His eyes left her face and fell to searching the ground . They roamed about until they came to the chrysanthemum bed where she had been working . " What 's them plants , ma'am ? " The irritation and resistance melted from Elisa 's face . " Oh , those are chrysanthemums , giant whites and yellows . raise them every year , bigger than anybody around here . " " Kind of a long-stemmed flower ? Looks like a quick puff of colored smoke ? " he asked . " That 's it . What a nice way to describe them . " " They smell kind of nasty till you get used to them , " he said . " It 's a good bitter smell , " she retorted , " not nasty at all . " He changed his tone quickly . " I like the smell myself . " " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man leaned farther over the fence . " Look . I know a lady down the road a piece has got the nicest garden you ever seen . Got nearly every kind of flower but no chrysantheums . Last time I was mending a copper-bottom wash tub for her ( that 's a hard job but I do it good ) , she said to me , ' If you ever run accost some nice chrysantheums I wish you 'd try to get me a few seeds . ' That 's what she told me . " Elisa 's eyes grew alert and eager . " She could n't have known much about chrysanthemums . You can raise them from seed , but it 's much easier to root the little sprouts you see there . " " Oh , " he said . " I s'pose I ca n't take none to her then . " " Why yes , you can , " Elisa cried . " I can put some in damp sand , and you can carry them right along with you . They 'll take root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she can transplant them . " " She 'd sure like to have some , ma'am . You say they 're nice ones ? " " Beautiful , " she said . " Oh , beautiful . " Her eyes shone . She tore off the battered hat and shook out her dark pretty hair . " I 'll put them in a flower pot , and you can take them right with you . Come into the yard . " While the man came through the picket gate Elisa ran excitedly along thegeranium-bordered path to the back of the house . And she returned carrying a big red flower pot . The gloves were forgotten now . She kneeled on the ground by the starting bed and dug up the sandy soil with her fingers and scooped it into the bright new flower pot . Then she picked up the little pile of shoots she had prepared . With her strong fingers she pressed them into the sand and tamped round them with her knuckles . The man stood over her . " I 'll tell you what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can tell the lady . " " Yes , I 'll try to remember . " " Well , look . These will take root in about a month . Then she must set them out , about a foot apart in good rich earth like this , see ? " She lifted a handful of dark soil for him to look at . " They 'll grow fast and tall . Now remember this . In July tell her to cut them down , about eight inches from the ground . " " Before they bloom ? " he asked . " Yes , before they bloom . " Her face was tight with eagerness . " They 'll grow right up again . About the last of September the buds will start . " She stopped and seemed perplexed . " It 's the budding that takes the most care , " she said hesitantly . " I do n't know how to tell you . " She looked deep into his eyes searchingly . Her mouth opened a little , and she seemed to be listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you ever hear of planting hands ? " " Ca n't say I have , ma'am . " " Well , I can only tell you what it feels like . It 's when you 're picking off the buds you do n't want . Everything goes right down into your fingertips . You watch your fingers work . They do it themselves . You can feel how it is . They pick and pick the buds . They never make a mistake . They 're with the plant . Do you see ? Your fingers and the plant . You can feel that , right up your arm . They know . They never make a mistake . You can feel it . When you 're like that you ca n't do anything wrong . Do you see that ? Can you understand that ? " She was kneeling on away self-consciously . " Maybe I know , " he said . " Sometimes in the night in the wagon there ? " Elisa 's voice grew husky . She broke in on him , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean . When the night is dark  --  the stars are sharp-pointed , and there 's quiet . Why , you rise up and up ! " Kneeling there , her hand went out toward his legs in the greasy black trousers . Her hesitant fingers almost touched the cloth . Then her hand dropped to the ground . He said , " It 's nice , just like you say . Only when you do n't have no dinner it ai n't . " She stood up then , very straight , and her face was ashamed . She held the flower pot out to him and placed it gently in his arms . " Here . Put it in your wagon , on the seat , where you can watch it . Maybe I can find something for you to do . " At the back of the house she dug in the can pile and found two old and battered aluminum sauce pans . She carried them back and gave them to him . " Here , maybe you can fix these . " His manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can fix them . " At the back of his wagon he set a little anvil , and out of an oily tool box dug a small machine hammer . Elisa came through the gate to watch him while he pounded out the dents in the kettles . His mouth grew sure and knowing . At a difficult part of the work he sucked his under-lip . " You sleep right in the wagon ? " Elisa asked . " Right in the wagon , ma'am . Rain or shine I 'm dry as a cow in there . " " It must be nice , " she said . " It must be very nice . I wish women could do such things . " " It ai n't the right kind of a life for a woman . " Her upper lip raised a little , showing her teeth . " How do you know ? How can you tell ? " she said . " I do n't know , ma'am , " he protested . " Of course I do n't know . Now here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy no new ones . " " How much ? " " Oh , fifty cents 'll do . I keep my prices down and my work good . That 's why I have all them satisfied customers up and down the highway . " Elisa brought him a fifty-cent piece from the house and dropped it in his hand . " You might be surprised to have a rival sometime . I can sharpen scissors too . And I can beat the dents out of little pots . I could show you what a woman might do . " He put his hammer back in the oily box and shoved the little anvil out of sight . " It would be a lonely life for a woman , ma'am , and a scary life , too , with animals creeping under the wagon all night . " He climbed over the singletree , steadying himself with a hand on the burro 's white rump . He settled himself in the seat , picked up the lines . " Thank you kindly , ma'am , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and catch the Salinas road . " " Mind , " she called , " if you 're long in getting there , keep the sand damp . " " Sand , ma'am ? ? Sand ? Oh , sure . You mean around the chrysantheums . Sure I will . " He clucked his tongue . The beasts leaned luxuriously into their collars . The mongrel dog took his place between the back wheels . The wagon turned and crawled out the entrance road and back the way it had come , along the river . Elisa stood in front of her wire fence watching the slow progress of the caravan . Her shoulders were straight , her head thrown back , her eyes half-closed , so that the scene came vaguely into them . Her lips moved silently , forming the words " Good-by  --  good-by . " Then she whispered , " That 's a bright direction . There 's a glowing thc. -. -c . " The sound of her whisper startled her . She shook herself free and looked about to see whether anyone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted their heads toward her from their sleep-. ing in the dust , and then stretched out their chins and settled asleep again . Elisa turned and ran hurriedly into the house . In the kitchen she reached behind the stove and felt the water tank . It was full of hot water from the noonday cooking . In the bathroom she tore off her soiled clothes and flung them into the corner . And then she scrubbed herself with a little block of pumice , legs and thighs , loins and chest and arms , until her skin was scratched and red . When she had dried herself she stood in front of a mirror in her bedroom and looked at her body . She tightened her stomach and threw out her chest . She turned and looked over her shoulder at her back . After a while she began to dress slowly . She put on her newest underclothing and her nicest stockings and the dress which was the symbol of her prettiness . She worked carefully on her hair , pencilled her eyebrows , and rouged her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hoofs and the shouts of Henry and his helper as they drove the red steers into the corral . She heard the gate bang shut and set herself for Henry 's arrival . His step sounded on the porch . He entered the house calling , " Elisa , where are you ? " " In my room , dressing . I 'm not ready . There 's hot water for your bath . Hurry up . It 's getting late . " When she heard him splashing in the tub , Elisa laid his dark suit on the bed , and shirt and socks and tie beside it . She stood his polished shoes on the floor beside the bed . Then she went to the porch and sat primly and stiffly down . She looked toward the river road where the willow-line was still yellow with frosted leaves so that under the high gray fog they seemed a thin band of sunshine . This was the only color in the gray afternoon . She sat unmoving for a long time . Henry came banging out of the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elisa stiffened and her face grew tight . Henry stopped short and looked at her . " Why  --  why , Elisa . You look so nice ! " " Nice ? You think I look nice ? What do you mean by ' nice ' ? " Henry blundered on . " I do n't know . I mean you look different , strong and happy . " " I am strong ? Yes , strong . What do you mean ' strong ' ? " He looked bewildered . " You 're playing some kind of a game , " he said helplessly . " It 's a kind of a play . You look strong enough to break a calf over your knee , happy enough to eat it like a watermelon . " For a second she lost her rigidity . " Henryt Do n't talk like that . You did n't know what you said . " She grew complete again . " I am strong , " she boasted . " I never knew before how strong . " Henry looked down toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , they were his own again . " I 'll get out the car . You can put on your coat while I 'm starting . " Elisa went into the house . She heard him drive to the gate and idle down his motor , and then she took a long time to put on her hat . She pulled it here and pressed it there . When Henry turned the motor off she slipped into her coat and went out . The little roadster bounced along on the dirt road by the river , raising the birds and driving the rabbits into the brush . Two cranes flapped heavily over the willow-line and dropped into the river-bed . Far ahead on the road Elisa saw a dark speck in the dust . She suddenly felt empty . She did not hear Henry 's talk . She tried not to look ; she did not want to see the little heap of sand and green shoots , but she could not help herself . The chrysanthemums lay in the road close to the wagon tracks . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car passed them she remembered the good bitter smell , and a little shudder went through her . She felt ashamed of her strong planter 's hands , that were no use , lying palms up in her lap . The roadster turned a bend and she saw the caravan ahead . She swung full round toward her husband so that she could not see the little covered wagon and the mismatched team as the car passed . In a moment they had left behind them the man who had not known or needed to know what she said , the bargainer . She did not look back . To Henry she said loudly , to be heard above the motor , " It will be good , tonight , a good dinner . " " Now you 're changed again , " Henry complained . He took one hand from the wheel and patted her knee . " I ought to take you in to dinner oftener . It would be good for both of us . We get so heavy out on the ranch . " " Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner ? " " Sure . Says That will be fine . " She was silent for a while ; then she said , " Henry , at those prize fights do the men hurt each other very much ? " " Sometimes a little , not often . Why ? " " Well , I 've read how they break noses , and blood runs down their chests . I 've read how the fighting gloves get heavy and soggy with blood . " He looked round at her . " What 's the matter , Elisa ? I did n't know you read things like that . " He brought the car to a stop , then turned to the right over the Salinas River bridge . " Do any women ever go to the fights ? " she asked . " Oh , sure , some . What 's the matter , Elisa ? Do you want to go ? I do n't think you 'd like it , but I 'll take you if you really want to go . " She relaxed limply in the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go . I 'm sure I do n't . " Her face was turned away from him . " It will be enough if we can have wine . It will be plenty . " She turned up her coat collar so he could not see that she was crying weakly  --  like an old woman .
