" The airplane is an instrument as vital and epoch-making as the telescope , the microscope and the camera . An hour in the air is worth a year on the surface in . . . understanding the works and ways of man . " <P> This smacking observation was made last week by Northwestern University 's Sociology Professor William Louis Bailey as he stepped from a plane in Chicago after taking his classes up for a 40-minute bird's-eye view of the city . Professor Bailey has been using the airplane as an instrument to educate his students for 18 years . Subject of their study : the growth of the city . Last week , Professor Bailey was prepared to discuss some striking theories he has developed about how a city grows . <P> The city , said he , is an organism , evolves like other living things . It begins as a village , roughly square in shape , then , constantly reaching out and expanding like an amoeba , it grows into an irregularly rectangular town , develops into a triangular metropolis , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these processes Professor Bailey calls " conurbanisms . " Within the city , also , changes in the organs take place . Thus in Chicago decentralization has been going on , and today there are 50 outlying business centres more conspicuous from the air than the Loop . Most startling observation by Professor Bailey is that all cities follow the same pattern of growth , and two cities of the same nature and age have the same form , modified only slightly by differences in the natural terrain . To prove his theory , Professor Bailey plans to take his students next year on educational flights over other U. S. cities .
