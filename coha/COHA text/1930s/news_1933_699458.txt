txt Mr. ROOSEVELT was Knowing greatly impressed by the and size of Muscle Shoals . Seeing . " It was at least twice as large as I had any conception . " Yet it is not to be supposed that he really made up his mind about Muscle Shoals on the basis of his brief study on the spot . He must have come to a decision before he made his visit . In that case his views shoulcl not have been strengthened , but , on the contrary , shaken , when he found that the Muscle Shoals project was twice as big as he has imagined . A difference of 100 per cent in the size of an engineering enterprise is quite a difference . Obviously , what Mr. ROOSEVELT meant was that Muscle Shoals in the flesh looks twice as big as any picture he had formed of it . He was not referring to any precise statistical " conception .

This real world and the magic world of Titipu met for the first time in March , 1885 . If it were not that New York has just said a reluctant farewell to ANTONIO Scorn after thirty-three years of continuous service at the Metropolitan Opera House , the old question might have been raised again : Why are American audiences less constant to their established favorites than are other countries ?

Well , the thing ought not to be impossible to imagine , since it is happening all the time . Some time we do it openly and unashamed . More often we disguise our feelings . We do not want to be like the English and the Germans and the French in loving old things because they are old . So we pretend to revive old plays for the purpose of guying them . But at bot- , tom we are wistful about the mutton-chop whiskers and the leg-ofmutton sleeves and the bustles and the mammoth hats and the bloomers and the bicycles that we laugh at .

We are being told that our economic system Is collapsing because we have so many machines about us . But we are not told that a great many of these machines are not for work but for play . How many are they ? We have heard much recently of energy and horsepower . The Report on Social Trends estimates that since the year 1900 the amount of energy consumed in this country has increased about six times if we count working machines , motor trucks and motor buses . But the increase has been twenty-six tithes if we include passenger automobiles . In other words , something like threefourths of our " machines " today are playthings . Three-fourths of the mechanical energy we consume today is expended in play . The new Federal court house in New York City is to be granite and not limestone .
