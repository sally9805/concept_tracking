AN old white , broken-down , frame house with a front porch , on San Benito Avenue in Fresno , California . There are no other houses near by , only a desolation of bleak land and red sky . It is late afternoon of a day in August , 1914 . The evening sun is going down . JOHNNY , aged nine , but essentially ageless , is sitting , dynamic and acrobatic , on the steps of the porch , dead to the world and deep in thought of a high and holy order . Far away a train whistle cries mournfully . He listens eagerly , cocking his head on one side like a chicken , trying to understand the meaning of the cry and at the same time to figure out everything . He does n't quite make it and when the cry ends he stops being eager . A fourteen-year-old boy on a bicycle , eating an ice-cream cone and carrying newspaper bags , goes by on the sidewalk in silence , oblivious of the weight on his shoulders and of the contraption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glory of ice cream in the world . JOHNNY leaps to his feet and waves to the boy , smiling in a big humanitarian way , but is ignored . He sits down again and listens to a small overjoyed but angry bird . After making a brief forceful speech of no meaning , the bird flies away . From inside the house is heard the somber voice of JOHNNY 'S FATHER reciting poetry of his own composition . ALEXANDER The long silent day journeys through the sore solemn heart , and  --  ( Bitter pause ) And  --  ( Quickly ) The long silent day journeys through the sore solemn heart , and  --  ( Pause ) No . ( He roars and begins again ) Crippled and weeping , time stumbles through the lone lorn heart . ( A table or chair is pushed over in anger . A groan . Silence ) ( The boy listens . He gets up and tries to stand on his head , fails , tries again , fails , tries again , and succeeds . While he is standing on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world : a solo on a bugle . The music is " My Heart 's in the Highlands . " The bugler , a very old man , finishes the solo in front of the house . The boy leaps to his feet and runs up to the old man , amazed , delighted and bewildered ) p. 3 JOHNNY I sure would like to hear you play another song . MAC GREGOR Young man , could you get a glass of water for an old man whose heart is not here , but in the highlands ? JOHNNY What highlands ? MAC GREGOR The Scotch Highlands . Could you ? JOHNNY What 's your heart doing in the Scotch Highlands ? MAC GREGOR My heart 's grieving there . Could you get me a glass of cool water ? JOHNNY Where 's your mother ? MAC GREGOR ( Inventing for the boy ) My mother 's in Tulsa , Oklahoma , but her heart is n't . JOHNNY Where is her heart ? MAC GREGOR ( Loud ) In the Scotch Highlands . ( Soft ) I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your family are always leaving their hearts in the highlands ? MAC GREGOR ( In the Shakespearean manner ) That 's the way we are . Here today and gone tomorrow . p. 4 JOHNNY ( Aside ) Here today and gone tomorrow ? ( To MacGregor ) How do you figure ? MAC GREGOR ( The philosopher ) Alive one minute and dead the next . JOHNNY Where 's your mother 's mother ? MAC GREGOR ( Inventing , but angry ) She 's up in Vermont , in a little town called White River , but her heart is n't . JOHNNY Is her poor old withered heart in the highlands , too ? MAC GREGOR Right smack in the highlands . Son , I 'm dying of thirst . ( JOHNNY 'S FATHER comes out of the house in a fury , as if he has just broken out of a cage , and roars at the boy like a tiger that has just awakened from evil dreams ) ALEXANDER Johnny , get the hell away from that poor old man . Get him a pitcher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell are your manners ? JOHNNY Ca n't a fellow try to find out something from a traveler once in a while ? ALEXANDER Get the old man some water , God damn it . Do n't stand there like a dummy . Get him a drink , I tell you , before he falls down and dies . p. 5 JOHNNY You get him a drink . You 're not doing anything . ALEXANDER Not doing anything ? Why , Johnny , you know I 'm getting a new poem arranged in my mind . JOHNNY How do you figure I know ? You 're just standing there on the porch with your sleeves rolled up . ALEXANDER ( Angry ) Well , you ought to know . ( Roaring ) You 're my son . ( Amazed ) If you should n't know , who should ? MAC GREGOR ( Blithely ) Good afternoon . Your son has been telling me how clear and cool the climate is in these parts . JOHNNY ( Bewildered , but eager to learn ) ( Aside ) Holy Moses , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting that stuff from ? ALEXANDER ( The aristocrat , grandly ) How do you do ? Wo n't you come in for a little rest ? We should be honored to have you at our table for a bite of supper . MAC GREGOR ( The realist ) Sir , I 'm starving . I shall come right in . ( He moves to enter the house . JOHNNY gets in his way , looking up at him ) p. 6 JOHNNY ( The romantic ) Can you play " Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes " ? I sure would like to hear you play that song on the bugle . That song is my favorite . I guess I like that song better than any song in the world . MAC GREGOR ( The disillusioned ) Son , when you get to be my age you 'll know songs are n't important , bread 's the thing . JOHNNY ( The faithful ) Anyway , I sure would like to hear you play that song . ( MAC GREGOR goes up on the porch and shakes hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making ) My name is Jasper MacGregor . I am an actor . ALEXANDER ( Delighted ) I 'm mighty glad to make your acquaintance . ( The imperial giver of orders ) Johnny , get Mr. MacGregor a pitcher of water . ( JOHNNY runs around the house ) MAC GREGOR ( Dying of thirst , sighing , but telling the truth nevertheless ) Charming boy . ALEXANDER ( Ordinary statement ) Like myself , he 's a genius . p. 7 MAC GREGOR ( Roaring , from fatigue ) I suppose you 're very fond of him ? ALEXANDER ( Delighted to be alive ) We are the same person  --  He is the heart of my youth  --  Have you noticed his eagerness ? MAC GREGOR ( Delighted to be still alive ) I should say I have . ALEXANDER ( Proudly and with anger ) I 'm the same way myself , although older and less brilliant . ( JOHNNY , running , returns with a pitcher of water which he hands to the old man . The old man throws back his shoulders , lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes widen , he lifts the pitcher of water to his lips and drinks all the water in one long swig , while JOHNNY and his FATHER watch with amazement and admiration . The old man breathes deeply , looks around at the landscape and up at the sky and to the end of San Benito Avenue where the evening sun is going down ) MAC GREGOR ( Reflection , sadly ; weariness , softly ) I reckon I 'm five thousand miles from home . Do you think we could eat a little bread and cheese to keep my body and spirit together ? ALEXANDER ( Napoleon ) Johnny , run down to the grocer 's and get a loaf of French bread and a pound of cheese . p. 8 JOHNNY ( The voice of doom ) Give me the money . ALEXANDER ( Statistics , poetic , with pride ) You know I have n't got a penny , Johnny . Tell Mr. Kosak to give us credit . JOHNNY ( The unwilling dutiful son ) He wo n't do it . He 's tired of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pay our bills . We owe him forty cents . ALEXANDER ( Impatient , irritated ) Go on down there and argue it out with him . You know that 's your job . JOHNNY ( Defending his rights ) He wo n't listen to reason . He says he does n't know anything about anything . All he wants is the forty cents . ALEXANDER ( Napoleon ) Go on down there and make him give you a loaf of bread and a pound of cheese . ( Gently , pleading , flattering ) You can do it , Johnny . MAC GREGOR ( Impatient and hungry ) Go on down there and tell Mr. Kosak to give you a loaf of bread and a pound of cheese , son . ALEXANDER Go ahead , Johnny . You 've never failed to leave that store with something or other . You 'll be back here in ten minutes with food fit for a King . ( For his own amusement ) Or at least a Duke of some kind . p. 9 JOHNNY I do n't know . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run-around . He wants to know what kind of work you do . ALEXANDER ( Furiously ) Well , go ahead and tell him . ( The hero ) I have nothing to conceal . I write poetry , night and day . JOHNNY ( Giving in at last ) All right , but I do n't think he 'll be impressed . He says you never go out and look for work . He says you 're lazy and no good . ALEXANDER ( Roaring ) You go on down there and tell that great-hearted Slovak he 's crazy , Johnny . You go on down there and tell that splendid scholar and gentleman your father is one of the greatest unknown poets living . JOHNNY He wo n't care , Pa , but I 'll go . I 'll do my best . Have n't we got anything in the house ? ALEXANDER ( Mock-tragically , roaring ) Only popcorn . ( To MAC GREGOR ) We 've been eating popcorn four days in a row now . Johnny , you 've got to get bread and cheese if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do my best . MAC GREGOR Do n't take too long , Johnny . I 'm five thousand miles from home . p. 10 JOHNNY I 'll run all the way , Mr. MacGregor . ALEXANDER ( For the amusement of the good Lord ) If you find any money on the way , remember we go fifty-fifty . JOHNNY ( Delighted with the comedy ) All right , Pa . ( JOHNNY runs down the street ) The inside of Mr. Kosak 's Grocery Store . MR . KOSAK is sleeping on his folded arms when JOHNNY runs into the store . MR . KOSAK lifts his head . He is a fine , gentle , serious man with a big , blond , old-fashioned mustache . He shakes his head trying to waken . JOHNNY ( The diplomat , as it were ) Mr. Kosak , if you were in China and did n't have a friend in the world and no money , you 'd expect somebody over there to give you a pound of rice , would n't you ? MR . KOSAK What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . You 'd expect some member of the Aryan race to help you out a little , would n't you , Mr. Kosak ? MR . KOSAK How much money you got ? JOHNNY It 's not a question of money , Mr. Kosak . I 'm talking about being in China . p. 11 MR . KOSAK I do n't know nothing about nothing . JOHNNY How would you feel in China that way , Mr. Kosak ? MR . KOSAK I do n't know , Johnny . What would I be doing in China ? JOHNNY Well , you 'd be visiting there . You 'd be hungry and five thousand miles from home and not a friend in the world . You would n't expect everybody to turn you away without even a pound of rice , would you , Mr. Kosak ? MR . KOSAK I guess not , but you ai n't in China , Johnny , and neither is your Pa . You or your Pa 's got to go out and work sometime in your lives , so you might as well start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more groceries on credit because I know you wo n't pay me . JOHNNY Mr. Kosak , you misunderstand me . This is 1914 , not 1913 . I 'm not talking about a few groceries . I 'm talking about all them heathen people around you in China , and you hungry and dying . MR . KOSAK This ai n't China . You got to go out and make your living in this country . Everybody 's got to work in America . JOHNNY Mr. Kosak , suppose it was a loaf of bread and a pound of cheese you needed to keep you alive in the world , would you hesitate to ask a Christian missionary for these things ? p. 12 MR . KOSAK Yes , I would . I would be ashamed to ask . JOHNNY Even if you knew you would give him back two loaves of bread and two pounds of cheese instead of one loaf and one pound ? Even then , Mr. Kosak ? MR . KOSAK Even then . JOHNNY Do n't be that way , Mr. Kosak . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing that would happen to you would be death . You 'd die out there in China , Mr. Kosak . MR . KOSAK I would n't care if I would . You and your Pa have got to pay for bread and cheese . Why do n't your Pa go out and get a job ? JOHNNY ( Swift abandonment of the intellectual attack for the human one ) Mr. Kosak , how are you ? MR . KOSAK I 'm fine , Johnny . How are you ? JOHNNY Could n't be better , Mr. Kosak . How are the children ? MR . KOSAK They 're all fine , Johnny . Stepan is beginning to walk now . JOHNNY That 's great . How 's Angela ? MR . KOSAK Angela 's beginning to sing . How 's your Grandmother ? JOHNNY She 's fine . She 's beginning to sing too . She says she 'd rather be an opera singer than Queen of England . How 's your wife Martha , Mr. Kosak ? p. 13 MR . KOSAK Oh , swell . JOHNNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that everything is fine at your house . I know Stepan is going to be a great man some day . MR . KOSAK I hope so . I 'm going to send him to high school and see that he gets every chance I did n't get . I do n't want him to have trouble all his life , too . JOHNNY I have great faith in Stepan , Mr. Kosak . MR . KOSAK What do you want , Johnny , and how much money you got ? JOHNNY Mr Kosak , you know I did n't come here to buy anything . You know I enjoy a quiet philosophical chat with you every now and then . ( Quickly , pleading ) Let me have a loaf of French bread and a pound of cheese . MR . KOSAK You got to pay cash , Johnny . JOHNNY And Esther ? How is your beautiful daughter Esther ? MR . KOSAK She 's all right , Johnny , but you got to pay cash . You and your Pa are the worst citizens in this county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kosak . Jasper MacGregor is visiting our house . He 's a great actor . p. 14 MR . KOSAK Never heard of him . JOHNNY And a bottle of beer for Mr. MacGregor . MR . KOSAK I ca n't give you a bottle of beer . JOHNNY Sure , you can . MR . KOSAK I ca n't . I 'll let you have one loaf of French bread and a pound of cheese , but that 's all . What kind of work does your Pa do when he works , Johnny ? JOHNNY My father writes poetry , Mr. Kosak . That 's the only work my father does . He 's one of the greatest writers of poetry in the world . MR . KOSAK When does he get any money ? JOHNNY He never gets any money . You ca n't have your cake and eat it too . MR . KOSAK I do n't like that kind of work . Why does n't your Pa work like everybody else , Johnny ? JOHNNY He works harder than everybody else . My father works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KOSAK hands JOHNNY a loaf of French bread and a pound of cheese ) MR . KOSAK Well , that 's fifty-five cents you owe me , Johnny . I 'll let you have some stuff this time , but never again . p. 15 JOHNNY ( At the door ) Tell Esther I love her . ( JOHNNY runs out of the store . MR . KOSAK swings at a fly , misses , swings again , misses , and , objecting to the world in this manner , he chases the fly all around the store , swinging with all his might ) The house . JOHNNY 'S FATHER and the old man are looking down the street to see if JOHNNY is coming back with food . His GRANDMOTHER is standing on the porch also eager to know if there is to be food . MAC GREGOR I think he 's got some food with him . ALEXANDER ( With pride ) Of course he has . ( He waves at the old lady on the porch who runs into the house to set the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew you 'd do it . MAC GREGOR So did I. JOHNNY He says we got to pay him fifty-five cents . He says he 's not going to give us any more stuff on credit . ALEXANDER That 's his opinion . What did you talk about ? JOHNNY First I talked about being hungry and at death 's door in China . Then I inquired about the family . p. 16 ALEXANDER How is everyone ? JOHNNY Fine . I did n't find any money , though . Not even a penny . ALEXANDER Oh , that 's all right . Money is n't everything . ( They go into the house ) The living room . They are all at the table after supper . MAC GREGOR finds crumbs here and there which he places delicately in his mouth . He looks around the room to see if there is n't something more to eat . MAC GREGOR That green can up there , Johnny . What 's in there ? JOHNNY Marbles . MAC GREGOR That cupboard , Johnny . Anything edible in there ? JOHNNY Crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnny . What 's delectable in there ? JOHNNY I got a gopher snake in that jar . MAC GREGOR Well , I could go for a bit of boiled gopher snake in a big way , Johnny . JOHNNY ( Defiantly , protector of animals ) Nothing doing , Mr. MacGregor . MAC GREGOR Why not , Johnny ? Why the hell not , son ? I hear of fine Borneo natives eating snakes and grasshoppers . You have n't got a half dozen fat grasshoppers around , have you , Johnny ? p. 17 JOHNNY Only four . MAC GREGOR Well , trot them out , son , and after we 've had our fill , I 'll play " Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes " for you . I 'm mighty hungry , Johnny . JOHNNY So am I , but I do n't want anybody killing them innocent animals . They got rights the same as anybody else . ALEXANDER ( To MAC GREGOR ) How about a little music ? I think the boy would be delighted . JOHNNY ( Leaping to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREGOR All right , Johnny . Bread . Bread . My God , how savagely it quarrels with the heart . ( MAC GREGOR gets up and begins to blow into the bugle . He blows louder and more beautifully and mournfully than anybody ever blew into a bugle . Eighteen NEIGHBORS gather in front of the house and cheer when he finishes the solo : " Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes " ) ALEXANDER ( Delighted , for amusement ) I want you to meet your public . ( They go out on the porch ) The house . The crowd is looking up at JOHNNY 'S FATHER , MAC GREGOR and JOHNNY . p. 18 ALEXANDER Good neighbors , and friends , I want you to meet Jasper MacGregor , the greatest Shakespearean actor of our day . ( Pause ) I believe . MAC GREGOR ( The actor ) I remember my first appearance in London in 1851 as if it was yesterday . I was a boy of fourteen from the slums of Glasgow . My first part was a courier in a play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no lines to speak , but moved about a good deal , running from officer to officer , and from lover to his beloved , and back again , over and over again . APLEY ( Regretfully interrupting the great speech ) How about another song , Mr. MacGregor ? MAC GREGOR Have you got an egg at your house ? APLEY I sure have . I 've got a dozen eggs at my house . MAC GREGOR Would it be convenient for you to go and get one of them dozen eggs ? When you return I 'll play a song that will make your heart leap with joy and grief . APLEY I 'm on my way already . ( He goes ) MAC GREGOR ( To the crowd ) My friends , I should be delighted to play another song for you on this golden-throated bugle , but time and distance from home find me weary . If you will be so good as to go , each of you to his home , and return in a moment with some morsel of food , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song I know will change the course of each of your lives , and change it , mind you , for the better . ( The people go . The last to go is ESTHER KOSAK , who hears the speech out then runs . MAC GREGOR , JOHNNY 'S FATHER , and JOHNNY sit on the steps and remain in silence , and one by one the people return , bringing food to MAC GREGOR : an egg , a sausage , a dozen green onions , two kinds of cheese , butter , two kinds of bread , boiled potatoes , fresh tomatoes , a melon , tea , and many other good things to eat ) Thank you , my friends , thank you . ( He stands solemnly , waiting for absolute silence , straightens himself , looks about him furiously , lifts the bugle to his lips and is irritated by the swift and noisy return of ESTHER KOSAK , bringing an eggplant . When there is silence , he plays " My Heart 's in the Highlands , My Heart is not Here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go away . MAC GREGOR turns to the father and son ) ( Grandly ) Sir , if it is all the same to you I should like to dwell in your house for a long time to come . p. 19 ALEXANDER ( Delighted and amazed ) Sir , my house is your house . ( They go into the house ) The living room . Eighteen days later , MAC GREGOR is lying on the floor , face up , asleep . JOHNNY is walking about quietly in the room , looking at everybody . His FATHER is at the table , writing poetry . His GRANDMOTHER is sitting in the rocking chair , rocking . There is a knock on the door . Everybody but MAC GREGOR jumps up and runs to it . ALEXANDER ( At the door ) Yes ? CARMICHAEL I am looking for Jasper MacGregor , the actor . ALEXANDER What do you want ? JOHNNY Well , ask him in anyway , Pa . ALEXANDER Yes , of course . Excuse me . Wo n't you please come in ? ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am from the Old People 's Home . I have been sent to bring Mr. MacGregor home . MAC GREGOR ( Wakening and sitting up ) Home ?

Who is this young man ? p. 20 CARMICHAEL Mr. MacGregor , I 'm Philip Carmichael , from the Old People 's Home . They 've sent me to bring you back . We are putting on our annual show in two weeks and need you for the leading role . MAC GREGOR ( Getting up with the help of JOHNNY 'S FATHER and JOHNNY ) What kind of a part is it ? I ca n't be playing young adventurers any longer . CARMICHAEL The part is King Lear , Mr. MacGregor . It is perfect for you . MAC GREGOR ( The actor , with a job again ) Good-by , my beloved friends .

Good-by . ( The OLD MAN and the YOUNG MAN leave the house.There is a moment of silence , full of regret and loneliness ) ALEXANDER ( Hungry , loudly ) Johnny , go on down to Mr. Kosak 's store and get a little something to eat . I know you can do it , Johnny . Get ANYTHING . JOHNNY ( Hungry , loudly , and angry ) Mr. Kosak wants eighty-five cents . He wo n't give us anything more without money . p. 21 ALEXANDER Go on down there , Johnny . You know you can get that fine Slovak gentleman to give us a little something to eat . JOHNNY ( With despair ) Aw , Pa . ALEXANDER ( Amazed , roaring ) What ? You , my son , in a mood like that . Come on . I fought the world this way before you were born . After you were born we fought it together , and we 're going to go on fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that 's all . Nothing is going to stop us , Johnny . Go on down there now and get us something to eat . JOHNNY All right , Pa . I 'll do my best . ( He runs to the door ) The house . It now has a large sign : " For Rent . " It is a moment before daybreak of a day early in November , 1914 . There is a suggestion of Winter coming . High in the sky a flock of geese flying south make their call . JOHNNY is sitting on the steps of the front porch with his chin in his hand . He hears the geese , listening carefully , leaps to his feet and looks into the sky for them . The sound decreases , then ends . JOHNNY goes back to the steps of the porch and sits down . As the sun rises , a big solemn smile comes over his face . He looks out of the corner of his eye at the morning 's light as if it were a quiet friend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light increases , this play between JOHNNY and the sun grows , like a theme of music , bringing him to his feet , turning his face to the light . He lifts his arms , and very solemnly begins turning somersaults . He then runs around the house lickety-split and returns on the other side , almost dancing.A freight train goes by not far enough away not to make the earth tremble.The light of morning increases.A newspaper route carrier arrives on foot , whistling.He is the typical small-town morning route carrier : about thirteen years old . He is in that somber and dignified state which comes over men who have done their work . His paper bags are empty . Night is over . His daily wage has been earned . The papers have been left at the doors of the readers . Another day has come to the world . He has walked two hours through dark streets to morning . The song he is whistling is soft and full of understanding . It is a song of his own composition , a morning song . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY ( Stopping ) Hello . JOHNNY What was that song ?

JOHNNY I wish I could whistle . HENRY Anybody can whistle . JOHNNY I ca n't . How do you do it ? HENRY There 's no how to it . You just whistle . JOHNNY How ? HENRY Like this . ( He whistles a moment , obviously improvising , a tour de force of technique ) JOHNNY ( With admiration ) I wish I could do that . p. 23 HENRY ( Pleased and eager to make an even better impression ) That was nothing . Listen to this . ( He gives the melody a sort of counterpoint , two tones , and a bit of syncopation ) JOHNNY Ca n't you teach me to do that ? HENRY You ca n't teach whistling . You just do it . This is another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsboy 's style , but keeps it soft ) JOHNNY ( Trying to whistle ) Like that ? HENRY That 's the way to start . Keep it up and after a while your mouth 'll take the right shape and you 'll be whistling before you know it . JOHNNY Honest ? HENRY Sure . JOHNNY Is your mother dead ? HENRY How did you know ? JOHNNY My mother 's dead too . HENRY Yeah ? JOHNNY ( With a sigh ) Yeah . She died . HENRY I do n't remember my mother . Do you remember your mother ? p. 24 JOHNNY I do n't exactly remember her . Sometimes I dream about her , though . HENRY I used to , too . JOHNNY Do n't you any more ? HENRY ( Disillusioned ) Naaaah . What good does that do you ? JOHNNY My mother sure is beautiful .

I 'm adopted . JOHNNY What 's an orphanage ? HENRY That 's a kind of a place where kids that ai n't got any mothers and fathers live until somebody adopts them . p. 25 JOHNNY What do you mean , adopts ? HENRY Somebody who wants a boy or girl comes to the orphanage and looks everybody over and goes away with whoever they like . If they pick you , you go and stay with them . JOHNNY Do you like that ? HENRY It 's all right . ( THE BOY puts away the ball ) JOHNNY What 's your name ? HENRY Henry . What 's yours ? JOHNNY Johnny . HENRY Do you want a paper ? There 's a War in Europe .

We bought a chicken and a lot of stamps and paper and envelopes . The chicken would n't lay eggs , though , so my grandmother killed it and cooked it for us . Did you ever eat chicken ? p. 26 HENRY Sure . I guess I 've eaten chicken six or seven times . JOHNNY What are you going to do when you grow up ? HENRY Shucks . I do n't know . I do n't know what I 'll do . JOHNNY ( Proudly ) I 'm going to be a poet , like my father . He said so . HENRY I guess I 'll carry a paper route for a while . ( He moves to go ) Well . So long .

( THE BOY goes , whistling . JOHNNY tosses the folded paper up on the porch , and sits down again on the steps.His GRANDMOTHER comes out on the porch with a broom and begins to sweep ) p. 27 JOHNNY 'S GRANDMOTHER ( In Armenian , which is the only language she speaks , with the exception of Turkish , Kurdish , and a little Arabic , which nobody around seems to know ) How are you , my heart ?

JOHNNY ( To his GRANDMOTHER ) He 's fine . ( Louder to his FATHER ) The old lady wanted to know . ALEXANDER ( In Armenian , to the old lady ) Good light , Ma .

I may not be able to turn a somersault as well as you , but if you want to know what kind of an athlete I am , just read the poetry I wrote yesterday . JOHNNY Is it really good , Pa ? p. 29 ALEXANDER Good ? ( He leaps to his feet , like an acrobat ) It 's great . I 'm going to send it to The Atlantic Monthly , too . JOHNNY Oh , I forgot , Pa .

JOHNNY 'S GRANDMOTHER ( Shaking her head sadly ) Ahkh , ahkh , the poor old prisoner . p. 31 JOHNNY Is it like a prison , Pa ? ALEXANDER I do n't know for sure , Johnny . JOHNNY 'S GRANDMOTHER ( Furiously , the way her son and grandson speak when they are irritated ) Why does n't he come back and stay here where he belongs ? ( She goes into the house ) JOHNNY That 's right , Pa . Why does n't Mr. MacGregor come back and stay here ? Does he have to stay in that place ? ALEXANDER If you 're an old , old man , Johnny , and have n't got any people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sure get lonesome for him sometimes . Do n't you , Pa ? ALEXANDER To tell you the truth , Johnny , I do . JOHNNY I 'm always remembering him , especially the music . And the way he drinks water . ALEXANDER He 's a great man . JOHNNY Is his heart really in the highlands like he said , Pa ? ALEXANDER Not exactly . JOHNNY Is he really five thousand miles from home , too ? ALEXANDER At least that many . p. 32 JOHNNY Do you think he 'll ever get home again some day ? ALEXANDER He 's an old man , Johnny . He will . JOHNNY You mean he 'll take a train and a boat and get back where the highlands are ? ALEXANDER Not that , Johnny . It 's a little different from that . He 'll die . JOHNNY Is that the only way a man gets home ? ALEXANDER That 's the only way .

( JOHNNY 'S FATHER jumps to his feet , dropping the paper ) JOHNNY Do you think maybe we 'll get a letter from New York with a check in it maybe ? ALEXANDER I do n't know , Johnny . ( MR . WILEY , riding a bicycle , arrives . He is almost knocked off the bicycle by JOHNNY and JOHNNY 'S FATHER ) p. 33 MR . WILEY ( Getting off the bicycle as if it were a horse ) Good morning , Mr. Alexander . ALEXANDER Good morning , Mr. Wiley . JOHNNY Any mail for us , Mr. Wiley ? MR .

MR . WILEY ( Holding a flat envelope ) Yes , it is , Johnny . Well , Mr. Alexander , it looks like Winter 's coming again . The geese were flying this morning . ALEXANDER ( Excited , tense , yet eager to be casual ) Yes , I know . ( To himself ) I know . I know . JOHNNY If I ever get a letter from New York I 'm going to save it up . MR . WILEY ( He wants to talk ) How are things , Mr. Alexander ? ALEXANDER I 've been lucky in my work , thank you , Mr. Wiley. p. 34 JOHNNY My father was in New York once . Were n't you , Pa ? ALEXANDER Yes , I was , Johnny . How is your family , Mr. Wiley ? MR . WILEY All fine , except the littlest one , Joe . He 's always crying . That 's one thing I ca n't stand either , a baby crying all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it makes me lose all faith in everything . When Joe cries I say to myself , Aw , what 's the use ?

I ca n't understand how I , your father , can be so scared . p. 35 JOHNNY You do n't sound scared , Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Atlantic Monthly all right . You remember them poems I wrote after Mr. MacGregor was here ? JOHNNY Maybe they 've bought the poems . ALEXANDER Bought them , my eye . They do n't buy poetry , Johnny . They scare you to death .

Why do n't you open it ? ALEXANDER ( Roaring ) I 'm scared , I tell you . I 'm scared and ashamed . Those poems were great . How can it be that I 'm scared ? JOHNNY ( Also defiant ) Do n't be scared , Pa . ALEXANDER ( Angry ) Why do they clamor for all things but the best ? Why do they destroy themselves running after things of death , and thrust aside all things of life ? I ca n't understand it . There 's no hope for anybody . JOHNNY Sure there is , Pa .

It is equally obvious that he ca n't believe the poems have come back . It is obvious too that the poems are great , because the man is . He paces about like a tiger . He seems to be speaking to the world , even though his lips are set . At last he tears the envelope open , in a fury . The envelope falls . He unfolds the manuscript of poems . A slip of white , heavy paper falls to the floor of the porch .

Declare War on one another . Take the people by the thousands and mangle them . Their poor hearts and their poor spirits and their poor bodies . Give them ugliness . Pollute their dreams . Horrify them . Distort them with hatred for one another . Befoul the legend of the living , you maniacs whose greatness is measured by the number you destroy .

JOHNNY 'S FATHER is on the steps of the porch , smiling : a foolish , tragic , desolate , lonely smile . Everything is the same ; the manuscript of poems is on the ground ; the envelope is on the porch . The newspaper too . It is several hours later . p. 37 ALEXANDER ( Shaking his head foolishly , unable to accept the truth ) Johnny . ( Pause . A little louder ) Johnny . ( Pause , softer this time ) Johnny .

Taking the boy 's arm ) No , Johnny . ( He pauses , obviously trying to find words with which to explain about themselves and the grocer ) Johnny ? I thought we 'd be getting some money . I did n't think it would be this way . Now , go on inside and eat . JOHNNY ( Going up the stairs ) You got to eat , too .

CUNNINGHAM ( Coming up to JOHNNY 'S FATHER , extending his hand , while the others stand back in a group ) Remember me ? I put up the " For Rent " sign . ALEXANDER ( Rising ) I remember . How do you do . MR . CUNNINGHAM ( Embarrassed ) Well . Mr. Corey , the owner of the house , is out of town , and these people are looking for a house . Right away . p. 39 ALEXANDER Of course . I can leave any time . Have they furniture ? MR . CUNNINGHAM ( Turning to the poor family ) Have you furniture ? THE HUSBAND No . ALEXANDER ( To the family ) You can have my furniture .

The furniture 's worth about that much . You can let these people have it till Mr. Corey gets back . ( To the family ) Do you want to go through the house ? THE HUSBAND It looks all right . MR . CUNNINGHAM ( Going ) Then that 's settled . ( To the people ) The rent 's six dollars a month . We pay the water . p. 40 ALEXANDER ( To the people ) You can move in any time .

JOHNNY When would it be stealing ? ALEXANDER ( Tossing it off like nothing ) The way I see it , Johnny , stealing is where there 's unnecessary damage or cruelty to an innocent one , so that there may be undeserved profit or power to one who is not innocent . p. 43 JOHNNY Oh . ( Pause ) Well , if it is n't stealing , Pa , I guess I 'll go get some more . ( He gets up ) They 'll be all gone pretty soon .

ALEXANDER What are you talking about ? What farmer 's dog ? JOHNNY The farmer 's dog that chased me all the way here . ALEXANDER ( Roaring ) Dog ? Do you mean to tell me a dog chased you ? What kind of a dog ? JOHNNY I did n't get a chance to take a good look , but I guess it 's a great big one . ALEXANDER ( Very angry at this awful humiliation ) Did the God damn thing try to bite you or anything , Johnny ? JOHNNY I do n't think so , Pa , but I thought it was going to any minute .
