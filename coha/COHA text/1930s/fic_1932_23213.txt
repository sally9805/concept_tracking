VACUUM CLEANERS A STORY V IOLET HACKETT sat and reread the end of Mr. Askew 's letter and tore the letter slowly across . , , I will not have time to return and say good-by to you all as the boat goes Wednesday and there is not another for a fortnight . I enjoyed my time in Louth and wish in many ways I did not have to leave . But this appointment has really more prospects . My remembrances to Lady Hackett and your father and cheerio to yourself . ( 1 daresay I shall find you settled down when I get back ! ) With all good wishes , Truly yours , Edmund Askew . The consciously dramatic gesture expressed a real pain . Through the whole of her large , warm-skinned , corseted body she felt a disappointment that probed and sickened and brought tears to her eyes . She sat there in the conservatory where she had settled to read his letter  --  plunked on a white bench in a thicket of palms , aspidistras , cinerarias , and ferns , her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and too ornate , her high-colored face tinted with a green bloom by the filtered light of blinds drawn across the glass roof  --  and realized that she had been building on Mr. Askew 's intentions ; and he 'd either never had any or had changed his mind . Every day he 'd come , the last two months . Sometimes only to play whist of course , but still he 'd come . Even mother had passed a remark . And then  --  three weeks ago , at the Leslies ' dance . A nice man like Mr. Askew did n't do that kind of thing unless he . . . holding her hand . ... She remembered the insistent clasp of his fingers , and then the heat of his palm against the back of her neck , walking as far as the end of the garden with her .. . and then . . kissing her , in " that way " so that she felt all queer . .. . And she 'd been so sure he would n't , being a gentleman , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd counted on his speaking soon , after that ; waited , feeling pretty certain ( and remembering at night , lying awake , the way he 'd kissed her , so that she felt all queer again and turned restlessly to and fro as if she were feverish ) . Thirty-four she was now . Thirty-four . . . Of course there 'd been several men in the last fifteen years , but she 'd refused to bother with them . There were n't many of her sort in the town . None of them had got so far , naturally , as Mr. Askew . She was n't like a lot of girls in the town  --  letting men kiss her and carry on . None of them had kissed her . No one since  --  since Dick  --  when she was still at the High School and they lived in the old house in Peck Street , and she and Dick used to go down to the docks and hide about in one of the warehouses or go off to the pictures .. . . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying on in the old house , with Molly doing all the housework and cooking and Dick 's people living in just the same sort of house down the street . And then Dad got his knighthood . She 'd never forget the day he came in to supper and said to mother , " Well , your ladyship " ? pulling in his chair and taking several radishes out of the dish . Sumner stopped the car again outside the next gate . A white gate this time with HAZELHURST painted in black letters on each of the gateposts and a yellow gravel drive beyond flanked by laurel bushes . The drive curved so that the house was hidden . He got out , locked the car , and went through the gate . It swung and shut itself after him . He walked up the middle of the drive because he had an impulse to skirt the side by the thick ribbon of turf and the laurels . A white notice board started up from the foliage with BEWARE OF THE DOG on it in black letters . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really more treacherous . One was always warned against simple dangers . ) He came in sight of the house . A bulky house of blackish-red brick flanked symmetrically by glasshouses . It looked like a bumble bee , he thought , brooding and formless with translucent wings . The gravel drive widened in front of the house to a semicircle edged by a continuous bed of pink and scarlet geraniums . On the lawn on the farther side of the drive was some rustic furniture with smooth twisted limbs ; and a red-and-white sunshade over six feet high rooted into the ground like a toadstool . Three semicircular steps rose to a Tudor front door in fumed oak . There was a bowl marked DOG CM the sideopposite to the shoescraper and a bell-pull with a copper chain and a china handle inscribed PULL in black letters . If Sumner had not been hot and discouraged and secretly convinced that no one really needed a Premier Vacuum Cleaner , he would have amused himself , as he often did , by guessing the inmates of the house . Often after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , describing curtains , imitating parlornmicls , haughty ladies with dusters knotted at four corners on their heads . .. . But this trip was making him nervous . Only two " P. V. C. 's " sold in the last ten days . People were feeling poor . Either had one , of some other make , or got on without it . Even installments did not tempt them . And if he lost the job . . . The P.V.C. Company had taken him on because he was what old Briggs called a " Varsity Man . " But mostly now that counted against you . And Jinnie could never be sure of translation work . The Tudor door was opened by a butler . Sumner put his heels together and leaned forward to hand a card . " I wonder if I might see the lady of the house ? " The butler , a young man with sparse black hair and a bilious complexion , looked Sumner over . Then he took the card and read it slowly . Then he handed it slowly back , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur underling . He observed the details of Sumner 's clothes , his well-cut gray flannel suit , his cheap shoes . " ' Er ladyship is out ! " " I might wait . I should very much like to show her . . " " It wo n't be worth while your waiting . " " Is there a housekeeper I could see ? " " There is n't . " The man stepped back to shut the door . " And anee-way ' er ladyship wo n't be interested . " A shrill woman 's voice interrupted VACUUM him from the hall beyond . " Half a minute , Collier ! " The butler stepped back , still holding the inner handle of the door . Sumner saw a girl come forward out of the shadow of the oak-panelled hall . She came with the half-rolling , half-jerky gait of a big female on high French heels . She must have been listening to them . But she said " What d' you want ? " mincing her vowel sounds and looking at him with hot pale blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oiled . " As a matter of fact I 've called from The Premier Vacuum Cleaner Company , as I should very much like to show you our Vacuum Cleaners . There 's absolutely no obligation of course . I simply demonstrate on one of your carpets  --  or upholstery ? An unbelievably low price considering the quality .. . " She was watching his face . She cut him short . " You can come and show me , " she said , " as my mother is out . " She had come to the front step now and stood full in the sunlight . Her hair was tan color and waved hard and close to her head , fastened with an enamel clip on one side . Her face , dull-nosed , heavy-chinned , had a sort of rich primmed-up beauty . Her pallidly burning blue eyes were redeemed from primal stupidity by the alert and metallic gentility of her expression . He said , " If you 'll excuse me a minute I 'll go back to the car and get the contraption . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned and ran down the gravel drive . He opened the white gate and got into the car and drove it up to the front door . She was still on the step  --  her blue silk dress strained to the curves of her body , the buckles of her shoes flashing in the sun . Two minutes in the sunbaked car made him sweat . He wiped his forehead before getting out , conscious of her stare on his movements . " Just bring it in , " she said . The butler had gone , and she seemed less self-conscious . " You can just as well show me , " she said , her hand , with big pale fingers like German asparagus patting at the tan waves of her hair . " Of course mother bosses the show here , but I daresay I shall have a home of my own one of these days . " He smiled amicably on the side of his face near her , while he lifted the cleaner out of the back of the car . " You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her into the hall and perceiving deer 's heads aloft and smelling a house without fragrance , without aroma , without age  --  the smell merely of polish and pot-plants in brass bowls . " We 'll go in the drawing-room , " she said , and they passed from brownness to pinkness and whiteness and silver frames and windows bridally shrouded in lace . He felt her gaze on him again as he looked around . " We 've just had it changed , " she said . " It used to be blue . I like it better like this . Dad 's Christmas present to mother as a matter of fact . " " Jolly , " he said , peering round the wainscotting for a socket for the plug . " What did you say the name of the firm you come from was ? " she asked , suddenly standoffish . " The Premier Vacuum Cleaner Company . " " Never heard of them . " " Oh , they 're very well known . " " You been with ' em long ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent people . " She was silent while he fixed the plug into the socket beside the marble fireplace . He began : " The great advantage of these cleaners . . . " He went on ; he knew it so that it said itself . If he were ever to be delirious he would say , " And can be easily carried from room to room , packed away into the smallest possible space . . etc. , etc . " A canary in a cage behind the lace curtains gave a sudden chirruping bugle-call . Outside , far across the lawn , the noise of a motor mower began steadily bruising the afternoon . He bent down and switched on the current . Low steady moaning filled the room . " . . . and you 'd be surprised how much dirt is actually sucked up within five to ten minutes from a carpet that you would imagine was being kept perfectly clean . In a minute I will demonstrate to you . " . .. He spoke loudly now , spacing his words so that they fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the time she stared at him , at his face , his lips as they moved , his hand as it grasped the handle of the machine . The noise made her seem isolated , like someone near in a high wind . He had an impression of her round pink underlip and the sunburn rash , powdered over , on her collar bones . He wondered what her life could be in this shop-made house , with no books on all the tables and no flowers to arrange , and a butler who was " beneath " her and with whom she felt ill at ease . What were her parents ? He turned off the switch . " . . . and now you see , even in three minutes over a few square feet of carpet one can accumulate an extraordinary amount of dust and dirt . " He saw her snap in the word and pronunciation of " accumulate . " . . . That must be her father in the large tinted photograph hung over the piano . A shrewd little nut of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had his eyelids and the same slightly stuck-forward pose of head . She had it particularly now , standing before him and saying , " It seems pretty good . " He urged , " You 'll have no reason to regret ordering one . MI our customers are delighted with it . " ( And only two in the last fortnight . ) He added , " I should very much like to show you our process of cleaning upholstery , curtains , and so forth . " " What is it ? " She was ladylike again , rubbing under the tip of her nose with a handkerchief , her other hand resting against her corseted hipline . He got the nozzle out of the box and began to fit it to the machine . As he did so he said , " I should very much like your mother herself to see this . I suppose she wo n't be in soon , will she ? " " Not till four thirty , I expect . " She was offended . Then she flung off . rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ignore , " Are n't I good enough ? " He did take it , with annoyance . " My dear Miss . . " Hhhackett , " she said , pouting and pursing her mouth . " Miss Hackett  --  I only felt that perhaps it was  --  I was wasting your time . " " My time 's me own to waste , is n't it ? " " Well , if you 're so kind . " The canary screamed several times . He finished fixing the nozzle . " Not , " she primmed , " that there 's too many people round here that you do want to know . Nice people I mean . Of course I was talking to a gentleman at a dinner party only last week and he said , ' It 's the same in all manufacturing places . The nice people move out to the country . ' " " Yes , " he said . The noise of the mower came steadily nearer to the windows . Between the festooned lace he watched a vista of the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you asking ? " " Seven pounds fifteen complete  --  or we are quite willing to arrange monthly payments . " " Of course that would n't be necessary . " " Of course , " he agreed , standing ready for the second demonstration . VACUUM She said bruskly , " I think I 'll get you to show me how that works up in my own room . It needs a thorough turning out and you 'll be able to test the thing there . Bring it up . " She turned , and he followed her back into the hall and up the oak staircase . She said over her shoulder but without looking round : " D' you like this job ? " " It 's very interesting . " She led him across a thickly carpeted landing into a bedroom furnished with a " suite of gray walnut " hung with lilac silk curtains edged with silver braid . The " Louis XV " panelling of the walls was filled in with a watered silk shading down from purple through lilac and pale pink to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantelpiece hung a colored reproduction of Leighton 's " Flaming June . " The lady 's proportions , Sumner supposed , consoled Miss Hackett for her own . " You might try the Recameer sofa for a start , " she said . She moved two cushions from it , and a leggy doll with peroxide wig and kohl-rimmed eyes . " There 's a switch just behind it , " she added . Standing with her back to the bed and clasping the perverse-faced doll , she looked like a symbolic picture of motherhood by a bad artist . " Progress gives Birth to Perversity " thought Sumner , bending to fix the switch and smiling for a second ; for she seemed likely to order one , and that would be something to report to old Briggs and Jinnie . He switched on . Moaning filled the room . He pushed the nozzle to and fro over the sofa , dug into corners and the crevices of the upholstery . She went to each window in turn and pulled the blinds three-quarters down . He saw her saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abrupt quiet she repeated , " I only said the sun would ruin the carpets . The head housemaid 's away ( her mother 's sister died yesterday ) , and everything 's thoroughlee neglected . " She came and stood again between him and the bed . He showed her the dust pocket . " You see how effectual it is . " He prepared to switch on again but she stopped him . " All right . I believe you . It seems pretty good . " He could n't in the new half-light see her expression , but he thought she was , somehow , at a loss . His hand went to his pocket , for the order book . " Of course , " she said , " I ca n't decide . But I daresay I could get mother to . She 'll do almost anything for me  --  since Grace went away . ( She 's my sister . She married last November . A Mr. White . Such a nice man . They live in Bristol now . ) " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother . Perhaps I might call again when she 's in . " She said , I daresay . " Then , " Look here , it does seem funny , your being in this kind of job . What made you take it up ? " He felt himself redden . " Partly vocation perhaps . " He saw that she did n't understand . She simply went on , " What 's your name ? " " Sumner . Richard Sumner . " " You look pretty young . " " I 'm thirty-two . " " I liked your voice when I heard it , just now downstairs at the front door . I think voices mean a lot , do n't you ? " " I suppose so . " " And faces too . Do n't you think ? I like people to have refined faces . Specially men . " She added , " I 'm very particular about men . Some men are such brutes , are n't they ? " " Are they ? " said Sumner , wondering how soon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She gave a rich giggle which ended in a series of high uncertain notes . " Well , some of them , anyway . .. . Sit down for a minute and perhaps mother 'll be along . She ought to be in soon now . " Sumner leaned the cleaner against the brass fireguard and sat down on the sofa . After a momentary hesitation she sat opposite him on the edge of the bed . She disposed the folds of her skirt in various ways , then rubbed her nose with her handkerchief , then remarked once more in her tight voice : " Of course if I did n't see that you 're not quite the ordinary run of traveler I would n't be talking to you like this . I do n't like travelers as a rule . But I could tell immediately that you were n't the ordinary kind . " " It 's very kind of you . But I 'm perfectly bona-fide . " " Go on . I know a gentleman when I see one . " She added , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose you do it to make a living ? " " Selling these things ? " Yes . " She looked in the glass . He watched her reflection . It looked queer in the under-water light of the room . Her look met his in the mirror . She simpered : " You must have a lot of lady clients . " " Women mostly buy the cleaner , " he said , elaborately patient . She turned her back to the dressing table and stood , bulky and irresolute , polishing the nails of her right hand against the palm of her left . " While their husbands are out , I expect . " Her giggle quacked out abruptly . Her face was half in shadow , but he had an impression that she had n't smiled . The lawn mower started again under the window , drilling into the very nerves of the room , and he raised his voice to ask : " What time did you say your mother would he back ? " and knew himself cornered by " You seem quite nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have laughed at himself  --  trapped with this great perfumed cow ( if she were n't exasperating him so ) . " You are n't nervous of me , are you ? " " My dear  --  Miss Hackett ? " She was standing above him now , so that if he were to get up from the sofa they would be close , face to face . " What did you say ? " she shouted . He made a deprecatory gesture . She bent over him , " That mower ! " He turned the order book over in his fingers . She glanced at it , then at his face again . " If I was to order one of them ? " Her words clinked down to him like big sharp coins . " I might even give Dad and Mother one for their anniversary ( wedding anniversary ) next month . " The mower was retreating now , and he could interrupt in his normal voice : " I can have one delivered to you within three to five days . " She stood upright now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanting down at . him . " I might an ' I might n't , " she said . He shifted to the left along the sofa and got up . She veered to face him . " Not that I 've decided , " she was saying  --  and saying in the same sultry voice . " I like your suit . " She felt the sleeve . Her hand moved up his arm and rested on his shoulder . He decided not to retreat . He looked at the bridge of her nose and counted five freckles . She waited . He put his right hand on her waist and felt her constricted body thudding like an electric train in a station . " You are a one , " she brought out , with dry-lipped coquetry . He moved his hand round her waist . Abruptly her bulk unstiffened , clamped itself against him with a clumsy exasperated voluptuousness . As her hand pulled against the back of his neck he ob-VACUUM served his ironical intention lose its edge , soften into sensation , and harden suddenly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roundness and innocence of paint , and went on kissing , fascinated by her genteel scent of violet-talc and mild perspiration , by the animalism and intermittent prudery which made her embrace , in that minute or so , a quintessence of feminine courtship . . . Speculatively and because she was heavy , he drew her down beside him on the edge of the bed . She reacted as he had foreseen . She banged to her feet and began to tidy her hair . He was relieved ; and dimly infuriated . He took out his handkerchief , wiped his mouth , and blew his nose while she was saying that he 'd " got a nerve . " " And I suppose you think I let any young fellow behave like this , " she panted , going to the mirror : and he watched her waggle her behind angrily and stare at herself . He got up and went over to the cleaner . " I 'd better be going , " he said . He began to pack it up . " Is that all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . She had blots of powder on , and her mouth and nostrils were twitching . " I 'm sorry , " he said , controlling his rage . ( He 'd lost the order and been cornered in an idiotic situation . ) He shut the box . As he did so he realized that the lawnmower had stopped and they were in silence " Well ? " he said , taking the box under his arm . " But suppose I was to order one  --  one of those cleaners ? " she said , haughtily , but with a cajoling inflection of voice - " Would you bring it round yourself ? " He decided to lie . " Of course , " he managed . " I f you 'll be here when I bring it . " She regained assurance . " I might an ' I might n't . " He felt for the order book . " Yes , " she said . " It wo n't do any harm to write it down . " He put down the box and wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the box again . " I 'll see you out , " she said , and minced out of the room , twitching her shoulders as she passed him . And as they crossed the hall she said in a " company tone , " " So you 'll be delivering it in a few days . Come in the afternoon , when I shall have time to see it work . " " Very good , Miss , " he said and she stared , holding the front door ; and he thought he saw some playful query checked . He went down the steps , and she stood watching him from the threshold , blinking in the mellow glare of the four o'clock sun . " Well , " she said . " So long . " He took off his hat , bowed , and got into the car . In the road , he got out the order book . Next to Miss Hackett , Hazelhurst , Westbury Road , he put " N.B. Special Delivery by Rail . " He looked in the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heat in the car was stifling now . If only he and Jinnie could find somewhere in the country to live  --  somewhere cheap enough . He got out and went up to the next gate . It was a green gate with Pui-En-unsT painted on it in white letters .
