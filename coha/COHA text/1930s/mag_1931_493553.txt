III : Sunday at Camp Hill AMP HILL , Alabama , had a revival last kJ July in the Methodist Church . ( The village of 900 people has three white and two Negro churches , and is proud of them . ) " There were n't many additions to the church , " a member confessed to me , " because this year most of the younger fry Were already members . We have a revival every Year and usually rake in the young people when they ' get to be about ten years old . " One Sunday night the revival service was interrupted by Wilson , the town marshal , who entered at the rear of the church and called for the doctor . I'Ie announced that Sheriff Kyle Young had been Shot to pieces . Men jumped to their feet , many left the church , but the preacher kept the service going . lTOW just keep quiet , " he is reported as saying , it 's just somebody trying to bring Chicago down ere . " The more cautious church-goers apparently went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sportsmanlike joined in an exciting two-day nigger hunt which filled the county jail at Dadeville with frightened and often wounded Negroes and put the little town on the front pages of the metropolitan press . Camp Hill is agreed that nothing much really happened , that the newspapers made a lot out of nothing . " No , we did n't have any trouble here . Just some damn niggers got smart and we had to . shoot a few to teach them their place . " I spent the last Sunday in September loafing on the main street of Camp Hill . I went to Sunday school and church ; sat on the bench in front of the cafe ; lounged around the filling station , the railroad station , the drug stores , wherever anyone would talk . Some suspicion there was , but after I had identified myself as a Southerner and a traveling salesman , not a Yankee or a Birmingham reporter , talk became free . Only the marshal remained reticent . " It was n't nothing much , " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went with him to break the meeting up ? and shooting started . " That was about all he would say . He did say he guessed the idea of the Communists was to put in practice their principles , " to take people 's property away from them and divide it up . A boy at the filling station gave me a vivid picture of going out nigger-hunting the second night with a party of seven or eight men . The sheriff did not bother to swear in all the voluntary hunters as deputies ; men just got their guns and set out in groups of six or eight . They searched the surrounding country , the woods , the fields , all the Negro cabins . It was a dark night . The Negro men were out hiding ; very rarely would one be found in his cabin . The women were at home , the children , and perhaps an old man sick in bed . In the two nights over a hundred men were caught and taken to jail , a number were shot or beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " I do n't think more than one nigger was killed , I really do n't , " the boy told me . " Of course , though , I do n't know , because there were so many parties out hunting that night ; and if a man shot a nigger he probably would n't say anything about it . Of course they killed the nigger that shot the sheriff , but I think the others got scared and ran away , and most of them have been too scared to come back . " An older man in one of the three drug stores , a kindly fellow , talked with me for a long time . " There was n't anything to it , " he said . " The newspapers made a lot out of nothing . The grand jury met a couple of weeks ago and could n't find evidence against anybody . Most of the niggers around here are all right , that is they are submissive and respectful . They say some of the niggers had guns and did some shooting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody would go before the grand jury and swear that he saw a nigger shoot , and the grand jury let ' em all loose . Of course they could have found evidence that white men beat up some of the niggers , but they did n't care to go into that . " About a year ago some of the niggers formed what they called the share-croppers ' union . They met from time to time in a house at the bottom of my field and talked about raising turnips and potatoes and such like . Nobody objected to that . Then some white man came down from Chattanooga . The niggers say he told them to demand a dollar a day when they worked and rations of food . He brought some literature down and told them that he was a Communist and that was what their meeting was about . They say he told them that everything here in the South was made by the niggers ' labor and they ought to have it , and that the only way to get what belonged to them was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe believed that stuff for a while . They are just like children and will believe anything you tell them . Anyway , the sheriff heard about these meetings and decided to put a stop to them . He did break up two or three meetings . He broke up one meeting Saturday night , the night before the shooting , and there was some grumbling and some talk about how they would meet anyhow . Sunday night the sheriff heard about another meeting and drove down to the meeting place with a deputy and the Camp Hill marshal , Wilson . When they got near the place they met a nigger picket . Just what happened I do n't know , but the sheriff says the nigger had a bundle and a gun . The sheriff says when he asked the nigger what was in the bundle the nigger said it was none of his damn business . So the sheriff reached back into the car for his gun and the nigger shot him in the side and back . Then the sheriff shot the nigger in the legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ? he had his side full of bird-shot ? and he did not want to kill the nigger . " After that the deputy and the marshal left the nigger on the ground and took the sheriff back to town . They took him to the marshal 's home and got the doctor , and the marshal let out that the sheriff was about to die . He always exaggerates things like that ; the sheriff was all right in a couple of weeks . While the doctor was giving the sheriff first aid , a big crowd gathered about the house , and after a while the marshal went out and said the sheriff was still living . Then the crowd began to go wild . They all had guns ; never saw anything like it . " After a while the crowd found out that the nigger who shot the sheriff had been taken to his home , wounded ; so a bunch of them went down there . I do n't know just what happened , but they say the nigger cussed them and told them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were fired an from the woods near the cabin . I think maybe that was exaggerated . Anyway , the door was locked and they broke down the door and got the nigger and took him to Dadeville , dead . In Dadeville they said that the nigger had a lot of buck-shot wounds on his feet and legs that were all painted with mercurochrome ; but up here indicating his breast he had a gash as big as your fist that was n't painted . I guess they killed him . " Then a crowd went down to the meeting place , about five miles from town , and broke up the meeting . It appears from all accounts that there was much shooting . " If the night had not been so pitch black , " one man told me , " I guess a lot of people would have been killed . " In the darkness a number of Negroes were wounded , some seriously , but 1 did not hear of any white men getting hurt . That night , and the next day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marshal Wilson was quoted as telling reporters that Negroes who were missing " had gone to cut wood , and had a lot of wood to cut . " He denie ) 5 now that he said it , but citizens lounging on the street say it sounds too much like him to be made up . But the loungers thought only one Negro was killed . " Though I do n't know , mister ; there were so many different parties out hunting . A lot of niggers got scared and ran off , but I think most of them turned up after things quieted down . And the nigger that shot the sheriff , there were n't enough niggers at his funeral hardly to bury him . It 's a funny thing the niggers wo n't bury a nigger a white man kills . " The loungers on Main Street generally thought there would be no more trouble . " Some damn Yankees and Communists came down from Chicago or New York and tried to get some.money from the ignorant niggers . That 's all them bastards wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the niggers ' heads with stuff , but they cleared out when the trouble started and they wo n't be back around here . It 's a pity we could n't catch one of them . " " They could n't have been any high-class white men . It takes a pretty low-down son of a bitch to take the side of a nigger . Some of the niggers said one of the white men put a pistol on the table and said , ' This is part of my speech . This is what it will take to get what you want , and every one of you ought to have one . " ' At the Methodist Sunday school in Camp Hill we sang : " Jesus , Jesus , Sweetest Name I Know , " and " More About Jesus , " and " Jesus Calls Us . " And in one of the other churches I heard this prayer : We thank Thee our Heavenly Father for our bright and shining land . . . for seed time and harvest . ? . for our nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefathers who fought and bled that we might have here a country where there is equality of opportunity . .. freedom and justice for all .
