Fortnight ago Germany 's Government decreed that , before next January 1 , Jews in Germany who do not bear " Jewish " first names must add to their names " Israel " or " Sarah , " according to their sex . The question then arose : What constitutes a Jewish name ? That question became a pressing one not only for 500,000 German Jews but for " Aryan " Germans with such Hebraic names as Paul , Joseph , David . Last week the Government resolved doubts by publishing an official list of Jewish names-including no Pauls or Josephs . Some of them : <P> Males : Abel , Abimelech , Abner , Absalom , Ahab , Aaron , Ascher , Baruch , Bud , Dan , Denny , Eli , Elias , Elihu , Enoch , Esau , Esra , Ezechiel , Gad , Gideon , Habakuk , Hillel , Isaac , Isachar , Isidor , Ismael , Israel , Itzig , Jehu , Jehuda , Jeremia , Jethro , Joab , Jochanan , Joel , Jona , Jonathan , Juda , Kaleb , Laban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moab , Mordechaj , Moses , Naftali , Nathan , Nehemia , Noa , Obadja , Pinkus , Ruben , Sally , Salomon , Samuel , Saul , Schmul , Scholem , Sebulon , Sirach , Simson , Teit , Uria , Uriel , Zedekia . <P> Females : Abigail , Bela , Chinke , Driesel , Fradchen , Frommet , Gole , Hadassah , Hannacha , Hitzel , Jezebel , Judith , Libe , Mathel , Pesschen , Pessel , Pirle , Rachel , Rebekka , Rivka , Sara , Schlmche , Tana , Zipora . <P> At least one section of world Jewry took the Government 's list calmly .
