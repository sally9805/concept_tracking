In all the world there was no happier man last week than Manhattan Banker William Woodward . Sitting in his box at ancient Churchill Downs , the 63-year-old millionaire watched his big bay colt , Johnstown , parade from the paddock with seven other top-notch U. S. three-year-olds-all that were ready to start of the 115 nominated last February-for the 65th running of the Kentucky Derby . <P> Millionaire Woodward , who owns one of the finest stables of race horses in the world , had won two Derbies before ( with Gallant Fox in 1930 and Omaha in 1935 ) and had won Great Britain 's coveted Ascot Gold Cup last year with Flares , a son of Gallant Fox . But Turfman Woodward , a serious student of blood lines , took special pride in his long-legged Johnstown , whom railbirds nicknamed " Big John . " It was his idea to breed his fleet-footed Jamestown with La France , a beautiful little mare who , because of a broken hip , never could race . Johnstown was their foal and Owner Woodward had followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Last year , as a two-year-old , Johnstown won only seven of twelve races . Because Johnstown ate too fast and often made himself ill , his trainer invented a sievelike device to feed him oats slowly . Johnstown swiftly improved . This spring , in three starts , no rival could get within six lengths of his heels at the finish line . Last week , Owner Woodward saw Johnstown join one of the Derby 's smallest fields as one of the shortest favorites in the history of the race . <P> After two magic minutes , for which 80.000 racing fans jampacked Churchill Downs last week , everyone , from the 50 standing-room to the $99 boxes , agreed with Owner Woodward that Johnstown was a great horse . Taking the lead away from speedy little El Chico ( winter-book favorite ) at the first quarter , long-striding Johnstown streaked farther away from the field at every pole , breezed under the wire in a common gallop , with ears cocked as if wondering what had happened to the rest of the gang . Six lengths behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Jock Whitney 's Heather Broom . El Chico , on whom some million dollars were probably wagered in winter books , finished out of the money . <P> Sharing Owner Woodward 's joy , as he accepted the gold trophy ( and $46.000 ) was his trainer , 65-year-old Jim Fitzsimmons , who had saddled both Mr. Wood ward 's previous Derby winners . To " Mr. Fitz , " as he is known to all racing folk , went 10% of the prize money . Another 10% went to Jockey Jimmy Stout , who had won his first Kentucky Derby al though he had ridden a favorite twice be fore . An hour later , while Louisville toasted Johnstown as another War Admiral , another Exterminator , another Man o ' War , the big bay received his reward : three quarts of oats , a quart of carrots and three kinds of hay .
