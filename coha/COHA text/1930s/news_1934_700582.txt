txt The Federal Trade Commission voted today to give full cooperation to the Judiciary Committee of the New York Senate in its proposed inquiry into the activities of Senator Warren T. Thayer in behalf of the Associated Gas and Electric Company . The action was taken at a full meeting of the commission after Paul J. McCauley , counsel for the State Senate committee , and two of his associates , Harry W. Mack and Abraham M. Davis , had conferred with officials and had begun an examination of the records to determine what documents would be required at the Albany investigation . In order to end doubt as to the ability of the State Senate to obtain documents it desired , the commission in its ruling gave formal authority for its attaches to go to Albany and take such documents as the legislative committee might subpoena . Mr. McCauley immediately had subpoenas served on William B. Horne , commission examiner who has testified that he found in the files of the Associated Gas and Electric System letters purportedly written by Mr. Thayer ; Mrs. Lucy Benedict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , and Robert C. Horne , a son of William B. Horne . The-latter was an employe of the commission in 1929 , when the copies of the alleged Thayer letters were made , and aided in the work . McCauley Parries Questions . Mr. McCauley would not say just what Trade Commission exhibits would be called for or indicate whether the inquiry might go into a broader field than that involving the supposed Thayer correspondence with Associated Gas and Electric system officials . In addition to copies of these letters . there have been introduced at the hearings here a number mentioning other New York State legislators , and inter-office communications between officials of the utility system which made references to legislators and company activities in connection with the utility situation in New York . " I am not going to discuss what we are going to attempt to establish , " Mr. McCauley said . " We are proceeding under the resolution passed by the Senate . " To reporters he read from a copy of the resolution , which called upon the Judiciary Committee to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been introduced at Trade Commission hearings purporting to have been written by Senator Thayer . He was asked if any further interpretation could be given of the resolution and replied : " Senator Thayer drew it . " " Will your first move be to attempt to establish the authenticity of the copies of the correspondence ? " he was asked . " I am not going to discuss that , " be replied . " The bearings will start at 2 P. M. on Monday at Albany . Then you will know what we intend to do . " Asked if any hearings would be held . in Washington , Mr. McCauley reiterated that the investigation would open at Albany and said he had no opinion as to what might develop after that . Indications appear to be , however , in view of the commission 's decision to permit any of the documents to be taken to Albany by its attaches , that the inquiry will centre there . Hill Renews His Attack . While representatives of the New York Senate committee were conferring with officials , W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuance of the commission 's hearing into the utility system 's affairs his charge that politics were prompting the Federal commission 's activities . When the commission yesterday received from Charles Nodder , one of its examiners , a statement that there had been a write-up of $191,000 on property of the Chasm Power Company , which Associated had acquired from Senator Thayer in 1924 , Mr. Hill cited the introduction of evidence about the Chasm company at this . time " as a cheap political trick and as playing to the gallery . " Today in a statement to newspaper correspondents , he supplemented this with the charge that facts had been withheld by the commission . He said : " By concealing the fact that Chasm Power Company , instead of involving a write-up in the Associated system actually involved a write-down , the Federal Trade Commission wrote its own ticket when it tried to get aboard the Albany band wagon . " That the true facts were known to the examiner testifying Is shown by his report , volume 45 , from which he stated he drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he did not refer , he sets forth the complete entries carrying out the writedown and uses these words in his final figures , which read as follows : ' Net write-down , $50,583.90 . ' " While Trade Commission officials were stirred by the latest charges by Mr. Hill , no official reply was made today The commission had intended to close this phase of the inquiry this afternoon , but instead it was anngunced that the hearings would be continued on Monday . It is understood the statement by Mr. Hill will be replied to in some detail then The write-down to which Mr. Hill referred , it is understood , was made in 1926 , whereas the write-up to which Mr. Nodder testified yesterday was alleged to have been made in 1924 . Reference to the 1926 write-down and how it came about was not contained in yesterday 's testimony , and it was to this that Mr. Hill objected . As for the political charges , it was pointed out that Robert E. Healy , who has charge of the general utility investigation , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sargent during the Coolidge administration , and that W. T. Chantland , associate counsel , and Mr. Nodder are also Republicans .
