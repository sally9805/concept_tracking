This week Britain will take another hitch in the communications belt of her farflung Empire when , for no extra charge , all first-class mail between the colonies and the mother country will begin to be carried by air . Exception is Canada , no scheduled North Atlantic service yet being in effect . To haul the estimated 20 tons of mail which will leave London each week , Imperial Airways , long equipped with huge old rattletraps , has acquired a fleet of 28 Short Brothers four-motored flying boats . Last week the Empire 's great new airmail network hit a snag before it could be formally inaugurated . <P> The Capricornus took off from Southampton with five men , one woman and 65 mailsacks to fly non-stop to Alexandria on a final experimental trip .

Inept like most European airmen at blind flying , he got lost , circled through the murk while the radioman sent out an SOS . Before he could get his bearings , the pilot scraped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of Mont du Beaujolais , killed everyone but the radioman , who crawled two miles through the snow for help . To England the news was as shocking as the crash of the China Clipper would be to the U. S.
