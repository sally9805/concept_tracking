( See Cover ) One quiet day ten years ago United Pressman Lyle Wilson burst into the press office of the State Department with a little model airplane in his hand . The State Department 's genial Press Division Chief Michael McDermott was talking with a few reporters . Wilson began sailing his plane around the room . <P> " Hey , " yelled McDermott , who is wonderfully kind to cub reporters but a bull dog to rowdy ones , " cut that out , or we 'll throw you out . " " I 'll ask the boss about that , " said Wilson in a mock huff , and walked down the hall to the office of the then Assistant Secretary of State Nelson Trusler Johnson ( who had just been notified of his appointment as Minister to China ) . Two hours later someone put his head in the Assistant Secretary 's door . Nelson Johnson and Lyle Wilson were tossing the airplane at each other , laughing like ten-year-olds . <P> Next day Reporter Wilson went back to the store where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes were sold out , Wilson protested that there had been a whole boxful the day before . " Yes , " said the salesman , " but a big , fat guy who said his name was Johnson came in and bought all I had . " <P> Not long afterward Nelson Johnson left for Peking and one of the most important posts in the U. S. diplomatic service . He carried with him the supply of little paper airplanes . For ten years since then , U. S. Far Eastern policy has ridden on little paper wings-unpredictable , steered by prankish winds-which Nelson Johnson , most of the time roaring with laughter , has launched . <P> Since the outbreak of war in Europe , the importance of Chungking and Tokyo in the U. S. Ambassadorial scale has increased tremendously-so much that only London and Paris now rank them . There are good reasons . Britain , France , Germany and , to a lesser extent , Russia have all turned Westward . Of important powers , only Japan and the U. S. are just now conspicuously active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores of the Pacific , they are natural opponents . One of them is big , rich , complacent , lazy , subject to delayed reflexes ; the other small , inordinately ambitious , troubled with intellectual cramps and an inferiority complex . The big fellow , slow as he is , has finally begun to realize he must do one of four things about the Orient , particularly China : <P> 1 ) Get out . Extreme isolationist view is that U. S. interests in China ( with only two-thirds the value of the U. S. domestic barber business ) and U. S. resources in the Philippines ( gold , iron , chromite , manganese , tobacco , hemp , timber , sugar ) are not worth holding at the risk of conflict ; that the U. S. should withdraw to the Panama-Hawaii-Alaska front , strengthen defenses there .
