Many a racketeer last week viewed with alarm a reversion to horse- &-buggy; justice when a Manhattan jury pointed Charles ( " Lucky " ) Lucania and eight of his lieutenants toward stiff jail sentences by convicting them , not on an oblique income tax-evasion charge but directly for doing illicit business . <P> For three weeks prostitutes and bawds had paraded through the courtroom , while Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey questioned them on the details of their occupation ( TIME , May 25 ) . No old-fashioned vice trial was this . The prosecutor had been appointed at the request of New York 's Governor Lehman , not to wipe out an ancient profession but to abolish rackets . Lucania and his prosperous executives had terrorized a large section of the city 's dealers in flesh , had put prostitution on a chain-store basis . <P> At the end of the long trial through which sleek Businessman Lucania sat with reptilian calm , his high-powered lawyers launched into a 13-hour summation for the defense , attacking the credibility of the prosecution 's witnesses , declaring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to induce them to testify . Mr. Dewey contented himself with a seven-hour answer . Urging the jury not to spare Lucania , he declared : " Unless you are willing to convict the top man you might as well acquit everyone . " <P> Justice McCook summed up in words of homely wisdom : " Most of those pretty faces are but masks for tainted bodies . The prostitute is both victim and enticer and her life is full of lies . . . . But if you believe what she says , then the story stands and the fact that she is a prostitute is of no moment . " <P> It was 10:55 Saturday night when the jury of business and professional men retired to consider the case . Rather than lock up the jurymen , Justice McCook went to sleep in his chambers . Lucania and his friends lay down in their cells . Their wives went home . Just after 5 the next morning the judge was roused from his sleep . Lucania &; friends shuffled into court in wrinkled clothes . Prosecutor Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh shave . <P> The verdict was " guilty . " There were 62 specific charges against each of the nine defendants . Defense lawyers demanded that each juror be polled . It took three-quarters of an hour . Each juror declared each defendant guilty of every charge against him . Said Judge to Jurors : " I congratulate you on the service you have rendered the people and the righteousness of your verdict . " He smiled in the Sabbath dawn . " And now run along . " <P> Having convicted the racketeers , Special Prosecutor Dewey straightway last week went after the racketeers ' lawyers . To the New York City Bar Association he sent the names and misdeeds of two lawyers who had done legal work for last week 's defendants .
