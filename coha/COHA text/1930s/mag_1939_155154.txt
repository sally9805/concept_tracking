More than 7,000,000 U. S. citizens took out hunting licenses this year . Last week , with the first frost on the pumpkin , farmers took down their cherished fowling-pieces , bankers assembled their shiny shotguns and the army of U. S. hunters took to the woods , the marshes and the prairies for their fall shooting . From Cape Cod to the Sierras , most of them were after rabbits . Many had their minds on quail , pheasant , grouse , squirrel , deer . But the most excited U. S. gunners last week were the 1,000,000 duck shooters looking forward to their rendezvous with canvasbacks , mallards , black ducks , pintails . <P> This year , winging south from Canada , come the heaviest flights of wild duck in ten years-20% more than last year , thanks to providential June rains in the Canadian breeding grounds and the efforts of Ducks Unlimited , a popular-subscription organization that has spent a quarter of a million dollars in the past two years restoring duck-nesting marshes in Canada. * <P> Around whiskey bottles , wherever duck shooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oldsters held forth about the good old days when there were flights of 150,000,000 ducks instead of 65,000,000 , when the season was 3 months long instead of 45 days , and there was no such thing as daily bag limits ( this year 's daily bag limit is ten ducks , four geese or brant ) . Tyros tickled oldsters with their newfangled theories learned on the skeet fields . Everyone grumbled about the Federal " nuisance " regulations : no shooting before 7 a.m. or after 4 p.m. ; no more than three shells in a gun ; no live decoys ; no baiting in duck-shooting areas . And many an ardent wildfowler gained an audience by quoting passages from the latest duck-hunter 's Bible , A Book on Duck Shooting* by famed Sportsman Van Campen Heilner . <P> Sportsman Heilner 's opus may prove as valuable a handbook for duck hunters as his Salt Water Fishing has been for big-game anglers . Packed between its covers-in addition to his memoirs and 150 pages of photographs-are : a guide for identification of 58 species of ducks and geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abundance of waterfowl ; maps of the North American fly ways ; statistics on the speed of birds ; a chapter on U. S. duck clubs , ranging from the commercial clubs ( no more private than a night club ) to the exclusive groups with $10,000 membership fees . <P> Astounding to most readers will be Hunter Heilner 's facts &; figures on the 3,000 duck clubs in the U. S. : <P> &gt; Some $76,000,000 is invested in wildfowl shooting properties . <P> &gt; Some 3,000,000 acres of waterfowl marsh are privately owned . <P> &gt; U. S. duck clubs give employment to 2,500 persons the year round , an extra 6,500 during the 45-day shooting season . <P> Welcome to all tyros will be Hunter Heilner 's hints : <P> &gt;Never shoot into flocks larger than seven or eight-you ca n't kill them all and you will only frighten away the others for a long time . <P> &gt;In shooting mallards , decoys are unnecessary if you have a good duck call . <P> &gt;If you suffer from cold feet , use rubber boots lined with sheepskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
