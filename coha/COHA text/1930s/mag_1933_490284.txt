EARLY one morning a schoolboy entered a drugstore on Grand Street . " I got a nickel , and I want a nipple , " he said . He showed the druggist a rubber nipple his mother had given him for a sample . " Costs a dime , " said the druggist . " I ai n't got a dime , I only got a nickel , " said the little boy . The druggist explained that the nipple cost him ( the druggist ) eight cents , and that he sold it for ten , making two cents ' profit . He told the boy to take the nipple along and bring the other nickel on his way to school . When the boy came back , he had only three cents . " My mother , " he said , " said to tell you that she is very poor and ca n't afford to pay you any profit . " Latest Models THE salesmen in attendance at one of the exhibits at the recent Automobile Show were most pleasantly surprised on the opening night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who detached themselves from the passing throng , centred their attention on this particular exhibit , and began to rave about the cars in terms of high enthusiasm . They were unquestionably excellent prospects , too : obviously prosperous , for the ladies were expensively evening-gowned and coated and the men all wore top hats . It was the salesmen 's idea of heaven . They did n't have to extol the merits of their cars ; the customers did it for them , clambering in and out of the cars and exclaiming over each new virtue discovered . The exhibit was conspicuously the most animated in the Show that night and the representatives of rival manufacturers exhibiting their wares in neighboring floor space looked on first in envy and then in despondency . The eight hung around most of the evening . It was n't until their departure that the salesmen realized that actually none of them had placed an order for a car . Somehow they did n't seem able to throttle their enthusiasm down to a point where they could sign an order blank . On the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time , however , the salesmen were moody . The fact is , they had been let in on a Big Idea which had been kept from them the first night . The couples were something of a hoax . They had been hired by the advertising department to build up enthusiasm . Their clothes were hired , too . They were models earning twenty-five dollars a night . It was a terrible disillusionment to the salesmen , but they bore up as bravely as they could and tried to look as happy as they had the first night . On the third evening , the news leaked out and salesmen from other exhibits sauntered around , smirking and making ribald remarks to the pseudobuyers . " Why do n't you wrap it in cellophane and take it home ? " and " Why do n't you buy a dozen of ' em ? " Things like that they said  --  not very bright , but disconcerting . The fourth evening was worse , because a man took to hanging around the exhibit knocking the cars in about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was hired by rival exhibitors is n't known , but what with him and the other scoffers , the dressy eight were told they need n't come around the next night . No Cruelty nN her morning walks of late , a nice lady of West Eleventh Street has been making it a point to go by an old stable in her neighborhood , the home of a bunch of bedraggled horses that seem to have worn their lives away pulling peddlers and junkmen around . She takes along a little sugar and some-times buys a few carrots or such to feed to the old nags . On an especially cold morning lately , a horse hitched to a wagon stood before the stable , shiver-ing . On the seat was a man , shiver-ing . The lady went up to the horse , holding out a carrot , and the horse was SPORTING GOODS about to take it when the driver called a halt . " Just a minute , lady , " he said .

He is forty-seven and weighs a hundred and ninety . He helps Mr. Roosevelt in and out of crowds , on and off trains , and also reads the crank mail . This keeps him in touch with whatever cranks may be brooding about the President-elect . So far he has never had to do anything very drastic about protecting his charge . " Have to punch a crank occasionally , that 's all , " he says . He calls Mr. Roosevelt President and Mr. Roosevelt calls him Gus , as does most everybody else . Gus belongs to the New York police force , which he joined in 1908 as a patrolman . New York City always assigns a cop to the governor as a bodyguard , an old custom .

When Mr. Roosevelt was governor , Gus did n't go to Albany except on special occasions , occupying himself with the activities of the Radical Squad much of the time . When the Governor was in New York , he used to show up at his town house at eight A.M. and stay with him all day , up to midnight frequently . He always went to Warm Springs with Mr. Roosevelt , and during the campaign traveled all over . In Albany , VVilliam Greene , a state CL trooper , usually acted as bodyguard . If anything special was going on , Gus would go up . In Albany , he was usually-to he found with gatherings of politicians as late as four A.M. been .

" It 's a beautiful thing in my life to be mixed up with a man like the President , " says Gus . He likes to recall the water-polo games at Hyde Park and Warm Springs in which Mr. Roosevelt and his cronies engaged .

They have a sentry box at the " Little White House " at Warm Springs and a system of floodlights by which they can light up the house and grounds in an instant . They 've never caught any prowlers this way . Gus , incidentally , puts on evening clothes when Mr. Roosevelt does ? that is , a dinner coat . He wo n't wear a topper , though , or morning clothes .

The buyer paid for his pur-chases and ordered them shipped to his home , which is in New Mexico . A day or two later the dealer got a note from the New Mex-ican , written on the stationery of his ho-tel , saying he was leaving and adding , briefly and crypti-cally : " With the or-der , please ship one second-hand plow . " The furniture man gasped , but rallied and set out to find a second-hand plow . He failed to find one in all the city , and so wired his customer . " Ship second-hand milk can , " the patron tel-egraphed back . Baf-fled , but conscien-tious and dogged , the dealer searched for a second-hand milk can . He found one and shipped it along with the goods . ? Then he wrote a letter to the customer , pleading for an explanation . The customer wrote back that a secondhand plow , or even milk can , made the shipment " emigrant movables , " and took a near fifty per cent off the freight hill .
