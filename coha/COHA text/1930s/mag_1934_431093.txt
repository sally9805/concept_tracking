 | WE WERE still sojourning at Godollo when the first snow began to fly . One chilly evening ? it was 1876 and long before the era of steam-heated rooms ? I entered Tante Kaiserin 's boudoir for the usual goodnight kiss . In the course of time this custom had become a more or less perfunctory bit of etiquette varying only in cases when Aunt Sissy felt the urge to talk . Then she would invite me to remain while Mrs. von Feyfalik brushed her beautiful long hair . That night , however , to my unbounded astonishment , the Empress sent the hairdresser out of the room . I grew apprehensive . While I secretly squirmed , Aunt Sissy came straight to the point : a marriage was to be arranged for me . " Ah , it must be Esterhazy ! " flashed through my brain . Aunt Sissy seemed to read my mind , for she shook her lovely head , and assured me smiling , " No , it 's not Nicky . . . He 'd never be the right man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then I learned that at the suggestion of the Empress , Count Gyula Andrassy had approached the Hungarian nobleman some weeks before . Instantly I recalled Elemer 's solicitude at the hunt when I had had my little spill . " Of course , " Aunt Sissy continued coolly , " Elemer is considerably older than you , but from what I hear , he admires you greatly . He will make an excellent husband . Besides , " the Empress pointed out , " with this marriage that terrible feud of 1848 will be wiped out completely . Do n't you see , Marie ? The son of Ludwig Batthyany will become the nephew of the King of Hungary . " This was not Aunt Sissy speaking to me , but the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary . She was serious , almost stern , and there were fine lines on her brow .  | I knew that since 1867 , shortly after the Compromise which reconciled the Magyars to the Hapsburg ruler , when she had accompanied the Emperor to Budapest , she had been greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown of St. Stephen . As Queen of Hungary , the Empress had become an eager student of the Magyar tongue . After that first trip to the land of the puszta , she had made it a point to spend as much time as possible in Hungary , especially in Godollo . I felt that Aunt Sissy was studying me from under those long eyelashes of hers , and I tried to check the sudden weakness that threatened me . So I was to be Elemer 's wife ! Never had I dreamed of such a possibility . Still , I told myself that I could love him ? not solely because he was a striking personality surrounded by a halo of romance , but for the very reason that appeared a drawback : our difference in age . Young men had never interested me . Today students of psychology might diagnose this liking for older men as a father complex . . . and probably correctly so . " In all likelihood Elemer will propose to you on the next hunt . Naturally you must seem surprised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my Aunt Sissy once more . She kissed me affectionately and rang for Mrs. von Feyfalik to continue with the nightly hairbrushing ritual . Back in my own room there was no need to hide my feelings . I felt at once elated and stunned . That Aunt Sissy meant to marry me off did not take me unawares . More and more , signs had been pointing that way . Only a few days earlier , Aunt Sissy , after introducing one of the princes of Thurn and Taxis , had remarked slyly , " That man might be a good match for you , Marie . " The Thurn and Taxis family was one of the oldest and richest in Europe , but this particular scion of the noble house was an elderly man with a wild gray mustache , a tremendous beak of a nose , and a black patch over the left eye to cover an empty socket . Elemer Batthyany was perhaps When the author went with her tall and slender aunt to Windsor Castle , she did not at first recognize the " small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . She thought she looked kind and capable , but not royal not so much younger than this prince and certainly not so fabulously rich , but I was still young enough to overlook material advantages . To me , at that age , Elemer seemed the nearest approach to a maiden 's prayer . More than once I caught myself wistfully eyeing the finger on which I hoped soon to see Elemer 's ring . To be sure , that finger was already encircled by a narrow band made of Caucasian platinum . Inside , tiny Russian letters spelled the name GRISHA . He was a young Russian aristocrat whom I had never seen , the brother of a school chum . One rainy afternoon , to the huge merriment of a houseful of girl friends , I had been " married " to Grisha in a mock ceremony with Nadja herself substituting for her brother . At her insistence , rings had been exchanged by mail between Grisha and myself , and I had also sent him my picture . Grisha was a junior officer in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That region in the seventies of the last century was still much too wild to boast photography or portrait painting , and I therefore never received a likeness of my " bridegroom . " Of course , I romantically concluded from Nadja 's ecstatic assurances that her brother was a veritable Adonis and the incarnation of all manly virtues . For some time my long-distance  | " husband " and I corresponded with each other . As letters were in transit from two to six months , however , according to the season , our correspondence gradually dwindled and eventually ceased altogether . By now Grisha seemed nothing more than a pleasant memory , while Elemer Batthyany represented exciting reality . As a young girl will do , I began to weave daydreams with myself in the role of Countess Batthyany . Every morning as soon as I arose I anxiously scanned the sky , praying that no early frost would interfere with our next hunt . My prayers were answered . A clear , cool day saw us at the meet , and it was during a short rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me . There was always a certain hoarseness in his voice , but it was more noticeable than ever that day . He raised his eyes slowly and looked at me . " Baroness Marie , " he began hesitatingly , " will you always think kindly of me ? " I stared at him , astonished . Was this a proposal of marriage ? At the same moment the hounds had picked up the scent once more , and the hunt continued . Elemer kept beside me but remained strangely silent . I cast a furtive glance at him . Heavens , what had happened to the man ? There was an expression of intense suffering in his eyes which made me compare them with the agonized features of the Redeemer , looking down at us from the little wayside shrine we were just passing . Never , in all my life , shall I forget those unhappy eyes . We rode on interminably ? or so it seemed to me . At last Elemer spoke again : " If only I did not have to leave here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . So it must be goodbye . . . Perhaps we shall never meet again , and I shall never have a chance to say what I want to say so badly right now . " He brought his horse close to mine . " Give me your hand , Marie . " I extended my hand , and as we trotted on I felt as if something irresistible were drawing me out of the saddle . Finally he released me . " Kedvesem ! " ? darling ? was the last word he said to me , in his native Hungarian . Then the distance between us increased , and I found myself alone , pondering why Elemer had behaved so strangely toward me . When I entered Aunt Sissy 's boudoir that night , I found her alone , as Mrs. von Feyfalik had already attended to her hair . Wearing a magnificent nightdress of purple , she looked beautiful and incredibly young , but there was something else which I noticed , despite the heaviness of my heart . While Auntie sat before her mirror , applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers ? vivid green in color . " What are you staring at , Marie ? " Aunt Sissy asked , following my gaze . " Oh , my green slippers . " She laughed a little as if to cover up her embarrassment . " Well , well , is n't accident a great aid to gossip ? " It sounded sarcastic , but with Aunt Sissy one could only guess whether she was serious or not . " It seems green slippers must have impressed you greatly . Do n't tell me that Nicky Esterhazy received you ? " she giggled a little like a schoolgirl ? " in so unconventional an attire as is your aunt 's habit ! " " The Count came out in the garden wearing a long black lounging robe and funny green slippers that did not match his robe at all , " I answered . " Just as mine do n't match , although I have so many of them . Well , Marie , we crowned heads are , after all , only human . Now and then we act on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sissy suddenly adopted a flippant manner . " There are red slippers and blue slippers why not green ones , too ? And Nicky was always partial to that color , " she added as if impelled to do so against her own free will . " Even when he was younger and gayer , he affected green bedroom slippers whether they matched or not . " The  | Empress grew pensive . " Would you believe it , Marie , Nicky was a real Don Juan once upon a time . " Suddenly she checked herself . " But it 's you , Marie , who has a story to tell tonight . Quickly ? tell me what happened ? What did Elemer have to say to you today ? " I broke into tears . " Hardly anything ... He just said . . . good-bye , " I sobbed . Aunt Sissy gave me a few minutes to calm down , taking me into her arms and patting my shoulder solicitously . " Poor child , I would have saved you this disappointment if Count Andrassy had reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You and Elemer had hardly ridden off when Andrassy came to me , greatly upset . Elemer 's mother is still irreconcilable , and it seems she made a horrible scene . That nasty old woman threatened that if her son marries the niece of the King of Hungary ? the man who murdered her husband , as she still refers to that terrible Arad trial ? she will put a bullet through her head ! " There was a short pause , then Aunt Sissy sadly concluded , " And that 's why Elemer must give you up . " So I had actually lost Elemer ! I broke down again , sobbing my heart out . " You poor child , " Aunt Sissy tried to console me . " I never imagined that the old Countess would be as stubborn as all that . God knows , I have done everything I can to reconcile the Hungarians with the House of Hapsburg . But somehow it seems that old women are always against me . " Although I was greatly preoccupied with my own grief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie , Kaiser Francis Joseph 's mother ? a difficult mother-inlaw if ever there was one . Aunt Sissy stroked my head resting in her lap . Then she put her hand under my chin and , raising my face , she looked straight into my eyes . " Marie , this day has made you much older than your actual years . Let me warn you . There is no man in the whole wide world worth breaking a woman 's heart . A man may think himself deeply in love , but he will always find consolation somewhere , somehow ... The woman ? never ! " For days I went about , my mind filled with all the painful details of my short-lived romance with Elemer . Because I was young , I could not resist dramatizing the situation . I looked upon myself as the victim of an unhappy love affair when , , in reality , it was only my girlish pride that had suffered . I fairly wallowed in my agony , probably the more so as I noticed that the Empress was sincerely concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas when she broke the news to me that she would hunt in England early in the new year ; after sending me ' home to Munich for a visit , she would take me to London and Combermere Abbey . " Shall we see Bay Middleton again ? " I asked , studying her secretly . Recently I had learned to look @#  | for " signs , " Had I still been so childlike as weeks before , I should hardly have noticed the little flutter that agitated Aunt Sissy 's eyelids . " Why , yes , Marie , so we shall , " was all she said as she kissed me good-night . During the few weeks at home in Munich I was officially introduced to King Ludwig II of Bavaria . Of course , I frequently had met him before , but only en famille . Now , however , I was received in audience . It was the first time that I saw the King in uniform , which made him appear extremely tall and broadshouldered . At that time there was no indication that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as the Mad King . At a court ball with tableaux as a special attraction , I met Prince Herbert von Bismarck for the first time . Although by now I considered myself highly sophisticated , I remained completely oblivious of the fact that , in one of the tableaux vivants scenes , the son of the Iron Chancellor had been cast in the role of my admirer , at the suggestion of Aunt Sissy and with definite matchmaking intentions on her part . To bring the Prussian junker and myself together had probably been her only reason for ' sending me to Munich on a visit . I was , however , still thinking too much of Elemer to take any notice of the Bismarck scion . Meanwhile preparations for my trip to England were completed , and when Aunt Sissy passed through Munich , aboard the imperial special train , I joined her . She was accompanied by her lady-in-waiting , Countess Pestetics . Count Johann von Larisch acted as her " travel marshal , " and he was accompanied by his gigantic son , Heinrich . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valet of the Empress completed the retinue . Aa BROWN fog through which gas lamps blinked feebly covered London . We put up at the Claridge Hotel . Soon after our arrival there the two Larisches reported to the Empress for duty . Of " the old Excellency , " Count Johann , I had caught only a fleeting glimpse on board the channel steamer. when Count Heinrich had introduced me to his father . Heinle , as the Empress usually called him , was well over six feet , heavily built and jovial . He was not so much a courtier as his father , who was the prototype of a suave diplomat of the old school . I knew that Heinie was married to his cousin Yetta Larisch , an older sister of Count Georg von Larisch . But that was about all I knew of the Larisch family at that time . In later years I wondered if the Empress had been so gracious to Heinie because he somehow reminded her of Captain Middleton ; Heinie , like Bay , , had beautiful white teeth which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be companionable , and the morning following our arrival he took me around London . Upon returning to the Hotel Claridge after lunch I was commanded to appear before the Empress . When I entered her salon , I saw her seated beside a gentleman whom I first mistook for Captain Middleton , as I had been told that he had arrived in London to serve the Empress as her hunting guide . But when I approached the couple seated before the open fireplace , I was greatly surprised to discover that Aunt Sissy 's visitor was not Bay ; but a heavy-set , middle-aged man with a short beard and with a gardenia in his buttonhole . Empress Elizabeth 's caller was none other than Edward , Prince of Wales . The heir to the British throne arose , bowed deeply , and after Aunt Sissy had introduced me as " my niece , Marie , " we shook hands .. As the Prince smiled at me , I could see that he had a way of taking in a woman at a single glance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Aunt Sissy referred to him as " a charming fellow , " she did not seem too regretful , perhaps because she was expecting Bay Middleton . With the Hotel Claridge considered a stronghold of strictest etiquette at @#  | that time , it would have been impossible for the heir to the British crown and a mere captain in the British army to dine at the same table . Since there would be no chance of seeing Middleton alone before dinner , Aunt Sissy called me aside and whispered to me , " Give my love to Bay as soon as you see him . " When Middleton arrived , I gave him Aunt Sissy 's affectionate greeting . A broad smile appeared on his face , and he stammered , " Why . . . why . . . thank you ever so much , little girlie . " Next afternoon we went to Windsor to call on Queen Victoria . At the station the royal caleche awaited us . Only the Empress 's valet de chambre had been taken along , but even he remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the castle . We were received by a major domo in the amusing uniform of the Scotch Highlanders . No sooner had we reached the first floor than Aunt Sissy , apparently no stranger in the castle , told me to wait , and she stepped into a large room . Through the high open door I caught a glimpse of a small , stout lady in black , wearing a little white cap . I settled down for a good long wait , but soon the major domo reappeared , ushering me into the Royal Presence . I fought down my excitement , which was the easier as the old lady smiled in friendly fashion at me , while her white cap bobbed up and down as she nodded . She extended her hand , which I kissed respectfully . Then Victoria , Queen of England and Empress of India , motioned me to sit do'vn , inquiring whether I was glad to visit England for the hunting season . After another gracious nod in my direction the Queen once more turned back to Aunt Sissy , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince of Wales resembled his mother . The Queen , however , seemed to be much more serious-minded than her son . Her short , thick neck especially attracted my attention . When the two majesties arose a few minutes later , I could not help comparing the tall , slender Hapsburg Empress with the stout little woman who ruled the British Empire . Victoria gave the impression of being kind and capable , but certainly her appearance was not very royal . When we were settled in the caleche on our way to the station , Aunt Sissy put her arm on mine and said , " Thank heaven , that 's over now , and tomorrow we shall go out in the country for a real good time . " N THE morrow we arrived at Combermere Abbey , a tremendous castle-like edifice , dark but not too forbidding , covered with ivy and surrounded by an extensive private park of wonderful old trees . It was the typical setting for a Walter Scott story . Day after day guests would call , among the first of them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown was to dine with us that night , it was necessary to postpone the dinner for a later hour than usual , a change of schedule which upset Aunt Sissy considerably , as she disliked to eat late . She believed that such a meal threatened her lovely , slender figure . Shortly before Edward arrived Aunt Sissy told me that while the Prince visited her on the first floor , I was to remain in the lower hall until I heard her call me . To while away the time she gave me , very suitably , a Walter Scott novel to read . " Remember , when I call you , Marie , I want you to come immediately . " As I was never in the habit of keeping my imperial aunt waiting , her strict injunction surprised me . As always , however , Aunt Sissy had her own reasons for this . Promptly the Prince of Wales arrived and ascended the stairs rather asthmatically . The old Count Larisch accompanied the royal visitor as far as the door to the Empress 's suite . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from time to time the soft laughter so  | typical of Aunt Sissy . Suddenly she called me . In all haste I dropped my book and rushed upstairs . Halfway up the stairs I met the Prince of Wales , who stopped for just a second to say a friendly word . His Royal Highness seemed extremely preoccupied . At the head of the staircase stood the Empress , pressing her handkerchief to her mouth as she was wont to do when trying to stifle her laughter . As soon as the door was shut after Edward by a flunkey , Aunt Sissy broke out into unrestrained laughter . Tears of mirth coursed down her cheeks . " No , no , Marie , do n't ask me . I could n't tell you . . . and if I could , you would n't understand anyway . " I had my own theory . Most likely the Prince of Wales had told the Empress a funny story of the kind he used to pick up on his frequent trips to Paris . No doubt Aunt Sissy had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would account for the Prince 's manner at leaving . It was not until Aunt Sissy dictated hea poems to me some years later that I found the key to this scene in two stanzas , eirh with an English refrain , entitled : MEMORIES OF LONDON " There 's Somebody Coming Upstairs " We at together , Prince Edward and I , In cozy Mk-a-0e ; He made such ardent love to me : " Elizabeth , it 's fate ! My dear , what do you say . . . ? " he urged ? This man of great affairs ; I drew away and murmured then , " There 's somebody coming upstairs . " We paused . . . but all was still , and so He resumed his amorous quest ; His boldness was amusing , for ' T was more than a regal jest ! " My dear , what do you say ... ? " I mocked It took him unawares .. . In turn , he blushed and rose to say , " There 's somebody coming upstairs : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Empress had instructed me in advance u await her signal of distress proved that shs knew Edward , the man , rather well . At dinner that night Aunt Sissy , lookinf more beautiful than I had ever seen her before cast mischievous glances first at the Prince d Wales and then again at Captain Middleton At Combermere Abbey the code of strict etiquette was relaxed so that it was possibh for the heir to the British Crown and a men captain in his army to dine at the same table I had been placed between Count Heinie anc Bay , and I remember how both of them . in the course of the evening , repeatedly asked me whether I could account for Aunt Sissy 's ex. traordinary gayety . " Oh .. I suppose His Royal Highness told Ha Majesty an amusing joke , " I finally ventured " Aha , " exclaimed Count Heinie with a smile " So that 's it ? " Captain Middleton muttered . During our stay at Combermere Abbey Bay Middleton was the Empress 's constant conspanion . Unless there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every afternoon . " We discuss horses and the like , and we must n't be disturbed , " Aunt Sissy explained these visits to me . Only too soon those wonderful days al Combermere Abbey were drawing to an end . About a week before our leave-taking , Aunt Sissy , as if on the spur of the moment , proposed a little trip , incognito , to London , " just for one day . " She said that she had heard about a new cosmetician and that she would like to see what this woman had to offer in creams and lotions . Her trusted valet de chambre was sent ahead to London to reserve a small apartment at the Hotel Claridge with the instruction that the Empress was coming to London incognito and that no word must leak out in the press . I was @#  | overjoyed when Aunt Sissy told me that Count Heinie and I were to go along . For baggage we were not to take more than a suitcase each . The whole trip would be in the nature of an excursion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the waiting women and the valet de chambre who had preceded us to London . Without arousing any undesirable attention we arrived at the Hotel Claridge early in the afternoon . As soon as we had changed into fresh clothes , two hansom cabs were ordered for us . The Empress and I got into the first while Count Heinie followed us in the second one in lonely splendor ? not for long , however , because very soon we paused before a modest hotel . A tall man in a light overcoat came rushing out and took a seat next to Count Heinie . The Empress noticed how I took in the incident and smiled in amusement . " Well , Marie , there are all sorts of surprises in store for you today . First we are going to the Crystal Palace to see the vaudeville show . " " But , Aunt Sissy , I thought we were to look up that cosmetician . " " Oh , forget it , Marie . You know I never use any of those commercial preparations . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise I would have done so then . Had not Aunt Sissy expressly come to London to consult that cosmetician . . and yet she was not in the least interested now in testing the toilet preparations ! I was still turning the matter over in my mind when our cab stopped in front of the Crystal Palace , and Count Heinie assisted us to alight . Behind him , as if appearing by magic , stood Captain Middleton . In a daze I watched Aunt Sissy take Bay 's arm while Count Heinie offered his arm to me , and we followed them . I noticed that the Empress had pulled down her veil as she turned around to us and remarked that on account of the great crowds we easily might become separated . It would , perhaps , be a good idea if each couple would go-their own way , later meeting at a bar which Heinie and Middleton seemed to know very well . Immediately the Empress and Middleton became completely lost in the crowd . My face must have betrayed some anxiety for Aunt Sissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , Baroness Marie , you are really very , very young yet . " His words sounded entirely too condescending to my ears , and I retorted : " I beg your pardon , Count , but I shall be seventeen next month . " " What a ripe old age ! " my huge escort exclaimed mockingly . DURING the whole performance I tried to discover Aunt Sissy and Captain Middleton somewhere in the audience , but I could not find them . To add to my uneasiness , when we reached the appointed meeting place after the performance , Aunt Sissy and Captain Middleton had not yet arrived . " I wonder what happened , " I murmured nervously . For answer Count Heinie shot another inlulgent glance at me ; then to relieve me of my obvious anxiety he started to tell me amusing anecdotes , and he told them very well indeed . Nevertheless I could not help consulting my watch now and then , and in my mind I was already trying to formulate some course of action if the Empress of Austria-Hungary actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He emptied a full beaker of ale while I sipped at a tiny glass of creme de menthe . At last the door opened , and Aunt Sissy and her escort came toward us . The Empress did not seem tired at all . She was in the best humor and without sitting down she proposed , " Let 's go somewhere for a bite . " Under no circumstances would she return to the hotel so early . I was aghast . This certainly did n't sound at all like Aunt Sissy , who was usually so very  | careful about keeping sensible hours . Count Heinie , with a deep bow , suggested in a half whisper , " Would Your Majesty graciously accept my invitation for a little supper ? " His boldness startled me . I expected a frown from Aunt Sissy , but to my great surprise her face was wreathed in smiles as she accepted . Heinie explained that he would take us to a very exclusive little restaurant where the Empress could depend upon remaining incognito . " Very well , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they take us for cocottes , Marie ? But that should n't worry us on a night like this , now should it ? " I was dumbfounded . Aunt Sissy seemed an utterly changed person ; true , she was still imperial , but somehow she seemed so human . The greatest surprise was still in store for me . A few hansom cabs were parked outside . Without hesitating a second Aunt Sissy stepped into the first , followed by Middleton . She closed the low doors and smiled at Heinie and me mischievously . I was so startled that my escort literally had to lift me into the second cab , all smiles at my helplessness . Heinie talked incessantly , repeating time and again that the poor Empress was certainly entitled to a little freedom occasionally ? a taste of that freedom which other mortals enjoyed every blessed day of their lives . " Being an Empress does not mean that she should n't have her fling for once , " he wound up . It dawned upon me that Aunt Sissy was cer- , tainly having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of liberty . At the restaurant she , who never dined late at night , consumed one caviar canape after another with great gusto . She even went so far as to drink champagne with it . When fried chicken served , the Empress helped herself to a larger portion than I had ever seen on her plate before , partaking of more champagne with the poultry . Finally the Captain arose and took his leave . It was in the wee hours of the ' morn when Aunt Sissy and I arrived at the hotel , followed in a second hansom cab by Count Heinie riding in lonely splendor once more . . THE next morning , driving to the station , THE Empress , asked me , " Well , Marie , what kind of time did you have ? " " Simply great , Auntie , only there were so many surprises they almost took my breath away . I must have acted rather stupidly : " Well , you 'll learn , Marie , you 'll learn , " Aunt Sissy said , throwing me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awhile I like to go my own way without dragging a whole trait of pompous chamberlains and liveried lackeys behind me . And our running into Bay Middle ton ? that certainly was funny , was n't it ? Ii some people would only know of it , my . would n't gossip unhinge their jaws ! " Aunt Sissy expressed herself colorfully in the Viennese vernacular . She threw her arm around me and hugged me for a second . " It was wonderful , Marie , simply wonderful ! " There was still one last surprise in store for me . When we returned to Combermere Abbey , none other than Captain Middleton stood at the front gate . Later Count Heinie told meptobably so that I should not make a faux pas ? that Bay supposedly had visited somewhere in the neighborhood the day before and had re- d turned on the night train . There was a merry twinkle in his eyes when he gave me this piece of information . For the last dinner at Combermere Abbey the Empress donned a simple lilac-colored crepe-de-chine gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aunt Sissy asked me to sing a few songs , among them " The Last Rose of Summer . " Aunt Sissy , who sat between Middleton and Count Johann von Larisch , arose after a few moments and , with only a nod to all of us , rushed from the music salon . As usual I followed her to the staircase to kiss her goodnight , but contrary to custom she beckoned to me to follow her upstairs . Once in her room the Empress broke into wild weeping , oblivious of ,  | the presence of her waiting woman . I indicated to the servant to leave us alone and drew Aunt Sissy to me in a tender embrace . It was my turn to play comforter . She shook with sobs and was far more unstrung than months before , when Bay had left Godollo . Gradually the Empress regained some of her composure . Reclining upon a chaise longue , still crying softly , her voice was so stifled with tears as to be almost inaudible . " Tomorrow everything ; will be over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony of a prison existence . . . Here , at least , I am not watched all the time . Nobody spies on me . The servants are trained to see nothing . . Why , oh why , ca n't I break my neck ? Why ca n't I dash in my skull so I may have peace at least ? " Again she broke out into hysterical sobs . I racked my brains how I might best console her . " But , Aunt Sissy , " I finally ventured , " remember that Valerie will be so happy to have you home again . " Intuitively I had hit upon the right thing . Being with Auntie day and night , I had come to understand what she meant by the Curse of the Crown . She simply craved little human interludes from time to time . They were like mileposts on her life 's journey , encouraging her to continue along the thorny road of royalty . " You are right , my darling , " she murmured , jerking into an upright position . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Valerie will be so happy . . . She is all I have ... I have nothing . . . nothing else in this world . " Then she changed completely . Anxiously she glanced in the mirror . " Heavens , I 've cried myself into a red nose , and look at the hour ! You , too , should have been in bed long ago . Do n't forget , tomorrow will be a strenuous day . THE next day we were to leave early in the afternoon . Luncheon was to be served as usual promptly at noon . At eleven o'clock Captain Middleton was formally conducted to the upper hall to take leave of Her Majesty because he would not accompany us to London . But when I came downstairs for luncheon at five minutes of twelve , I found Count Heinie nervously pacing back and forth . So far there had not been the slightest sign that luncheon would be served on schedule . " What shall I do if Middleton does n't come down on time ? " he whispered to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably complacent . " Go upstairs and fetch him , " I advised . Count Heinie shook his head . " No , I ca n't do that , " he demurred . " Could n't you go up ? " " Certainly not . Aunt Sissy gave me no such orders . " Heine resumed his nervous pacing while the footmen and waiters stood at their posts like so many statues . " I do n't know what to do . I do n't know what to do , " he mumbled , consulting his watch again and again . Suddenly he straightened up and walked out of the room . I looked after him . I certainly did not envy him his ticklish job . Recalling the scene of the night before , I feared that Aunt Sissy would take her last te " te-a-tete with Bay very much to heart . Casually I flipped pages of a magazine to hide my dread . At last Heinie came downstairs again , Middleton trailing behind him . I looked at the Captain and although at first I felt like laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of utter woe . To all appearances he had cried . His usually proud bearing had given way to one of utter dejection . Bay seemed a broken man . The change in him was so obvious that I carefully looked around to see whether anybody else had observed it . But the well-trained servants never seemed to see anything amiss . Another half hour passed before the Empress 's valet de chambre came to announce that Her Majesty would not appear for luncheon .  | Aunt Sissy joined us only when the carriages were already before the door to take us to the station . She stepped into the hall , every inch an Empress , addressing a few friendly words to the major domo and graciously nodding to the rest of the servants lined up in front of the gate . In the carriage she turned to me and with a deep sigh remarked ; " Play-acting , my dear child , is the sad lot of those who wear a crown . " At the station in London the Austro-Hungarian ambassador came to pay his respects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth crossing , the Empress kissed me goodbye . While l was proceeding to Munich , she was off for Amsterdam to undergo one of her occasional mysterious cures ? this time a massage treatment ? and we would not meet again before the summer at Feldafing . BACK in Munich I soon discovered that while there were still plans under way to marry me off , Prince Herbert von Bismarck was no longer considered eligible . The reason for his elimination was the strong objection on the part of King Ludwig II , who , as the head of the royal family , meanwhile had been consulted . His Majesty was firmly opposed to any member of his family marrying the son of the Iron Chancellor , an objection that sprang from the old Wittelsbach-Hohenzollern jealousy . Through the political astuteness of Prince Bismarck , during the Franco-Prussian war , the royal Bavarian house had lost out against the Berliners . King Wilhelm of Prussia had been proclaimed German Emperor at Versailles , and not King Ludwig , as the southern states had hoped . I was told that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned Prince Herbert as a possible candidate for my hand , King Ludwig thundered , " I would rather see your daughter dead than married to a Bismarck . " The unfortunate King a few years later ? alas , much too late ! ? was to appeal to the Iron Chancellor to save him from his so-called friends . No sooner had the latest scheme fallen through than Tame Kiinigin ? Aunt Marie ? erstwhile Queen of Naples and the Two Sicilies , invited me to visit her in Paris for a few weeks . I was overjoyed . I knew that she had a very tender spot for me , perhaps because I looked very much like her . Always she called me her " little girl . " I loved her dearly , almost as much as my own mother . For me Aunt Marie was restfulness personified . Contrary to her sister Elzabeth , who was much more vivacious , sarcastic , and witty , Queen Marie was invariably even-tempered . Her dark , soulful eyes never failed to make a deep impression upon me , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only had Queen Marie been forced to enact the part of the Heroine of Gaeta during the harrowing days when her husband lost his throne to the newly united Italy ; destiny decreed also that she play the leading role in a love tragedy . While the first part of the drama has been written in the pages of history , the second part has remained untold until now . Aunt Marie was the last " picture bride " of royal blood . Never since she was sacrificed on the altar of dynastic considerations has another princess been married off in so absurd a fashion . It was in the fall of 1858 that discreet inquiries were made by King Ferdinand II and Queen Marie Cristina of Savoy to ascertain whether Duke and Duchess Maximilian of Bavaria would be ready to give their daughter Marie in marriage to Francis , Duke of Calabria , Crown Prince of Naples and the Two Sicilies . Both royal families scarcely knew each other personally ; the young people had never even met . Nevertheless my grandparents answered with an unconditional yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his paternal side Francis was a  | Bourbon ; on his mother 's side he was related to the Sardinian royal house . Most important of all , he was the heir apparent to an old and honored kingdom constituting a considerable part of beautiful Italy . Aunt Marie was never consulted in the matter ? merely told , and no sooner had word of her assent reached Naples than Count Ludolff , trusted minister of King Ferdinand II , appeared in Munich to tender the official proposal of marriage . He was received by my grandfather with great ceremony . The Count presented to the eighteen-year-old princess , on a purple velvet cushion , a miniature of her future husband , five years her senior . - The picture showed the Duke of Calabria in the smart uniform of the Hussars of the Guard , looking extremely impressive . My Aunt Marie never conceived the idea that she should be asked ; she was satisfied that her parents wanted what was best for her , and that her future husband was , to all appearances , a fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen betrothed were married by substitutes , as was then the custom for royal unions in the Bourbon family . Marie , Duchess of Bavaria , thus became the picture bride of Francis Marie Leopold , Duke of Calabria and Crown Prince of Naples and the Two Sicilies . King Maximilian of Bavaria and the Queen led the bride to the altar , with the King 's brother Luitpold substituting for the absent groom . Five clays later Aunt Marie left for Naples , accompanied by her brother Ludwig and some gentlemen and ladies-in-waiting . AT THAT time the liberation movement in Italy had developed to the extent where it was quickly approaching its ultimate consummation . After Ferdinand II died in May , 18J9 , . the Crown Prince precariously clung to the royal scepter for eighteen months . He was compelled to leave his country when Garibaldi 's red shirts advanced on the capital . The royal pair fled to Gaeta , but it proved impossible to hold the fortress . In the heat of the bloody battle Aunt Marie rushed on errands of mercy through the rain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning the epithet of " Heroine of Gaeta . " After the fortress finally capitulated on February 13 , 1861 , the royal pair found sanctuary under the protection of Pope Pius 1X . What did it profit Aunt Marie that German princesses , expressing their appreciation for her striking heroism , sent her a laurel wreath of pure gold ? Not only was she now a Queen without a throne ; she was also a woman without love . While the strain of the great historical , drama in which she had played such an important part had lasted , she was spared the full force of the artificiality of her marriage ties to the king . But when all the excitement subsided , she discovered the appalling emptiness of her life . Francis II was far from being the good-looking , dashing officer the miniature had made him out to be . Besides , the defense of his throne during the last two years had left the king little time for love-making . After he had been deposed he became sickly and morose . While Aunt Marie was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed by political intrigues aiming at the restoration of his rule . At this difficult juncture in their marital relations the young woman of twenty-one fled into the arms of a fascinating Belgian officer . Later Aunt Marie left the King to return to her native Bavaria , presumably suffering from some pulmonary ailment . In reality she retired to the Ursulines ' Convent in Augsburg to give birth to a love child , Daisy . Before tongues could be set a-wagging outside intimate court circles , a reconciliation between the Queen and the King was effected . In the spring of 1877 when I journeyed to Paris to visit Aunt Marie and Uncle Francis , over fifteen years had passed since that interlude . The royal couple meanwhile had @#  | grown to regard each other with a kindly , if somewhat resigned , tolerance . When I arrived in Paris , chaperoned by Mademoiselle Bertha , I did not expect Aunt Marie and the King to meet me , as it was late at night . Nevertheless the royal couple awaited me at the station . Uncle Francis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt immediately at home as we drove up to an oldfashioned but cozy dwelling ; its very simplicity was impressive . Despite the late hour a sou per was served , and I could see how time had healed old wounds . After almost two decades of married life Aunt and Uncle had grown very much attached to each other . Always ailing , the ex-king was on a very strict diet , and every bite of food he consumed was watched by Aunt Marie . If Uncle Francis ordered a dish not on his diet list , the ex-Queen , like any good rife , would admonish him . And the King would desist a bit regretfully ... like any other husband . After all the curious young girl 's ideas I had entertained about these two , this little domestic scene touched me greatly . The first day of my Paris sojourn , Aunt Marie took me on a long drive into one of Paris 's beautiful suburbs . There in a comfortable cottage I made the acquaintance of Daisy . A beautiful , but all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a painting depicting a dashing young officer . Remembering that my aunt had been a refugee in the Ecclesiastical States , I recognized the colorful uniform as that of a captain of the Papal Zouaves . " That is my father , " Daisy explained to me . I did not dare to question her , for I did not know how much or how little I was supposed to know of her origin , especially as Aunt Marie , when speaking of Daisy to me , always alluded to her as " a sweet young girl friend of mine . " Whether Daisy knew the ex-Queen was 1 her mother , I am not at all certain ; she always addressed her as " Ma cherie . " Later I grew bold enough to ask Auntie for Daisy 's full name . The ex-Queen explained calmly , " Her father was Count de Lavayss , member of an old Belgian family . " And then we talked about something else . I HAD come to Paris unaware of any marriage plans on the part of my royal relatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me to the best modistes and most expensive couturieies , I thought that all these preparations were for the approaching May races , to which Uncle Francis always referred as " that great exhibition of horses and women . " At the very last minute , however , Aunt Marie admitted to me that she was not only dressing me up for the races , but also to make the best possible im- ' pression on the young Duke of Norfolk whom I should meet . To marry me off to the secular head of the English Catholics was the pet idea of King Francis II . Without saying it in so many words , he nevertheless made it very clear to me that the Duke of Norfolk would be a brilliant match . " Why these incessant plans ? " I pleaded . Aunt Marie shrugged her shoulders . " Of course , Aunt Sissy would he so glad to see you married , " ? and after a little pause she added , " happily , I mean . " " Do n't I know it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man of the Empress 's choice must be my choice also . Softly Aunt Marie Sophie explained to me that in case I should become interested in the young Duke , she and Uncle Francis would take me to London for the season . But if these new marriage plans should come to naught , I would return to Munich and join Aunt Sissy at Feldafing later . On our way to the race track , where I was to meet the Duke of Norfolk , Uncle Francis made it a special point to inform me that the English nobleman was the possessor of the precious necklace of Mary Stuart , Queen af Scots . I did not dare to show it openly . but by now I was actually amused by all these  | frantic machinations , watching them with an air of detachment amounting to indifference . The Duke turned out to be a rather nice young chap . Apparently he neither had a clear idea of who I was nor did he know of the plans in which he played so prominent a part . We shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. , If on that day I could have looked into they future , I would have thanked Aunt Marie and Uncle Francis on bended knees for troubling to introduce me to the Duke of Norfolk . I would have made myself as agreeable as possible to become his Duchess . But foolishly I snubbed the rather pleasant young man , and instead of becoming the protected chatelaine of stately Arundel , I inadvertently took a hand in steering myself toward the cliffs of matrimonial disaster . Instead of the necklace of Mary , Queen of Scots , I was to wear a crown of thorns .
