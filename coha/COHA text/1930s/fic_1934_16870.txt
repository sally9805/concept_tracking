As the clerk exits he offers the Countess a chair . She accepts and seating herself , takes a cigarette from a case which Nash lights . The woman is an ultra sophisticate and accepts his attentions as nothing more than she is accustomed to . Replacing the case she looks at him quite casually , with no feeling . She comes to the point quickly . &nbsp; COUNTESS RENIERShe told you of my tremendous admiration for one of your gowns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else ..... ?  --  73  --  The Countess is placid and persistent .

I have never seen such excitement . It is like the race to Marne ! There are horns , confetti ... it is wonderful . Cocoa gurgles with delight . It seems that she is more impressed with Victor 's feat than with Victor himself . Nash is strangely silent . Being relegated to the background irritates him . There is no jealousy in his attitude but simply resentment at being reduced to comparative unimportance in the excitement of Victor 's achievement .
