txt Mr. Calvin Coolidge , former President of the United States . missed on at his home here today . His passing was discovered by Mrs. Coolidge when she returned from a shopping tour . Mr. Coolidge sent to his office as usual this morning , but returned home , accompanied by his secretary , about 10 o'clock . Calvin Coolidge was a leading figure in the political life of Massachusetts and the nation and he was also a man who , in the midst of an active and visible career , grew to be a legend and a symbol . People , hearing his name , had Immediately a picture of stanchness , of Spartan strength , of thrift and frugality , a man upon whom people might safely lean their trust . It was often said of him that he was a humorless man , but no one could really believe that upon knowing him . At the circus he gazed at the many-ton sea elephant and commented , simply , " big . " He lacked the loquaciousness of many a New Englander , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le did make . He was a neat man , In character and bearing . He wore his ' othes with a precise neatness , and li , s hair , of a certain raffish sandy eclor , he pasted close to his round head with meticulous care . He walked neatly , with his hands hanging straight down at his sides , and his steps short , precise and directed . His sharp blue eyes took in everything within a wide range of vision though they often stowed away what they saw without comment , as their owner stowed away for quiet reflection , the torrents of comment and advice and opinion poured into his ears by the people who eddied and flowed about him . It has been said that the Boston police strike made Calvin Coolidge . But there are those who like to think that the rock-bound hills of Vermont made him , and the long line of frugal , God-fearing , simple forbears who still lay their mark upon the State . Certainly , however , it was that short pronouncement  --  that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which placed Calvin Coolidge 's feet squarely on the path which could lead him nowhere else but to the office of Chief Executive . When he left the White House , after a career in which he became in the midst of so many oddities of individuality , a popular President , he left it determined to savor the charms of an actual private life thenceforth , He associated himself with the New York Life Insurance Company , because he believed in its functions , as contributing the greatest benefit to mankind that can come from investment . He was made a member of a board to investigate and offer suggestions for the solution of railroad difficulties , and he accepted that Job because he believed in it . He had the instinct to make himself quietly useful and he had no idea that a man has ever the right to refuse to be of service where he can , so long as he shall live . In Northampton , to which town he retired , he was a familiar figure along Main Street . His rather close-lipped " good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and neighbors , and the inevitable strings of curiosity seekers , had behind them a Coolidge warmth , which , if it glowed palely to some , was nevertheless honest and sincere and wholehearted to him . He passed quietly as ho.lived ; outside the clamor . He was a simple man , born of simple bill people ; he did his duty , as simply as he could .
