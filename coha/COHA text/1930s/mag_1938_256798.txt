Twenty years ago the title of " world 's most famous musician " belonged to a shockheaded Pole named Ignace Jan Paderewski . Flame-haired Virtuoso Paderewski was the greatest pianist of his time and one of its most lionized personalities . Women swooned at his concerts , pursued him to beg a lock of his long red-gold hair . Kings and cabbageheads applauded him . Even among people who never went near a concert hall " Paderoosky " was a name to conjure with . <P> When the World War broke out Pianist Paderewski 's career took an abrupt turn . A fervent patriot , he foresaw a chance for the independence of his native Poland , dedicated his every effort to this cause . His acquaintance with nearly all the powerful and famous figures of the world made him Poland 's best ambassador . At War 's end Poland was free , and Paderewski virtually retired from the concert platform to become its first Premier . <P> Today , 77-year-old , white-haired Paderewski lives quietly in a sprawling baroque villa at Merges , Switzerland . His careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long past . This week , with the collaboration of Actress-Author Mary Lawton , he publishes a volume of memoirs* covering the first of these two careers ( 1860-1914 ) , promises another volume at a later date . <P> Unlike many famous musicians , Paderewski was no infant prodigy . Though he took piano , violin , cello and even trumpet lessons at an early age , his teachers at the Warsaw Conservatory considered him a promising composer rather than a concert artist . Not until he was 28 did he manage to make his debut in-Paris ; even then he knew only enough music to fill one program . Debutant Paderewski had to go back and learn more pieces before he could appear again . But this he did with dogged determination , and soon the musical world began to realize that the composer of the famous Minuet could also play the piano a little better than anybody else in the world . <P> Though Patriot-Pianist Paderewski has lived to see his dreams of Polish independence realized and himself a legend in the history of music , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts most fondly turn . " The passing of that great period , the nineties , " he muses , " brought to a close a tremendous era , a flowering of all that was most beautiful and elegant in life . We shall not see its like again . " <P> <P> * THE PADEREWSKI MEMOIRS-Paderewski and Mary Lawton-Scribner ( $3.75 ) .
