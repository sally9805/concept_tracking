txt The question of what relation , if any , the earlier model announcements and the earlier automobile show dates have had upon the current slump in new cars sales and the seasonal record high accumulations of used car stocks is being studied extensively here . Manufacturers , both individually and through the Automobile Manufacturers Association , are gathering and collating all available evidence and opinions to determine whether or not it would be advisable to return the new model introductory period to January , or change It to a later date . While the attitude of the A. M. A. and of most of that group 's members is that the October and November new model presentation dates have been successful in levelling out factory production and in stabilizing factory employment , there is little doubt that a change in date will be made if it is found that majority of dealers wish it . To date , a dealer survey being made by Automotive Daily News , a trade publication , shows that more than 60% of the dealers replying favor a return to January show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% November and only 4% October . Prior to 1935 , the industry 's new models for many years had been formally introduced in January of each year ; in 1935 and 1936 , the new models made their bows in November , and last year the season was advanced to late October . Current Model Sales Hit Chief dealer objections to the earlier new model seasons , as shown by the News ' poll and as learned from other sources , are that the fall shows cut in on the model 's merchandising while it still is going strong , " that the fall rush of new car buying overloads dealers with heavy used car stocks which they must carry through the dull winter selling season until the spring upturn , and that the public 's normal tendency is to buy new cars in the spring rather than in the fall . Officially , the National Automobile Dealers Association has taken no stand on the question . Oft the record , executives are of the personal opinion that the choice of dates as between fourth quarter and first quarter new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitation now underway by dealers seeking a change in date will receive N. A. D. A. support if the agitation evinces signs of having majority dealer support . Dealers and factory officials agree that much of the current break in new car sales is directly traceable to the used car situation . They point out that prospective customers for new cars , majority of whom possess 1937 , 1936 or 1935 models , in many cases are experiencing difficulty in finding dealers who will make them satisfactory trade-in-offers . Partly , this is because the market for the late model and relatively higher priced second and third hand cars is slower than the used car market as a whole . - More on . Hand This Year An even greater deterrent to dealers ' accepting consumers ' cars on trades for -- new cars is the fact that the country 's approximately 45,000 new car dealers have inventories of between 700,000 to 800,000 used cars on hand , according to trade estimates , or 150,000 to 200,000 more than at this time a year ago . As a consequence of this sharp gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used cars that they hesitate to tie up any additional substantial portions of their funds in merchandise that they normally would n't expect to move in volume before spring at the earliest . Factories know from field reports that desires are holding up new car sales until the used ears start selling and that despite the general business recession , more new cars would be sold if the used car situation were improved . Thus there is basis to believe that if spring brings its usual sharply higher turn for used car volume . and prices , new car sales now being frozen up will break loose in many new orders to the factories . Meantime , the manufacturers are devoting their beat advertising and promotional efforts to the sales of dealers ' used stocks . Factory field men of moat companies for the past several weeks have concentrated upon used cars , rather than upon their normal job of selling new cars , and some manufacturers already are reporting that the campaign is having a favorable reaction . New Car Stocks Exceed 300,000 New car stocks in dealers ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dealers ' association and at 400.000 by the manufacturers ' association . While such inventories are the largest since 1930 , and show an increase of around 10% to 15% above this time last year , they would not be abnormally large in terms of the average monthly rate of turnover in 1937 . It is the slower rate of turnover rather than the large stocks that has slowed down dealer orders to the factory and factory output , and it will ibe an increased rate of turnover rather than a substantial reduction of dealer new car stocks that will step up production . in the belief of representative factory officials here . For this reason , the immediate reduction of used car stocks is more important to the industry than the immediate reduction of new car totals . If the used cars move , the new cars virtually sell themselves ; this is the feeling of representative factory officials and dealers . There are scattering reports of sacrifice liquidation of used car stocks in various parts of the country and downward adjustments are going forward almost constantly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car dealers are effectively held within limits by the trade-in factor . Factory-dealer cooperation in handling used cars undoubtedly could be more successful if the factories were n't faced with the danger of having - its. efforts being , construed as : coercive by the House subcommittee now investigating whether charges that the industry is coercive in its relations with its dealers are worth a Federal Trade Comre insion investigation .
