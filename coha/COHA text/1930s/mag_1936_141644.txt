Baron Bror Blixen-Finecke is a distant cousin of Denmark 's King Christian . His first wife is a middle-aged woman named Ellen , who divorced him in 1921 , wrote best-selling Seven Gothic Tales in 1934 under the pseudonym Isak Dinesen . Baron Bror 's second wife is a pert , pretty , English girl of 28 , named Eva , who spends most of her time seeking adventure . During one long trek alone in Africa , her automobile broke down . She had to be pushed by natives for 32 days . In Ethiopia last year she watched the war . <P> Early last summer the Baroness decided to cap these exploits by flying the North Atlantic . In July she arrived in Manhattan with a dour , 31-year-old Swedish pilot named Kurt Bjorkvall and the backing of the Stockholm Tidningen-Dagblad . Acquiring an old Bellanca high-wing monoplane with one motor , they announced they would fly from Floyd Bennett Field to Stockholm . <P> Ten times the airship Hindenburg flew the Atlantic . Two Lufthansa flying boats made the trip twice . Beryl Clutterbuck Markham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pilot Dick Merrill went over and back . Meantime the Blixen-Bjorkvall Bellanca , loaded with ping-pong balls like Harry Richman 's Lady Peace , never left the ground . Its take-off for Stockholm was constantly postponed , apparently because the pair were finicky about the weather . This did not bother Baroness Blixen-Finecke . The blonde noblewoman was having so much fun partying on Long Island that she could not find time even to complete her radio lessons . <P> Last week , tired of the delay , the Tidningen-Dagblad suddenly withdrew its backing . Behind the Baroness 's back , Pilot Bjorkvall bought the plane himself . <P> At a Long Island party two nights later , Baroness Eva was tipped off that he was about to take off alone . Bundling into flying togs , she dashed at dawn to Floyd Bennett Field where Pilot Bjorkvall at first would not speak to her . Eventually she cornered him in a hangar from which she presently emerged in tears . Said she . " I 'm grounded . ... I expect he wishes to have all the publicity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not swear . " <P> Said he : " What the hell ! I better fly solo . I 'll take a chance . But having a woman with you ... is too much responsibility . If I get drowned , okay . But if she gets drowned , there 'd be trouble . " <P> Flyer Bjorkvall did not drown , but he nearly did . After fighting heart-breaking weather for 2,400 befogged and snowy miles , he suddenly found his engine overheating . With great luck he encountered a French trawler , succeeded in plopping safely into the chop beside her . Gushed he by wireless next day : " I felt myself being lifted over the rail while a voice cried , ' Courage , mon brave ! ' I believe that , for the first time in my life , I must have fainted . " <P> Sniffed Baroness Eva Blixen-Finecke : " I 'm sorry I did not go along . I would not mind a little water . "                @ @ @ @ @
