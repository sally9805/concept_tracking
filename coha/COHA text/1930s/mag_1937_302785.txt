Since last spring when a Berkeley , Calif , surgeon sawed two holes in her skull " to let out the pain , " as she understood the purpose of the operation , Dema Dunlap , 23 , a buxom , introspective epileptic , had an irresistible compulsion to finger her scalp where it lay sewn over the trephine holes . The soft spots , yielding under pressure of her finger tips , felt like the germinal depressions of a coconut . <P> Dr. Erich Kosterlitz had trephined the girl as a last effort to cure her of epilepsy . Sedatives and confinement in an asylum had failed to help her . He concluded that pressure on her brain caused her condition and that he might relieve that pressure by removing pieces of skull over her right temple . <P> After her operation , Dema Dunlap suffered few epileptic attacks , but more headaches . A week ago her head seemed ready to burst . Fingering her right temple seemed to help . The harder she pressed the better her head felt . An idea developed in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 316 in. in diameter . The sharp point of this she pressed into her scalp over a trephine hole . It hurt a little , but it made her feel better . Reaching her left hand over her head , she held the spike in position and with her right fist pounded the spike into her brain as far as it would go , Except for the trifling pain in the scalp she felt nothing , because the tissue of the brain is insensate . <P> The rest of that day she behaved in her usual introspective way . She went to bed and slept as usual , rose as usual . Next day she casually told her mother what she had done . Her mother drove Dema Dunlap to Dr. Kosterlitz , who refused to believe the young woman 's story until he saw the projecting butt of the spike . He rushed her to a hospital where he extracted the nail . Then she fainted . There was some chance for her recovery , for a person can live with a large part of his brain gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who lived for many years after an explosion drove a crowbar clear through his head . In Louisville lives a woman who had the front lobes of her brain removed on account of an abscess of the brain . In fact , Dr. Kosterlitz was sanguine about his patient . Said he : " If she lives , the shock of the injury may cure her . Such things have happened in epileptic cases . " But removal of the spike permitted a hemorrhage in Dema Dunlap 's brain , from which four days later she died . <P> Los Angeles last week had a perforated brain almost as bizarre as Berkeley 's . Someone drove a knife into the head of one Frank Hill , Negro , and broke off the handle ( see cut ) . The victim 's skull was so thick that the surgeons could not pull out the blade without wriggling it , and wriggling would tear his brain irreparably . The surgeons therefore sawed the man 's skull around the blade , lifted bone and blade together , expected uneventful recovery .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
