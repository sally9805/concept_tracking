txt Outwardly , Canton still appears to be fundamentally intact after many months of intensive Japanese air-raids . Although there is hardly a district in the vast city which was not hit by bombs , the hundreds of places of destruction do not seem to show very much . There is not a single street In which some houses have not been hit , and most of them are poor dwellings , while almost all major buildings , such as Government quarters and key positions in the city 's economic life that were the targets of the Japanese airplanes , ? escaped unscathed . " iihe only exceptions seem to be the few modern factories which had been constructed in recent years . On them the Japanese had concentrated their attacks with especial The big cement , plant , a small chemical factory , a big textile mill , and a new power , plant have been virtually destroyed . So *ye the railway stations . But trains - are running just the same , and the main lune- air-raids at night as well as in daytime I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poor people who fled the city or who al e now preparing to do so , seem to be motivated primarily by economic reasons . For there is almost no work for them to do ; savings they do not have . prices are rising , and the natural react ion to all this is an attempt to get , back to the villages from which their families came , in order to survive . It can not be denied that responsibility for the paralysis of all economic activities which have not diiectly to do with carrying on the war , lies mainly with the well-to-do classes . They were the first to leave . For weeks on end , even before the recent intensification of the Japanese air-raids , they packed up their valuables , closed and bolted their shops and houses , exchanged their money against Hong Kong dollars the process , and took the river boats for the haven of the near-by British colony . Even most of those men who had to stay behind because they are officials of some kind do not seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , not into the interior , but to Hong Kong , and thus to intensify All this seems not only to have robbed the majority of the people of their precarious means of livelihood , but also to have somewhat dampened their spirit of patriotism and their will of resistance against the Japanese . The old Chinese tendency of putting the welfare of the family before that of the state has been enhanced in the masses by those very circles whose superior education and whose much professed enthusiasm for the cause of China 's national independence ought to have made them the active supporters of the city 's morale . The patriotic letters these better-class refugees write to the Hong ' Kong newspapers , while they fill the expensive hotels , apartments , restaurants , and places of recreation in the Colony , are being sneered at in Canton , Nor doe ; it seem that the Government authorities are ciflite free from blame . Those of the Province of Kwangtung and of the Canton Municipality have obviously failed in many regards . They allowed , and still allow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever they like . They have not controlled the black exchange market so as to prevent the exodus of people and capital to comfortable Hong Kong in preference of the interior . During the 11 months of war and continual threat from Japanese bombers , they have done nothing to provide shelters and dug-outs for anybody but officials ( " the city is too crowded to allow for such constructions " ) , and they have taken very few measures indeed to keep up the spirit of the man in the street in his futile search for safety and livelihood . Another failure which has much to do with the growing tendency of indifference and apathy in a city which not by chance but by temperament had been the cradle of China 's national revolution , is that of effectively suppressing espionage and treason within its gates . Martial law is only superficially enforced . An Open Book to Japanese As everybody is free to go to , and to come back from , Hong Kong , almost without any control , it is not surprising that the enemy should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one place to another and about other locations of interest to their raiders as well as developments in Canton generally . Treason is a more or less open activity in Canton which tends to discourage the hopes of those who stick to the guns . It is not easy for the outsider to decide whether the National Government has to be blamed for the paralysis and the lack of real war atmosphere in the hard-suffering city of Canton . But it is a fact that the popular view is more and more turning toward such a view . Was it really impossible for Chiang Kai-shek to spare a number of airplanes and a greater quantity of anti-air guns for Canton ? Did not the National Government underestimate the dangers which were threatening China 's largest remaining city and her only open gate to the outside world Canton and Kwangtung Province are not yet beyond hope . But it will require a supreme effort on the part of China itself , and a firm stand of the Western powers who ought to be vitally interested in the survival of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to the rich South and Southwest of China , if the fate of the country is not to be sealed by the complete demoralization and the eventual loss to the Japanese of this last stronghold of potential national rehabilitation .
