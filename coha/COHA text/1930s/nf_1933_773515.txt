txt COMMUNICATION AGENCIES farm population , have combined to account for the changes that are occurring . In general , the extension of the Post Office organization , as depicted above , may be said to have resulted in : ( 1 ) Greater accessibility to convenient mail facilities for a continuously increasing proportion of the population ; ( 2 ) A gain in the regularity and frequency with which mail matter moves unimpeded through the postal machinery directly from the writer to the recipient . The Utilization of Postal Facilities. ? The postal structure has been reviewed ; it is somewhat more difficult to describe succinctly the utilization of the facilities that it offers . A thoroughgoing study of all types of material handled by the Post Office Department would be exceedingly laborious and involved , especially since the classification of mail matter for determination of rates is highly complex and intricate . There are , in general , four classes , to which innumerable special rates apply in given circumstances specified in Post Office Department regulations . Much of the matter handled through the mails ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no greater , significance , than freight or express handled upon the railroads . Its significance for communication is incidental , and is not considered further here . Of more importance are the newspapers , periodicals and books handled by mail , but for the distribution of which the postal service is but one among a number of competing agencies available to publishers . Data concerning the volume of such mail matter are at best partial and accordingly would be an inadequate index of the production and distribution of these forms of communication by printed word . They would be of little more value for present purposes than an analysis of the same material conveyed by motor truck , or by freight and express in railroad cars . ' Attention may therefore be limited primarily to first class mail , which includes letters , sealed parcels , government postal cards , and private mailing ( post ) cards . These THE POSTAL SERVICE constitute the major forms of message material.l The data are available which make it possible to analyze various trends in the growth of this class of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1908 , the Post Office Department has conducted systematic checks on the mail matter handled . By a sampling process , including one week in each quarter , it estimates with considerable accuracy the annual volume of the postal business . This volume is classified in a variety of ways , in addition to the " breakdown " into the four major classes , and the subclasses , upon which the rate structure of the Post Office Department is based . Its classification of first class mail includes , for each sub-class , an estimate of the total weight in pounds and the weight per piece ; the number of pieces , local and non-local , in each category , with the average weight of each ; the average haul of non-local pieces ; and the weight and number of pieces of franked and penalty matter . ( Distributions between sub-classes of first class mail do not always extend throughout the compilations . ) Estimates are given for the country as a whole , and the totals of the samples for the cities and towns in which they are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1926 , are published each year in the Cost Ascertainment Reports from which data in Table 37 are drawn . Although the studies are undertaken primarily in order that the cost of handling the mails may be ascertained and allocated among the several classes of mail matter , they provide data of considerable value for detailed analysis of selected aspects of social organization and communication . The data , reveal in general , an increasing frequency of contacts between individuals . Both total and per capita volume of first class mail ( lines 1 and 9 ) show marked net increases between 1908 and 1931.2 This probably reflects , COMMUNICATION AGENCIES 1908 1923 1926 1927 Number of pieces-first class ( in millions ) 7,103 13,167 15,266 16,284 1 .

Total number outgoing , except publishers ' second class in part , an increased use of the mail for commercial purposes ; declines in 1930 and 1931 were in response fo the 11:2 I THE POSTAL SERVICE business depression , in keeping with the general sensitivity of postal business to economic fluctuations . Local and Non-local Mail. - The hypothesis was advanced in Part I that , as a result of extended ownership and use of the automobile , " contacts within the community are multiplied out of proportion to contacts at a distance . " It was inferred that the substantiation of this 113 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES hypothesis would constitute a presumption that the intensification of local patterns of attitude and behavior would likewise be intensified as a result of the reinforcement they received . The data of Table 37 throw further light upon this hypothesis , by permitting comparison between local and non-local first class mail . The number of local letters per capita ( line 10 ) was 26.7 in 1923 and 41.1 in 1930 . In 1931 it dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the number of local contacts by mail increased during a period of prosperity . It is impossible to determine the extent to which non-local letters , including sealed packages ( line 11 ) , may have changed between the same years . Data concerning the number of pieces of non-local matter are limited to the years 1927 to 1931 inclusive , and during this period the change was slight . In 1931 the average individual received 31.5 local letters and 84.2 non-local letters and sealed packages . Analysis of changes in local and non-local first class mail indicates that local mail is more sensitive than non-local . Data are not available to establish the point , but it seems probable that the drop in 1931 in local first class mail is indicative of a decreasing number of commercial announcements and bills in the local mails . The relation between local and non-local categories may also be stated in terms of comparative weight . The weights of these , respectively , are given in lines 7 and 8 . Comparisons between " local " and " non-local , " whether by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratios given in lines 12 and 13 . The first express the numbers of local letters as decimal fractions of the numbers of nonlocal letters and sealed packages . The ratios in line 13 express the weights of all local first class matter as decimal fractions of the weights of all non-local first class matter . Until 1931 the changes shown were small and irregular , and there was in both sets of ratios a slight suggestion that the growth of local mail had been somewhat greater , proportionately , than the growth of non-local . The changes in these ratios in 1931 are curious . In conjunction with the corresponding data relating to numTHE POSTAL SERVICE hers and weights of the two classes of mail matter concerned , it appears that local letters remained nearly constant in aggregate weight , but declined sharply in number ; at the same time non-local letters and sealed packages declined in aggregate weight but increased in number . These changes , presumably related to the industrial situation during 1931 , lack adequate explanation . The problem whether the increase in mail contacts is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as represented by local mail ) or between individuals in separate communities ( non-local mail ) has been examined by an analysis of the distribution of local and non-local matter within the individual communities employed as a sample by the Post Office Department in procuring cost ascertainment data . The results are suggestive , though not as yet conclusive . It was assumed that the proportion of first class mail which is composed of local letters will , in any community , be related to the size of the population within the jurisdication of the central post office . An aggregate growth in the proportion of mail which is local is therefore to be expected with the growth in size of American communities , and such a growth has occurred . It can be stated , in addition , that , in general , between 1907 and 1923 , the smaller American communities , irrespective of growth in population ( holding size constant ) increased their ratios of local first class mail within the total , by weight , at a relatively more rapid rate than did the larger communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rural delivery routes , which in general have their loci in smaller communities , and deliveries on which are regarded as local to the communities out of which they extend . Further study is required to determine whether , with other variables held constant , mail contacts are becoming relatively more frequent between individuals living in the same community as compared with contacts outside . ' COMMUNICATION AGENCIES The Average Haul of Non-local Mail. ? When the transportation agencies were reviewed in Part I , it was observed that while contacts at a distance were increasing , those within more circumscribed areas were perhaps increasing at a still faster rate . Table 37 presents two types of evidence bearing upon the same general point . The distribution of first class mail between local and non-local destinations has already been discussed . Line 15 shows in addition the average haul of all non-local first class domestic pieces . In 1930 the average haul for each piece of such mail was 525 miles , in contrast to 507 miles in 1908 , but the maximum average haul was found in 1927 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 520 ; but air mail letters , which in that year had an average haul of 1,715 miles , were for the first time excluded from the general average.1 These figures suggest the distance to which contacts extend throughout the country , and become especially significant when it is considered that between two-thirds and threequarters of all first class mail received is non-local . THE POSTAL SERVICE While marked changes in average haul from year to year are not apparent , there are interesting differences among individual cities , groups of cities , and classes of offices . For example , the average hauls for the general post offices in New York , Detroit and Washington have consistently increased . ' Average hauls for Philadelphia and Brooklyn have tended downward . The figures in 1929 for these and other selected cities were as follows : New York , 711 ; Detroit , 616 ; Washington , 762 ; Philadelphia , 459 ; Brooklyn , 404 ; Boston , 514 ; Los Angeles , 1,167 ; San Francisco , 1,151 ; Kansas City , 571 ; Pittsburgh , 475 . The corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group A ( 14 largest offices in terms of receipts ) , 653 ; all Class I offices , 552 ; Class II offices , 427 ; Class III offices , 399 ; Class IV offices , 401.2 Several variables combine to determine the average haul of first class mail from any community . Geographical position is obviously important . For example , it is to be expected that the average haul of letters from San Francisco , at the continental extreme , will be greater than from Kansas City , near the geographical center of the country . Again , the volume and character of business mail will exert an influence . A financial and commercial center like New York will have a greater volume of distant correspondence than an industrial city like Pittsburgh . The character of population is also involved . Los Angeles , with many migrants and visitors from the east , who maintain contacts with their former homes , will almost certainly show this influence when the average haul of its outgoing mail is contrasted with that of a self-contained city on the eastern seaboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to complexity of business and industrial structure , this too is a factor , as indicated by the above com- COMMUNICATION AGENCIES parisons among offices grouped according to class of post office . Yet in addition to all of these factors there is reason to suspect an influence upon the average haul which is attributable to the comparative breadth of cultural boundaries . Thus Detroit is in a geographical position tending to reduce its average haul close to the minimum . Philadelphia is much farther from the center of population . Yet Detroit shows an average 107 miles greater than Philadelphia . It is not improbable that this reflects a wider range of contacts by the residents of the former city . Miscellaneous Utilizations. ? The remaining items in Table 37 require only brief comment . The number of government post cards ( line 5 ) and private mailing cards ( line 6 ) were not separated in the cost ascertainment report of 1908 . Taken together , they exhibited only a slight growth in the reports of later years , as compared with the total first class ( line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum and when measured in per capita terms is declining . The use of both , for certain social purposes , has ceased to be considered " good form . " No particular trend is discernable in the case of foreign mail ( line 18 ) , although the figure of 1931 was close to the maximum . The volume of franked and penalty matter ( lines 16 and 17 ) is interesting as evidence of the extent to which relationships are maintained between the government and its citizens . Franked matter , sent , for the most part , by representatives in Congress to their constituents , was in 1926 slightly more than three and a half times its volume in 1923 , but has declined in subsequent years . Penalty matter ( material sent out by government departments ) has remained fairly constant since 1923 , but achieved its maximum in 1931 . Utilization of Rural Services. ? The utilization of rural free delivery service , the growth of which was shown in Table 35 , has been , as was indicated earlier , an important factor in breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in establishing frequent and more regular communication with centers of population . In the I 118 I THE POSTAL SERVICE fiscal year ending June 30 , 1930 , it was estimated that 1,550,880,000 pieces of first class mail were delivered by rural carriers , which was 9.2 per cent of all first class domestic mail . ' The number of families served on rural routes at the mid-point of this year constituted 22.86 per cent of all families in the United States enumerated by the census of 1930.2 Thus it is clear that postal facilities are employed less extensively by rural families than by the general population . In 1904 there were 1.7 pieces of first class mail delivered on rural routes for every piece collected . The divergence between deliveries and collections has widened until in 1930 there was 3.0 pieces delivered for every piece collected . The latter ratio undoubtedly reflects the increase in business mail directed to the farmer , which has no counterpart originating in his own industry . Of all franked mail ( congressional free ) in the United States in 1930 , 21.6 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the proportion received of first class mail deliveries . That is , congressional correspondence has proportionately double the importance in the farmer 's mail that it has in the mail received by the general population . Penalty matter ( departmental free ) delivered to farmers was 9.1 per cent of all penalty matter , which is thus distributed to them in approximately the same proportion with which it is distributed in the mail matter of the population at large.3 Expedition of the Service. ? There is no average figure which will indicate the extent to which the transmission 119 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES of mail matter may have been accelerated since 1900 . The speed of transmission is partly dependent upon the frequency and speed of rail schedules , supplemented in the more recent years by motor vehicles ; and in part upon the efficiency and celerity of handling at points of collection and delivery , at junction points and at terminals . In general the time interval between posting and delivery has been reduced , in particular by such improvements in handling as are represented by the construction of postal tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of machine cancelling devices ; by more frequent collections and deliveries ; and by the sorting in railroad postal cars while in transit of larger proportions of the mail posted . ' The demand of the public for expeditious mail service is reflected in a growth of special delivery transactions from 5,191,594 in 1900 to 101,769,753 in 1930.2 The number for 1931 was 94,072,832 . The Air Mail. ? The most ambitious attempt to speed the mail service came with the introduction of air mail on May 15 , 1918 , when the first air mail route was established between New York and Washington , a distance of 218 miles . The growth of this service has been rapid , as shown in Table 38 . The first transcontinental mail trip between New York and San Francisco , September 8 , 1920 , bettered by 22 hours the best possible postal time by train . Night flying , made possible by the development of auxiliary aids to navigation discussed previously , has further speeded the air mail service . A letter posted in time to catch the 10:45 A.M. departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles ready for delivery at 7:42 A.M. the following morning . While business firms early took advantage of the speed afforded by the new postal medium , it is the opinion of postal authorities that in certain sections of the country , notably the west coast , the use of the air mail for social correspondence is developing rapidly . The Department attempts to stimulate this THE POSTAL SERVICE social utilization with its poster slogan , " It is correct to use air mail . " The dependability of air mail service is as yet unequal to that of other branches of the postal system ( Table 38 , COMMUNICATION AGENCIES column 5 ) . The percentage of scheduled miles of flight completed has remained fairly constant , with a norm slightly above 90 per cent . This means that nine-tenths of the planes started achieve their destination . It does not necessarily mean that these flights are completed on scheduled time . In addition to the domestic routes , extensions into foreign countries are authorized by the United States Post Office Department , notably around the Caribbean Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these routes totalled 18,064 miles . ' The more general implications of the data that have been discussed in this section will be elaborated in connection with the other agencies of point to point communication that are to be considered in the two sections that follow . // It was one hundred years ago , in 1832 , that Samuel F. B. Morse first conceived of the telegraph . By 1837 , utilizing the results of other scientific explorers , in particular those of Joseph Henry with regard to electromagnetism , he had solved the fundamental problems and was in possession of " all the elements of the modern telegraph . " It was in the same year that the Congress of the United States directed the Secretary of the Treasury to inquire into the desirability of establishing a system of telegraphs in the United States.3 By 1844 the first commercially successful telegraph system had been established , and by the end of the century the I I ' 22 THE TELEGRAPH United States and most European countries were gridironed with telegraph wires . ' At the outset of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph had long been the basic and established agencies of point to point communication . The former was unchallenged wherever the actual transmission of original written messages was required . The latter provided opportunity for more rapid but restricted and less personal contacts by wire . It had already begun , moreover , to feel the effects of competition from a newer agency of wire-transmission , the telephone , the extraordinary rise of which , with its effects upon the telegraph , will be sketched in the next section . The Growth of Telegraph Facilities. ? In 1902 there were 237,990 miles of telegraph pole line , or slightly more than the miles of first track upon American railroads , with whose growth the telegraph had been closely associated , and which , to a very large extent , through the development of despatching control , it had made possible . The extension of the basic telegraph network , like the growth in railroad bed mileage , went on but slowly , during the next quarter century , and in 1927 had been increased to only 256,809 miles ; though again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this network had increased at a far faster rate . The mileage of single wires had increased by more than half , ' while the capacity of these wires had been multiplied . COMMUNICATION AGENCIES The early forms of telegraph had been improved before 1900 to include duplex and multiplex systems whereby as many as eight messages could be transmitted by the Morse code simultaneously over one land wire , and systems for transmitting and receiving at high speeds by dots and dashes on a tape had been devised . At present , " it is standard practice to transmit four to six printed messages simultaneously over one wire , and by the use of carrier currents , which are superimposed upon the regular operating currents , as many as fifty-two simultaneous transmissions per wire are possible . Long distance printer circuits are operated at speeds as high as seventy words per minute . " Today , " eighty per cent or more of the telegraph load of the country is carried by printing telegraph machines , transmission being effected by keyboards similar to those of typewriters , and reception by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These mechanisms mark a striking technical advance when contrasted with the hand-operated telegraph key of earlier decades , with its dot and dash transmission , on which the average operator could send about twenty words per minute . The use of continuous cables on lines between important cities and on a transcontinental line that now reaches Davenport , Iowa from the eastern coast has increased the reliability of telegraphic service by immunizing the wires against atmospheric disturbance . At the outset of the century transcontinental service was frequently disrupted for several days at a time ; discontinuance for more than a few hours now practically never occurs.2 The Oceanic Cables. ? The intercommunication within the nation which was made possible by the land telegraph lines was even less revolutionary than the interconnection of continents resulting from oceanic cables . " One cable across the Atlantic was established in 1868 , and by 1900 there were thirteen North Atlantic cables . In addition to 1 ? 4 THE TELEGRAPH these the United States was connected by one cable from New York to Haiti , two from Key West to Havana and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Central and South America were relayed via the latter . " Messages could be transmitted at about thirty words per minute , and by the use of duplex systems , sixty words could be sent over a single cable per minute . Transoceanic messages required two or three manual retransmissions as , for example , with London cables , in Nova Scotia and Ireland . ' In 1931 , twenty-one submarine cables crossed the North Atlantic . In addition , there was one from New York to Haiti , four from New York to Cuba , one from Miami to Cuba , one from Miami to the Barbados , seven from Key West to Cuba , and three from Galveston to Mexico . Technical improvements now allow speeds of over onehundred words per minute on the newer cables , and automatic retransmitters have replaced the staffs of operators formerly required for this purpose . In 1902 the Pacific Ocean was spanned from San Francisco to Manila via Hawaii , the Midway Islands and Guam , and from Vancouver to Australia . These cables completed the circuit of the globe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Theodore Roosevelt , transmitted a message around the globe from Washington to New York in the elapsed time of nine and one-half minutes . Since that day , the United States has never been out of cable contact with the other continents . There are also cables from Seattle to Alaska and from Guam to Japan which further link the United States with its Pacific possessions and neighbors . In the earlier years of the century two messages could be sent simultaneously over a single cable . A so-called " loading " device , now employed , permits from three to eight simultaneous transmissions . " The carrying capacity of the twenty-one North Atlantic cables in 1931 , as compared with the thirteen cables in 1900 , in view of the improved speeds and number of transmissions possible , is ital. i 125 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES therefore in the neighborhood of fifty seven to thirteen rather than twenty-one to thirteen , and this in a measure is also true of all other long cables . " ' The Utilization of Telegraph and Cable. ? The extent of utilization of telegraphic wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted . The statistical data available employ the " message " as the unit , and the average number of words per message can not be stated . Table 39 presents the available data on the utiliza- THE TELEGRAPH tion of the telegraphic and cable network as reported by the quinquennial census of electrical industries . It has been shown that the number of land telegraph wires since the beginning of the century has increased by more than half , that the capacity of these wires for simultaneous transmission has been multiplied , and that the potential speed of transmission is nearly treble its 1900 average . The facilities for cable transmission have been similarly increased . The collective effect of these improvements for capacity of the land and cable telegraphic systems may be compared with their actual utilization as shown in Table 39 . The comparison discloses that the growth of facilities has far exceeded the growth in number of messages . It must be inferred that there has been a relative decrease in the utilization of existing facilities , an increase in the average length of messages , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of messages has increased during the period under consideration , especially since new types of service at reduced rates for longer messages have been developed . The effect which the growth of the telephone may have had in retarding the extension of telegraphic utilization is conjectural . The per capita use of the American telegraphic services may also be compared with that of the United States Post Office for the years 1907 and 1927 . In the former year the pieces of first class domestic mail numbered approximately 71.9 for each land wire message . In 1927 there were 76.3 pieces of such mail matter for each message . ' Evidently the utilization of the post office service has increased somewhat more rapidly than that of the land telegraphic wire systems . Reasons for this will be discussed subsequently . In view of these ratios , it is quite easy to understand why , in general , there should still be an emotional response to the receipt of a telegram similar to that once revealed by hesitancy in opening a letter . The traditional infrequency of the occurrence suggested an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with untoward COMMUNICATION AGENCIES circumstances . Traces of this attitude which survive have been capitalized by professional and business men who have discovered that telegrams almost invariably receive closer attention , and make deeper impression , than the same message conveyed through any other medium , even to those accustomed to receive them . The implication of crisis attached to a telegram is no doubt lessening , but its implications of emphasis and urgency seem to persist . Recently the telegraph companies have sought , with some evidences of success , to popularize the use of the telegram for purposes of felicitation and greeting . Rate reductions have also led to a more widespread popular use of the telegram . Reduced rate services , such as the night letter , the day letter , and the night message , have contributed to the same end . The relatively rapid growth of cable messages ( Table 39 , columns 4 and 5 ) suggests an extension of international contacts . This growth would appear more striking if the numbers of words rather than the numbers of messages were available . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much per word for every word transmitted , except for special press and governmental transmissions . Cable services now offered include special rates for deferred cables , night letters , week-end letters and greeting messages , with a consequent increase in the number of words per message . Commercial Wireless Transmission. ? Important as the telegraph and cable are , their utility is limited to the fixed points to which their lines are laid . Thus , for example , there was in 1900 no fixed communication with vessels from the time of their departure until within a short time of their arrival . In this country " marine observation stations were established at such points as Fire Island and Sandy Hook , and connected with land line wires to central offices . Inbound vessels signalled these stations with flags by day or rockets by night and messages announcing their expected arrivals were then transmitted and delivered to customers desiring them . " The development . of wireless , Skirrow , op. cit . THE TELEGRAPH since its invention in 1895 , has done much to free telegraphic communication from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication . Not only are fixed ( land ) terminals no longer essential , but wireless can be employed where it would be difficult or impossible to construct and maintain wire lines . Where it has come into competition with existing cable services , the chief effects claimed for it have been in the reduction of rates . ' Where , on the other hand , it has held a natural monopoly of point to point communication , the results have been of revolutionary significance . For example , not only has the safety of sea travel been greatly enhanced ; its whole implications with respect to communication with the world ashore have been altered . The modern ocean liner has its daily paper and its broker 's office , as well as the facilities for private communication with office or home on land . During recent years , special types of inexpensive service have been introduced , whereby passengers at sea may send radio letters to adjacent ships travelling in opposite directions for mailing by post upon arrival at a designated port . The Radiomarine Corporation broadcasts each night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a single round trip large liners handle as many as 1,000 radiograms for passengers.2 These contacts with vessels are maintained through thirteen radio telegraph stations on the Atlantic Coast , seven on the Pacific , six on the Gulf of Mexico , and seven on the Great Lakes.3 The numbers of messages transmitted by private commercial wireless systems of the United States , as recorded in quinquennial years by the Census of Electrical Industries , have been as shown on p. 130 . This remarkable growth is indicative of the rapidity with which a new 1 129 1 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES agency gains foothold and becomes integrated into the communication system . The significance of point to point aspects of wireless as a medium for message communication has been obscured in the public mind by the rapid and extensive development of radio broadcasting . The entire range of radio frequencies from 10 kilocycles to 60,000 kilocycles was made the subject of agreement at the International Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927 , which divided the entire spectrum of radio waves into bands allocated to various kinds of services . In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ( a total of 96 " channels " ) are allocated to broadcasting . Below the broadcasting band is the low frequency ( long wave ) band , devoted largely to wireless telegraph service , and " used practically up to its full capacity at present by government stations , stations engaged in transoceanic communication , ship stations , aircraft stations , beacon and compass stations and miscellaneous services.2 In 1929 , there were 502 standard width telegraph channels in this band , to which scientific progress , by reducing the standard width , is expected to add 147 channels in the immediate future . Above the broadcasting channels is the high frequency ( short wave ) band , subdivided into " ( a ) the continental high frequency band . . . ; ( b ) the transoceanic high frequency band . . . ; and ( c ) what , for want of a better THE TELEGRAPH term , may be denominated the laboratory ' high frequency band . " It is estimated that , with technical improvements , these will contain in the next few years a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphic services ; the activities of amateurs ; the mobile services , including maritime , air , emergency police , emergency fire , exploring expeditions and geophysical research ; experimental visual broadcasting , including television ; and general experimental activities of wide variety . Some indications of the present extent of these developments , and some hint of the almost unlimited possibilities which they forecast , are contained in Table 40 . This table shows an especially rapid recent growth in several classes of wireless telegraphic services . The number of commercial transoceanic stations ( column 3 ) approximately doubled in two years between 1928 and 1930 . This is particularly important since direct contact now ( 1930 ) exists between the United States and sixteen European countries , eighteen Central and South American countries , and seven in the Orient.2 With some of these this country has previously had no telegraphic contact except through the media of cables controlled in other countries . It is within the range of possibility that these contacts will have importance in the future international relations of this country , especially when it is remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can only surmise what the consequences would have been in the days prior to the outbreak of , and during , the World War had there been the possibility of international contact that the modern wireless and broadcasting stations provide . Twenty of the oceanic and continental channels have been set aside for the use of the American press . The commercial ship to shore stations ( column 4 ) , which showed a comparatively modest growth for several years prior to 1929 , increased their number by nearly half in the latter year . It is evident that provision for telegraphic service to travellers at sea has become a recognized part of the equipment of every modern liner . The rapid installation of wireless equipment upon airplanes since 1928 , while still for navigating purposes only , foreshadows the similar provision of telegraphic service to passengers in llle air . I2 THE TELEGRAPH It has been a policy of the Federal Radio Commission to encourage amateur stations ( col. 6 ) as a means of stimulating scientific development . Since many of these are licensed upon the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , informal dot and dash conversation between operators all over the world is extensive . Miscellaneous Telegraph Services. ? In addition to the transmission of commercial messages for the public , there has been an amplification of telegraphic services in a wide variety of specialized fields . There has been from the beginning a close association between the telegraph and the railroad , in which the speed and frequency of train despatching have been dependent upon telegraphic facilities . Without numerous automatic safety devices employing telegraphic circuits modern railroad travel at its present speed and safety would scarcely be possible . Radio telegraph service has in some instances been established between terminal points and trains en route , and is also used to maintain communication between engine and caboose on long freight trains . The railroad station is still , in many communities , the recognized office for the despatch of private telegrams . An extensive " ticker " service , both inter-city and local , plays an important part in the country 's economic and financial structure and in maintaining a fluid market for commodities and securities of all descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective headquarters by prospectors , explorers , and moving picture staffs " on location . " Fire and police departments now make extensive use of telegraphic signal systems , with boxes conveniently located for use by citizens in case of emergency ; and police departments are equipping cruising automobiles with wireless sets . Instructions from headquarters , received by police officers while driving at full speed , can be carried out with the utmost expedition . This is one of the most effective aids to the police yet devised for combatting the professional criminal . Fire and burglar alarm protection circuits are extensively used in guarding private property . I 133 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES Telegraphically controlled clocks have been installed widely . Automatic typesetting machines , several of which may be operated in series by wire from a central point , are now in service on an experimental basis . Other forms of wire service which are similarly difficult to classify will be discussed in connection with the telephone . Some of these , in fact , may be regarded with equal validity as telegraphic or telephonic in character . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed in this section are to be considered at the conclusion of Part II , two observations may be made at this point : ( 1 ) There has been a rapid expansion of the telegraph and cable network that binds the various communities of this country , and foreign countries as well , into a closer relationship . ( 2 ) This network makes communication more rapid than it has ever been before . Thirty years ago , under normal conditions , it was necessary to allow for a day 's delay in receiving the reply to a message sent from coast to coast across the continent . In 1932 , a reply within an hour is not uncommon . The installation of printing telegraph machines in business offices has made it possible to deliver a message in San Francisco ten minutes after it is filed in New York . XII . THE TELEPHONE In the preceding section it was shown that the per capita use of the telegraph increased 60 per cent in the twentyfive years from 1902 to 1927 . The average interval between the receipt of telegrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 days to 6 months and 21 days . In a period of dynamic change in which point to point communication would normally play an important part , this appears as a surprisingly small growth until it is recalled that it was in the same period that a new agency of communication was developing with astonishing rapidity . The first telephonic communication was on March 10 , 1876 . Shortly thereafter , Alexander Grahain Bell offered 134 THE TELEPHONE to sell his patent to the Western Union Telegraph Company for $100,000 . The offer was rejected because , it is reported , the telegraph company did not conceive of the possibility that the new invention could affect its monoply of wire communication . ) The development of the new instrument , however , was once more to demonstrate the rapidity with which social changes occur . By the beginning of the century , it had passed through the period of demonstration and become definitely established . By 1892 it was possible to talk from New York to Chicago . The Growth of the Telephone Network. ? The growth of the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any single index . Instead , growth must be considered from the standpoint , in turn , of at least three aspects : ( a ) The increase in number of instruments is indicative of the extension of physical facilities . ( b ) The possibilities of interconnection of individual instruments is indicative of the efficiency of the total system as a network of potential contacts . ( c ) Mechanical improvements have contributed a qualitative element which is measured by increased range , power and audibility of conversation . Inasmuch as the data showing the growth in number of instruments since 1900 are nowhere else available in so accurate and compact a form , they are given in detail in Table 41 . The basic telephone network is that of the Bell System ( column 2 ) , composed of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and a number of associated regional companies . Bell-connected lines ( column 3 ) are independently owned and operated , but have working agreements with the Bell system for the mutual forwarding of messages . Non-Bell-connected lines ( column 5 ) include small independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without such agreements , and whose business , therefore , is confined totally to the area of operation . The figures of Table 41 indicate , but only in part , the extent to which the telephones of the country have been integrated into a unified network . In 1907 , when the non- 135 THE TELEPHONE Bell-connected lines ( column 5 ) reached their maximum , it would have been possible in theory for any Bell system subscriber to telephone , directly or by relayed message , to 62.7 per cent of the nation 's telephone subscribers . More than one-third of the nation 's subscribers , however , were on lines not connected with the major group of companies , and to this extent the intercommunication system represented by the total number of telephones ( column 6 ) was segmented and not complete . Each year since 1907 has seen a decline in the number of non-Bell-connected telephones , until in 1930 only 0.48 per cent of the total telephone subscribers of the nation could not be reached by any subscriber of the Bell-connected network . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-connected phones , important technical advances have extended the direct range of telephonic conversation , and improved its audibility . The first transcontinental conversation took place between Boston and San Francisco in 1915 . Mr. Alexander Graham Bell , whose request " Mr. Watson , please come here , I want you " was the first telephone message ever transmitted , opened the line . He repeated , thirty-nine years later , his request of 1876 ; but Mr. Watson replied " It would take me a week , now , Mr. Bell . " ' Another transcontinental line via the southern route was opened in 1923 , and a northern line in 1927 . Audibility has been improved by the vacuum tube amplifier which prevents fading of the voice . The rapid diffusion of the telephone is most accurately indicated when the number of instruments is related to the number of inhabitants . At five-year intervals , the numbers of telephones per thousand population were as shown on top of p. 138.2 Telephone Utilization. ? These figures portray the available facilities . The extent to which the population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Kaenipffert , op. cit. , pp. 345-46. 2 Calculated from column 6 of Table 41 , and from estimates of population on Dee . 31 , each year , trade by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company . The ratio has declined in 1931 from the 1930 figure . 137 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES 1900 17.6 1905 48.5 1910 81.9 1915 103.9 1920 124.1 1925 146.3 1930 163.6 the telephone in its daily life is best represented by data concerning telephone utilization , given in Table 42 . The first point to observe in Table 42 is that the extension of telephone facilities , measured by the number of instruments , has grown more rapidly than the utilization of these facilities , as measured by the number of calls . The total calls per phone per day ( column 7 ) have declined from 6.7 1 138 J THE TELEPHONE in 1902 to 5.4 in 1927 . This decline is even more striking when the corresponding figures for the Bell System are considered . Here the ratios are 7.0 in 1902 and 4.1 in 1927.1 Again , the growth in per capita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the growth in number of telephones per thousand population . This , of course , does not indicate a lessening use of the telephone ? rather , the reverse . The facts must be interpreted as indicating that the telephone has come to be regarded as a necessity , and as such has permeated the country . It is installed in office and residence , wherever it will be conveniently at hand , regardless of the frequency of its actual use . In consequence , not only are there frequently a multiple number of extensions of the same telephone ( which , however , does not affect the statistics showing the number of telephones ) but there are also many installations in residences and elsewhere where use is infrequent . Bell System data showing the residence and business classification of its telephones bear out this assertion . In 1927 , 39.3 per cent , in 1929 , 39.1 per cent , and in 1930 , 39.0 per cent of all Bell instruments were classified as " business . " While not conclusive , this comparison suggests that new installations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calls per telephone are fewer . Growth of Toll Service. ? A second point to observe in Table 42 is the growth since 1917 in the proportion of toll calls ( col. 5 ) in comparison with local exchange calls ( col. 3 ) . In ten years the percentage of all calls represented by toll messages increased from 2.2 to 3.7 . This observation is substantiated by data for the Bell System which show that in the twelve years from 1917 to 1929 , toll messages more than trebled while local exchange messages only slightly more than doubled.2 With the increase in volume of toll messages there appears to have come a lengthening of the average distance for which toll calls are placed ; and there has certainly been an increase in the average speed with which they are corn- COMMUNICATION AGENCIES pleted , and a lessening of their average cost per mile to the user . Doubt concerning the trend in the average length of transmission comes from two factors . While there has unquestionably been a greatly increased number of calls to distant points , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll points , due particularly to the rapid development of suburban areas around the large cities . A confident balancing of these opposing tendencies is difficult because of the enormous complexity of the toll business conducted by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its affiliated regional companies . The most satisfactory single index of the growth of toll line utilization is contained in traffic data , summarized in Table 43 , concerning the " long lines " of the parent company . These in general are inter-regional , in the sense that they interconnect the more than twenty areas served by the affiliated Bell System companies . ( Within most of these areas the // affiliated companies themselves operate " toll lines " between separated points . ) Over the " long lines " the number of messages increased from 1,358,000 in 1900 to 41,289,000 in 1928 . From Table 43 it is apparent that the average length of haul on the lines there involved ( column 2 ) gained steadily between 1922 and 1930 . This is doubtless due to the improved facilities for distant transmission , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York ? Boston toll board messages increased 62 per cent ; the New York ? Chicago messages , 194 per cent ; and the New York and Chicago to Los Angeles and San Francisco messages increased 430 per cent . ' The cumulative distribution of long lines messages by length of haul in February , 1928 , was as follows:2 Calls of 100 miles or less 42.2 per cent Calls of 150 miles or less 57.8 per cent Calls of 200 miles or less 71.0 per cent Calls of 250 miles or less 79.0 per cent Calls of 300 miles or less 83.5 per cent Calls of 400 miles or less 90.5 per cent Calls of 500 miles or less 94.0 per cent Calls of 1,000 miles or less 99.0 per cent The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has classified a sample of these messages according to the distance of haul , within each year , 1922 to 1928 . It finds that the rate of growth in each class of calls has been directly related to their distance . That is , the longer calls have shown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the time required for completing long distance or toll calls ( columns 3 and 4 ) was rapidly declining , while the percentage of all calls completed ( column 5 ) was slowly but steadily rising . These changes have resulted largely from the elimination of seasonal fluctuations in these series . It may be added that in 1930 , 82 per cent of all long distance calls were completed without the COMMUNICATION AGENCIES patron replacing his receiver on the hook , as compared with approximately 70 per cent in 1929.1 The speed of short haul toll connections in 1930 was such that 95 per cent of the calls were completed while the subscriber stayed at the telephone . ' The substitution of cable wires for open wires on toll lines , freeing service from the effects of inclement weather conditions , had aided in eliminating interruptions and delays , and has also improved audibility . Analogous advantages in the improvement of local service are claimed for the dial operated telephones as compared with manual ( switchboard ) phones . Their installation was begun by the Bell System about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one-third of the total ( 4,976,941 dial operated telephones ) . It is expected that by 1942 dial telephones will be in use wherever practicable . ' The improvements in certainty of service summarized in the preceding paragraphs and depending chiefly on technological innovations have been in part responsible for the increasing inclusion of telephonic communication in the daily habit patterns of the population . Toll Service Utilization. ? The comparatively rapid growth of toll business is attributable to three major factors . The first of these is the technological advance in all phases of transmission . While the improvements in quality and cost of service resulting from this advance have affected both local and toll business , the improvements in long distance transmission have been the more striking and have probably afforded a relatively greater stimulus to increased utilization . A second factor has been the far-reaching changes which have taken place in urban structure , business organization and practices , and social habits . In Part I it was pointed out that modern means of transportation , including the railroad , the electric line and the motor vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pro- 14 ' 21 THE TELEPHONE nounced growth in residential suburbs on the fringes of population centers . The increased physical mobility between the city and the suburb made possible by improvements in transportation has its counterpart in the increased facility of point to point communication brought about by the telephone . With interests centered in both city and suburb , there is an incentive for the commuter to use its services in joining the two . This results in an increase in short haul toll business . Business practice has itself been affected in numerous ways by the enhanced availability of transportation and of point to point communication agencies . There has been an extension of the retail marketing area ; at the same time traffic congestion brought about by the automobile has encouraged the use of the telephone in conjunction with motor delivery service in the suburban areas surrounding large cities . In industry and trade , the combination of larger numbers of production and distribution units within the same corporate control has necessitated quick and frequent communication among units , and between them and management . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation executives , having offices in one city , must be in telephonic communication with the plant managers in other cities . Board meetings and sales conferences , involving individuals at separate points , may be conducted entirely by telephone . The social habits which have promoted the increasing use of telephone toll lines are somewhat less tangible in character . There has been an increase in living standards ( luring the first thirty years of the century and this has doubtless played its part . Familiarity with and dependence upon the use of the telephone for local business and social purposes leads to an extension of these uses to longer distances when the facilities become equally convenient . Again , an increase in the tempo of life ? the celerity with which any activity is undertaken ? contributes to the utilization of any device that is in keeping with this Icn1po. 143 I COMMUNICATION AGENCIES A third factor in the growth of toll business is the reduction in rates . The basic day station-to-station toll message rates of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company since 1919 have been approximately proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , 1919 , the toll rate structure was slightly raised , and remained unchanged until October , 1926 , when rates were lowered considerably . In December , 1927 , further general reductions were effected ; again in February , 1929 a reduction was made on calls of less than 1,600 miles , while in 1930 further reductions involved calls up to 300 miles . From the rates prevailing between 1919 to 1926 to those of 1929 the net decreases on the longer calls were substantial . Thus on air line calls of 3,000 miles , the reduction was approximately $8.50 from a 1919 rate of nearly $19.00 . On a call of 1,000 miles , it was about $2.50 from a 1919 rate of approximately $6.25 . Other decreases have been proportionate . ' The average time spent in each telephone conversation over selected long lines of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , as measured annually in February , shows little variation:2 Minutes 1924 **49;61;TOOLONG 4.97 1925 **49;112;TOOLONG 5.10 1926 **49;163;TOOLONG 5.02 1927 **49;214;TOOLONG 4.91 1928 **49;265;TOOLONG 4.95 1929 **49;316;TOOLONG 4.97 The average time spent in transcontinental conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been changing as a result of the introduction of reduced rate services during certain hours of the day , and of rate differentials favoring station-to-station as compared with person-to-person calls . There has been a substantial reduction in the proportion of person-to-person calls and a noticeable increase in stationto-station calls during daylight hours . The proportion of THE TELEPHONE early evening station-to-station traffic has almost doubled , the late evening traffic has more than doubled and there has been a sharp decline in calls between midnight and 4:30 A.M. ' International Telephonic Connections. ? The development of telephonic communication has been outstandingly an American phenomenon . On January 1 , 1930 , 58 per cent of the world 's telephones were in the United States . This ratio declined to 57.2 per cent on January 1 , 1931 , indicating relative growth or stability in other countries . Almost as many telephones were in use in New York City alone as in Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and more than half as many again as were to be found in all of France . Just as there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the United States , so , in the last few years , there has been an extension of this network to include a large proportion of the world 's telephones . The first commercial telephone service ( via radio ) between the United States and England was opened on January 7 , 1927 , in which year long distance telephone service to Mexico was also opened . In 1931 the only countries in the world having more than 100,000 telephones with whose telephonic system connections could not be made by an American subscriber were Japan , Russia , Brazil , New Zealand , China and the Union of South Africa . These countries together had 1,910,000 phones out of the estimated world total of 35,350,000 , or less than the number found in New York and San Francisco combined . ' Borderline Services of Telephone and Telegraph. ? It will have been observed that in discussing the development of telephonic services , it has been impossible to limit attention to transmission by wire . So far as the patron is concerned , it is usually immaterial whether his message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally true whether the message be a telegram or a long-distance COMMUNICATION AGENCIES telephone conversation . As a matter of fact , modern technology is tending to obscure and even to eliminate the customary distinctions between the transmitting facilities of the telegraph and the telephone , as well as between cable and wireless services . Similarly , various new services involving transmission by wire which have been developed in recent years are classified with difficulty as either telegraphic or telephonic . The " teletypewriter " and telegraphic " printer , " performing the same service functions , have been extensively employed over fixed circuits . They permit instantaneous typing or printing of messages at separated points by means of automatic mechanisms . Their uses have been varied . For example , they serve to connect ground stations along commercial air routes , carrying orders for the despatching of planes and providing the stations with weather reports and other navigating information for relay by radio to planes overhead . They have been found especially useful in state-wide police administration ; messages from state headquarters are relayed simultaneously to all connected police offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing these mechanisms were inaugurated by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , and by the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Postal Telegraph Company jointly . These services now make possible interconnections within each of the competing systems that are analogous to the interconnections within a telephone system . Thus , any subscriber to this service calls any other subscriber by typing his number , and a connection is immediately made through a central office . Once connected , two-way communication is possible . There is particular interest for the present discussion in the fact that the same service is being offered to the public at the same time by telegraph and telephone companies . As a further example of the difficulty of differentiating services , it may be noticed that for some years the telegraph and telephone companies have been using the saute wire // circuits for the simultaneous transmission of telegraphic messages and telephone conversations . The fac-simile transmission of pictures , printed material , etc. , over wires was first demonstrated in 1924 . By 1930 equipment for the commercial transmission of such material was located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal documents and advertising copy have been so transmitted . Fac-simile transmission is now possible over transoceanic radio telegraph circuits and , in addition to commercial uses , has been employed by foreign residents in this country in sending hand written messages in native characters to relatives and friends abroad . In 1930 , a full page of a New York newspaper was first transmitted by R.C.A. Communications to a steamship in mid-ocean . ' While telegraphic ship to shore communication has been possible for several years , it was not until December 8 , 1929 , that commercial telephonic ship to shore service was opened with the installation of apparatus upon the S. S. Leviathan . Other ships have since been equipped . Telephonic communication from moving railroad trains is in an experimental stage . XIII . THE INTEGRATION OF POINT TO POINT COMMUNICATION AND ITS INFLUENCES It has been the purpose of Part II to survey the functions of those mediating agencies through which there is a person to person or point to point interchange of contacts between physically separated individuals . Increased speed , ease and volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , are post office , wire and wireless facilities ? all contributing to the same end , communication , as demand may arise or be created . The changing relationships among these suggest an interesting analogy with the changing relationships among the agencies of transportation discussed in Part I , where it was shown that the older agencies 147 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES of rail , water and electric trolley have been facing the competition of a newer agency , the motor vehicle . The essential advantage possessed by the latter so far as personal transportation is concerned was found to reside in the control exercised by the individual over his own movements . In most situations the same factor ? individual control ? gives the telephone its outstanding competitive advantage over the older agencies of point to point communication ? the postal service and the telegraph . The postal service , like the railroad , operates on fixed schedules . This restriction does not apply to the telegram , which , however , as employed by the average person , is still limited by the requirements of formality and condensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally present in direct conversation . Both involve a degree of premeditated effort not necessitated by the use of the telephone , except , perhaps , on longer calls.l With the telephone one uses an instrument that is always at hand , to call whom one pleases , whenever one pleases , to say what one wants . It does not follow that the older agencies have no functions for which the telephone is less well adapted , but it is suggested that in the modern scheme of living the telephone has advantages of flexibility which give it preeminence where a quick " two-way " verbal interchange is desired . In the actual physical transmission of documents , bills , confidential memoranda and the like ; where a record of statements is desired and verbal interchange is not a requisite ; or in any correspondence , business or social , where immediacy is not essential , the postal service has a secure place . Where urgency is not involved and the correspondents are at distant points it also has at present a cost differential in its favor . The postman will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders . // Similarly , whereas the telephone is an agency for placing two persons in direct contact , so that messages may be personally exchanged , the telegraph , like the post office , is an agency for the delivery of messages committed to its custody . The message may be filed , and thenceforth dismissed from the sender 's mind , with the assurance that it will reach the addressee promptly , accurately and forcefully . When delivered , it possesses the advantage of being a written record which can be referred to and studied paragraph by paragraph , with whatever detail is necessary , in a way that is impossible with an oral message . Many telephonic conversations end with a request to " confirm by letter or wire . " Again , where precision of statement and speed of transmission are both required , and the " two-way " aspect is less essential , the telegram still offers the more convenient , and at the same time , cheaper medium . This is especially true where the message is long , as in press dispatches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Part I it was suggested in conclusion that certain tendencies toward the unification of passenger transportation facilities are discernible . The question now arises whether analogous tendencies are apparent in the realm of point to point communication . The distinctions among the services in this realm are largely historical . They follow different trends of development in different countries . Telegraph service , for example , is operated in general by governments , except in the United States and Canada , usually in conjunction with the Post Office . " The Department of Posts and Telegraphs " is familiar to the American traveller in Europe , who learns that ordinarily he must go to a post office station to send a telegram , cablegram , or wireless message . In the case of the telephone , the only countries of importance in the world telephonic network which , on January 1 , 1931 , had telephone systems exclusively operated by private corporations were : United States , Argentina , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Peru , Uruguay and Spain . Those countries in which 149 1 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post Office , were : Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , France , Germany , Great Britain and North Ireland , Greece , Hungary , Irish Free State , Jugo-Slavia , Latvia , Netherlands , Russia ( including Siberia and associated republics ) , Sweden , Switzerland , Japan , Egypt , Union of South Africa , Australia and New Zealand . In the remaining countries there was operation by both private companies and the government . The unparalleled development of the industry in the United States is necessarily reflected in any data concerning world telephone facilities . On January 1 , 1931 this country contained 57.2 per cent of the world 's telephones , with the result that 67.1 per cent of the world total was under private operation . ) It is not to the pros and cons of public ownership that attention is called here , but rather to the fact that , outside of the United States , there does not generally exist the sharp demarcation between post office , telegraphic and telephonic services to which citizens of this country are accustomed . In this country there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postal functions to include those now performed by wire or radio companies . On the other hand , certain technological advances and operating practices have brought the land wire , cable and wireless companies more closely together . Though corporate distinctions persist , there are tendencies toward assimilation of services . Thus the telephone may be used in the filing of a telegram , and its subsequent transmission may be over a wire which is at the same time carrying a number of telephone conversations . Telephone companies and cable companies are now both engaged in wireless transmission . Trade agreements and priority of patent rights alone will determine which of a number of point to point communication corporations may control any one of various new mechanisms for point to point transmission . Telegraph and telephone companies are now actively competing for the " printer-teletypewriter " business . POINT TO POINT COMMUNICATION Taken together , the telephone , telegraph and wireless companies offer a communication service that is integrated so far as function is concerned , though at times there is competitive overlapping . Separate corporate control formerly led to considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of competing telephone systems in the same community . This has been largely eliminated , through extensions of corporate control and interconnection of services , and now exists in such relatively minor forms as the initial duplication of printer-teletypewriter services , and the remaining instances of dual telephone systems . While competition among corporations for the same business still exists , as between the major telegraph companies , the interconnections are such that service to the patron is not correspondingly limited . He may choose freely among the various point to point communication agencies available , according to his needs , with the assurance that his requirements will be met no matter what patented mechanical devices are involved , or what corporate interests provide the facilities employed under any given set of circumstances . Whether or not the separate services are eventually merged under a single control is a matter which does not materially affect the communication function and hence requires no discussion here . The effects upon the individual of the elaboration of facilities that has been traced can only be suggested . Of the total contacts of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increasing proportion tend toward brevity and impersonality , induced by the use of mediating devices . Within this part of the aggregate are lost those values that inhere in more intimate , leisurely , and protracted personal discussion . The ultimate effects are matters for conjecture . There is , too , an increase in the tempo of life . Mechanical aids make it possible to communicate more extensively and to conduct by such means many of the interchanges which formerly necessitated personal contact . Time saved may be utilized in further contacts . Devices that permit speed in turn Huluccc and the agencies here discussed have added their tart toward this result .. Moreover , the convenience COMMUNICATION AGENCIES of instruments that contribute to the efficiency of necessary communication tends to induce communication for its own sake . Finally , there is increasingly accessible to the individual a variety of instrumentalities which maintain him in actual or potential contact with any of his fellows . Personal isolation ? inaccessibility to the demands of others for access to one 's attention ? is increasingly rare , or , when desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " person represents at all times the terminal point for each of the various agencies of point to point communication here reviewed . He is always able , because of the network of facilities converging upon him , either to send or receive communications as needs arise . The natural question is , How does he employ these facilities ? His use of each has been discussed in turn . What is the comparative frequency of his use of these facilities as a whole ? The average intervals between incoming messages received by the average individual through the various agencies of communication , at the rates of 1907 and 1927 , respectively , are summarized in Table 44 . Reference to the table shows that in the year 1907 , the average person in the United States received a telegram ( line 5 ) once in each period of eleven months and two days ; in 1927 the interval had shortened to six months and twenty-three days . A distinction is made in the table between local and nonlocal letters and telephone calls , in an endeavor to distinguish between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those originating at a distance . Distinctions between these are not easy to draw . It will be clear that cablegrams are always non-local and telegrams generally so . The telephone , in its local service , is by far the most intrusive of the several agencies . Local calls have become a part of daily routine approximated only in the delivery of the mail . Although non-local letters still have more than twice the frequency of local letters , the latter have been 152 l POINT TO POINT COMMUNICATION increasing at the more rapid rate , and in general , with the single exception of toll telephone calls , the local contacts have increased their frequency to a greater extent than have the non-local . Moreover , the significance of the exception is more apparent than real , because it conceals a tremendous growth in volume of short haul ( suburban ) telephone toll traffic , which in effect is essentially local , and because this traffic is a comparatively small part of the total contacts represented in the table . Three net impressions are left from Table 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the frequency of all point to point communications , both local and non-local. ( 2 ) The frequency of local contacts is greater than that of non-local contacts , primarily because of the habitual utilization of the telephone . ( 3 ) Relatively , the frequency of local communications has increased even more rapidly than has the frequency of null-local. 153 i COMMUNICATION AGENCIES The areas of contact have been expanding , the point to point channels have lengthened and their use has increased ; but all the while the impingements of the local community upon the individual have multiplied with even greater rapidity ? an observation that also developed from the consideration of transportation agencies and travel habits . This suggests an hypothesis : It is not improbable that this intensification of local contacts plays a part in the preservation and even in the enhancement of local patterns of attitude , habit and behavior , and serves as an inhibitor of the process of cultural levelling which is so often assumed as an outstanding and unopposed tendency of American life . This is only an hypothesis , yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that localisms are strengthened by multiplication of contacts between individuals . It is possible , of course , that the intensity of local contacts is counterbalanced or outweighed by more powerful non-local contacts , even though the former are relatively more frequent . The non-local contacts established through the agencies of mass impression , discussed later , may have such an enhancement of effect . It may also be that closer local contacts serve merely to provide channels through which standardizing influences of the agencies of mass impression diffuse within local areas . Again , while the result of modern communication may be to strengthen certain aspects of localism , it may simultaneously serve to break down the control hitherto exercised by relatively closely knit primary groups over individual conduct . For example , the telephone , utilized by the adolescent in " making a date , " and the automobile , utilized in keeping it , may remove him from strict parental supervision to which he was formerly subject even within the same local community .

The data reviewed in this study do not warrant conclusions regarding the balance among these various possibilities . 1,1 . PART III THE AGENCIES OF MASS IMPRESSION PARTS I and II were devoted to the mediating agencies that facilitate the contacts of individuals , whether by movement from place to place , or through the use of postal service , telegraph or telephone . There remains to be considered another group of communication agencies whose common characteristic is that through them it is possible to establish contacts simultaneously with large numbers of individuals . There is little room to doubt that , taken together , they are the dominant agencies through which are inculcated the ideas and attitudes that find expression in collective thought and behavior . Public opinion , as Walter Lippmann has shown , may be resolved into the individual " stereotypes " held in common by large numbers of the population . The sources of these stereotypes are varied : some develop unconsciously and spontaneously in the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some are implanted in consequence of the ceremonialism found in every group ; many are formally inculcated , as in the educational process ; some are the result of deliberate propaganda . Repetition in social intercourse brings about a constant reinforcement of stereotypes in the individual , by making him aware that other individuals have opinions similar to his own . No agencies of reinforcement can compare with the newspaper , the periodical , the motion picture and the radio , whose simultaneous mass impressions upon millions of people are not limited in their effect to those directly impressed , but are immediately passed on into the stream of private conversation . In Part III these agencies of mass impression will be discussed . // XIV . THE NEWSPAPER AND PERIODICAL The first newspaper in America to have consecutive publication was John Campbell 's The Boston NewsLetter , which appeared in 1704 . The newspaper developed rapidly during the colonial period , and soon achieved a tremendous influence which it has never lost . Its early importance was probably even greater than that of the periodical , ' whose long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion . The first American magazine , as the term is usually understood , appeared in 1741 . Both the newspaper and the magazine had their antecedents in the pamphlet , a form of communication which still flourishes , not periodical in time of issue , and of lesser pretensions than the book.2 In 1900 the newspaper and periodical were unrivalled agencies of mass impression . Americans were inveterate newspaper and magazine readers . While no reliable figures are available for the press as a whole it is known that some of the largest circulations ever reached in this country by individual newspapers were attained at the time of the SpanishAmerican War . Changes in Number and Type of Newspapers and Periodicals. ? It is difficult to summarize the growth of institutions as multiform and complex as the newspaper and the periodical . Both reflect the infinitely varied tastes and attitudes of the public , and are correspondingly difficult to compress within categories for enumeration . Circulation figures would be one of the most satisfactory indices of growth and significance . Such figures were untrustworthy even as recently as 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to bring standardization and authentication , was not established until December , 1913 .

Data compiled by Rose Epstein from annual volumes of American Newspaper Annual and Directory ( N. W. Ayer &; Son , Philadelphia ) , now issued as Directory of Newspapers and Periodicals . Data relating to newspapers and periodicals are also to be found in the Census of Manufactures l ) oenuial ) , reports of the Audit Bureau of Circulation , Standard Rate and Data Service , and Editor it Publisher ( International Yearbook Number ) . For the immediate purpose , that of surveying the entire newspaper and periodical field since 1900 , the Ayer figures appear most useful . Between Ilmm and the figures of the Census of Manufactures there are striking discrepancies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded a combined total of 7,760 weekly newspapers and periodicals . N. W. Ayer &; Son recorded by name a corresponding total of 12,920 publications , each 157 J COMMUNICATION AGENCIES and magazine circulation figures have become dependable , and then only for certain classes of publications . Data relating to the number of publications are more reliable and , as given in Table 45 , serve to show some of the major changes that have taken place in the publication field since 1900 . This table is compiled from classifications presented annually in the Newspaper Annual and Directory of N. W. Ayer &; Son . The classification is not clear-cut . In particular , columns 2 to 5 , inclusive , pertaining primarily to newspapers , include also some publications which might preferably be classed as periodicals ; while columns 6 to 10 , inclusive , primarily relating to periodicals , contain also publications which might preferably be classed as newspapers . The largest number of daily publications in a single year was in 1917 ( column 2 ) , while the weeklies ( column 5 ) reached their maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward consolidation , thereby reducing the number of papers , though , it must again be cautioned , this does not necessarily imply a reduction in the aggregate circulation . The importance of the weekly newspaper in national life , in spite of growing urbanization , is indicated by the fact that in 1931 , newspapers were published in 9,830 communities in the United States , in the great majority of which the country weekly newspaper was the only publication . Tri-weekly and semi-weekly publications 1.58 NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS ( columns 3 and 4 ) have remained of comparatively negligible importance . It is obvious that the publications in columns 6 to 9 , inclusive , are primarily periodicals ; these continued to increase in number throughout the period until maxima were reached for each class in 1929 or 1930 . Moreover , their growth was faster and more regular , in general , than that of the publications in columns 2 to 5 , inclusive . The growth in bi-monthly and quarterly publications ( columns 8 and 9 ) was particularly striking . The periodical field is occupied primarily by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these grew consistently until 1930 , in which maximum year it was more than half again as large as in 1900 . Semimonthlies ( col. 6 ) , although they increased until 1930 , did not keep pace with the quarterlies ( col. 9 ) . Nor did they show as rapid an increase as the bi-monthlies ( col. 8 ) . The growth in numbers of periodicals in all probability reflects a phase in the development of social organization , rather than a change in the reading habits of the general public . The multiplication of what the sociologist terms " secondary groups " persons associated through special interests but with less intimate relationships than in simpler face-to-face associations ? has led to types of publications suited to their needs . " House organs , " trade journals , fraternal bulletins , and publications with purposes covering the entire range of contemporary interests , have multiplied . They are important as bonds keeping together those with common objectives . Table 45 seems to reflect primarily this proliferation , rather than an increased number of magazines of general circulation , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The data of column 2 , Table 45 , include many publications of restricted clientele or of limited interest , such as foreign language papers , and those serving professional or trade interests , as well as daily newspapers in English . The trend since 19.20 in the number of newspapers of general circulation is given iii Table 46 , together with circulation totals . In general , though with some irregularity , // the trend in numbers is downward . Between the beginning and end of the period there was a net loss in morning and evening papers , combined , of 105 . Relatively , the morning papers have declined the more rapidly ; there were 43 fewer in 1931 than in 1921 , while the net decline among the much larger number of evening papers was 62 . Sunday papers also showed a loss . Relatively few new papers were established during the period , and these were almost all in the evening field . Contrary to general impression , foreign language dailies have not declined in number throughout the period 1900-1930 . Table 47 shows for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of such dailies classified according to whether their issues appear in the morning , the evening , both morning and evening , or Sunday . In accord160 6O NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS mice with accepted practice , Sunday editions of morning or evening papers are counted as separate publications . Two points stand out in Table 47 . While corresponding data for intervening years are not available , it appears that the agitation in the United States against foreign language newspapers during the period of the World War was without visible enduring effect . Nor was the decline in immigration since the war reflected as late as 1930 in the numbers of daily papers in foreign languages . Data for the same papers are not available to show circulation , reliably or adequately , during this period . The number of evening papers , from 1910 onward , has decreased ; whereas the number of morning papers shows a net gain during the same period . Since 1920 there has been no change in either class comparable to that found among English language papers ( Table 46 ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of a general downward trend in the number of American newspapers , combined with a dwindling non-English speaking population , reflects attempts of alien groups to maintain cultural identity even in the face of eventual cultural absorption . The data of columns 2 , 5 , and 8 in Table 46 , pertaining to numbers of papers , give no indication concerning the " selection " that may be involved in the changes that are shown . What are the regions in which newspapers are increasing or declining ? Are papers of large or small circula 161 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES tion most involved in the changes occurring ? Many such questions might be asked for which data necessary to answer are wanting . It is possible , however , to indicate trends in the distribution of papers according to their political affiliations . These are shown in Table 48 for those English language newspapers of general circulation which could be classified . There was a general decline in papers with straight party designation , and this was of about equal proportions among organs of the Democratic and Republican parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " independent Democrat " and " independent Republican , " on the other hand , increased about five-fold in both instances ( cols. 5 and 6 ) . Papers designating themselves as " independent " in politics , moreover , nearly doubled , and in 1930 constituted the largest single class . The general tendency with respect to party designation is perhaps best indicated by contrasting the number of straight party organs and of papers with independent leanings , in 1900 and in 1930 . In 1900 the former ( col. 2 + col. 3 ) numbered 1,533 as compared with 491 of the latter ( col. 4 + col. 5 + col. 6 ) . In 1930 , the numbers were , respectively , 939 and 1,248 . The growth in stated " political independence " is striking . This may reflect one or more of several possible tendencies : it may be Thal. the // newspaper is becoming less important as an adjunct of party organizations ; it may be that it has increasingly sought to make its appeal to all political factions in the population ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial freedom . Consolidation and Chain Ownership. ? In newspaper ownership and operation , two major trends are discernable ? consolidation and extension of chain ownership ? and it is these that largely account for the changes in numbers of papers that were shown in Table 46 . The fixed operating costs of a modern daily newspaper are heavy , and retrenchment is difficult , for the paper must be issued regularly , and with approximate completeness , or not at all . Publication costs have mounted , making profitable operation more difficult . Consolidation and the extension of chain ownership result from attempts at adjustment to this situation . At the end of 1929 , 303 of the total 1,944 daily newspapers of general circulation ( about one-sixth ) were published under chain ownership . According to a study by Beazell , ' at the end of 1929 the newspaper chains extended into 40 states . The states unrepresented were Arizona , Delaware , Montana , Nevada , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Wyoming . ' Cities having chain-owned papers only included : Pittsburgh , Rochester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flint , Grand Rapids , Knoxville , Memphis , and Camden . Of the 56 major newspaper chains listed by Editor &; Publisher as of December 31 , 1931 , the largest were the Scripps-Howard group with 25 properties , and the Hearst group , with 21 properties . 163 f COMMUNICATION AGENCIES The centralization in the number of opinion-forming agencies resulting from the extension of newspaper chain ownership is apparent . There is a somewhat similar result from the decline in the number of daily papers , which leaves additional communities without newspaper competition . The number of cities in the United States having only one daily newspaper , was as follows on decennial years : By itself , this increase in one-newspaper cities might appear to be explicable by the establishment of newspapers in towns where they had not formerly been published . That this is not the explanation is evident from the data of Tables 45 and 46 , where no evidence of such an extension of newspapers to new communities can be found . It is clear that the trend shown must result from suspensions and consolidations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more population , 69 had but one morning newspaper , while 12 had none.2 The restriction of the reader 's choice to a single newspaper has interesting implications with regard to social control and political alignments . Monopoly may limit the reader to the reception of information and points of view represented by the news and editorial character of the paper . The nature and comprehensiveness of his daily impressions of events in the world around him will depend upon the newspaper 's policy of selection . Publishers and editors are no less human than other people , and are accordingly as likely to express their own preferences and prejudices through the media in their command . At the same time , a newspaper monopoly in a community does open the way to deliberate and conscious control looking toward the promotion of given economic or political ends . 164 NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS On the other hand , it is also possible that when a newspaper has monoply control of either the morning or evening field , or both , it is compelled by that very fact to be more comprehensive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To hold readers of diverse interests it must offer some appeal to all . No general conclusion can be drawn as to which of these opposing motives may prevail in any given combination of circumstances . Similar problems are provided by the possibilities of social control represented in the fact that one-quarter of the total daily newspaper circulation is in the eleven largest chains . ' Newspaper and Periodical Circulation. ? Total newspaper circulation , as shown in Table 46 ( columns 3 , 6 and 9 ) , exhibited a substantial net increase between 1921 and 1931 . The trends in morning , evening and Sunday circulation , however , are best suggested by the figures for circulation per thousand of population in columns 4 , 7 , and 10 . For evening papers the trend was slowly upward throughout the period until 1931 , though ( as seen when statistically analyzed ) at a diminishing rate of increase . For morning and Sunday papers , on the other hand , the rates of increase until 1929 fell more rapidly and in 1930 increases were replaced by declines . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reached where circulation appeared to have become stationary , or to have begun a decline . The maximum circulation per thousand population for morning papers was reached in 1927 and 1929 , and for Sunday papers in 1929 . This suggests not only the approach of a saturation point for newspaper circulation in general , but also a slight shift in reading habits from morning to evening papers . It suggests , further , cessation of growth in the Sunday paper , attributed in some various informed quarters to the competition of outdoor activities , associated ( specially with the automobile ; to the radio ; to changes in habits relating to church attendance ; and to other similar causes // Periodical circulation figures are not adequately summarized except for selected groups . Four of these are included in Table 49 , as classified by Editor &; Publisher , with the terminology that it employs . Since its classification was designed for particular reference by advertisers , the distinctions in the table are somewhat tenuous for present purposes , and are repeated here to indicate the bulk of magazine circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impressive . In 1931 , nine of the eleven women 's magazines included in column 5 each distributed in excess of a million copies a month . Five of the " general monthlies " ( column 4 ) each exceeded 600,000 . The publications included in columns 2 , 3 and 5 show circulation gains , even in the years 1930 and 1931 . " Leading weeklies " ( column 2 ) advanced more rapidly , taking the entire period , than other periodicals or newspapers . " General monthlies " ( column 4 ) , on the other hand , have declined since 1929 . Data for other important groups , if available , would be of interest . Certain agricultural journals , for // example , exceed a million circulation . There is no way of summarizing the aggregate distribution of periodical circulation within the total population . Centers of News Dissemination. ? The preceding data pertaining to numbers and circulation of newspapers indicate the general importance of these media , although their full significance can better be understood in terms of the material that they print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of news appearing in American newspapers , or the distances from which it comes . There is reason to believe that the average daily paper has available today a supply larger than ever before of non-local news material from which to select , and that this supply has an ever widening source . For the most part , the daily paper is dependent for its non-local news on one or more of the news-gathering agencies , prominent among which are the Associated Press , the United Press and the International News Service . Some idea of the bulk and widespread origin of the news matter which enters into the making of a daily newspaper is gained from a survey of its traffic by the Associated Press , November 10-16 , inclusive , 1929.1 Excluding stock exchange and financial tables , this organization transmitted 2,562,715 words , in 17,323 items , within this period . The average daily transmission was about 366,000 words , in 2,475 items . The domestic news totalled 2,415,089 words ( 94.2 per cent of the total ) and 16,260 items ( 93.9 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news item was 148.5 words ; foreign items averaged 138.9 words . The points at which the preceding news items originated were also determined . These items bore date lines from 1,850 different communities , of which 1,678 were in the United States , and 172 were foreign . Of the domestic items , 4,042 , or approximately one-quarter , bore the date lines of 17 cities . It is not surprising that the large cities should have a preeminent position as news centers , since the // concentration of economic , social and political affairs will lead to a similar concentration of events having general interest . Moreover , the large metropolitan dailies bear the major part of the cost of collecting the news , both domestic and foreign , for American readers . It follows that the values and interests of the larger urban centers will be diffused throughout the country . It does not follow that importance as a news center will be directly related to population , even among the larger cities . The ten places supplying the largest numbers of items during the period of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list of comparatively smaller cities like Seattle and Atlanta may have been due to the occurrence of unusual events of national significance during the period of the survey . Nevertheless the omission of such cities as Philadelphia , Cleveland , Baltimore and Pittsburgh in any week picked at random is striking . The high position of Washington in the list is noticeable , and is easily understood . News dispatched from Washington has particular significance as indicating the contact of the individual in this country and abroad with our own national affairs . At least three indices may be utilized in showing the extent to which these contacts have grown and ramified. ( 1 ) The total number of papers in the United States directly represented in the Press Galleries of the 56th Congress ( 1899 ) was 149 . In the 71st Congress ( 1929 ) it was 308 , or double the former figure . ( 2 ) The number of syndicates and press associations represented in the press galleries increased ( luring the same period from 3 to 19 , with an 16H J NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 113 . Since these press associations and syndicates supply papers throughout the United States with Washington dispatches , this growth suggests the more thorough collection and more widespread dissemination of information from the national capitol throughout this country . ( 3 ) A more thorough coverage of Washington news by the nation 's press is shown further by an increase from 62 in 1899 to 183 in 1929 in the number of American cities having newspapers with special Washington representatives . Some of the increase comes with the growth in the number of cities having sufficient population to sustain such representatives . Making allowance for this factor , it will be found that between 1909 and 1929 the relative growth in such representation was largest for the class of cities having , in each of these years , between 50,000 and 100,000 population . The classes 25,000 to 50,000 and 100,000 to 250,000 also showed a relative growth in representation , by ratios which nearly doubled in the same period . Other classes of cities , by population , relatively declined or remained stationary . Hence it may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation , supplementing press association service , in the cities of middle size . ' COMMUNICATION AGENCIES During this period , when press representation at Washington was being extended in these cities of medium size and in smaller cities above 25,000 population , papers in the larger cities , already well represented , were expanding their Washington staffs . They were in this way becoming more independent of press associations for news material , and thereby achieving greater individuality in their reporting . The smaller papers , even though represented by special correspondents who furnished them on occasion with pertinent material of local bearing ( and often represented several papers simultaneously ) were still largely dependent on the press associations . Taken together , this increase in staff of the larger papers , and the more frequent use of special representatives by the smaller , constitute an intensification in the coverage of the Washington field by the newspapers of the country . The increases in press representation in Washington of individual papers vary geographically . They were relatively greatest in New England and next in the West South Central Division . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just as residents of the United States are dependent in large part upon their newspapers for information about current affairs in Europe , so the foreigner is primarily dependent upon his newspaper for American news . The number of foreign papers represented at Washington , while small , has fluctuated widely between a minimum of 5 in 1899 and a maximum of 18 in 1929 . Foreign press associations and syndicates were first listed in the press galleries in 1911 with two representatives . In 1929 there were 5 such organizations with 6 representatives . ' 170 J NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS It is generally assumed that American interest in European and other foreign affairs received an impetus during the World War . Data on telegraphic transoceanic news traffic prior to the outbreak of the European conflict are not available , but Table 50 displays its volume from 1916 onward . Outstanding is the fact that in every year between 1916 and 1929 , inclusive , the number of words received from across the Atlantic ( col. 2 ) was more than double the number transmitted ( col. 4 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disparity . While incoming news increased two and one-half fold , COMMUNICATION AGENCIES outgoing news quadrupled . Quantity alone gives no indication of the value of the news transmitted , but the figures do indicate a growing international consciousness . Contrary to the trans-Atlantic balance of news , in 6 of the 11 years from 1920 to 1930 , inclusive , more words were transmitted from this country across the Pacific ( col. 5 ) than were received ( col. 3 ) . Trans-Pacific dispatches are but a small fraction of the trans-Atlantic . Although more irregular than the latter , the general rates of increase , both incoming and outgoing , have been about the same . The smaller volume and the irregularity of trans-Pacific dispatches , when compared with trans-Atlantic , suggest that Far Eastern affairs have comparatively little importance in the American mind . For American readers , an event has more news value in a European than in a trans-Pacific setting . Oriental affairs , for example , have news value only in situations deviating more widely from the normal . Recent Sino-Japanese conflicts illustrate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European background of American culture and traditions . Nor is it surprising , when consideration is taken of the westward diffusion of American culture , that the balance of news across the Pacific should so often be in the west-bound direction . It is probable that this balance would be even greater except for the relatively high costs of trans-Pacific communication , in meeting which the publisher from across the Pacific is at a comparative disadvantage . The Newspaper and Communication. ? It is not the present purpose to discuss such qualitative changes in the content of the newspaper as the increased attention given to sports and finance ; the place of sensational matter symbolized by the rise of the " tabloid " ; or the increased proportions of non-news reading matter , such as comic strips , stories and other " magazine " materials . These are trends which vary widely from paper to paper , and which together constitute a separate problem . The present intent has been to describe the recent grow Iii and the essential status of an agency by means of which it 172 NEWSPAPERS AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a large segment of the population , whatever materials are selected for publication . The widespread permeation of the population by the newspaper was indicated in the figures of circulation per thousand population , which also hint that a saturation point is being reached , following an actual decline in the number of papers themselves . This decline contributes to the standardizing process , which is also fostered by chain ownership , modern practices of newsgathering , and syndication . Regardless of the kind of materials which the newspaper presents , these come to the reader from an increasing number of distant points , among which the nation 's capital and transoceanic centers have increasing prominence . For the press as a whole it can not be said whether or not there is a parallel increase in the quantity of local news . To the extent that non-local news is found in the columns of the paper , the intensification of local contacts , observed as a result of the utilization of the transportation and point to point agencies , may be counterbalanced . In either event , the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , whose contacts with the rest of the world have been correspondingly multiplied . This opens possibilities for enhanced understanding or distrust , depending upon the use to which this agency of mass impression is put . Newspaper and Periodical Advertising. ? The dissemination of advertising as well as news is an important function of both the newspaper and the periodical , although these are not the only media that may be utilized for this purpose . I t is possible , for example , to employ point to point agencies of communication for this purpose , especially by the largescale distribution of material through the mails , already alluded to in Part II . Again , the radio has introduced new forms of advertising which have already brought it into competition with the older agencies , as will be seen in a following section . The newspaper and magazine , however , st ill coast hate the traditional and standard approach to the consumer . Their importance in this respect rests upon the I 173 I COMMUNICATION AGENCIES fact that they make possible a national market for the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to summarize because of the absence of any single source for the collection of data relating to the country as a whole . If data were available it would be pertinent to learn whether local or national advertising has grown at the more rapid rate , with a consequent balance of effects upon the intensification of local or national contacts . One index of the volume of newspaper advertising is given in Table 51 . This table indicates that coincident with the end of the World War lineage increased in a single year by nearly 40 per cent , thereby attaining a new level below which , until 1931 , it did not subsequently drop . From 1921 onward there was an irregular gain , which showed tendencies toward retardation , until the onset of depression in 1930 . These increases in volume reflect , in part , the extension of national advertising campaigns , and in particular those associated with the automobile industry . A study by the New York Evening Post shows that in 56 selected Sunday newspapers , national advertising lineage showed net gains of 31.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the same period local advertising declined 11.9 per cent , and classified advertising lost 12.6 per cent . ' 1 174 I NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS Expenditures for national magazine advertising are available from 1925 to 1931 , inclusive , and are as follows : 1925 $154,450,000 1926 177,448,000 1927 ........................ 190,818,000 1928 ........................ 185,205,000 1929 ........................ 203,776,000 1930 ........................ 201,885,000 1931 ........................ 166,556,000 A steady growth within this period to 1929 is indicated , with a slight recession in 1930 , and a much sharper drop in 1931.1 Table 52 shows the comparative importance of advertising and circulation revenues for newspapers and periodicals . It is evident that advertising plays a somewhat more important part in the total revenues of the former than of the latter . Both show increasing dependence upon advertising for their operation . In so far as the newspaper is concerned , antithetical interpretations of this trend are possible : It may be contended , ' National Advertising Records , Jan. 1931 , and subsequent issues . The expenditure for the first six months of 1932 was $68,332,000 as compared with $91,274-000 for the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , be reflected in the above tabulation. 175 j COMMUNICATION AGENCIES on the one hand , that increasing dependence upon advertisers makes possible control by them in their interest of the news content of the paper . On the other hand , when it is remembered that the number of cities with only one newspaper is increasing , it also becomes apparent that the national advertiser is more limited in his choice of newspaper media , and that the local advertiser may have no choice at all , thus giving the newspaper a higher degree of independence . News , Advertising and Publicity. ? The line between advertising and news is often hard to draw , because the " news value " of events which are of public significance is frequently accompanied by " advertising value " for particular persons or groups . It is to the advantage of innumerable individuals and interests to obtain newspaper mention in such a manner as to serve their ends . In selecting the daily grist of events which they will record or discuss , newspaper publishers and editors are compelled to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments are affected by all of the influences of suggestion and manoeuvering by others to which human beings are subject . In this situation there is provided a setting for the activities of those individuals whose function it is to create favorable attitudes or responses on the part of the public toward their clients or their clients ' goods or services . They influence , when they can , the process of news selection . The press agent and publicity manager are known from the past ; more recently has appeared the public relations counsel . The objective of these specialists in general , is the conjoining of news values with the interests of clients ( who may or may not also be buying advertising space ) by projecting the latter into news situations . They frequently achieve their ends by creating situations in which their clients figure , which are so important or so unusual that their news value can not be ignored . Thus entrance to the news columns is achieved . Access to the magazine page may be gained by analogous methods . Techniques for accomplishing the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PICTURE ing . Reiteration is important . The purpose is always the same : to induce attitudes or behavior by the public in accordance with predetermined calculations of private interest . This is best effected when the reader unsuspectingly accepts as impartial or disinterested , news or magazine matter which has been charged with publicity values . XV . THE MOTION PICTURE The Development of the Industry. ? The motion picture is a second agency of mass impression , important not only because of its widespread appeal , but also because of the uniquely concentrated attention which it induces in its audience . It is a lineal descendant of the stereopticon , or magic lantern , and the drama ? two parents which still play important parts in the communication of attitudes and ideas . While the motion picture had been a novelty prior to 1903 , it was in that year that the first independent " story picture " is said to have been produced . The first motion picture theatres were " nickelodeons , " and began to appear between 1902 and 1905 . All of the early pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multireel pictures exhibited . ' National distribution of films began in 1914 . Some evidence of the rise to prominence of the motion picture industry is found in the number of trade and popular periodicals devoted exclusively to it , which increased with almost unbroken regularity from 4 in 1911 to 54 in 1928 , from which point it declined to 38 in 1930.2 In discussing the motion picture as a medium of communication today , a distinction between theatrical and nontheatrical uses must be constantly maintained . While the activities of the commercial theatre are universally apparent , the importance of the non-theatrical picture in education , science , industry , commerce , the home , and for other special purposes , is not so generally recognized . 177 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES The motion picture industry has developed with tremendous rapidity , under competitive conditions which have provided incentives toward secrecy of business operations . It exhibits much of the exuberance characteristic of a rush to unexploited fields , or a new industry in the first flush of its growth . The resulting individualism of a large number of separate enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical information exceedingly difficult . Jesse L. Lasky has estimated that in 1910 there were approximately 9,000 theatres , auditoriums , halls , etc. , in the United States in which motion pictures were exhibited ) . On January 31 , 1931 , the Motion Picture Division of the United States Department of Commerce estimates that there were 22,731 motion picture houses in the United States , with an aggregate seating capacity of 11 , - 300,000.2 The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America , Inc. , accepts this estimate and believes that 14,000 of these houses were operating on schedules that called for performances at least two days per week . In recent years , many small houses have been discontinued because of competition from larger theatres and inability to meet the costs of installing apparatus for the production of sound effects.3 Inasmuch as producers ' charges for pictures are often based upon attendance , the latter is not infrequently a subject of dispute between producers and exhibitors.4 All estimates of total motion picture attendance , in consequence , are subject to distinct limitations . The Motion . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. , has arrived at annual estimates based upon the relationship in 1922 between amusement tax receipts by the United States Treasury Department and the estimated seating capacity of the theatres . This ratio has been projected for subsequent years on the basis of estimated seating capacities . The organization 's estimates of aggregate motion picture attendance per week in the United States are as follows : The sharp increase immediately after 1928 is attributable to public interest in the talking motion picture . In 1931 , attendance dropped sharply , and the decline continued in 1932 , with some estimates of losses as high as 40 per cent . In 1930 , 500 feature films were produced , from each one of which 200 or more prints were made a number sufficient to maintain the 175,000 to 200,000 weekly performances in the United States and Canada . ' In 1929 , according to the Census of Manufactures , 2,543 films of all lengths were produced for theatrical exhibition.2 Of these , 689 were dialogue films ( talkies ) while an additional 344 included sound effects without speech . Silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export . The Introduction of Sound. ? The addition of dialogue and sound to the motion picture has enhanced its importance as an agency of mass impression , for the reason that I 179 1 COMMUNICATION AGENCIES it joins an appeal to the ear with an appeal to the eye . By 1926 the principles which made possible the recent development of sound pictures had been perfected and successfully introduced . On January 1 , 1931 , the number of motion picture theatres wired for sound apparatus was estimated to be 12,500.1 The novelty interest in the sound picture has been replaced by definite acceptance and habituation ; in two years the silent picture became almost an anachronism . It is still too soon to predict the ultimate effects of this change , either upon the industry or upon the social habits related to it . The silent film depended for its impression upon external conduct and behavior ? upon action . What screen characters did could easily be portrayed ; what they thought , the audience learned only in indirection , or through captions . The introduction of sound effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation , as contrasted with conduct and behavior , has been opened to the producer as subject matter for his presentations . Whereas the pictures hitherto could deal only with persons , they can now deal with personalities . Psychological depth is achieved . Metaphorically , it is now possible to put the camera to the mind of the character portrayed and reveal his intellectual and emotional life . All of this raises new and difficult problems for the producer . There is the possibility that the portrayal of motivations in screen characters will introduce a degree of subtlety sufficient to destroy the entertainment value of the picture for the mass of the audience . To be generally understood , the motives represented must be simple ; and the characters to this extent become " unreal . " The most difficult problem of the producer , therefore , is that of blending " talk " and " action " in forms and proportions calculated to appeal to those who constitute the bulk of the motion picture audience . Some observers have contended that children have less interest in the talking picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies , and that the same is true of the child-minded adult . Others contend that these patrons prefer the " talkies . " The fact probably is that children , and many of their elders , do prefer the " talkies , " provided these are within the level of their comprehension . Whatever the ultimate balance between sound and action may be in the development of screen technique , it is clear that sound has made it possible to dramatize many subjects that were beyond the range of the silent picture . The result is that the motion picture has come to resemble the theatre more closely , as is evidenced by the fact that the literature of drama is increasingly drawn upon for motion picture scenarios . The Motion Picture and Social Habits. ? The effects of the motion pictures upon attitudes , values and standards constitute a problem of bewildering complexity . Any discussion of this topic must begin with a realization of the tremendous vitality that the pictures possess for their nation-wide audience . Pictures , actresses and actors , by the average movie-goer , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal criteria of judgment . Editors of popular motion picture magazines are deluged with letters from motion picture patrons , unburdening themselves of an infinite variety of feelings and attitudes , deeply personal , which focus around the lives and activities of those inhabiting the screen world . One such editor receives more than 80,000 letters a year . A single article in his magazine , questioning the public adoration of a film luminary , produced 15,854 letters within one month . ' Not only are intense partisanships revealed in the letters of motion picture enthusiasts : a surprisingly large number are self-revealing , in that they naively disclose both deliberate and unconscious copying by the writers of the mannerisms , movements and diction of screen figures ; or the acceptance of these as preferred qualities in the opposite sex . They disclose the degree to which personality stereotypes are created , and ego ideals moulded in relation there ' " " 1'onclt Not .

Observant artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , counterparts in dress and manner and cut of hair of American film stars . Each month 's mail brings hundreds of requests for information concerning the availability of dress patterns , concerning points of etiquette raised by the action of characters in certain pictures , inquiring where house furnishing of given types seen in movie settings may be procured , and so onall indicative of the inculcation of moving picture standards . ' Commercial interests in recent years have been quick to take advantage of the prestige of motion picture actresses and actors . A commercial mechanism has been developed whereby manufacturers and retailers of women 's clothing are acquainted in advance with the specific garments to be worn by popular stars in forthcoming productions , in order to be prepared to meet the demand that normally follows the release of the picture . One of the leaders in the nation 's shoe industry states of a given star , that whenever she wears a new style of shoe , it is necessary " to change our shoe pattern to conform , which means an expenditure of many thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new style is created and there is an instantaneous demand for it from women in all parts of the country . " In the cloak and suit industry " under old conditions manufacturers could make up a large quantity of garments in a certain style , and sell them in large cities while the style was at its height ; if they had any left over they could sell them in smaller communities before the new styles had permeated there . Today this is quite impossible because the new styles , through the screen showings become known THE MOTION PICTURE almost as quickly in the small communities as in the large cities . " 1 The utilization of motion picture performances for advertising has evolved gradually , beginning with the use of the lantern slide as a filler between reels . The " trailer , " or short , undisguised , advertising film , usually portraying the wares or services of a local merchant , was a natural sequence . In 1930 , an aggressive utilization of the motion picture as a national advertising medium was undertaken with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general introduction seemed foreshadowed . Radio broadcasting , with its " sponsored " programs , had habituated the public to vocal advertising ; when the talking picture appeared , its employment in a similar manner was an obvious corollary . The sponsored film , so far as content is concerned , contains little or no advertising , but portrays a subject of general appeal . It is announced as " presented by ? , " with the name of the advertiser given . For privilege of exhibition , the advertiser pays an agreed rate , based upon the attendance at the theatre . The opposition of newspapers and magazines led in 1931 to the abandonment of the sponsored film by two of the largest producers and exhibitors , and it is now generally regarded as in the discard , at least temporarily . A more disarming type of advertising appeared with the unobtrusive inclusion within feature films of scenes suggesting the merits of nationally known goods or services . This technique has not been widely developed , but it offers farreaching possibilities of advertising control . ' Competent observers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this form of advertising . The potency of the motion picture in influencing attitudes and standards has been widely recognized , and has led for many years to conflict between those who would invoke a rigid censorship upon it and those who would leave its development relatively unfettered . A third group senses Quoted statement of Raymond V. Ingersoll , Impartial Chairman Cloak &; COMMUNICATION AGENCIES the need for thoroughgoing studies of its influences upon social values . ' Censorship provisions by governmental agencies carry effects far beyond the jurisdictions to which they apply , since producers must seek a common denominator of sanction for the scenes displayed . Thus , for example , a control held by Boston police authorities over Sunday film exhibitions determine the cuts or deletions on all days , in all films , throughout the state . Similarly , the action taken by the Motion Picture Division of the State Education Department in New York ( the state censorship authority ) determines what will be shown to motion picture audiences in many parts of the country . In the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1928 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes and 965 titles were eliminated . Of the total eliminations , 2,101 were on the ground that the material tended to incite to crime ; 607 were regarded as indecent , 764 as inhuman , 643 as immoral or corrupting of morals , and 121 as sacrilegious . Six pictures were rejected in toto.2 Eliminations and rejections involve great expense to producers , who are naturally concerned to avoid them . A considerable amount of preliminary self-censorship exists within the industry , including the work of " The National Board of Review . " Opponents of censorship , within and without the production field , contend that it induces a conservative unwillingness to experiment . In any event , the producers ' problem is complicated further by the fact that there is considerable variation in the standards employed by public censorship boards in the judging of pictures . Non-theatrical Use of Motion Pictures. ? Some indication of the extent to which motion pictures are employed for non-theatrical purposes is contained in the large number of motion picture projectors , roughly estimated at 190,000 or more , including home sets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture exhibitors . ' For example , the National Committee for Study of Social Values in Motion Pictures , whose extensive studies are soon to be published . THE MOTION PICTURE This number is eight times the number of projectors now in service in theatres . ' The use of the motion picture in connection with school systems is indicated by returns from 517 representative primary and secondary public schools in the United States included in a study published in 1931 by the Department of Commerce . In these schools , during a period of one year preceding their reports , there were 44,186 showings of motion picture films , of which 73 per cent were in connection with curricular activities . Of the total showings , 40.6 per cent were in elementary schools , 27.2 per cent in junior high schools , and 32.1 per cent in senior high schools . ' No reliable figures are available concerning the extent of industrial , business , scientific and other non-commercial and non-school uses of motion picture films . Numerous independent non-theatrical producers are engaged in making films on special order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts of this type . Typical of such films are those demonstrating sales methods to employes of branch offices of national sales organizations , where the effects upon merchandising technique are said to be profound ; those demonstrating processes in the manufacture of articles or commodities for special exhibition before employes , public groups or prospective customers ; and outdoor advertising films . In 1932 the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Commerce issued a composite list of non-theatrical film sources , and this list contained names of 5 24 firms which had such films for distribution . ' A unique use for the motion picture has been found in the analysis of complex movement . Employing special cameras , it is possible , for example , to record the otherwise unobservable details of motion in living organisms . Not COMMUNICATION AGENCIES only may the trot of the horse or the flight of the bird be reduced to slow movement , but even the growth of plants or the behavior of the amoeba may be translated into rates of change which permit close analysis of the component motions involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found . Many films have been produced illustrating scientific processes or skills , as for example in the field of surgery . In industry , slow motion studies have been made of workers at machines , to ascertain efficient methods of operation . Athletic coaches have found films useful in analyzing team plays , as in football , and the movements involved in swimming , tennis , and golf . Together , these and many other uses of the motion picture provide new implements of scientific investigation and new modes of human communication . XVI . RADIO BROADCASTING ' Census enumerators in 1930 asked this question : " Do you own a radio set ? " The instrument about which they inquired can scarcely be said to have existed in 1920 , when the previous census was taken . The dramatic suddenness with which radio broadcasting has gained overwhelming popular acceptance since the establishment of the first broadcasting station in 1920 has seldom , if ever , been surpassed in the history of cultural change , and probably has no counterpart except in the growth of motor vehicles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time an important agency of mass impression , of far greater significance than the phonograph , its nearest prototype . By means of broadcasting , America has been turned into a vast auditorium , into all corners of which a single voice can carry with dramatic ease and clarity . Broadcasting is but one of numerous important phases of the general development of wireless communication . As RADIO BROADCASTING shown on page 130 , the band allotted to it comprises a relatively small segment of the radio spectrum . Its social significance , however , is far greater than this comparatively small band would indicate , and in the public mind it looms larger than all other phases of wireless communication together . The Distribution of Radio Sets. ? In determining the distribution of instruments of reception , two somewhat different units are employed . The Bureau of the Census made its enumeration in 1930 in connection with its census of families . It therefore reports the number of families owning ( one or more ) sets . Production and sales data are employed , together with census data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which results in a larger figure . The Bureau of the Census enumerated 12,078,345 families owning radio sets in continental United States , as of April 1 , 1930.1 Twenty-one months later , on January 1 , 1932 , 16,026,620 sets were in use in the United States , according to an estimate of the Columbia Broadcasting System . These gross figures , while of interest as showing the extent of set ownership as compared with other media of communication , do not indicate the wide variations that exist within the country when different groupings of the population are compared . Within the gross estimate are concealed at least five significant differentials that are disclosed by analysis of the census figures : ( 1 ) regional , ( 2 ) urban-rural , ( 3 ) economic , ( 4 ) metropolitan concentration , ( 5 ) racial . These will be discussed in sequence . Table 53 shows the distribution of families owning radio sets by states and geographic divisions . The other agencies of communication that have hitherto been discussed , with the partial exception of motor vehicles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The radio , on the other hand , is essentially a family medium . While ratios relating the number of families owning sets to the total population , would be of interest , therefore , they are of less significance than those of column 4 which show the percentage of all families owning sets . ' Since the radio is primarily an agency of mass impression , the region in which there is the highest percentage of family ownership may be regarded as the area of highest potential COMMUNICATION AGENCIES " coverage " for anyone wishing to reach the entire population . Table 53 shows that if all radio sets were in use simultaneously , the largest proportion of families would be listening in the Middle Atlantic Division , including the states of New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania . These would be more than half the total number of families in this Division , and would be relatively four times as great as the number listening in the East South Central Division , comprising the states of Kentucky , Tennessee , Alabama and Mississippi . However , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when divisional classifications are disregarded . Thus there is an extreme variation in the percentage of all families owning sets between New Jersey ( 63.3 per cent ) and Mississippi ( 5.4 per cent ) . The possibility of reaching families in the former state is approximately twelve times as great , proportionately , as in the latter . In general , the eastern , northern and Pacific states show high ratios of set ownership and the southern states , low ratios . Within any region or state , equally wide variations tend to exist between individual counties . This may be seen in the following tabulation , which gives respectively , for the nine geographic divisions , the highest proportion of families owning radio sets in any county , and the lowest such proportion . It may be observed that all of the divisions have counties with high coverage and that all except four have counties with extremely low coverage : 100J
