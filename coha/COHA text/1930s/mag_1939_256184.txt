Three years ago Serge Koussevitzky , conductor of the Boston Symphony , took a vacation . To pinch hit for Maestro Koussevitzky the orchestra 's board of directors picked an obscure , lean , bald-headed Greek named Dimitri Mitropoulos . Boston 's Brahmins , who thought all Greeks ran lunch wagons , had never heard of Conductor Mitropoulos . At the way he bounded to his place on the stage and went into action , they turned pale with alarm . <P> Not in many years had they seen such an exhibition of jumping , crouching and beating the air as this slippery-skulled Greek gave them . But under his jumping-jack direction the staid Boston Symphony , churned into a lather of excitement , surpassed itself . Delighted Boston critics gave Mitropoulos full marks , even hinted at comparisons with the great Koussevitzky himself . When he came back a second time , Conductor Mitropoulos made almost too much of a hit . After that Maestro Mitropoulos did not guest-conduct in Boston again . <P> But next year , after Eugene Ormandy had left the Minneapolis Symphony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minneapolitans soon found that their new Greek had a mind of his own . In a small dormitory room on the University of Minnesota campus with a studio couch , an upright piano and two trunks , he lived the life of a monk . When he did go out for an evening , it was not with Minneapolis ' dowagers but with some fiddler or bassoonist from his own orchestra . A devout Greek Orthodox Catholic , he wore a crucifix inside his shirt and a medallion of the Virgin Mary in the lining of his coat , never ventured to conduct without them both . When he was not conducting or studying scores , he could usually be found in the gallery of a Nicollet Avenue cinema theatre . <P> Minneapolitans grew proud and fond of their Maestro Mitropoulos , bought out every last seat of their huge Northrop Auditorium ( capacity 4,800 ) . The men in the orchestra followed their leader with a devotion bordering on worship . Visitors discovered that some of the most brilliant and spectacular U. S. conducting since the peak days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year , with Mitropoulos ' fame spreading to bigger cities , Minneapolis tied him securely with a three-year contract . <P> Stuffier Minneapolitans were always a little embarrassed by Mitropoulos ' lack of dignity . But last week , as their symphony rounded out its season with an appeal for funds to balance the $250,000 annual budget , they thanked their stars for it . " Never mind my dignity , " said Conductor Mitropoulos . " If necessary to continue the orchestra , I 'll take the men to Seventh and Nicollet heart of downtown Minneapolis and play there and then pass the hat . " <P> That was not necessary . But one night last week , in the Nicollet Hotel 's ballroom , Conductor Mitropoulos and his men played a concert of musical burlesques and waltzes by Johann Strauss . Then , sure enough , they did pass the hat-to some 400 of Minneapolis ' solider citizens . Into it dropped $20,000 and promises that the Minneapolis Symphony 's annual guarantee fund of $130,000 would be fully subscribed for the next two years .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
