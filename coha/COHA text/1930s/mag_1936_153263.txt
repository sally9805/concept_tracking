Esquire ( " The Magazine for Men " ) was established as a quarterly in October 1933 . Its sexy cartoons , mannish stories and articles , big pages , colorful men 's fashion drawings , found instant favor with a large and admiring public . Its second issue appeared on a monthly basis . Last month Esquire reached a circulation peak , sent some 440,000 copies to readers throughout the land . Last week this big , slick publishing success branched out with a speculative journalistic sideline . The trade was informed , through the medium of a full-page advertisement in Editor &; Publisher , that " The Magazine for Men " was entering the newspaper syndicate business . <P> First Esquire feeler into syndication came two years ago when Publisher David A. Smart sold a fashion feature , produced by Esquire artists , to 100 papers . This year , with newspaper advertising revenues rising , smart Mr. Smart figured that it would be a good time to offer papers some other features as well . Last July Esquire Features , Inc. was quietly formed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News went able , owlish Howard Denby to be the new syndicate 's vice president and editor . Quickly Mr. Denby allied the Esquire syndicate with the News by arranging for it to market two News features , Howard Vincent O'Brien 's column All Things Considered , and Naturalist Donald Culross Peattie 's A Breath of Outdoors . Counting the old fashion article , the Esquire syndicate offers prospective customers eleven different features , to be purchased singly or in block . <P> Funny material to be purveyed by the new syndicate had a heavy rural cast . As a possible substitute for the wise saws of the late Humorist Will Rogers , which McNaught Syndicate sold to 500 newspapers , Esquire Features offered a daily 150-word gag from Bob Burns , onetime vaudevillian whose radio hillbilly and cinema humor and music on a home-made " bazooka " were last week estimated in Variety to be earning him $400,000 a year . " * Pictorial humor was to be furnished by Esquire Cartoonist Paul Webb 's " Mountain Boys , " a group of grotesque , bearded , barefooted figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of a balky old car , gawking at an aged woman who is hanging from a nearby tree with a crank in her hand . Caption : " C'm on down an ' finish crankin ' ' er , Gran'maw-Shucks-I 'll be late fer school . " <P> Other features included a Personality Institute for women , a children 's cut-out called The World Museum , a serialization of Laurence Greene 's historical scrapbook of U. S. Journalism , America Goes to Press ( TIME , March 30 ) . Publisher Smart and Editor Denby say they will be in the black if they can sell the Esquire feature list to 35 fair-sized papers . With 100 customers , they say they will see big money .
