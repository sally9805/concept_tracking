Within twelve hours after the Supreme Court voided NRA last fortnight the arch-Republican New York Herald Tribune and Los Angeles Times removed the Blue Eagle from their mastheads . Within 24 hours the Boston Transcript , St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Detroit Free Press , many another anti-New Deal newspaper did likewise . Hearst 's Chicago Herald &; Examiner hoisted red-white- &-blue; flags in the Eagle 's place . The New York Times and Scripps-Howard dailies everywhere left their Eagles flying . The lusty , liberal tabloid New York Daily News , first in the city to hoist the Eagle , ostentatiously hauled it down , with a biting editorial explaining that the News and the rest of the Press now had the right to work its employes longer , pay them less , or throw them out altogether . <P> The Newspaper Code Authority warned all publishers to erase all Eagles by June 16 , when the Code expires .

These babies have not been kissed on the mouth by Tom , Dick and Harry , as so many unfortunate little children are kissed ; nobody has been allowed to plant germ diseases in their systems . <P> " In England , gorillas have recently lived and thriven amazingly because the keepers now put plate glass between them and the staring crowds . It is impossible to breathe or sneeze into the face of the captive gorillas and whereas formerly , gorillas in captivity always died quickly of consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ? -
