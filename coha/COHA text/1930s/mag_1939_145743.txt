Although the New Deal has striven through AAA I and II to cut crop production for six years , the nation has been steadily faced by a great economic , political , humanitarian dilemma : agricultural plenty existing side by side with human want . To resolve it without dislocating business has proved a ticklish job . <P> Federal Surplus Commodities Corp . is now spending some $50,000,000 a year buying surpluses and giving them to the poor , which pleases the poor and the farmers but worries the food distributing industry . Last fall Secretary of Agriculture Wallace proposed a bolder " two-price plan " under which surplus goods would be sold at one price to most buyers , at a lower price to the needy . Business reacted so unfavorably that the plan was hastily abandoned . Last week came news of something new under the agricultural sun : a new plan to make farmers , Business and the poor equally happy . <P> When FSCC 's President Jesse Tapp was shelved along with the two-price plan late in January , he was succeeded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1934 when outspoken Milo Perkins was running his own cotton-bagging business in Houston , he wrote Henry Wallace a hot letter denouncing administrative red tape in the first AAA , wrote an article in the Nation excoriating the shortsightedness of his fellow capitalists . In 1935 Henry Wallace hired Mr. Perkins as Assistant Secretary . He later became Assistant Farm Security Administrator , learned plenty at first hand about the woes of stricken agriculturists . Last week Washington Correspondent Alfred Stedman of the St. Paul Dispatch , who had just resigned from a $9,000-a-year publicity job with the Department , uncorked first details of the Perkins Plan , scheduled for formal announcement and discussion at a food trade conference in Washington on March 13-14 . <P> In keeping with the Administration 's new business appeasement drive , Mr. Wallace 's Mr. Perkins proposes to hand over to Business itself the distribution of surpluses . Instead of buying surpluses direct from farmers and doling them out to the needy , FSCC will dole out tickets redeemable for food at any grocery . Grocers would do all the buying and selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government agencies . Families would eventually get enough tickets to increase their food consumption 50% ; i.e. , a poor family spending $16 a month for food would get $8 in tickets . There would be no price controls ; retailers and wholesalers will get their usual profits , thereby making the plan politically appealing . Details of the scheme were not worked out last week , but it was reported that the Perkins Plan would be tried out first in five or six selected cities . <P> FSCC has an allotment of 30% of U. S. customs receipts ( about $90,000,000 a year ) with which to launch the plan , if and when adopted .
