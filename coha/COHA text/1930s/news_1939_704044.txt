txt Enthusiastically cheering , yelling , singing and waving flags in a riotous medley of sound and color , 100 , - 000 school children greeted the King and Queen yesterday morning as they passed through Central Park on their way to the World 's Fair . From the Seventy-second Street entrance at Central Park West to the Ninety-sixth Street exit at Fifth Avenue , the boys and girls , acting as official hosts , lined the East Drive a dozen deep . For two hours the pupils waited  --  they began to arrive in the park at 9:30 ? and with them were 1,500 of their teachers and principals , as well as 350 attendance officers . No sign of impatience was manifest . A picnic spirit prevailed . Although a few of the boys were dressed in Sunday best , with hair slickly combed and faces dItifully scrubbed , the vast majority wore open shirts and their everyday school outfits . Several schools sent delegations of girls dressed all in white , but here again most of the pupils were decidedly informal in their appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park they were assigned to their stations . They trooped in two by two , some of them singing class songs , others laughing and joking with fellow-pupils recognized along the route . A sixty-five-piece band from the High School of Commerce enlivened the long wait with spirited . numbers . At other points fifeand-drum corps struck up martial airs . By - 10:30 all of the children were in their places . Walter E. O'Leary , acting director of attendance , in charge of the arrangements , estimated that 100,000 pupils lined the road , with another 50,000 , mostly parents , right behind the children . In all eases the pupils were placed in the front ranks . More than 25,000 British and American flags were distributed , and-these were highly prized by the youngsters elected to the " honor " of waving them . By and large , it seemed that the girls were rather more excited about the impending visit than the boys . In fact , some of the boys admitted that they were present only because it was expected of them and that , confidentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls evidently thought this was the , most eventful hour of their young lives . Pretty Elsie Hummel , a seventhgrade pupil at Public School 96 , Manhattan , nearly trembled with anticipation . She had arisen at 5 A. M. , just to be sure that she did not miss a thing that might happen during the day . " Oh , am I glad to be here ! " she exclaimed . " Ltagine , I 'm going to see the King and Queen ! " Five of Children Faint By 11 o'clock the sunshine had become a little oppressive and a few of the children began to wilt . A. first-aid station was set up , but no serious accident occurred . Five girls fainted and they were taken out of line . But one girl , after being revived , refused to leave . " Oh , no , " she protested , " I 'm staying right here to see the Queen . " By all odds it was the Queen who excited the most interest . This was doubly true among the girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look and if she were as pretty as the papers said she was . Of course , the King was worth seeing , too , but the Queen was the pet of the crowd . At 11:30 the excitement had perceptibly increased and a slight nervousness could be felt . " They 'll be here , soon , " one child would say Jo another . " I wonder what they 'll look like ? " Then they discussed their ill fate that this occasion should take place on a Saturday , a school holiday anyway . Still , the day was not " wasted , " the children agreed . " I 'll always remember this in the years to go by , " Lucy Maietta , 14 , of Julia Richman High School , said with a happy giggle . " Every one of us will , " a chorus of girls echoed noisily . Boys Profess Boredom No , not quite every one , John Yeroian , 14 , a seventh-grade student at Public School 59 , Manhattan , said boredly . " I 'm tired wait. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffed . " Let them come , let them go , it 's all the same to me . " His pal , Calvin Schmidt , 12 , agreed 100 per cent with John 's sentiments . " I 'm not at all excited , " he said with a shrug . " I 'd rather take a nice dip than stand here . " Other boys in the vicinity caught the spirit . They , too , were " unimpressed . " In fact , coercion had been used to get some of them to the park , Nicholas Nuzzi , 12 , also of Public School 59 , confessed . " My mother forced me to come , " he related . " She made me get dressed and all . Maybe it 's all right to see the King and Queen , but we got to have fun , too . " But as the moment for the royal arrival approached , even the patently unimpressed lads began to take notice . " Do you hear them , are they coming ? " one asked another . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon three bombers roared overhead , accompanied by half a dozen smaller planes , flying in formation . A moment later an advance squadron of motor cycle policemen sped through the park . " They 're coming , they 're in the park , " the children began to shout . From the sea of children came a roaring wave of noise that boomed and echoed from one end of the park to the other . Forgotten was the " coercion , " forgotten the desire for a cool dip , forgotten the real or fancied disinterest . A rhapsodic fervor seemed to sweep over the youthful crowd . " Oh , here they come ! " " Here they are ! Here they are ! " " Yea , yea , hurry , the King and Queen ! " A Glimpse Leaves Memories In but a few minutes , the royal entourage had passed , leaving behind 100,000 frenzied , shouting themselves hoarse . It was as though a history bock had opened , revealed a dazzling fairyland picture , and then had just as suddenly closed again . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections , from the heart of Manhattan and from Park Avenue , had actually seen the King and Queen ! Here was something long to remember and everlastingly cherish . Almost breathless in their rapture , . words tumbling in unrestrained profusion , the children tried to express their delight at what they had ' seen . Here again it was the Queen who won her way into the young hearts . " Oh , she is so nice , " Margaret Fedorho , 13 , of Public School 17 , Manhattan , sighed . " She is much prettier than she is in the pictures , " Maxine Snyder , 12 , broke in . " Is n't she a darling . " " I think she is pretty  --  dressed all in blue , " Mary Conti , 15 , also of Public School 17 , murmured . " She was so beautiful and gorgeous . " But the King had his quota of admirers .

As far as Sonny Del Rosario , 13 , of Public School 51 was concerned , he did not feel at all different after seeing the royal entourage . In fact , he was just a bit disappointed . " I prefer a big parade , " he said . Over Too Soon for Some What , upset most of the children was the fact that it was all over so quickly . Although the cars had slowed down to fifteen miles an hour , the King and Queen had passed before many of the pupils had a good view. , " They should have gone slower , " Morris Yorkowitz , 15 , of Public School 64 , commented . " I 'm disappointed . " Then he added hastily : " Still , it was worth waiting for . " " Why did they go by so fast ? " another pupil of Public School 64 , Irving Segal , 14 , asked glumly . " I wish they had taken their time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed my breakfast . I suppose it was worth it , though . " What impressed many of the children was the friendliness shown bp the monarchs . As the entourage passed , the King and Queen waved and nodded to all . " They waved to us like ordinary people , they were so friendly , " Leonard Kofsky , 14 , of Public school 64 , observed . Then he became philosophical . " I think it is one of the most wonderful things that has ever happened to America , " he added . A similar view was expressed by Harvey Manner , 14 . " They were friendly people , " he remarked . " They were n't high tone with their noses in the air . " Turnout Pleases Officials The show was over , and the school officials snapped into action . In massed formation , the children , still eager and alert after ati eventful morning , left the park . Most of them were thrilled and excited . Now the English and history books would be more meaningful when the British Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Marshall , president of the Board of Education , made a tour of inspection with Mr. O'Leary and he reported the day a complete success . Evidently recognizing the Board of Education car , one little girl called out : " Why do n't you cut Out the Regents exams ? " Mr. Marshall laughed heartily at this request , but did not give the pupil any encouragement . As far as the school officials were concerned , nothing could have been better , not even the weather , Mr. O'Leary commented after the park had been cleared . It only took a half-hour , using the Central Park West and Fifth Avenue exits , to march the children out . " I never saw them behave better or act more orderly , " he said . " I 'm very happy and delighted . " Deputy Inspector Charles 0 . Nelson was in charge of the police arrangements . Assigned to him were two captains , two lieutenants , fourteen sergeants , 200 patrolmen and a motorcycle patrolman .
