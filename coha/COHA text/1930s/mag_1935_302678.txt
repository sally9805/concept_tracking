Malaria is stoically accepted as the recurrent curse of the Southern states . Last year South Carolina had more than its normal share of the disease and in Camden County , N. C. a particularly malignant form laid some 500 persons low in two months . These outbreaks , however , did not perturb the rest of the nation . People know that only mosquitoes carry malaria infection from one person to another . Hence those who live in malarial districts shield themselves from mosquitoes by screening their windows , putting netting over their beds and dosing themselves with quinine . The more foresighted prevent the breeding of mosquitoes by draining swamps and oiling ponds where mosquitoes lay their eggs . Thus malaria in epidemic form has vanished from most of the U. S. and people have forgotten that , except perhaps for tuberculosis , no single disease is spread so widely throughout the world , killing and disabling so many individuals . <P> Last week the forgotten might of malaria made itself heard . Since early December reports have come from Ceylon that malaria was decimating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India . Last week 's dispatches mentioned 250,000 cases , 3,000 deaths in a single district . In some villages nine out of ten people have been stricken . What the British administrators who govern Ceylon as a Crown Colony mostly fear is that the Ceylon epidemic may spread to the Indian mainland and rouse a plague like that of 1908 when in the Punjab alone 3,000,000 people died of fever . <P> The micro-organisms which cause malaria breed in the red blood cells of human beings and in the bellies of common anopheline mosquitoes . The male anopheline is a vegetarian . But the female loves human blood . When she bites someone who has malaria she drinks his infected blood . When later she bites a healthy individual she plunges some malaria germs into his flesh . The germs make straight for red blood cells , dig their way in and live off the contents . The strain of voiding dead blood cells , manufacturing new ones and trying to live on a deficient supply is what was killing thousands of Cingalese last week . <P> The chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of dying red cells and scatter their spores throughout the blood . After the chill comes fever . This occurs while the spores settle into uninfected red cells . Many people , unable to stand repeated shocks of chills and fevers , weaken and die . <P> Quinine and certain recently invented synthetic drugs have especial affinity for malaria organisms in the blood . Careful and consistent dosing for eight weeks cures the disease in most people . Such a cure , however , does not give immunity against new malarial infections . Some cases are never cured although they may be latent for years . The reason for relapse is obscure . Specialists guess that the malarial parasite acquires a form which quinine can not assail until some accident of ill health intervenes .
