For two months a committee of the New York Curb Exchange hunted high &; low for a man who cynics said did not exist . To be the Curb 's first paid president the committee wanted someone with executive ability , personality , contacts and nerve ; someone who had taken no part in the bitter internal strife that preceded reorganization of the Exchange ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) ; someone who , with all these qualities , could be hired for $25,000 a year . While painstakingly going through a list of 50-odd names , the committee sneaked away from Curb headquarters to meet in unpublicized seclusion , thereby got to be known as the " Silent Five . " Last week the Silent Five agreed on George Peters Rea and even cynics cheered . <P> George Rea was a bond salesman in Buffalo before the War , later helped form a Buffalo investment banking firm ( Vietor , Hubbell , Rea &; Common ) . Then , after a turn with Buffalo 's Fidelity Trust Co. as chief of its underwriting department , he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join Goldman , Sachs in Manhattan . When Goldman , Sachs 's investment trust business fizzled , he set himself up as a consultant to banks . <P> In 1931 the Bishop National Bank of Honolulu consulted him about becoming its president , and George Rea thought that would be fine . In seven years he built Bishop 's assets from 30 to 50 millions , enjoyed himself no end with golf , surfriding and singing in a barber-shop quartet . He resigned last December , took his wife on a long vacation in the Orient and the Philippines . Last week he landed in San Francisco , received a telephone call from one of the Curb Exchange 's Silent Five , rushed to Manhattan and landed the job . <P> Stocky , ruddy , blond George Rea 's first act as president of the Curb was to go down on the floor and shake hands with every member there . His grin and his grip augured well for his regime . " The only question on Rea , " wrote the Journal-American 's Financial Columnist Leslie Gould , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone downtown would swap a Stock Exchange seat for a good palm tree ?
