To Broadway blithe May brings only the kiss of death . This year , however , May tripped into Manhattan carrying in her arms a lusty infant World 's Fair from Flushing , Long Island , a babe supposed to bring luck to Broadway . All it has brought so far is one of the worst theatrical slumps in years , perhaps because the curious are visiting the Fair instead of the theatre . <P> But financially , 1938-39 was a cut above 1937-38 . Like last season , about 50% of its 90-odd plays were out- &-out; flops . But compared to last season 's 19 , 24 plays ran ( or will run for the Fair ) over 100 performances . <P> Biggest moneymaker : the Shuberts ' and Olsen &; Johnson 's production of Hellzapoppin . Most costly flop : Dwight Wiman 's production of Great Lady . Most gored theme : antifascism , which begot four failures . Up the ladder : The Group Theatre , which produced Clifford Odets ' intense Rocket to the Moon , revived his brilliant Awake and Sing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Highlands . Down the chute : Orson Welles 's Mercury Theatre which , after its sensational doings last season , collapsed on Broadway with the anemic Danton 's Death , on tour with the acrobatic Five Kings . <P> As last season , Hollywood had no production finger in any important Broadway pie . But unlike last season , it paid some fancy prices for hits . Abe Lincoln in Illinois was sold to Max Gordon Plays &; Pictures Co . Inc. on a cash and royalty basis that may come to over $300,000 , set a record . The American Way was sold to Gordon for $250,000 . Setting a precedent , The Philadelphia Story was sold to Katharine Hepburn ( its star ) before it ever opened on Broadway .
