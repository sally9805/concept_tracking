It took the Federal Government less than a month to catch Harvey J. Bailey and Albert Bates , leaders of the gang which kidnapped Oklahoma 's Charles Frederick Urschel last July . It took the Oklahoma City Federal court less than a fortnight to try them . Last week it took the jury only two and one-half hours to find them guilty . A verdict was returned against Bailey , Bates , Farmer R. L. ( " Boss " ) Shannon and his wife and son ( accused of hiding Urschel on their Texas farm ) , and two Minneapolis money-passers who handled part of the $200,000 ransom . Three other accused money-passers were acquitted . <P> But bigger kidnapping news than Oklahoma City 's came from Memphis where George R. ( " Machine Gun ' ' ) Kelly fell into the hands of the police . Wanted in Oklahoma City for the Urschel kidnapping , wanted in Kansas City for murder , wanted in Chicago and St. Paul for robbery and murder , Kelly-a heavyset , black-haired ex-convict who got into crime via bootlegging and who boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine gun bullets-had been eluding Federal authorities for more than three months . Thanks to an intercepted telegram and the story of a 12-year-old girl , they caught him one dawn last week in a Memphis bungalow . <P> Detective Sergeant William Raney of Memphis slipped into the house at 6 o'clock . The bedroom door opened . Kelly peered out , pistol in hand . <P> " Drop that gun , Kelly , " said Sergeant Raney shoving his shotgun into Kelly 's stomach . Kelly dropped the pistol . <P> " I 've been waiting for you all night , " he said . <P> " Well , here we are , " replied the Sergeant , pushing his way in . <P> A kitchenette adjoining the room was littered with gin and whiskey bottles . On the table was a half-eaten angel cake . On the floor of the room were some of Kelly 's sawed-off machine guns , weapons he had learned to use after listening to the tales of oldtime racketeers in Leavenworth Penitentiary . In another room the officers found Mrs. Kelly , 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telltale scar of a blow her husband once gave her . " We 've been celebrating our third anniversary , " she explained . " A swell celebration ! Just swell ! " <P> Not until the Kellys were safely behind bars in the Shelby County jail did Federal authorities tell the story of the hunt and the twist that led to Kelly 's capture . " The Kellys left Texas sure they were not linked with the case , " explained Federal Agent William A. Rorer . " They were driving Kathryn Kelly 's 16-cylinder automobile and did n't waste much time in covering their tracks . A magazine detective could have followed them to Minneapolis . From there it was easy to trace them through Chicago to Detroit . In Detroit they began to realize their heels were warm . They found they had been identified and we were after them .
