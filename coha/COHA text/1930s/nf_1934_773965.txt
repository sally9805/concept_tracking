Several of these " garden cities " have been built near New York City . An especially attractive one is at Radburn , New Jersey . Since Colonial times , heating has become more efficient . I t is possible to regulate modern heat by a thermostat in order to obtain an even temperature throughout the house . To-day you probably have a furnace in your home which may be the hot-water , steam , or hot-air type . " These may burn coal , oil , gas , or coke , depending on the locality in which you live . You may be using an electric , gas , oil , or coal-and-wood stove for cooking purposes .

Modern lighting , correctly used , causes less eyestrain than the firelight or candlelight of Colonial days . To-day your home is lighted by electricity , gas , or oil . Of these , electricity is the most efficient , if properly used . There should be a mellow radiance throughout the room , and not patches of glare and gloom . In order to obtain the right effect , lamps should be shaded and distributed about the room ; frosted bulbs should be used ; and lighting should be indirect for general use . Light for reading should fall over the left shoulder . To-day lighting is used for decoration in the home . Lights can be used artistically to emphasize the best features of the room .

The furniture of to-day may be original pieces or reproductions of antiques , the kind made by American furniture manufacturers in the " gay nineties " , or the new modern type . The few original pieces of furniture of the F.arly American period still in existence are of great value historically . The people in whose families these pieces belong value them because of their associations . Reproductions of antiques are used extensively to-day . They combine the beautiful lines of the cabinetmakers Of the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries // with modern methods of construction . These are usually less expensive than the original pieces , and may be chosen to advantage by those who understand the relation between the style of furniture and the type of house in which the furniture is to be used . The furniture made in this country ( luring the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth centuries does not compare well in beauty with that made during the previous periods . The best that can be said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable and inexpensive . In the last five years a distinctly new type of modern furniture has developed . This type of furniture is simple // and characteristic of the generation whose needs it serves . Simplicity of line and fitness to purpose are expressed in modern furniture . It is suitable for modern apartments and offices and may be used by the skilled interior decorator in certain types of houses with pleasing results . This type of furniture is still in its infancy . // You will have the opportunity of watching its development . Household equipment has been devised to meet the needs of the modern home . We are still using some of the materials common in Colonial days . Iron is used less extensively , but iron frying pans , gem pans , and kettles may still be found in the modern kitchen . Copper is figure sometimes used for cooking utensils in hotels and institutions , but is rarely found in the home except for decorative pieces . Brass is used for trays , candle-sticks , book ends , bowls , plates , and ash trays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular for lamps , candle-sticks , dishes , and all sorts of decorative pieces . This new pewter is lighter in color than that used during the Colonial period , is more highly polished , and does not tarnish . Silver is more commonly used to-day than in the early // days of this country . It is used for flat silver , dishes , and decorative pieces . The silver used to-day is divided into two classes , plated and solid or Sterling . Plated silverware is just coated with silver . The better quality is guaranteed to last a lifetime . Solid silver is the solid metal and is usually stamped " Sterling " , a symbol of recognized excellence . This type is very expensive , but is considered a good investment in as much as it can be handed down from generation to generation . Both kinds of silver tarnish easily and require frequent cleaning to keep them beautiful . Wooden household utensils are not very common to-day . I ? xcept for chopping bowls and mixing spoons , utensils made entirely of wood are seldom seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking utensils . All kinds of glasses , dishes , vases , and bowls are used . " These may be purchased in white or in colors and at prices ranging from the very costly to the ten cent variety . Heat-proof glassware is used for baking dishes , teapots , tea sets , and various other articles . This is entirely a modern product . China is commonly used and may be obtained in all grades , from the fragile , translucent ware to the heavy type used in institutions . Some materials which we use were unknown in the Colonial period . Aluminum , enamel , and stainless steel are entirely products of modern civilization . Time- and labor-saving devices which we accept as necessities were unknown to the Colonists . The foot-power and electric sewing machines , carpet sweepers , vacuum cleaners , dustless mops , electric floor-waxing and polishing machines , stationary tubs , washing machines of all kinds , electric irons and ironers , ice boxes , electric and gas refrigerators , and other electric household appliances , such // as the toasters , waffle irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of modern invention and science . Recreation has been and is still being greatly changed by the invention of the automobile , victrola , radio , and television , wonders of which the Colonists never dreamed . The clothing for the modern family is produced outside of the home . There is a great variety of materials on t he market from which to select when garments are con-structed at home . Many people still prefer to make cloth-ing , and the process to-day is much simpler , due to the style of modern garments and improved sewing equip-ment . Ready-to-wear clothing is steadily gaining in popu-larity and is growing as an industry . It is possible to select garments from a wide range of styles , colors , and prices . For this reason it is necessary to educate the public to buy wisely . A satisfied customer will return to buy again . It is therefore good business for the mer-chant to help educate the consumer . The modern homemaker depends largely on the neigh-borhood stores for her food supply . These stores maybe chain stores or stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , and meat and fish . I n addition to these there may be a neighborhood bakery , creamery , delicatessen , and confectionery . Another source of food supply is the vendor who comes to the door to sell his products ? baked goods , vegetables and fruits , and meat and fish . Since the invention of the automobile there has appeared a new type of vendor , the so-called " store on wheels " , a complete store driven from house to house . Another result of the automobile age is the roadside stand . These are booths along the main highways where F , farmers sell their produce directly to the consumer . This // method is steadily gaining in popularity . The farmer is receiving the market price for his produce , and the consumer believes she is buying fresher foods . In the larger cities the municipal and public markets are popular places for buying food . The municipal markets are made up of numerous private concessions or counters in one large building , offering a variety of foods . The municipal market building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually held in a city market square . The farmers drive in and sell their produce directly to the consumer . Modern methods of food preservation in the home are similar to those of the Colonial period . We still preserve foods by drying , salting , and pickling , but to those methods , modern science has added canning and refrigeration . Commercial food preservation is a modern development and , as the quality of the products has improved , canned foods have become popular with the modern housewife . As a result the practice of canning foods in the home is decreasing , especially in the cities . Hospitality is not centered entirely in the home to-day . The radio has helped to make the home more attractive , especially to the younger members of the family . Entertaining friends at dinners , luncheons , buffet suppers , bridge parties , teas , and dances is still popular in the modern home . Because of the limited space in small houses and apartments , and because fewer families employ servants , entertaining outside the home has become popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels are becoming favorite places for entertaining large and small groups of friends . People who have automobiles may entertain their friends by arranging automobile trips and picnics . // Easy facilities have made travel popular for business as well as for recreation and education . To-day we have travel by land , water , and air . Railroads , trolley cars , automobiles , and busses have made travel by land com fortable , safe , and comparatively fast . The boats are a decided improvement over those of the Colonial period , especially for ocean travel . It is now possible to cross the Atlantic in less than five days , a journey which would have required months in the eighteenth century . But the almost inconceivable change which has taken place in your day is the inauguration of air travel by aeroplanes , zeppelins , and dirigibles . You may remember Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh 's epoch-making flight from the United States to France , and all those other courageous men and women who dared to follow his lead .

Education for girls is considered as necessary to-day as education for boys . There is very little formal instruc40 YOUR HOME AND FAMILY tion in the home to-day , but the girl learns from associating with her mother and father and other members of the family group . There is definite instruction in churches , in Sunday schools , church day schools , and young people 's groups . Girls and boys alike are educated principally in schools .

This is an age of specialization , and women and girls are discovering that their chance of success is much greater if they have prepared themselves for a definite type of work . Ellen H. Richards was one of those who started the idea of equal educational opportunities for men and women alike . After graduating from Vassar College , Mrs. Richards , then Ellen Swallow , applied for entrance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . This was the first time that a girl had ever had the courage to enter a man 's college as a student , but she convinced the authorities of her sincerity and was admitted . After her marriage to Professor Robert Richards , Head of the Department of Mining Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1875 , Mrs. Richards continued her interest in the education of girls . In 1897 she participated in the first Lake Placid Conference , which later became the American Home Economics Association . At this time they discussed the place of Home Economics in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to this beginning that you owe much of the subject of homemaking which you are now enjoying . Religion should have a part in the life of every modern family . Religion , like the home , has adapted itself to // the needs of to-day , but this change does not mean that people are any less religious than formerly . For example , the " blue laws " , which forbade any activity on Sunday other than that directly connected with the church , were typical of the Colonial period . To-day , Sunday is a day for church and for wholesome family recreation . Which do you think is better ? Another trend which is highly admirable is the spirit of toleration of all religions which is steadily developing in this " land of the free . " // Pages 43 - 46 missing // Repeated family quarrels can not help but have a dis turbing effect on any child , causing him to be nervous , irritable , and quarrelsome . In direct opposition to this are the parents who cultivate an atmosphere of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents realize how careful they must be never to deviate the slightest degree from the whole truth when talking within the hearing range of children . Parents sometimes send a child to the door to tell the uninvited guest that , " Mother is not at home . " The child does not sense that this is simply a polite way for mother to tell the intruder that she does not care to see him , and he immediately feels that he has a right to make such state ments . This , of course , leads to punishment and unhap piness for the child . You probably feel that your education did not start until you entered school , when really it began way back in those early days when you were just a tiny baby , and you commenced to acquire knowledge which you are using to-day . Your parents taught you early to be con siderate of others , by giving you only your share of atten tion . Gradually , you were taught not to break nor de stroy property which did not belong to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys , and take care of your other personal belongings . Although you did not realize it , they surrounded you with books and pictures , which you thought were for your amusement but , all of the time , they were intended to increase your knowledge . You soon began to like flowers and other things pertain ing to outdoor life . With this interest , you were slowly building your education . Naturally , you had your troubles , and had to be cor rected . Many times , parents fail in the problem of pun ishing their children , and very often it is due to the fact // that they do not agree on how and when a child should be punished . Before parents have that difficult situation to meet , they should decide between themselves that they will never take sides against each other , but shall always agree on the treatment of the child , whether it is in punishing or in granting a permission . Many of you know , when you want to do something very much , that , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request , even though the other parent has emphatically said , " No . " This is poor sportsmanship on your part and very often it leads to trouble between your mother and father . Do you ever do this ? When it comes to the point of actual discipline , there are certain things every parent should remember . The parent should never punish when angry , but should always wait until his temper has cooled . This does not mean that mother should wait for father to do the punishing when he comes home at night . ' lie actual punishment should be just , and be in accordance with the wrong-doing . Parents should consider it a duty to prepare themselves for the training of their children . During the last few years , there has been a decided tendency toward parental education throughout the country . This inclination has manifested itself through study groups , clubs , or organizations , and the aid given by the state and nation to promote this phase of education . Many parents feel it a duty to benefit by these advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , normal individuals . The financial support of the family should be borne mainly by the father . This tradition has been handed down from generation to generation , and many of you take it for granted that father should earn the money for the family . This idea has changed somewhat , and you find that more and more , other members of the family // are sharing this burden . Father should be given special consideration when he comes home tired from a day in the office , field , or factory . This is a job which each of you could assume , in order that father may find relaxation in his home . The mother is responsible for the health of the family . Mother , the homemaker , is usually the way you think of her . By that , you mean that she is the person who carefully plans your diet ; buying the food , preparing and serving it in such a manner that it will help to make you healthy . She watches the family clothing situation , planning and selecting those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house in which you live , and slowly , by artistic arrangement and pleasing decoration , she converts it into a place which you call home . She does not stop at this point , but cares for this home , keeping it neat and clean in a most efficient manner . When you are sick , whom do you think of first ? All of you would no doubt answer , " Mother " , because she is the one who soothes your tired nerves , and quiets your aching head . Mother is usually the one who promotes the atmosphere of love and devotion which you all like so much . The biggest contribution that the younger children can make towards happy family life is to learn to care for themselves . Many times , hours which might be more profitably spent by the members of your family , are used to pick up and replace your younger brother 's and sister 's toys and clothes . Very early in their training , they should be made to understand that they must assume their share of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside for them , and by hanging up their clothes in some low convenient place . Children enjoy dressing themselves , and should be allowed to do this , so that this 5o YOUR HOME AND FAMILY amusement may develop into a worthwhile occupation , not only for themselves , but also for mother . Feeding themselves is another task which they can early be trained to assume . These simple duties give the child a feeling of being a real part of the family . The training that a boy receives in his father 's home will prepare him to assume the responsibilities of his own home in the future . Many boys feel that their home is simply a place in which to eat and sleep . They drop their belongings in their rooms , and expect mother or sister to pick them up , and keep their rooms in order for them , when really they should experience a sense of pride in the care of their own belongings . Clothes should be hung in their proper place . Fishing tackle , tennis rackets , golf clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their special place iii your brother 's room , but he should be the one to take care of them . He should learn the best way to press his trousers , and the right way to sew on a loose button . If he does these things for himself , he will soon have a feeling of independence , which is always desirable in a young boy or girl , when it is directed along the right channels . Besides taking care of his personal belongings , a boy should assume regular tasks about the house ; such as taking care of the furnace or stove , emptying the ashes and rubbish , bringing in the fuel , cutting the lawn , shoveling the snow , and cleaning the car . There is really no reason why your brother can not help you with the dish washing . It is also possible for him to wash windows , and to do bits of painting . Every boy enjoys being an important factor in the life of the family . The training that a girl receives in her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home in the future .

Everything that you hold dear ? happiness , beauty , and success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may say , " , I am healthy " , meaning , " I am never sick . " That is an indication of health , but it is only one indication . Health may be divided into two kinds , mental and physical . Mental health is indicated by a balance and strength of personality , an interest in your environment , and a joy of living . Physical health is indicated by freedom from and resistance to disease , vitality to meet the demands of the day , and the correct weight for height and age . " 1'o-day we believe in keeping healthy and preventing disease , and in administering treatment when necessary . The old idea was to cure disease when it occurred , but now we understand the possibilities of preventing its occurrence . A balance of the right foods in your diet is an important factor in keeping healthy . You have frequently heard the expression , " balanced meals " , but do you know what that means ? The term " balance " , in relation to foods , means including in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct proportion necessary for the growth , development , and energy requirements of the body . It also means a balance of the basic and acid-forming foods in the diet . It is not necessary to have each individual meal balanced . But in order to balance the food elements in the meals for the day , you have to know // the food elements , their function in the body , and in what foods they are found . For the purpose of study , foods may be divided into four classes : fuel foods , body-building foods , bodyregulating foods , and protective foods . The fuel foods include carbohydrates and fats ; the body-building foods are proteins ; the body-regulating foods include the minerals such as iron , calcium , phosphorus , iodine , and copper ; the protective foods include the vitamins . Carbohydrates are divided into two kinds , sugar and starch . They furnish energy to the body . Sugar is more quickly digested than starch . Fats also furnish energy to the body . They require a longer time for digestion than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If more protein is taken into the body than is needed for this main function , it will be utilized to furnish fuel for the body . This is not advisable , since the best source of fuel is obtained from carbohydrates and fats . The minerals have various functions in the body . Iron makes rich , red blood . Copper works with iron in the formation of red blood . Calcium and phosphorus work together to build bones and teeth . Iodine is needed for the proper function of the thyroid gland ; lack of it causes goiter . The protective foods , or vitamins , serve still different purposes in the body . They are each designated by a letter : A , B , C , D , E , F , and G. Vitamin A is essential for growth , vigor , and the maintenance of health . Vitamin B is an important factor in the function of the digestive system , and in preventing extreme nervousness . It prevents a disease known as beri-beri . Vitamin C prevents the disease of scurvy , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOW CAN YOU KEEP HEALTHY ? Vitamin D is necessary for bone development , and for l he prevention of rickets and tooth decay . Vitamins E , F , and G are comparatively recent dis coveries , and their exact functions in the body have not been fully determined . YOUR HOME AND FAMILY In food selection , a general knowledge of the following foods will be of great assistance to you . Milk is called the nearly perfect food . It contains all of the food elements , but is low in iron . It is easily digested and promotes growth by building bones , teeth , and tissues . It is a source of energy , the amount depending on the percentage of cream present . It helps to prevent deficiency diseases , and to keep us young and vigorous . Fruits stimulate the flow of digestive juices , are laxative , and prevent deficiency diseases . They are high in mineral content , and are a source of energy . Cereals are high in fuel value . Whole-grain cereals furnish bulk , and are rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals and vitamins . They furnish bulk , and are sources of energy . Eggs build and repair body tissues , and are rich in minerals and vitamins . 58 // Meats furnish an excellent source of protein , and therefore build and repair body tissues . The meat extractives stimulate body activities . The fat of meat has a high fuel value . Certain portions of the meat animal , such as the liver and pancreas , sometimes called sweetbreads , are excellent sources of minerals and vitamins . Fish is another source of protein , and therefore builds and repairs body tissues . Sea food is rich in iodine . Eating between meals is a bad habit which will undo all the good work of the proper selection and balance of meals . It overtaxes the digestive organs , usually means an exceptionally high carbohydrate intake , causing overweight , and spoils the appetite for regular meals . Dieting has become a fad in your day . The style of modern clothing has made us all want to look like the sylphs of the motion-picture world . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , more people are dieting to lose weight than to gain , but both are equally dangerous . You have heard the expression , " Count your calories . " Do you know what that means ? A calorie is a unit for measuring heat . When food is digested in the body , a certain amount of energy is produced , some foods giving more than others . If more food is eaten than is used by the body , some of the surplus will be stored in the body in the form of fat . People know this , and they get so busy counting their calories that they forget to count the cost of broken health . Strenuous reducing diets lower the resistance to disease , affect the digestive system , and cause a lowering of vitality and too great a loss of weight over a short period of time . They also affect the appearance .

Modern clothing allows freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heavy petticoats , and the long drawers typical of your grandmother 's day . No wonder that was called the " fainting age " for girls . " I'o-day we have clothing which suits its purpose : pajamas and shorts for summer sports ; leggings , breeches , knickers , and divided skirts for winter sports ; and bathing suits that are comfortable for swi i iing . Clothing should act as one of the factors for keeping the body temperature normal . The amount of clothing you wear varies with the temperature . In cold weather clothing should be warm , but not heavy . Woolens are good , because they are light and are poor conductors of heat . Knitted or loosely woven materials are warmer than tightly woven ones , because there are more air spaces . In warm weather clothing is worn to protect the body from the intense rays of the sun . Exposure to the sun for too long a period will cause painful sunburn , which is as dangerous as any other burn .

Mesh weaves are the coolest and have been popular for the last few summers . Dark colors absorb heat , and therefore are not good for general wear in warm climates. // Evaporation is a cooling process . Some hot day sponge our body with water or alcohol and notice how cool you feel while your body is drying . Too rapid evaporation , which lowers the body temperature too quickly , causes colds and lowers the body resistance to all diseases . This is caused by sitting around for any length of time in wet shoes and stockings . Vigorous exercise will keep the body temperature from lowering too quickly , until dry clothing can be obtained . The use of protective clothing such as raincoats , rubbers , galoshes , and umbrellas will prevent the clothing from getting wet . Clean clothing is necessary for health . Underclothing should be aired , changed , and laundered frequently . Outer clothing should be aired and brushed daily .

They should be large enough to be comfortable when standing , to avoid the formation of corns and bunions . Pointed shoes crowd the toes unnaturally . The inside line of the shoe should be straight from the arch to the toe . There are types of heels for all occasions : low heels for sports wear , Cuban heels for walking , and high heels for dancing and formal occasions . High heels for steady wear are not advisable , because they put the foot in an unnatural position . The entire weight is thrown on the ball of the foot , causing the transverse arch to fall , and the cords and muscles in the back of the leg to become shortened . To-day it is possible to buy corrective shoes for the abnormal foot . The science of fitting shoes has been perfected , and the causes of fallen arches studied , until to-day , persons suffering with lateral or transverse fallen arches can buy shoes to relieve either condition . // Stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , they may cause corns , bunions , and ingrown toe nails . If they are too large , the wrinkles may cause painful blisters . Stocking supporters should hang from the shoulders or waist . Round garters worn above or below the knee are unhealthful , because they hinder the circulation . Habits of personal cleanliness are important factors in maintaining health . The face and neck should be thoroughly cleaned every day with pure mild soap and warm water . You should use a good cleansing cream or cleansing liquid after exposure to sun , dust , and wind , being sure to remove it thoroughly with cleansing tissue or swabs of sterile cotton . Of course natural coloring is preferable , but if cosmetics are used , they should be applied artistically , following the color lines of the face .

Warm baths are relaxing to the muscles and soothing for the nerves . Cold baths are stimulating , but there are few people who can stand the shock . A pure mild soap that lathers well is essential for the bath . Water softeners such as borax and scented bath salts may make the bath more attractive . Some parts of the body require special care . Your hands need frequent and thorough washing , because they are used constantly to touch things which may carry infection . They should always be washed before sitting down // for meals , before handling food , and after using a handkerchief or performing any other personal service . Of course you would always wash them when they look dirty . When washing your hands , be sure to use soap , and to dry them thoroughly to prevent chapping .

The use of a deodorant will insure personal daintiness and is harmless unless it is the kind that stops the flow of body excretions . Depilatories should be used when the occasion demands the removal of the hair in the armpits . This care is necessary when sleeveless or short-sleeve clothing is worn . The ears should be thoroughly dried after washing and after swimming . When necessary , remove any accumulation of wax by using a cotton swab very cautiously . The feet require frequent bathing , because they perspire freely and the perspiration does not evaporate quickly . Daily manicuring saves time and keeps the nails in good condition . Nails should be cleaned with an orange stick or nail file . They may be whitened by using under the nails a small amount of salve , powdered cord , or a white pencil prepared for that purpose . The cuticle should be kept pushed back by using an orange stick . Cutting cuticle may cause hangnails . Nails should be filed to the most becoming shape . They may be polished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unnaturally shaped and brightly colored finger nails are evidences of bad taste .

The brush may be cleaned by dipping it in a weak solution of ammonia , rinsing thoroughly in warm water , and drying with the bristles down . Your hair should be combed simply and becomingly to suit your type and personality . The comb should always be clean , and may be washed with the brush in the same manner . Your hair should be shampooed about every two weeks , depending on the condition of your hair and scalp . Soap for shampooing should be in solution . A pure mild soap that lathers well when melted in a small quantity of warm water is just as good as the expensive shampoos on the market . It is important to rinse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to obtain the best result from the shampoo . Soft water is the best for shampooing , because it lathers easily and will not leave a mineral scale on the scalp . Warm water is used for washing and the first two or three rinses , and then a cold rinse is given to close the pores and prevent taking cold . A vinegar rinse for brunettes and a lemon rinse for blondes will remove any trace of soap and make the hair soft and fluffy . In the summer time the hair may be dried in the sunshine , fanned by a warm breeze . When the weather will not permit this ideal method , the hair may be dried by rubbing with heated towels and vigorous brushing . The intense heat and forced air in artificial driers makes the hair dry and brittle . Your hair may need special care . If it is oily , it will need more frequent washing . This condition can sometimes be cured by scalp treatments , but it is usually due to a faulty circulation , and means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved if the scalp is massaged with warm olive oil before the shampoo . Then the hair should be rinsed with cool water to remove // the oil before applying the warm water and soap solution . Brilliantine may be used on the ends of dry hair to keep them from splitting . If the scalp is dry , hot-oil treatments and massage before the shampoo will help . Scalp salve may be rubbed on the scalp after the shampoo . This condition is sometimes caused by a run-down system , and as soon as the person returns to normal health , the condition of the scalp will improve . The teeth should be brushed after each meal , using an up-and-down motion to massage the gums as well as to clean the teeth . Toothbrushes may be purchased in a variety of sizes and shapes with soft , medium , or hard bristles . You will select the kind that best suits your needs . There are also a variety of tooth cleansers in the form of powders , liquids , and pastes . Dentists will advise you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the delicate enamel coating of your teeth . Mouth washes also serve a definite purpose in the care of your teeth and mouth . They help to prevent pyorrhea , a disease of the gums , and relieve halitosis , a condition of unpleasant breath . In addition to this daily care which you give your teeth , you should consult your dentist at least twice a year to have him check and do any necessary repair work , in order to lengthen the life of your teeth . He will apply braces , if necessary , to straighten crooked teeth and improve your appearance . Every girl should take part in at least one form of outdoor exercise . It gives you a good reason for being out in the air and sunshine , develops and hardens your muscles , stimulates body circulation , and adds to your social life .

The care of younger children should develop in the Junior High School Girl a feeling of satisfaction in helping others . Many girls often feel that to take care of a younger brother or sister is a disagreeable task , when really it is an undertaking which should afford great pleasure . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this duty . There is no better way to stimulate an interest in others than to take care of a little boy or girl for an afternoon while his mother is busy . It promotes in you an unselfish attitude , develops your initiative , and teaches you to control your temper . In order that your presence will be a benefit to the child , you must always be kind , courteous , and orderly . These habits can not help but improve your character while they are building that of the young child . Some people think that it is a natural thing for a girl to know how to take care of a young child , but we realize there is a great deal to be learned before you are really capable of assuming such a responsibility . You must , therefore , be content to be mother 's assistant , and learn by watching and helping her carry out the daily routine for the baby . Daily bathing is necessary for the health and comfort of the baby . Regularity is the keynote for the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not say i2 YOUR HOME AND FAMILY too much about it . A definite time for the daily bath is one of the ways by which we can establish a schedule . This bath usually is given before the mid-morning feed ing , but during the warm weather you will find that fre quent bathing is necessary to insure comfort for the baby . You know what a relief it is to you to go swimming on one of those hot summer days . During the first few weeks the baby is given a sponge bath , but he is soon able to take his bath in his own little tub . Before mother starts the bathing process , she must col lect all of the supplies needed and the baby 's clean clothes , and place them in a con venient spot in the room where he is to be bathed . You will find that some mothers keep the articles needed for the bath on a tray . This tray and containers may be bought at the store . The tray is usually made of glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daintily painted glass or celluloid . However , it is possible for you to make a most attrac tive bath tray by using a cake tin , a round cheese-box cover , or a basket for the tray , and mayonnaise jars for the containers . These may be painted to suit your taste , s // and when you are finished , you will be proud of your achievement . Do you know some new baby for whom you could make a bath tray ? The containers are used to hold the toilet necessities . These include an unscented , uncolored , mild soap , and safety pins , which may be placed on a cushion , but are usually stuck in the soap . The absorbent cotton and cotton swabs are placed in jars . There should be a weak boric acid solution for the baby 's eyes in one of the jars , and sterile oil in another jar . Powder may also have its place on the tray . Near the bathing equipment should be placed a soft cloth for washing the baby , a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also handy to have a paper bag near by , into which the mother may drop the soiled bits of cotton . After she has assembled all of these articles , she will turn her attention to the preparation of the room and the water . The room should be one which is free from drafts , and which may be kept at an even temperature of 75 ? F. This is impossible if it is a room through which people must pass , to go from one place to another within the house . The water must be lukewarm for the baby 's bath , which means that the temperature must be 98 ? F. In order to test the water for the correct temperature , you may use a bath thermometer , or try the water with your elbow . When the water feels neither hot nor cold when tested like this , you may decide that it is the correct temperature for the baby . You must be careful about this matter , not only from a health standpoint , but also in order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of too hot or too cold water . The tub may be of various types and still serve the purpose equally well . Probably the most convenient type // is the collapsible canvas tub with the table attachment . This tub is handy for the mother , because it is the correct height for her to work . When the other types of tubs are used , they should be raised to a convenient height for the mother . When everything is in readiness , the baby is brought into the bathing room . Before undressing the baby , although she may loosen the clothing , the mother washes the baby 's face in clear warm water and dries it carefully . She gives special attention to the eyes and nose . She ( lips a bit of clean cotton in the boric acid solution and wipes the baby 's eye , dropping the swab into the paper bag , and taking a fresh one for the other eye . The rolled swab for the nose is dipped into oil and is gently placed in the baby 's nose . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a toothpick , and then the toothpick is removed . The scalp is thoroughly soaped , using a mild soap and soft cloth , and may be rinsed off over the bath tub , and then carefully dried . The baby is then undressed , and the soiled clothing is placed in a special container . The body is rubbed gently with soap solution before placing him in the tub . The mother then takes the baby , supporting his back and head with her left hand , while her right hand holds his ankles , and lowers him gently into the water . Still continuing to support his head and back with her left hand , she rinses his body well by lifting the water over him until the soap has been removed . You must remember that a wiggly baby , whose body has been soaped , is rather slippery to handle , and requires a great deal of skill on the part of the person who is performing the task . The baby is then removed from the tub and placed on a soft bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place on a padded table or other convenient firm surface . You Bias slips for infants are cut without fullness and will stretch lengthwise or crosswise ; straight ones need extra fullness across back and chest . Slips with raglan sleeves are comfortable for cool days ; sleeveless designs for mild weather . Full-length front openings simplify dressing and laundering . Wide laps spread for kicking room . Petticoats are unnecessary with these slips . Neck-lines cut low at front will not pull back and choke . Soft firm nainsook of durable quality , in white or pastel color , is comfortable and attractive , and will stand frequent launderings . French seems is inch wide , and trim such as shell-edge , binding , or narrow hems are soft and comfortable in babies ' clothing .

It contains the constituents in the correct proportion for growth and energy . This milk can be relied upon always to be fresh and sterile . Sometimes , however , it is impossible for the mother to nurse her baby , and she must resort to artificial feeding . The best substitute for mother 's milk is some form of cow 's milk , but care must be taken that the very best cow 's milk is obtained for the baby . Milk is graded into three classes , A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds , pasteurized and raw . Pasteurized milk is milk which has been subjected to a temperature of 146 ? ? 142 ? F. , and held at that temperature for 30 minutes , and then quickly cooled and bottled . This type of milk is free from harmful bacteria . Another type of milk used in sonic states is certified milk , which is milk which has been produced on farms that have been inspected by the . state commission of health and meets its requirements . You must always be sure that the baby 's milk conics from a reliable farm , where the cattle have been carefully inspected for tuberculosis . You should always have the baby 's milk as nearly free from bacteria as possible . Before cow 's milk can be given to the baby , it must be changed so that it is as near like mother 's milk as it possibly can be . This is done by adding a certain amount of water to it to dilute the protein , which makes it necessary to raise the carbohydrate content by adding some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk is fixed in this way , it is known as modified milk . When it becomes necessary to place the baby on a modified-milk diet , the doctor will give the mother a formula for the baby , telling the exact amounts to be used . The formula should meet the individual needs of each child , and so no general rule can be given . THE CARE OF YOUNGER CHILDREN s Some of your brothers and sisters have been given other kinds of milk , such as condensed , but this should be avoided when possible , due to the fact that it is not best for the health of the child , usually making flabby fat . Dried or powdered milk is often very convenient when the baby must be taken on a trip . Great care has to be taken with the cleansing of the bottles and other equipment used in the preparation of the daily food supply for the bottle-fed baby . Everything must be sterilized before it can be used . Why is this necessary ? The equipment used for mixing the modified milk must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be poured into sterile bottles . These bottles should be quickly corked by using sterile rubber or cork stoppers , or pledgets of non-absorbent cotton . The filled bottles may then be stored in a cold place until ready for use . When it is time for the baby to be fed , the bottle may easily be heated by setting it in a kettle of water and warming it . The water should come above the milk line . The milk should be Ioo ? F when given to the baby . This may be tested by allowing a drop of the heated milk to fall on the inside of the wrist . It should feel neither hot nor cold . Immediately after the bottles and nipples have been used , they should be rinsed with cold water , and the bottles filled with water . All of the bottles used for the day 's feeding may then be sterilized at one time . This is done by thoroughly washing the bottles with warm , soapy water , using a bottle brush , and rinsing them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kettle and covered with cold water . The water should then be boiled for five minutes . The nipples should be treated in much the same way , but left in the boiling water for // only three minutes . They should then be lifted from the water with a sterile spoon , and placed in a sterile , covered jar . Special care should be taken when you select the bottles and nipples for the baby . The bottles should be free from corners , thus making them easy to clean . The most important thing to remember about choosing the nipples is to buy the type which is reversible , so that they can be more easily cleaned . The size of the hole in the nipple should be carefully watched , for you know that the milk should drip rapidly but not flow in a steady stream . All of these facts concerning cleanliness may be destroyed if the person who is preparing the food is not scrupulously clean . Special care should be taken by the baby 's attendant to see that she keeps herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviates from this procedure , she will erase all the benefits derived from the sterilization process . Due to the fact that the infant 's stomach is so small at birth , it is necessary to feed the baby small amounts at regular intervals . Sometimes the baby is placed on a fourhour schedule and sometimes on a three-hour schedule , according to the doctor 's orders . After the first few weeks , the second night feeding may be omitted . Very often if the baby is gaining nicely and sleeping well , the doctor will take away the late evening feeding , and the infant may then sleep from six to six . Sterile water should also be given the baby each day . The most important feature of the feeding problem is for the mother to establish a definite , regular schedule for the baby , which she will hold to constantly . In this way , the child will be given a fine chance for health and happiness . Weaning of the baby should be gradual , and should be completed by the end of the ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother will introduce bottle feedings into the diet after a few months . These are increased slowly until finally they constitute the entire milk diet of the child . Weaning has been simplified greatly by the introduction of supplementary foods into the diet . As the baby begins to develop and grow , you can easily see that mother 's or cow 's milk can not sufficiently meet his needs . Because of this , it is necessary to introduce into his diet foods rich in calcium , iron , phosphorus , and vitamins , in order that the development of his bones and muscles may continue unimpaired . These foods must be selected carefully , in order that they will not upset the digestive system of the baby . Orange juice and tomato juice , because of their high Vitamin C content , are introduced early , as they protect the baby from scurvy , and help to build strong teeth . These foods are usually given by the time the child is six or eight weeks old . At first only one-half teaspoon is given diluted with boiled water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one orange or one-fourth cup of tomato juice by the time the baby is weaned . It has been found that mother 's milk as well as cow 's milk is deficient in its Vitamin D content . Because of this , it is necessary to introduce a few drops of cod-liver oil daily with the diet by the end of the first month . This amount may then be increased to one-half teaspoon . Cod-liver oil is also a good source of Vitamin A. The baby continues to need more vitamins , minerals , and carbohydrates , and so it seems wise to give the child vegetables , using spinach , young carrots , peas , and tender string beans . Sometimes , these are introduced into the diet as early as the third or fourth month , but may be delayed until the sixth month . The vegetables should be steamed and put through a sieve before serving . // Fruits may be introduced at the same time . They are good sources of minerals and vitamins , and also contain cellulose and fruit sugars . The fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first as juice and then as strained pulp . Another important factor is that stewed fruits are valuable for their laxative effect . By the time the infant is six months old , the mother may give him thoroughly cooked whole-grain cereals which have been put through a sieve . The cereals should be cooked until they are smooth , soft , and palatable . She will at first serve him only a teaspoonful , but gradually will increase it to two or three tablespoonfuls daily . As the child continues to grow , the doctor may allow other foods to be added to the diet . These may include whole-wheat toast called zwieback , baked custards , steamed calves ' liver , and egg yolk . They should be given in small amounts , and great care should be taken with the preparation . The baby 's food should always be absolutely fresh and clean , thus making it necessary for the mother to buy her food under sanitary conditions , and to store the food at home in a desirable spot for its protection . If you have watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist and shake his head when she has made him eat his orange juice or spinach for the first time . It requires a great deal of patience on the part of the mother , but she must continue daily with this procedure until slowly the infant acquires a liking for the taste . In order that the infant can grow properly , it is necessary for him to have a sufficient amount of rest . If you have been in the same household with a newborn baby , you can not help but notice how much he actually sleeps . During the first few weeks he will sleep the greater part of the twenty-four hours , taking out time only for eating . This // Is one of the reasons that he is able to grow so rapidly . At six months , he is sleeping eighteen hours , and when he is a year old , he will still be sleeping sixteen hours . In order that the baby 's sleep will be most beneficial for him , he should sleep alone . It is also best not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Too much handling will fatigue the baby , and so it is better if he is allowed to amuse himself , and only he touched when it is necessary for his comfort and health . If possible , a separate room should be set aside for the use of the baby . Because the family is always desirous of furnishing every possible comfort , in order that the baby may grow strong and healthy , they should convert a convenient room into a nursery , if possible . Everybody tries to have ideal conditions for the infant , and in this case we would take a room near mother 's room and also near the bathroom . It is preferable to have a southeastern exposure for this room , with plenty of windows , allowing good ventilation and sunshine . You should keep in mind when furnishing the room that it should be bright and cheerful , easily cleaned , and simply decorated . The walls should be finished so that they can be easily cleaned , but this does not mean that they can not be attractive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will perhaps be a good idea if they are of some neutral color . The curtains should be dainty , but simple and washable , and should allow plenty of sunshine to enter the room . The floor should be of hard wood or linoleum , so that it may be kept perfectly clean . The baby 's first bed is often a bassinette or a large clothes basket . These are padded and fixed attractively , hut because the baby grows so quickly , it is soon necessary to buy a bed which is large enough to allow the // infant to move freely . When you are choosing it , you should select one which will prohibit accidents . if there are fastenings , they should be well made and secure . The sides should be high enough to prevent falling , and the side rods or slats close together , so that the baby will not be able to get his head between them . The mattress must be firm and flat , and should be protected by rubber sheeting and a pad . The sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed may be kept immaculate . It is very much better for the baby if the mother does not allow him to use a pillow . THE CARE OF YOUNGER CHILDREN You will find it convenient to have a chest of drawers in the room , which will be used for the baby 's clothing and for the bedding . Mother will find a low chair without arms comfortable when taking care of the baby . A table on which the baby may be cared for will be handy . As you are always desirous of knowing the temperature of the room , you will need a thermometer placed three feet from the floor . How would you arrange and decorate a nursery for a baby ? Regular routine of health habits for the baby is desirable . You will notice that as the regime of the infant becomes perfectly regulated , he begins to develop other good health habits . As early as the third month , mother may begin training the baby to eliminate body excretions at a regular time . If this is continued every day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before a daily habit has been established . This not only will be helpful for the baby , but also for the mother . A regular gain in weight is another assurance for the mother that her baby is well and healthy . The baby should be weighed regularly every week for the first six months , every two weeks for the next six months , and once a month after he is a year old . If the baby fails to gain , it indicates that something is wrong , and the doctor should be consulted . The doctor should be consulted whenever the baby shows any signs that he is not in perfect health . Common ailments such as colic , hiccoughs , regurgitation , constipation , and diarrhea usually result from faulty feeding , and may be easily corrected . The so-called " children 's diseases " should be avoided , as they are serious , and dangerous to the health of the child . Baby 's play should have educational value . Did you ever notice how happy and pleased a baby is the first // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twists , and finally feels of them , and smiles with delight . For minutes at a time he will amuse himself watching his hands . At about this time mother will buy him a celluloid rattle , which he will shake , enjoying the noise as he does it . When he gets a little older , you will teach him to " pat-a-cake " , and as you tell him the rhyme , he will listen to his first story and play his first game . To you this will all be interesting , but to the baby it is more than just play , because it means that with every motion he is developing his muscles . His toes , feet , and legs come in for their share of attention , first simply by watching them as he kicks , then by trying to get them in his mouth , and finally by creeping . If you have taken care of a baby for the afternoon , you will remember that everything went into his mouth . Because all babies like to do this , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , washable , and free from sharp edges . You must also be sure that the paint will not come off in their mouths . Toys which are made of hair or fur are not the best for the baby , because they can not be kept clean , and because he will put them in his mouth . Babies enjoy rattles , rubber toys , and spoons because they can shake them . They also are delighted with sponge and celluloid toys for the bath . I f you notice carefully , you will soon realize that even little babies like bright colors for their toys . Can you suggest some other toys which a baby will enjoy ? It does not take long for the months to roll by , and soon we find that our tiny infant has grown into a pre-school child . With this rapid development comes the need for the knowledge which will help us to train this child for the future . THE CARE Oh YOUNGER CHILDREN Clothing for the pre-school child should not only pro tect him physically , but should also meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often mothers dress their children with little thought as to the comforts and pleasures of the child . At a very early age , children learn to like or dislike certain garments . These prefer ences are usually based on whether that specific article of clothing fits his present needs . Weather plays an impor tant part in the thoughtful decision as to what the child shall wear that clay . The amount of clothing that the child wears should depend on the child 's reaction rather than on the adult 's idea con cerning the subject . If a child is dressed too warmly , he will perspire freely , and will then be more liable to take cold . However , if he is dressed with too little clothing , he will look blue and pinched . The mother should watch for these signs , and then increase or decrease the amount of clothing that the child has on , to fit the particular case . The temperature of the day is not the only factor with regard to weather which should be considered . If it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he will be protected from the moisture . This may be accomplished by having him wear rubbers or galoshes , and // by dressing him in a play suit which completely covers him . The material of which this garment is made should be one which does not absorb moisture readily . To-day there are many at-tractive winter play suits on the market , which make it possible for a child to play out of doors with-out any danger of catching cold . When mother is selecting garments for the child , she should remember that they will have to be made of dur able materials , be-cause they will have to be laun dered frequently . It is also necessary that they should be simply made , in order that the task of washing and ironing will be easy . In summer , cool cottons and linens are most desirable , and in winter light-weight , soft woolens will be best for some of the garments . Children , as you know , grow so rapidly that constant attention must be given to the size of their clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . You should be careful that the little drawers or trousers are long enough in the crotch , so that they will not draw and be irritating . Their shoes should conform to the natural lines of the foot , allowing it to become correctly formed . Their stockings should fit the foot , but should permit plenty of toe action . Care should be taken when their garters are chosen . f round ones are to be used , they should be loose , and if long ones are to be used , they should be fastened to a waist which fits well up around the neck . In this way , poor posture is avoided . During the last few years , there has been a decided // change in the construction of children 's garments . To-day we make them simply , but attractively , thus avoid-ing conspicuous clothing which children soon learn to dis-like . Children may be taught at an early age to express their desires with regard to the dress or suit they wish to wear . If you observe children when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one which is brightly colored . Because of this fascination for bright colors which the child seems to have , mothers should encourage this delight , as it has its educational value . Another benefit derived from the use of proper cloth ing is the ability which the child soon acquires for help ing himself . If the garments open in the front and are fastened with fairly large buttonholes and buttons , it is possible for him to dress himSelf . As the child develops this ability , you will notice that he is delighted with him-self and feels independent . There is a very attractive brother and sister suit which is a good example of this type . The jacket opens completely down the front , revealing a clever sun suit underneath . As the sun bath has become such a factor in the daily routine of the child , it is neces sary to include sun suits in his wardrobe . Some of the most attractive ones are made with net tops . Many times mothers , in their desire to buy clothing // which the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the activities of the child are hindered . This should be watched carefully , because a saving which impairs the develop ment of the child is not a wise thing . The pre-school child should have good food , care-fully selected , at tractively prepared and served , and in small amounts at regular times . Did you ever real ize that small children are influ enced greatly by the appearance of the food which is served them ? Few mothers real ize this fact , and SO they wonder why they are confronted with behavior problems at mealtimes . Children do not like to see the same thing over and over on their plates . If mother must serve the same food often , she should plan to fix it in a variety of ways . However , if mother holds to the daily food rules , she will find that there are plenty of ways of changing her menus . You should always include each day in a child 's diet the follow ing things : one quart of milk , which may be served as a // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one egg ; wholegrain cereals ; two fruits , one fresh and the other stewed ; and three vegetables , one of which should be a green leafy one . Mother may also obtain variety in the child 's diet by serving foods of different textures . There should be crisp foods such as lettuce , celery , and cabbage ; spongy foods such as bread ; soft foods such as custards ; hard foods such as crackers and toast ; and liquid foods such as soups . You can plainly see that when a variety of these are served , the child will not become tired from too much chewing , nor disgusted by having just to swallow . Tough foods , however , should always be avoided . The menu which mother plans for the child should be prepared with as much care as she has used in planning it . The food should always be well cooked , but not over done . It is better for the child if mother puts little or no seasoning in the food . In this way the child develops a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to do , because he has never had the chance to acquire any likes or dislikes along this line . The child should never be served fried foods , rich pastries , cakes , candies , coffee , or tea . Appropriate table accessories are always helpful in making the meal attractive . Children enjoy gay china and napkins , and if they may sit at their own small table , it is remarkable how much they will eat . The plates should be fixed attractively . As the child likes bright colors , mother should fix the plates with this in mind . Many times you have seen children being served mixtures which you could not possibly have eaten yourself . In order to eliminate this idea of mixing the foods all together , it is far better to serve small amounts in a neat arrangement on the plate . If small servings are given // the child , he will soon form the habit of finishing all that has been placed before him . If he wishes more , he may then have a second helping . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be continued . Meals should be served at definite times each day . Children should never be allowed to eat between meals , as it will spoil their appetite . However , a mid-morning and mid-afternoon lunch should be served at a regular time each day . This may consist of fruit juice , fruit , or milk and a cracker . Mother will also simplify matters if , when she is preparing the foods , she considers how well the child will be able to eat it . For instance , it is very hard for a child to place peas in his mouth when using a fork . However , if mother serves mashed potatoes with them , the problem will be solved . Carrots are manipulated better if they are sliced rather than diced . I f a lettuce leaf is cut up finely and placed between two slices of bread , making a sandwich , the child will be able to eat it more satisfactorily . Meat should always be ground or cut in small pieces before serving . If these simple suggestions are followed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal , healthy appetite . Can you think of some foods which should be served in a certain way in order to make them easier for the child to manipulate ? If the parents understand the problems that the child faces at mealtime and manage the situation intelligently , the child will develop good food habits . Parents should remember that every day new problems are confronting the child , and therefore it is necessary for them to help as much as possible . The meal hour should definitely aid the child in his social adjustment . Here he receives his first lesson in table manners . He learns to feed himself , using the small knives and forks . In order to help // the child to avoid spilling his food , it is better if at first he has a plate with edges which curve upward . He must learn to use his napkin . Soon he learns that it is best to chew his food with his lips closed . He also must learn to chew his food well before swallowing it . You can readily see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is especially true if the parents quarrel at mealtime . These emotional scenes have a strong effect on the child . Very often food dislikes may be traced to a dislike of that food by one of his parents . Parents must be careful to set a good example for the child always . The child should learn at once that he must eat the food put before him . If he finishes his first course , he may then have his dessert . If this rule is strictly upheld , the parents will soon have no trouble in enforcing it . Sleep is an important factor in the growth and development of the pre-school child . Have you not often wondered what made some children so very irritable and cross ? Many times it is simply lack of sleep . Children are so active throughout the day , that they must have periods of relaxation in which they may rest . It is during these quiet moments that they grow and develop normally . Parents , who have the health of their child foremost in their minds , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular time every night , and that besides this , he should take his daily nap . No amount of teasing on the part of the child should influence the parents to allow the child to remain up . This fact should also be remembered when the family are having callers . It is not the wise thing for the parents to permit their children to stay up , in order that they may entertain the company . If the child is allowed to remain up one evening , he will not understand why he roo YOUR HOME AND FAMILY can not repeat the affair the next evening . Immediately trouble begins , and the child has to learn all over again that he must go to bed at a regular time . Children should be put to bed by seven o'clock . A good night 's sleep is not enough to insure health . The child should take a nap each afternoon . It is also desirable to encourage the child to relax at intervals throughout the day . This is especially necessary if the child is of a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains quiet for a short time before eating , he will in all probability eat better and his food will be well digested . Some children have to be taught to relax , and this may be accomplished by having the child lie down and listen to a story or soft music . Children between the ages of two and five should sleep at least sixteen hours a day . The foundation for future health habits may be formed at this age . You can all recall how mother used to make you wash your hands and face , comb your hair , and clean your teeth . Did you all like to do it or did you rebel ? - Probably most of you were decidedly against such duties , and yet all of you used to think it was great sport to play in water . If you would keep this in mind , and allow the child to stand on a stool or little steps so he can reach the water , and let him have his own wash cloth , towel , toothbrush , and comb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , you will soon find that the daily cleanliness problem becomes a pleasure rather than a terrible task . These simple things started early in childhood make the health problems throughout his life simple . Mothers should continue to insist that the child have regular times for body excretions . If this is carefully held to , constipation and resulting poor health will be avoided . THE CARE OF YOUNGER CHILDREN ror It is ideal for a pre-school child to have separate rooms for sleep and play . When you plan a room for the baby to sleep in , you should have definitely in mind that the room must meet the needs of the pre-school child later on . The sleeping quarters for the child will be the same as for the baby with only a few changes . The bedroom should be a place for rest , and so , under ideal conditions , the child will have a separate room for play . The room itself will resemble the nursery , having neutral-colored walls which may be easily cleaned . The floors will no doubt be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there . The furniture should be divided into two classes : one for the adult , and the other for the child . The furniture for the adult will probably consist of a comfortable chair , a small table , and a reading lamp . These will be placed in the background , in some convenient corner where the child may be observed , but where the adult will not play any part in the actual activities of the child . The furniture for the child should be the correct size for him , thus encouraging good posture . It should be made of durable material , and constructed so as to withstand the hard usage which it will get . It is best if the finish can be washed . Low cupboards and shelves should be built and placed along part of the wall space . These may be painted a gay color , and may have attractive chintz curtains . On these shelves , the child will keep his toys and books . The child will have an incentive to keep his room in order . Small chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they furnish the means for a variety of activities . How would you rearrange the nursery which you planned for the baby to meet the needs of the preschool child ? // As you know , children like bright colors . A good way to introduce color into the room is by decorating the walls with pictures and friezes . The pictures should be simple but brightly colored . Children enjoy them best if they have definite outlines which make them easy to recognize . Pictures have a definite educational value for the child , and , because the child likes to sit and look at them , they should be framed appropriately and hung low . Play of the child of the pre-school age should have educational , social , and recreational value . Early in the child 's development , you will find that the child enjoys playing " pat-a-cake . " This is really the beginning of games , and continues through all the phases of finger plays . This type of game is not only amusing to the child , but also a factor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , the finger game called " Thumbkins " requires the child to manipu-late his fingers in an intricate way , changing them with rapidity . The child sings the words accompanying the game , and in this way his musical training is started . The younger children enjoy dramatizing the nursery rhymes which they have learned . " Jack and Jill " and " Humpty-Dumpty " are good examples of story games . Children experience keen delight by keeping time to music . These rhythms teach them , not only to keep the proper tempo , but also to interpret the music . It is in-teresting to note how quickly some children realize the difference between quick , joyous music , and slow , soft lullabies . The older children continue these same types of games , but in a more complicated manner . In place of the nurs-ery rhyme games , we find them using complete stories for their portrayal . " Fair Rosy " , which is a favorite , is really the story of " Sleeping Beauty . " These children // enjoy choosing partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go In and Out the Window . " They also enjoy games such as " Aiken-Drum " , in which each one must choose the material of which his coat or hat is made . You will notice that all of these games contain a great deal of repetition . Children of this age seem to require this essential in their games and stories . Have you ever noticed how intently a child listens to a story appropriate for his age ? The younger children enjoy the nursery rhymes , and the simple stories accompanying the finger plays . Gradually , however , they develop an interest in stories based on their actual everyday life in which they are the main characters . Donny will sit absorbed while his mother tells him how he went downtown , and entered a big store . How the elevator went up and up and finally stopped . The elevator man opened the door , and Donny and his mother went to the coat department . Here he turned the racks around and around , and finally he found just the coat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one arm and then the other . She buttoned the coat up , and he stood in front of the mirror , and mother decided that he looked so nice that she would buy it . As the child continues to grow , his interest changes , and he likes stories with repetition such as " Little Black Sambo " and " The Three Bears . " He also enjoys telling stories himself , concerning things he has done , such as a trip to the zoo . Very often you are called upon to tell stories to children . When this happens , be sure that you choose a story which is suitable for the child , and then tell it in such a way that it will be interesting . Show the child clever pictures illustrating the story . Change your voice to emphasize the action of the book . A good example of this is in ro6 YOUR HOME AND FAMILY telling the story of " The Three Bears " , in which the different bears speak . You remember that Father Bear speaks with a " deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice " , and Baby Bear with a " wee-tiny voice . " Also be careful that you do not tell the tale with such fervor that the child becomes frightened . Is there a child living in your home or neighborhood to whom you might tell stories ? At first children play by themselves . Then , gradually there develops a type of play in which two children are working together , but they are each building a house or garage separately . Finally , we find them joining each other in order that they may more completely play house , fireman , policeman , or iceman . This type of play is purely imaginative , but it definitely imitates some household or community activity . You will find that children practice this imaginative play by thinking of their dolls as babies or their toy dogs as real ones . As long as they realize the difference between the real and the unreal , the imagination of the child should be allowed to expand . It is impossible for children to play for any length of time under proper conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given blocks , they build houses and garages . Using pieces of wood and nails and hammers , the boys will construct crude aeroplanes . Baskets , animals , and vegetables will be formed from clay . In the sand-box , hills and valleys , or pies and cakes soon take form . Attractive pictures will be painted or drawn if the child is given a chance . Many children distinctly have the ability to combine colors in lovely effects . At first , the child paints something and then names it , and later he decides what he is going to make and then does it . These Io8 YOUR HOME AND FAMILY drawings are usually crude and can not easily be distin guished . However , you should always encourage the child in whatever constructive play he may undertake . Play should also take on a physical aspect . Children enjoy climbing , riding , swinging , running , and jumping . Too often mothers inhibit the child 's development by not allowing him to do these very things . A child is the best judge of just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will not climb any farther than he is really able . If mothers would only understand this , there would be fewer falls , which are mainly caused by the child be-coming frightened when the mother screams , " Be careful ! " Children of this age should not be supplied with elaborate manufactured toys which appeal to the adult , but should be given raw material from which they can make things which appeal to them . Too often children are presented with expensive mechanical toys . If you have watched a child with this type of toy , you know that at first he is interested . He winds it and watches it run , but after a little while he loses interest and either discards it or takes it apart . Parents can not seem to understand that a small child will spend hours amusing himself with household utensils such as clothespins and tin pans . // Blocks , bits of wood , paints , and clay afford him new adventures and tasks every time he plays with them . A doll which a little girl may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous doll which she is afraid to touch . Toys which develop motor control are valuable to children of this age . Boys and girls alike should have toys which strengthen the muscles . Kiddy cars , scooters , and tricycles are especially suited for this purpose . In the yard where the child carries on outdoor activities , it is well to have some equipment suitable for jumping . Slides and jungle gyms provide this amusement . If , however , it is impossible to buy these , you may produce good substitutes from large packing boxes of various sizes , and planks which have been smoothed down so ' To YOUR HOME AND FAMILY that the child will not be liable to get injured by splinters or nails . A swing is another piece of apparatus which can be inexpensively procured . Often parents find it impossible to buy toys for their children , and frequently they do not realize that there are many toys which could be made at home . You will find a great deal of enjoyment from constructing simple toys . Clothespins may be dyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of which you can paint . The child who gets this gift will spend hours fitting the pins around the edge of the can , but finally he will build log cabins from them . Then there are peg boards with spools , colored-throat sticks for sorting , wooden animals , nests of jello-dishes gayly painted , spools strung on shoe strings , and picture books . All of these toys are inexpensive , and yet they meet the educational needs of the child . He learns to count and to know his colors . He develops the muscles in his hands , and is able to create many new and interesting things . Why not try to make some toys for a small friend ? Parents should know how to handle situations which require discipline . Very often situations arise in the home which will later , no doubt , lead to unfavorable conditions . Parents sometimes think it necessary , from their point of view , to tell " white lies . " These are interpreted by the child as being the proper line of action , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do not realize that they are doing anything wrong . When a situation arises in which the child does not realize that he is doing wrong , parents should take into consideration his viewpoint . It is always wisest never to make promises to a child which you can not keep . This not only pertains to the promise to give the child something , but also to the fact THE CARE OF YOUNGER CHILDREN r that if you promise a child that you will punish him if he does a certain thing , you must most assuredly follow out that course of action . As you know , it is always best to avoid behavior problems , as far as possible , by creating situations for the child which will not allow any trouble to brew . One of the best ways to do this is always to keep the child busy at some constructive play . If parents would only give their attention to matters which interest their children , there would be built up a strong understanding between them . However , there are always times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resort to some form of punishment . If this is the case , and you remember these simple rules for discipline , the punishment will not be harmful : I. A child should be punished at the time of the offense. 2 . The punishment should be suited to the misdemeanor. 3 . Parents should try to control themselves when punishing the child . 4 . Spanking as a form of punishment should be resorted to only as a final measure . 5 . Threatening should never be used as a form of punishing . 6 . Parents should agree on the punishing , and the form of punishment . 7 . The child should understand the reason for the punishment . 8 . The punishment should be constructive . Sometimes even though great care is taken , behavior problems will develop . However , if these are wisely managed , they can be solved to the advantage of everybody concerned . // Feeding problems are very prevalent , and no doubt you can remember some . Do you recall how they were solved ? Do you think they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out nicely . Young Walter did not like to eat very well . He did not enjoy his spinach or carrots , and it was very hard to get him to drink milk . His mother was upset about the matter , and tried to fix the foods in different ways , but that did not seem to help . It happened that Walter was very fond of golf , and he spent much time teeing up his ball and making long drives . His mother sensed that here was her chance , so she asked the " golf pro " to tell Walter that if he really wished to grow up to be a strong man and play a good game of golf , he would just simply have to eat everything that was set before him . The next time that Walter asked the " golf pro " about holding his club , he found the opportunity also to tell him that it was just as important to eat the proper food as it was to hold his golf club the correct way . Walter hurried home and insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother did not have any more feeding problems . Another common behavior problem is that of fear . The baby is naturally afraid of falling , and of a loud noise , but these gradually disappear as he grows older . Children , however , are not afraid of the dark at birth , but for some reason may acquire this fear . For instance , it may happen that the child is suddenly awakened by the sound of the fire engine passing by in the middle of night . He is startled , as he does not know what it is . Because he is alone in the dark , he attributes it to the darkness . It will be necessary to explain that the night must follow the day , because birds and flowers and people must go to sleep so they can grow . If you give the child a flash light to put under his pillow , he will feel more secure . If // he wakes up in the night , he can turn on the flash light and see that everything is safe and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacefully . Mothers often have trouble with children because they seem to enjoy destroying the property of other people . This no doubt is the result of not allowing the child to have the correct things with which to play . If the child enjoys writing on the wall paper , you will find that he will also like to write on his own paper , if he is given some . These are only a few of the many problems which confront the family . You will be interested in discussing and solving other problems which are always coming to the attention of those caring for younger children .

UNIT SIX I10W CAN THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRL HELP TO CARE FOR HER HOUSE ? House care , to you , probably means washing dishes , dusting , or some other activity which mother always asks you to do , just as you are getting ready to do something more absorbing . This is the case in many homes , and of course should be avoided . Mother has a perfect right to require you to clean parts of the house , but , if she is wise , she will turn over some specific task for you to do . In this way , you will take a certain amount of pride in seeing how well you can do it . Your bedroom should be of great interest to you , and you should enjoy taking special care of it . Do you take care of your room ? A girl 's bedroom should be her own , to decorate , to arrange , and to keep clean and orderly . If you are given your choice of bedrooms , you can choose one with a southeastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and cheerful . Your room should be arranged in certain furniture groups , which tend to make the room more convenient , and pleasing to look at . You will , of course , have a sleeping unit , which will consist of a bed and , perhaps , a small hcdside table with a lamp on it . You will need a dressing unit , which will have a dressing table or dresser , and a chest of drawers . A little draped dressing table , gay with chintz , would be lovely . Naturally , you will need a studying center , made up of a desk and bookshelf . You will enjoy a comfortable chair for moments of relaxation u8 YOUR HOME AND FAMILY and rest . You will often be reading , so you will include in this group a reading lamp . If you will consider your room carefully this afternoon when you go home , you will undoubtedly see innumerable chances for redecoration . Perhaps your mother will consent to this project , in which case you will immediately begin to have many hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibly your family will allow you to select new furniture and furnishings for your room . If this is the case , you will then have the definite problem of deciding what type of a room you wish to have . Your taste may run to a colonial room , which might be a reproduction of your grandmother 's room when she was a girl , with its fourposter bed and hooked rugs . If you decide to redecorate your room in a colonial manner , be sure to read unit one again , which deals with furniture in the colonial days . No matter what style of furniture and furnishings you use , you will want to be sure that they will go well together . You can plainly see that a modernistic chair in your colonial room would spoil the effect . A color scheme should be carefully worked out , keeping in mind that if your room is bright and sunny , you will use cool colors ; while if your room is a cold , dreary one , you will want warm , cheerful colors . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not give up the idea of remodeling . When you definitely decide on just what changes you want to make , you can then begin to think of ways of doing it . Your old furniture may be taken care of in two ways , by painting or by refinishing . To paint furniture , you must first remove all of the paint or varnish . This may be accomplished by using varnish remover and a coarse or fine sandpaper . After Ito YOUR HOME AND FAMILY the surface is clean and free from its former finish , apply one coat of flat paint , being sure that it leaves a smooth surface . When it has thoroughly dried , sandpaper it with a fine sandpaper . You are now ready to give it the first coat of enamel or lacquer . If lacquer is used , it may be put on either by brushing or spraying . The surface should then be sandpapered again before the final coat is applied . After that your furniture should look like new . It may be possible that you can find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bring out the beauty of the natural wood . The treatment , in this case , will be very different from the painting . You will rub down the old varnish with pumice and crude oil , until you are satisfied with the finish . Cover this with a thin coat of liquid wax , and polish with a soft cloth . This will restore many an old piece to its former beauty . Sometimes you will need to redecorate your walls and woodwork . If this is necessary , the old finish of the woodwork may be removed by using a strong solution of washing soda , and smoothed with fine sandpaper . It may then be varnished or painted as desired . The walls may be made fresh and clean by repapering or painting . If you are painting the walls , you may have them plain or stippled . Your curtains may be very faded , but they can be nicely renovated by tinting or dyeing . When you do this , be sure to buy dye especially prepared for the fabric to be dyed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to spend a small amount of money for a few accessories which will add to the splendor of your room . You might purchase a few pictures , a lamp , a new bedspread , scatter rugs , or some toilet articles . If these are wisely chosen , they can not help but lend an atmosphere of beauty and comfort to // your room . With your room prettily decorated , you will , of course , want to keep it in perfect condition . If you are careful every day to put away your things in their proper places , your room will be much neater . This will necessitate hanging up your clothes , never allowing them to remain on chairs nor on the floor ; keeping your drawers in good order , so that you will be able to find things immediately without upsetting everything ; and keeping all of your toilet articles and accessories in their proper places . If you do this regularly , you will soon have formed the habit of orderliness . You will want to keep your room free from dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duster for the furniture and the accessories . A good duster is made of cheesecloth . This material seems to collect the dust and hold it , without leaving any lint . You may decide to have one of your own . If you do , why do you not make it of colored cheesecloth , and finish the hem with a running stitch of floss ? You could even carry out your color scheme . It should be washed after it is used . Before you have your breakfast , fix your bed so that it may air thoroughly . This may be done by pulling down the covers and sheets , so that the fresh air from the open window will circulate through the bedding , and purify it . After breakfast , you will have time to make your bed , which you will want to do systematically . The springs of the bed should be covered with a mattress , and over this should be placed the bottom sheet . Sheets are purchased according to the size of the bed , but you should always purchase them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in under the mattress . A good size sheet to fit the single bed is 63 " X 99 " or 63 " X Io8 " ; the three-quarter-size bed 72 " X 99 " or 72 " X Io8 " ; and the full-size bed 81 " X 99 " or 81 " X Io8 " . // The bottom sheet is placed on the bed so that the right side is up , and the center of the sheet corresponds to the middle of the bed , in order that the same amount will be left on each side . The sheet should then be tucked in at the head and the foot of the bed , the corners mitered , and the sides tucked under , pulling them tight . This will leave a smooth surface . The top sheet is then placed on the bed so that the centers match , and the wrong side will be up this time . The sheet is tucked in well at the foot , still leaving enough to turn back over the blankets at the top . The corners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but warm blankets , which you will place on top of the sheets and tuck under at the foot . The top sheet should then be pulled back over the blanket to protect it . Your pillow will be made of ticking which is filled with feathers , down , kapok , or hair , and over this you will place a pillow case , fitting it carefully over the pillow at the corners . Each morning , after they have beenthoroughly aired , you will shake them up and replace them on the bed . You are a wise girl , if you use these pillows only for their appearance rather than for sleeping . There are so many different types of spreads that you will have to judge for yourself the best way to place it on your bed . If you are careful to make your bed in this manner , it will add greatly to your comfort . You may think that you can not possibly perform all of these tasks before you go to school , but do , at least , try it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have to clean your room more thoroughly , and probably you will decide that Saturday morning is an excellent time for this task . Before beginTHE CARE OF THE HOUSE 12 ? ; ping to clean , open the windows . If you will gather together all of your cleaning equipment before starting to work , you will be surprised how much quicker and easier you can accomplish your undertaking . Remove all of your accessories to a convenient place while cleaning . If you have small scatter rugs , you should also remove them . They may be vacuumed or swept before being returned to your clean room . If you will remember that all cleaning in a room should begin at the ceiling and proceed to the floor , it will simplify your problem greatly . You then begin by dusting the pictures , window sills , and furniture , using your cheesecloth duster . If your floors are of hardwood , you will simply wring out a soft , clean cloth in lukewarm water , and proceed to clean them . However , if the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap , being sure to rinse it thoroughly . Your furniture will need polishing , so put just a few drops of polish on a soft cloth and rub it over the surface . Your bed should now be made , after which you can return the accessories and clean rugs to their proper places . You can close the windows , replace all cleaning equipment , and your room will look immaculate . A few times each year it will be necessary to give your room a thorough cleaning . Each part of the room will be given special attention . The curtains will be taken down and washed . Before laundering , soak them in cold water to loosen the dirt . The washing process will follow , using warm water and mild soap chips or beads . You should be very careful not to tear them by vigorous rubbing . You will then rinse them thoroughly in warm water , and if they are white , it will be necessary to put them through a weak // blueing solution instead of the last rinsing water . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may decide to dry the curtains on frames or substitutes for them . Some curtains can be successfully hung up to dry , but they will then have to be dampened , and ironed , by folding in half lengthwise and pressing the edges first . You should then put them on the curtain rods immediately .
