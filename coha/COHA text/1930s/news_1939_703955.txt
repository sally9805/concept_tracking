txt The three men charged with conspiring to forge passports were convicted yesterday afternoon , but their trial left an incomplete mystery story . Remaining for a final chapter were spectral characters who risked their necks intriguing in Europe , evidently in the service of Soviet Russia . The evidence written by seventyfive witnesses failed to establish even the true name of Adolph Arnold Rubens , alias Donald Louis Robinson , who was imprisoned with his wife as a spy inl*Moscow . And several other men who traveled like him on fake American passports emerged as nothing more than fictional names on false documents during the three-week trial . Nevertheless , considering the narrower story of fraud , the jury of eight housewives and four men found enough evidence to bring in a quick verdict of guilty against Edward Blatt , a lawyer of 31 Union Square West ; Ossip Garber , a commercial photographer , and Aaron Sharfin , former clerk in the Egyptian Consulate. 200 Documents Are Scanned Out only two and three-quarter hours  --  from 11:30 A. M. until 3:15 P. M.  --  the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one and three-quarter hours for deliberation . In that time they looked over more than 200 documents , including many handwriting exhibits . Noting that the " defendants apparently have foreign conections and that the circumstances are rather unusual , " Federal Judge Henry W. Goddard raised the deferidants ' bail from $1,000 to $5,000 each pending imposition of sentence next Tuesday . This was a compromise on the $10,000 bail demanded by Lester C. Dunigan , chief of the criminal division in United States Attorney John T. Cahill 's office . Each defendant faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $10,000 fine . Immediately aftertJudge Goddard completed his charge the jury foreman , Mrs. Helen S. Winters , a serious-faced matron of 145 West Seventy-ninth Street , requested the exhibits and led her fellow-jurors into a chamber . They had only to consider whether the government had established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , for none of the defendants took the witness stand to explain , defend himself or expose himself to cross-examination . Although Federal agents have said that the traveling members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely touched on at the trial . The only reference was by a witness who said Garber bad . asked him to receive three letters from Russia at his home so that nobody would suspect Garber was " communistic . " The story may be unfolded through a sealed indictment in the case , which officials refuse to discuss . An authentic report of motives and actors in the case was expected from Loy W. Henderson , former charg ? d'affaires in Moscow , when he took the witness stand last week , but he was stopped by strong objections from defense counsel . At the trial the government was able to prove that Blatt obtained a court order indicating Rubens got his name by adopting it instead of the name Arnold Rudewitz . Then the true Rudewitz came from Chicago and told the jury he had never changed his name . Rubens had stolen it from the naturalization papers of his father , Christian Rudewitz , which he got in an unknown manner . Rubens sent the citizenship papers to the State Department to support his passport application . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her two sisters , knew what the true identity of Rubens was . And because this could not be established nor his United States citizenship , Mr. Henderson was never able to demand the diplomatic privilege of interviewing Rubens . Blatt was pictured as the master of the passport group here by Mr. Dunigan and his trial assistant , Robert L. Werner . The salient points they offered against him were that he got name-changing orders in Supreme Court for Rubens and another man , that he asked friends and relatives to receive passports , based on false applications and affidavits , as they arrived from Washington ; and that he drew up a " phony " contract which made Rubens appear to be an editor of a magazine . This was to be used for references in European travels . Sharfin was described as the man who was able , through a friend , to pass false passport applications through the office of former County Clerk Albert Marinelli , where they did not get the scrutiny ordinarily given to them at the Sub-Treasury Federal passport office . Garber was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forging the photographs that went on them .
