Confronted by a dearth of new pictures ( TIME , May 16 ) , cinema producers last month took to reviving old ones . By this week , 52 old pictures , from Birth of a Nation ( 1915 ) to Stowaway ( 1936 ) , had been exhumed from storerooms , placed on view in cinemansions throughout the U. S. Result of the process was a pair of discoveries which , to an industry proverbially hypnotized by precedent , seemed utterly astounding . One was that any good old picture will often outdraw any poor new one . The other was that at least one old picture was the best cinema bargain of 1938 . <P> Rodolfo Guglielmi , born May 6 , 1895 , in the little Italian village of Castellaneta , died August 23 , 1926 , in New York , as Rudolph Valentino .

Cohan Theatre . In five other Eastern cities it packed theatres . But the greatest triumph of The Son of the Sheik was at Chicago 's Garrick Theatre , where it did more business than any other show in town except Holiday , accompanied by Tommy Dorsey 's swing band . Garrick audiences were apparently about evenly divided between middle-aged women and young girls who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady patron to the theatre 's manager : " I loved him , I loved him , I loved him-I still love him .
