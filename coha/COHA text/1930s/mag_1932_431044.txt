 | Quaint Folk , the Eskimos Condensed from The Atlantic Monthly ( July , ' 32 ) George Miksch Sutton ASK an average white man to tell you what he knows about the world of the Eskimo and he may give you a somewhat disjointed discourse upon long dark winters , icebergs , igloos , Husky dogs , filthy clothing , blubber , and the trading of wives . Ask an average Southampton Island Eskimo to give you his concept of the white man 's world and you may , in due course , be regaled with a series of practically unpronounceable words describing very big boats , radios , gramophones , mouth organs , accordions , soap , warm water , razors , airplanes , odd footgear , robed priests , binoculars , and magazines ; and sooner or later you will be told that white men spend nearly all their time looking for skins of the white fox . The Eskimo appears to concede that the white man possesses and controls many wonderful tools , toys , and machines . He seems to feel that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over huge ships , or so to control the spirits as to bid them carry messages through the air , as it is for the snow to cover Southampton in winter . Accepting the phenomenon , he does not disturb himself further . In fact , the average Eskimo knows and cares so little about the world outside his own that , consistently enough , he thinks it impossible that we of the South should be interested in , or know anything about , the circumpolar region . One man was amazed at the bird specimens I had prepared ; it was not fitting that I should skin a bird as well as or better than he , since these birds were of his world , not mine . He wondered whether I had ever seen or heard of an ookpikjuak , a snowy owl . Another man was surprised that I could handle a rowboat without special instruction : it was his world 's water , at present his world 's boat . Maps , magazines , and books have given the Eskimo some idea of the world and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the white man 's civilization which every Eskimo appears to have is that the white man needs fox skins . So long has he trapped all winter , brought his pelts in for trade , and been exhorted to hurry back for more , that he has come to  | think of the arctic fox as a sort of hub about which the Wheel of Civilization moves . It is considered quite normal , therefore , for any white man to go to any extreme in his quest for the fox skin . But when a naturalist comes to Southampton on the annual supply boat , announcing , as I did , that he is interested in lemmings , mushrooms , sculpins , the Eskimo gulps , remembers that the white man 's behavior is unaccountable after all , then bends to the task of bringing in everything from half rotten birds to a fair-sized willow tree . The preparation of naturalhistory specimens assumes theatrical proportions while a silent man may stand near by absorbed in every detail of the process . When I measure a lemming 's tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may whisper a rapt " Lhah , kudlunga ! " - which is , so far as I can ascertain , almost precisely the equivalent of Virgil 's " Mirabile dictu ! " My careful examination of stomach contents interests and amuses him , though my failure to nibble at this and munch at that as I proceed may mystify him . Thinking that the Eskimos might better understand my need of specimens after seeing watercolor portraits of arctic birds , I took some downstairs one evening , and bade my friends inspect them . Groan followed groan ; grunt followed grunt . " Why-ee , why-ee , " sounded in many voices . The Eskimos handled the sheets almost reverently , touched the delineation of cloud , rock , or feather as if to make certain the object were not actual . Finally Shoo Fly , who was queen of our island by popular consent , delivered her ultimatum : " You are not human . You are more like a camera . But I want to see you making one . " Here , indeed , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man ; but in his heart he knows that the Eskimo in Eskimo land is superior . The Innuit are the inheritors of the earth . We come to see and live with them because we need their environment , their philosophy , or their religion ; because we need their fox skins ; or because we want to paint pictures of their birds . The Eskimo may appear to admire a white man 's ability as hunter or craftsman ; or he may compliment him upon his courage and endurance . But in his heart he has reservations . And who am I to assert that the Eskimo is inferior to me ? While my world has developed an obsession for inventing , discovering , conquering , for " being somebody , " the Eskimo has evolved the ability not alone to endure , but to enjoy , the " unspeakable tedium " of the long winter . He  | seems to have learned far better than I to be content . The Eskimo sees no need for effort not connected with the pursuit of daily food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has no printed literature ; his only classics are those of legend and fable . Yet why is not the spoken fable of the Bunting and the Snowy Owl enough for the soul whose great ambition is to kill a walrus or caribou , to keep comparatively comfortable in tupek or igloo , or to drive the dog team properly ? And why should the Eskimo have a greater ambition , so long as he is happy ? The average Eskimo is scarcely even curious about the Outside World . At the Post he looks at a map for a moment , but prefers to gaze at the wall , listening to the radio . He inspects a magazine , gapes admiringly at a fullpage corset advertisement , finds , with satisfaction , the picture of a woman clad in white fur , asks a question about a horse or cow , recognizes a Sealyham terrier as a dog in spite of its aberrances , informs us that the Eskimos could make an igloo as high as a skyscraper if they wanted to , murmurs a self-satisfied " motah khah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether bananas grow in the sea , stares long at drawings illustrating some comical situation but does not smile , laughs uproariously at a Jeritza cos- tumed for her part in 4'urandot , cuts a square of red paper from the cover design , closes the journal carelessly , and is done . He plays cards - soo , casino , poker , hearts , or snap . He listens to lectures , weather forecasts , sermons , and music from the radio . He trades his fox skins , his bear hides , his whalebone , or his sealskin boots for food , ammunition , and clothing at the store , and then ; sitting silently on his komatik , makes his way back to camp , where he becomes an aboriginal once more . As he journeys across the tundra , what does he think about ? Does he muse upon the beauty of the sky above him ? Is the weighted curtain of the aurora borealis a mystery to him ? Does he compose poems about his hunting experiences or his love affairs ? Does he think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have traveled with the Eskimos on their komatiks and have lived with them in tupek and in igloo . I have learned to like them greatly . But of their thought processes I know next to nothing . My guess is that the Eskimo has learned long since that there are times for thinking and times for not-thinking ; and that the lcng hours of solitude on the komatik or at the seal hole are not hours of loneliness or tedium because they are not-thinking hours .
