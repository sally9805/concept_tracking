One of the pet projects of James Delmage Ross , onetime Securities &; Exchange Commissioner , longtime head of Seattle 's municipal power system and now administrator of Bonneville Dam , is a standard yardstick for all Federal power projects . Last week Administrator Ross took his yardstick formula to President Roosevelt at Hyde Park for approval . The President approved for Bonneville only , but the idea seemed to be that if it worked at Bonneville the formula would be applied permanently to TVA , Boulder and Grand Coulee Dams and the " little TVAs " of the future . Said Mr. Ross : " We ought to be businesslike about this thing and pay Uncle Sam back the money he puts up . " <P> The Ross formula called for power rates high enough to pay 3% interest on the Government 's investment and to pay back that investment over a period of 40 years . In this formula , however , there was a big joker . The Government investment would not be the total cost of the development but only that part allocated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control or navigation . On the Tennessee River , Wilson Dam , for instance , is valued at $33,000,000 but for yardstick purposes the power investment is considered to be only $22,000,000 . Division of the $51,000,000 investment in Bonneville has not yet been determined by the Federal Power Commission . <P> To a private powerman who has to pay interest on the entire cost of a dam or a steam station , this arbitrary allocation of Government costs seems thoroughly unfair . Moreover , a public project pays no taxes , which may take as much as 25 from every private power dollar . And after the Ross formula works itself to its 40-year conclusion , the Government apparently will be almost ready to give its power away . Cried the Republican New York Herald Tribune : " Bonneville may be a yardstick to Mr. Ross . To the plain citizen its economics are just slapstick . "
