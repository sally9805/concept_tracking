txt Viewed from the elevation of mid-June the meat packing industry appears in a good position to extract from its business for fiscal year ending October 31 , 1934 , net income after all charges which may well be the best in several years . The packers are selling their products under more nearly normal conditions I than since 1930 . Current selling prices on the I all-important pork lines are higher now by a ! good margin than at any time during 1933 pack ' ing year when relatively favorable profit sho ? , ings were made . t This year has witnessed expansion to highest levels of domestic consumption of meats . The Iby-products divisions , which in 1933 started a belated comeback , have made good profits . In , creases in wages have been practically and corn , pletely offset . The ensuing four and a half months of the current fiscal year is a seasonal period of high volume sales at what is generally the most favorable price level of the whole 12 months . Inventory Positions Favorable Current inventory position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and this means in the main Armour . Cudahy , Swift and Wilson  --  are on a more distinctly domestic basis as regards pork sales than in any time since the early 1900s. does not rob the prospect of any of its cheerfulness . Assertions as to the apparent soundness of the going inventory position are fortified by the fact that 1934 supplies of pork have been definitely reduced by ( 1l the decimation of pigs last fall and ( 2 ) considerable reduction in weights of hogs due to drought and underfeeding . It is pretty safe to say that the drought , with its effect of sharply and temporarily expanded live stock runs . played into the packers ' hands. , It brought to market a good many swine and cattle that would ordinarily not come until midsummer and after , and would have , if marketed in the normal course of time , been heavier than when actually received . Prices paid for these swine , as well as live hog costs during the most of this past spring , were low and offered both immediate profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought was soon reflected in an improvement in hog and pork prices . The hog market at all centers saw an upturn of 41 a hundred weight on the average hog price in the third week of June . Contemporaneously was witnessed a more cautious buying attitude on the part of packers who had freely taken swine all spring . Even on the advance , however , the packers were willing buyers  --  to point out their convictions as to summer prospects . Getting Back to Normal The first seven and a half months of the current fiscal year produced good profits for most packers , and certainly for Swift , Armour , Wilson , Cudahy . Hormel , Morrell , Rath and Hygrade . May of this year was not as good a month as was the like 1933 period , owing almost entirely to the fact that May , 1933 , saw considerable speculative buying of packed meats by the trade which gave an abnormal turn to that month 's operations . Irrespective of this fact , however , each month of this year has piled up its share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normality than in several years . The industry estimates a reduction of about 10% in summer receipts of hogs , which means a cut of between 6% and 8eii in net pork poundage cut during the period . Taking this decline into consideration with eliminations from the swine population of 1934 effected by the pig killing last fall and the probable net result will be reflected in a net poundage of pork somewhere between 10 ' , and 15 ' , less than a year ago . Leather and hides made seasonally good profits from January to April and , while now idling , are expected to contribute some further before the year is up . Butter and egg trade- is improving with the butter inventory deemed favorable to a good price structure . The big packers derive around 10,7 , - . to 15% of total net sales from these two commodities , with the butter and egg business of Swift and Armour representing totals closer to the larger percentages mentioned than this department means to other packers . Swift claims the largest selling butter brand in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Armour has grossed as much as 5100.000.000. or 10 , i- of total sales , from butter . and last year took in nearly 560,000.000 from this source . Britain Restricts Imports The packers with export businesses are naturally disappointed in the further sharp curtailment of the trade with United Kingdom due to institutions of more restrictive quotas for 1934 than in the past . But it appears reasonable to expect that the domestic market will eat the unexported balance without appreciable affect on prices . Estimated ham and bacon exports to Great Britain during 1934 are set at 52.000.000 pounds , as against about 72.200,000 pounds in 1933 and 70.300.000 pounds in 1932 Total exports of pork to United Kingdom in 1933 were 95.139.532 pounds and of lard 296 - 193.571 pounds . as compared with 74,865,559 pounds of pork and 236.933,347 of lard and neutral lards in 1932 . The 1933 total included about 5.000,000 pounds of fresh pork . Reduced production of American pork can readily offset losses in this market . The German lard market is a more critic al loss , but it is annoyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed with respect to the lost trade Quotas have been reduced all year and on June 1 . for the 30 days following , Germany reduced lard imports from America to 17 , , of the average for the month for 1931-1952-1933 April and May imports to that country were about 38% of this average . On top of tots physical restriction our exporters are faced with a duty in Germany of rm. 100 per 100 kilos:rams of lard . equivalent to about tun times current wholesale value at Chicago of this commodity However , modest consolation is had In the fact that the important Central and northern South American markets remain Lard stocks are extraordinarily large and . on June I. totaled 182 576,000 pounds in this country , 2 ' , more than a month previous . 64 ' , above a year ago and 43 , , above the five-year average for June 1 Packers , howecer , hate not voiced concern .

South American Ree  --  Trade Fan orable On June 1 , 1934. stocks of frozen cured , in process , dry salt and dry salt in cure pork in the United States aggregated 642,055,000 pounds . compared with 656,087,000 on May 1 , a decrease of 2 " - , .

All of this meat was put down at low prices . Domestic beef business this year has been miner unsaLisfactur y but zhows signs of straightening itself out .
