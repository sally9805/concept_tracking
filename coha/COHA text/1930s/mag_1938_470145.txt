SERIOUS groups of little thinkers have been gathering all over Chicago the past couple of years . They order the blue-plate luncheon and proceed to tell one another that Chicago is ripe for reform . These good people are all amateurs . They know that their city is the world 's champion sinkhole , but they do n't know why , and they do n't know what to do about it . So they form a committee and , after the third luncheon , the committee falls apart . Reformers ca n't reform Chicago . In 1900 the Municipal Voters League discovered a cultured young man named William Hale Thompson and elected him alderman . Steffens thought that the business men wrecked the reform movement of 1900 , but that was incidental . What has always wrecked reform in Chicago is the nature of reformers , reformers everywhere . They do n't know what they want , they do n't know why they want it , and they do n't know what to do with it when they get it . So it is stolen from them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement is thefirst in forty years . The blue-plate luncheoners arc responding to a movement they think they have created . It is a movement leaderless , bodiless , directionless , of the only people who can reform a city . It is a movement among the Bohunks . The Bohunks feel , very vaguely , that something is happening in other cities and not in Chicago , and that maybe they are the reason . The $o-hunks of Chicago are the custodians of the radicalism that gave the world Altgeld and the eight-hour-day , the radicalism that led Kropotkin to misjudge the violent energy of Chicago as the hope of anarchy . The radicalism is buried today under the glacier of failure , of reform misled , misdirected , misappropriated . But the uneasy sense of something impending is there . It persists . It evokes , inarticulately , the blue-plate luncheons . It sends the city to the polls to slap down the Kelly-Nash machine and nominate another machine just like it . But the uneasiness persists . It is too deep this time to be drawn off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traces . It is too deep to be drawn off by reform movements or imitation reform movements . Something is going to happen . Not to-day . Not to-morrow . Chicago , if you want to know what has happened to it since Insull , has merely grown a little worse . Chicago has a mayor who settled for $100,000 a claim of the government for unreported income . Taxes are higher . The poor are hungrier . The blighted area , fifty square miles of the city 's two hundred , has n't been touched . The schools have the highest non-instructional expenditures in the country . The streets are full of holes , and the garbage is disposed of by kicking it round until it gets lost . Metropolitan government has improved everywhere else , but Chicago stands where it stood in the ' 80s , when Mr. Mulligan cautioned his wife , who wanted to awaken the drunken aldermen , " Lave them be . While they sleep the city 's safe . " Chicago has never really had reform . " You ca n't reform big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " New-York's-done-it " animates every blue-plate luncheon in town . It spreads through the city like a messianic rumor , and it means something special in Chicago . For Chicago , indifferent to everything else in this world or the next , hates and envies New York . Chicago 's miraculous growth carried it past one city after another until it felt that its destiny was to grow always bigger , and it made its destiny its god . But it never caught up with New York . Some day , says Chicago ... some day . The Tribune 's platform is : Make Chicago the First City in the World . The blue-plate luncheoners will disappear into the maw of one or another of the two pseudo-reform movements now getting under way . One is the city-manager plan . The other is Tom Courtney , the fighting prosecutor of Cook County . It might be enough to point out that both these reform movements are owned and operated by that rabid reformer , Col. Frank Knox . But their implications go farther . City-management is hacked by the outs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . The popular clamor surrounding the movement in Chicago is , however , considerable . It emanates from the bosomy ladies ' clubs , male and female , the same sweet souls who , in their innocence , may always be depended upon to give reform a lift in the direction of corruption , via the clarion call of low taxes . With all its mechanical merits , city-management is based on the ladylike notion that city government properly has nothing to do with politics . It is purely a matter of business efficiency . But the only reform that has ever reformed ? like MiIwaukee 's and New York 's ? has been based on policy ; efficiency has been a by-product . Efficiency does not tell a city whether to build a highway instead of a playground , whether to shoot strikers or protect them , whether to levy a sales tax or a luxury tax . Only a good or a bad politician , responsive or unresponsive to human dynamics , can make these decisions . The city manager of Cincinnati was a good politician ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always broke because for reasons of policy it tries to live off those who ca n't pay . Rather than follow the ladies ' clubs to that bright newdayof lower taxes for poor and rich , Chicago will stick to the oneto-a-hundred gamble of getting a good politician . This time the chances are a little longer than usual . The city will go to the polls in next year 's mayoralty election and decide between Tom Courtney , the New Deal Democratic favorite of Colonel Knox and his Republican Daily News , and Ed Kelly , the New Deal Democratic favorite of Col. R. R. McCormick and his Republican Tribune . You have to hold on to your hat when you tour Chicago politics . Courtney and his reform ally , Democratic Governor Henry Horner , are not unacquainted with Kelly and his reform ally , Democratic National Committeeman Pat Nash . They all four worked in the same rich vineyard of Democracy under Roger Sqllivan and Tony Cermak . A couple of ' yearsago State 's Attorney Courtney ai Mayor Kelly split , on the academic isSue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , better yet , which of Ahem should declare the more firmly that gambling must go . Any reasonabl.y mature infant knows that where tl4re is no protection there is no gambling Courtney , who has spent his entire career in the public service , sometimes in four or five public services at once , has been announcing " wars , " " probes , " and " drives " since the machine made him prosecutor in 1932 , and the vices of the rich and the poor continue to flourish . Courtney is the darling of the business men . His anti-union activity commends him to them . His " investigation " of tax-fixing , announced almost three years ago , has never reached the indictment stage . And as a crime-fighter , he enforces with impartial severity the majesty of those laws which forbid rich and poor alike to steal bread , beg in the streets , and sleep under bridges . If Courtney takes over Chicago the blue-plate reform movement will subside . The city will go on feeling uneasy , but it will be ten or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what it ought to do about it . There is talk that Courtney and Kelly are going to get together ? Kelly to be reelected mayor and Courtney to go to the Senate in place of Jim Ham Lewis , who has just been placed on the City Hall payroll as special traction counsel at $1,000 a month . For months at a time the two crusaders conduct no rival " raids " on gambling . If they are really reconciled , Mr. Roosevelt , who has kept away from the shooting , can inform them that , whether they or their friends like it or not , Harold L. Ickes is to be the next mayor of Chicago . If that happens , and it is n't impossible , Chicago will have its La Guardia . But we are talking politics , and the question is , What makes Chicago a city unto itself ? in America . The suburban trains are fast . It 's forty minutes from the manufacturing district to the North Shore , and you carry back to your garden only a little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the suburbs the Chicago of the Polacks and the Wops and the Sheenies and the Niggers is a far place , filled with factories and alleys and , of all things , young criminals . You do n't have to live with the Bo-hunks , but you have to work them and boss them and hate them . Chicago , remember , is a manufacturing , not a financial , center . Its business men handle men , not balance sheets . They are masters not of steel but of steel workers . The raucous voice associated with Chicago is the voice of the yard foreman , the voice of Chicago 's operating aristocracy . This aristocracy hates the city and tries to get away from it because it is so close to it . It 's not always easy , in Chicago , to tell the bosses and the Bohunks apart . The Bohunks have to be shown who 's boss . They have to be bridled by the men who sponsor the opera . In New York a finance-industrialist will sign a contract with the C.I.O. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that the increased costs can be passed on to the public . But in Chicago there is something besides costs to be considered . In Chicago a Girdler will be damned if he will let a lot of Bohunks tell him how to run his steel company ; he 'd rather go back to the farm and grow potatoes . That 's one reason why a young city , with a young aristocracy , is so violent . That is why the Haymarket repeats itself all the way from Crane 's Alley in 1886 to South Chicago in 1937 . That is why the Pinkertons got their start in Chicago . That is why it took two companies of regulars to break the railroad strike of ' 77 and Grover Cleveland to break the Pullman strike of ' 94 . " Nothing to arbitrate , " Mr. Pullman said to Debs . Chicago 's aristocracy is tough . Such an aristocracy has no leisure and little taste to understand or love its city . Up to now it has not been necessary to understand or love it . Chicago is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map . Chicago is the heart , literally , of the continent , every artery terminating in its freight yards . Incomparably located at the crossroads of men and materials , it dominates a plain that produces the richest agricultural yield in the world . Chicago can go bankrupt because of what Dun &; Bradstreet calls " conditions which are essentially administrative . " But it ca n't go broke . A city that is young and rich and rambunctious does n't worry about high taxes . When business is good it pays them . When business is bad it does n't . Chicago 's tax delinquency , after eight years of bad business , is far and away the highest in the country . But the bonded debt is low , the city 's credit is good . What difference does it make ? Chicago has never had to take stock . And it wo n't have to , despite its " administrative " troubles , for a while yet . Neither the aristocracy nor the proletariat asks much in the way of public services , and the government does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage is collected regularly . In the slums the citizens lived in garbage before they came to Chicago and ever since they 've been there . Fifty years ago Jane Addams of Hull House began her fight for garbage collection ; a few weeks ago Charlotte Carr of Hull House began her fight for garbage collection . III " The city 's morals are bad , " said a local historian in the ' 40s , " but business is good . " What does a city with good business want with good morals ? What does Chicago want with a reputation ? All Chicago needs is money and moneymaking , power it can see and touch , great superlative things that the world will have to admire . These things it has , and the world admires them , And as long as it has these things , as long as the world admires them , it wo n't need anything else . It wo n't need to listen to its social workers and its professors who tell it that it needs something else . Chicago is a legitimate child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , roughly , with Ulysses S. Grant and ended , very roughly , with Charles G. Dawes and the $90,000,000 loan from the R.F.C. And Chicago is the only American metropolis wholly without roots in earlier ages with earlier ideals . Los Angeles and Detroit were boom towns too ; but Los Angeles is a combination side show and infirmary , not a city at all , and Detroit had grown slowly and steadily , with its feet on the ground , for almost a century before Henry Ford . Chicago has been hustling since the day it was born . It has been a boom town and a crash town , a speculator and a cardsharp , a continuous pay-night in Leadville for every one of its hundred years . It is this that is unique about Chicago . Boston and Philadelphia , New Orleans and St. Louis are cities with a past . In such cities , as in New York , there are values of leisure . In Chicago there are none . In Chicago the rush is on , it is always on , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a boom town and has never been anything else , Chicago is , more than any other metropolis except Los Angeles , a city that does n't care . Chicago knew what Bill Thompson was . Did it care ? Does it care now ? Of course not . Look at the show he put on . When we got tired of him , we traded him in for Ten-Per-Cent Tony Cermak . Chicago knew what Capone was . Did it care ? Why , Al was a sport , a real sport ; when lie walked into the courtroom we gave him a cheer . Chicago knew what Instill was . Did it care ? Say , Sam was the biggest of them all ; you 've got to admire a man like that , even if he takes your dough . So Chicago , young and rich and booming , laughs . And its laugh says : What the hell . We built the town , and the fire burned us out . We built it again , big and fast , and now we want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . Gangsters ? They 'll kill one another off . The new Criminal Courts Building ? That 's a hot one ; you know why Tony built it out in the sticks . The right-angle turns at the New Outer Drive Bridge ? That 's a good one ; you know who made a killing on that one . Chicago is n't lawless , just careless . Nobody gives a damn ; nobody , that is , that you can hear . The only thing that counts is front . Chicago has always had the front . Between God and the Commercial Club it has built a lake-front swimming in sunlight , with a park all along the length , the paper-thin length , of the city . You must see the parks and the lake front and the sky-line , and you must say , with the late William Bolitho : A noble and a spacious city . The City Beautiful . The Burnham Lake-Front Plan was drawn up in 1909 . It gave the world the goal of the City Beautiful . But since 1909 the City Beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Livable . Everything Chicago has , has gone into that rim around the lake , and the whole thing , park and sky-line and water , is a Hollywood set , creating the illusion of non-existent depth . Behind the City Beautiful lies the Chicago that neither the visitor nor the suburbanite knows or wants to know . This is the City Monotonous , the Chicago of cottage-tenements thrown up hurriedly , flimsily , after the Fire of ' 7 1 . Here live the Bohunks , the people without the heart or the carfare to see the lake . Here buildings come down when they fall down , and buildings never go up . Twenty-five per cent of the vast area of Chicago is officially slums . There has never been any money in slum-clearance . The " temporary " slums of the ' 70s remained . When the New Deal decided that slum-clearance was public business it turned to the cities and asked them for their plans . Plans ? What would cago be doing with plans ? It had none . It has none now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens described at its inception as " hard-boiled business men " who would " make Chicago attractive to visitors from all parts of the world , " meets once a year and changes personnel when somebody dies . It is interested in a lake-front airport , in a subway serving the downtown department stores . It is not interested in the relation of traction to highways , in the rehabilitation of blighted areas , in a land-use survey preliminary to government housing . Chicago did n't need a plan . The people who run Chicago , in and out of government , had their own plan for government housing . Over the most extortionate handicaps , three federal projects have been completed . After five years of sabotage , in and out of the courts , a single project for Negroes is ready to go up . The business interests have fought them all . And the last session of the State legislature , with the Republicans voting with the Chicago delegates , refused to permit the necessary tax exemption for $50,000 , - 000 of federal housing money offered Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved . Planning ? There has n't been any time for planning . Chicago , doubling its wealth and its population every time the census man stuck his head in , has been rushing and roaring forward for a century , stumbling over its dead , hiding its debris , shooting and shouting and grabbing and sky-scraping , hoping it will last forever , saving it will and knowing it wo n't , beating the gun , beating the lights , heatingthe law . Chicago has n't heard the voices that in much less than a hundred years come to trouble cities . Who is there in Chicago to take time to hear them , to listen for them above the noise of men and pigs and forges ? IV A city whose ideals are size and prosperity has neither the space to house nor the money to support men and women who concern themselves with books . America to-day is more alive culturally than at any time since America consisted of New England and " the West . " But Chicago is untouched by the renaissance . It remains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hackett , Hansen , Rascoe , Hecht , and Hemingway all gave up and left . The city that , young and magnetic , produced in a single winter , in 1902 , The Pit , Fables in Slang , and The Common Lot , the city that , from 1870 to 1917 , produced more literary magazines than New York itself ? that city to-day wants nothing and just about has it . A few vestiges remain . Sandburg is a last lonely giant , coming in from his farm to wander about the place and look for the songs the city sang when he called it the hog-butcher it is . Poetry keeps him company , but it is n't what it was , though Chicago does n't know that because it never read it . The Art Institute keeps him company , but Chicago does n't go there unless it hears that the biggest collection of Masters ever assembled is being shown for the Fair . There are younger artists , like Bohrod and Millman , and writers , like Meyer Levin and Louis Zara , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York . And Sandburg looks round and says : " Where is everybody ? " Everybody is gone . Herbert Stone 's Chap Book , publishing Ibsen and Beardsley ; Margaret Anderson 's Little Review , publishing the first installments of Ulysses ; Scripps ' Day Book , publishing Sandburg alongside scoops on falling elevators in department stores ; Maurice Browne 's Little Theatre , producing Synge and Strindberg ? where is everybody ? They 've gone away , and Sam Instill has made culture and dynamos hum . There are more Friends of Writers and Foundations for Literature than there are even in Muncie ? dowagers in search of an author . Nations go in for colonies , and Chicago goes in for culture . It is n't fair , or possible , to indict a city , everyone in it . There are Chicagoans who know that their University is one of the half-dozen most useful in the world . There are Chicagoans who do n't join the clamor for a second encore of Paganini 's Perpetual Motion at the Symphony . There are Chicagoans who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suspect , when every one of the city 's four theaters is dark , that , Mayor Kelly and his advisers notwithstanding , The Children 's Hour would n't have corrupted the city . But Chicago in the large is seen at its dead and deadly level when the city pitches in to rack the University for sedition . Chicago , for all its size , is a hick town as well as a boom town . It is a hick town not because it is young ( although that 's what it will tell you ) but because the age that made it great was a hick age . Within its city limits are Europes and Asias and Africas , but they are mysteries unexplored . The lake looks out to homogeneous shores , the railroads bring in movie stars who are interviewed for the front page , and Chicago is a suitcase city , Chicago is as landlocked as Kansas . Chicago is bigger than most of the capital cities of the world , but the currents of world affairs , of intellectual and artistic movements , wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has no right not to have fulfilled the cultural destiny of great cities . It has no right not to have a newspaper which thinks that important ideas are news . But it all happened so suddenly and has gone on happening so suddenly for a century . The suddenness has never given the city a chance to catch up with itself physically , much less culturally . Chicago lies at the foot of the lake like a loose crescent , and half the population has been pushed twice as far from the heart ( and the interest ) of the metropolis as it would have been had the city been built round a center . The absence of topographical obstacles , north , south , and west , has encouraged the outward flow . The suburbs have grown five times as fast as the city itself . Government piles on government . There are more than 1,600 governmental bodies , aside from State and Federal , within fifty miles of State and Madison Streets . There are six entirely independent feudalities feasting on Cook County alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens to leave theircabbage patches uncovered between October and April . The building code has more than 1,300 amendments , most of them representing graft , blackmail , or special privilege . The combination of physical diffusion and governmental chaos accounts , in large measure , for Chicago 's perennial state of political misery . More than two-thirds of the population is of foreign birth or parentage . Years ago national and racial groups huddled , each by itself , in Chicago 's empty reaches and stayed there and multiplied . They remain isolated and insulated as in no other city in America . All that Chicago knows about its half million Poles , its half million Germans , its quarter million each of Irish , Swedes , and Italians , is that they live " somewhere out that way . " Nobody 's ever been there . To-day Chicago is a loose federation of some eighty walled cities , none of which thinks of itself as Chicagoan , none of which knows , or , if it knows , cares that the others are there . At the borders the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix it with rocks and fists , and Chicago 's criminals rise from the conflict , young tribal leaders come to power in the wars between neighborhood principalities for which no international law exists . The neighborhoods remain strangers because the boundless plain does n't throw them together , and tribal hatreds survive at an intense pitch . Foreign immigration is finished , but when the packers began bringing the Negroes in , during and after the War , the struggle of the native Americans to retain their economic supremacy shifted to a new sector , one in which all the old tribal enemies could pile in on the winning side . More than 200 , - 000 Negroes pay fantastic rents for tenements that simply do n't hold more than 150,000 . And if they budge they are bombed . Chicago has n't seen the last of its race riots . Chicago 's political bosses operate through their control of these immigrant cities . Thompson had the Negroes ' two wards , and with them the balance of Republican power . Cermak welded all the brands of Slays , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic machine . When he died the Irish came back ; the Negroes , beneficiaries of the New Deal , swung bodily to the Irish Democracy ; the Slays and the Jews are the battleground of the two Irish factions now at war for control of the Democratic party . Thus Chicago has never had a Boss , but shifting cliques of factional bosses operating on mutually exclusive national or racial lines . Of the two-party tradition , moribund in many metropolitan centers , Chicago has known nothing for years . Democrats and Republicans have party appetites but neither party principles nor party tendencies . As Thompson , the Republican , controlled the Brennan Democrats , so Kelly , the Democrat , controls the Crowe Republicans . There are n't many Chicagoans who can remember the name of the " Republican " who ran against Ed Kelly for mayor . But this constantly shuffled factional system has saved Chicago from what may have been something worse : a Tammany . The prey of the big boss is the people , inert and unorganized . Little bosses do n't have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do in Chicago , honest citizens at least have the choice between a bad official and a worse one . Even if Chicago could and wanted to do something about its municipal monkey-house , it would still be in the toils of that ancient and rural institution known as the State . Like New York , Detroit , and Atlanta , but more hopelessly than any of them , Chicago is deprived by the downstate farmers of the right to govern itself . Though the State constitution demands redistricting after every census , Chicago was last redistricted in 1901 . The city has 54% of the State 's population and 41% of the representation in the legislature . The farmers wo n't pay for redistricting unless Chicago is willing to rewrite the 120-year-old revenue section of the constitution to in-MAGAZINE troduce an income tax . And the Chicagoans who do n't want an income tax are the men who rule Chicago . V The sin of Chicago 's aristocracy , except for the publishers and the utility combine , is more negative than positive . The business community coalesces by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor legislation . But the larger offense of the business men lies in their refusal , though they alone have the power , to accept the responsibility for government . That they pass on to the politicians , whom they use only when their class interests are involved . The situation is not unique in the Chicago of to-day or yesterday , but the non-rule of the rulers is more vitiating than their misrule . There is not a Chicagoan , not one , at the top of the heap who is willing to have anything to do with the tragedy of the city . When Governor Horner , who , though a Chicagoan , now leads the downstate forces against the Kelly-Nash-Tribune machine , attempted to get a constitutional convention for revision of the revenue section , the Civic Federation of Chicago , which says that its business is " giving the public information concerning pending legislation affecting government finances and taxes , " was silent . The Tribune spoke for business : " The people of Illinois do not want constant meddling with the fundamental law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1818 . Hovering protectively ? and with some of the characteristics of a buzzard ? over the business interests of Chicago is the press . And by " the press " I mean all five metropolitan dailies . ( Incidentally , Chicago had fifteen dailies fifty years ago . ) The people , even the people of a city that does n't care , hate the Chicago press with a holy hate ; but it takes ten million dollars these days ? and in Chicago a crew of sluggers ? to start a metropolitan newspaper . Chicago 's papers have a special interest in keeping the city from any radical change . Years ago Chicago 's school lands underlay the priceless downtown district . Most of the land was sold for a song , but there were a few ninety-nine-year leases , among them to the Tribune and the News . These leases were subject to revaluation every ten years , but in 1895 , at an historic midnight session of the school board , the revaluation clauses were stricken nut . Of course the value of the properties rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of the city 's school children . And in later years , before the War . it was two of the Chicago papers , bloodying for circulation , that set the precedent for that notorious Chicago technic of importing unidentifiable hoodlums . The News used to be dear to the " better element 's " heart . It was Melville E. Stone , first editor of the paper , who convinced Judge Gary that " the identity of the bomb-thrower , " in the Haymarket case , " was of no consequence . " But the News at least stood for efficient government ( with all the implications of effi ciency ) . Then it fell , largely through the influence of men like Dawes , into the hands of Colonel Knox . To-day it is still possible to distinguish it from the Tribune . But it is falling fast . In the interest of destroying McCormick 's man Kelly , Knox demands that the city " consolidate and reorganize city departments , establish a central purchasing system , and centralize the accounting system . " But Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator bill . " The tabloid Daily Times is an allegedly liberal paper which espouses the liberalism of Franklin Roosevelt and Ed Kelly . The two Hearst papers are Hearst papers , important only because the morning edition is below the general Hearst level and provides the only alternative to the Tribune . It is the Chicago Tribune , recently voted by ninety-three Washington correspondents " the least fair and reliable " single paper in America , that plays a larger role than any other oneagency in keeping Chicago as it is today . Colonel McCormick , who inherited the paper , can not be bought . He does n't have to be . He comes by the courage of his advertisers ' convictions naturally and honorably . With his fanatic hatred of New Dealer Roosevelt and his fanatic love of New Dealer Kelly , he suits the Association of Commerce right down to the ground . He blinds Chicago , where local issues are concerned , and he symbolizes Chicago to the Middle West , " Chicagoland , " which he serves with the largest circulation of any standard-sized newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A vote for La Guardia is a vote for Communism . " He will save Chicago from Moscow , if it takes every Arabian in his stable . Whatever temperamental differences may divide Chicago 's publishers on superficial issues , they stand rock-ribbed , foursquare , and hat in hand , at the door of the utilities combine . The utilities are unshakable . Their grip began sixty years ago with Yerkes , who looked back on his Chicago career , which netted him $70,000,000 , and said , " I had to do it . " It reached its full flower with Instill . It continues to-day , its insult " L " coaches occasionally plowing through one another 's matchwood , its Yerkes street cars crawling and lurching , its gas company enjoying the highest comparable rates in the country . Its present control is in the downtown banks . The President of the First National , which dominates the gas company , and the President of the Continental Illinois , which dominates the electric company , are co-receivers of the surface lines . Yerkes was even-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " Republican " Billy Lorimer . When the Thompson " Republicans " were in power , the law partner of Thompson 's lawyer was retained by the Insull companies .

Senate whose pasts were so unfortunate that even the U. S. Senate would n't have them ? Lorimer in 1910 and Frank Smith in 1926 . Instill contributed $150 , - 000 personally to Smith 's campaign . Professor Charles E. Merriam , who knows Chicago better than any man alive , may have been na ? ve , though it is doubtful , when he wrote of the Chicago utilities companies : " The high personal character of many of their directors had nothing to do with their political methods when politics was in question , and their public spirit did not stand in the way of the most greedy and desperate undertakings in the special field where franchises and other public favors were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything he sold , from water power to watered securities , and came as close to worshipping him as godless Chicago ever comes to worship .

The workers in the buildings , the night copy men and the scrubwomen , came to thewindows and hollered down to the booing Bohunks . But the Bohunks did n't hear what they said ; they might have been surprised , had they heard . Chicago 's radicalism was , and will be again , a parochial radicalism , coming out of the prairies .

In all the litigation over the traction lines , ten years in receivership now , there is one phrase that is never mentioned by any of the parties : municipal ownership , the only answer to a traction system that does n't pay and has no buyers .

" The utilities and the press are hell-bent on saving Chicago from collectivist crackpotism . Chicago was once the strongest labor town in America . Its craft unions dared in 1919 to awaken that apocalyptic monster , class consciousness . They organized a labor party and ran the noble John Fitzpatrick for mayor . He came in third , Bill Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labor town was at hand . To-day the craft unions , aside from the Typographers and a few others , are thoroughly reactionary , and their leadership is thoroughly harmonious with the city 's politicians . Kelly is on intimate terms with the building trades and Courtney is on intimate terms with the teamsters . Last year the Chicago Federation of Labor was officially not interested in the police massacre of C.1.0. strikers in South Chicago . The great murderous attacks on labor in Chicago have all been made on the industrial union front ? from the railway strike of ' 77 to the steel strike of ' 37 . With one exception , clothing , Chicago 's six giant industries have been kept free , as the Tribune puts it , for labor . Packing , steel , farm machinery , mail order , and electrical machinery have always been " open , " and always must be , because industrial unionization has an historical tendency to turn to political action . " Labor " wo n't save Chicago , but the men who labor , the Bohunks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners in Chicago is declining every year . It was the propertyless who produced Golden Rule Jones in Toledo , Tom Johnson in Cleveland , Potato Patch Pingree and Frank Murphy in Detroit , Dan Howl in Milwaukee , and La Guardia in New York . Revolutions , all of them , American revolutions . The revolution will come to Chicago some day . Chicago is the most democratic city in the United States . It is young and strong , and , though it has been big and rich and careless , it has never had a Tammany , a Wall Street , or a " Four Hundred . " Chicago needs to have a future . Democracy needs to assert itself in Chicago , for the corruption of our cities is the genesis of the mass base for the conviction that democracy wo n't work . Jefferson was afraid of the city . Incapable as he was of visualizing a nation-city like Chicago , a prison for five million people , he realized , nevertheless , that such cities as he could visualize were threats to democracy , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1934 ninety-seven Chicagoans paid 20 per cent of all the income tax collected from the thirty counties in the city 's domain , and 54 per cent of Chicago 's children came from homes where the tax-paying ability was inadequate to provide education . The Bohunks , the only people who can reform Chicago , have an amazing reproductive rate . And their children are growing up , speaking English . By the time they are full grown , ten or twenty years from now , Chicago 's elite will have changed , too . The boom , it seems likely , will be over . The railroads are played out , the influx of cheap labor has stopped , and the city 's industrial expansion has been slowing down , imperceptibly , since 1923 . Give the Bohunks ten or twenty years to begin caring , give the elite ten or twenty years to produce a few free men ? and Chicago may yet be a city .
