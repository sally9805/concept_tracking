GOOD-BY , young man , and gond luck ! " The captain had said it that twenty-fourth of October , 1934 . I stood on a desolate Alaskan beach 140 miles north of Nome and watched the Coast Guard cutter , Northland , wallow around until her how pointed toward Bering Strait . Suddenly she vanished into the blinding blizzard . Good lurk ! I needed it already . Surrounded by five tons of food , clothing , tools , medicines , gifts and miscellaneous items  --  our year 's supply , purchased overnight in Nome at prices as high as the latitude  --  I could only be thankful that Ruth and our three-year-old Billy , or Skooker , as he was called , were still at Fairbanks , 750 miles away . They would follow by plane , weather permitting . I could bank on Ruth for anything . Had n't she risked a crazy honeymoon hike with me through uncharted British Columbian wilderness four years before ? Then , after wintering at Atlin , had n't we built a skiff and floated 1200 miles down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital before Skooker 's birth ? Now , with another baby coming , she was as eager as 1 to tackle this Government job of teaching Eskimos on the westernmost point of the North American continent ; the extreme tip , from which Siberian hills are visible across fifty-six miles of Bering Strait , What if we would be the only whites there , with mail arriving by dog team once a month and ninety days needed to get replies from home ? We were to be only temporary teachers at first , since Uncle Sam demanded two years of college instead of one for his permanent teachers . But I had been assured that our firstyear on the job would place us in the permanent class . That was the practical reason a hy this unexpected offer looked good to Ruth and me . It came only a day before the Northland was to leave Nome on her final northbound trip of the season . I radioed Ruth at Fairbanks ; received her Biblical-sounding reply : ANYWlitHE YOU GO 11 , . L G0 , RUM With fourteen hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me throughout the night . I had even arranged for a short-wave radio transmitter to be assembled and sent us by dog-team mail , so that we could summon a plane from Nome when Ruth 's time came to go to the hospital . Meanwhile , we 'd have nothing to do but keep house and teach school among those 180 full-blooded Eskimos at Cape Prince of Vales . Captain Seamrnell had done his best , kindness alone prompting him to bring the Northland this far north so late in the season , But Cape Prince of Wales is a tough spot to land lifeboats , even in moderate weather . After one look , he had been forced to turn back and put me ashore on this Godforsaken beach ten miles short of the village . : la well be a hundred , I thought gloomily , surveying all my unprotected stuff . Now what to do ? Finally , remembering that moisture permeates only a thin outer layer of a sack of flour , I began piling my flour on top of everything else . lire Eskimo Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I rubbed my eyes at sight of a large skin boat , or umiak , manned by parka-clad Eskimo men and women , heading straight for shore , the sound of its outboard motor muffled by snow and pounding surf . / did n't dream that this native family skirting the coast in search of precious driftwood included one-eyed Nanooruk and his fourteen-year-old son , Romeo , both of whom had been in Hollywood and played parts in the moving picture , Eskimo . All I was aware of was being surrounded by a group of natives above whose excited jaliberings I caught the wool , " Teacher ! Teacher ! " The welcome was mutual . An hour later , our umiak , loaded with as much of my supplies as she could carry , rounded the rooky cliffs of Cape Mountain . Then , through the blizzard , came my first glimpse of " home . " It was n't much to look at . Some scattered wooden shacks , a small frame church , a smaller building for the native missionary , and the long white wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would set up housekeeping . The native driftwood igloos , half buried in the ground and covered with sod and earth , were invisible to my untrained eye . Yet when my shipmates gave their ancient village rallying cry , " Quo-main ? Quo-main ! " little figures popped out of nowhere and scurried shoreward to watch us land . I 've seen many an umiak beached in dangerous breakers since , but never a landing in which I took more personal interest . Lifting our motor aboard , the crew grabbed paddles and kept us well out from land while awaiting an extra-high wave . Then , at a signal , they paddled furiously for shore while I sat tense as a bowstring . On we swept , riding that huge comber like a surfboard . A second shout and , to my horror , they deliberately swung us around into the trough , parallel to shore . Instantly all hands leaned to leeward , as if trying their best to pull the umiak over on us all . There came a tremendous crash as the breaker caught our bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it slapped us far up into shallow water , reasonably dry , wholly intact . I grabbed my rifle and scrambled out . My first mistake ! The rifle , I mean . For a stranger to come among Eskimos with rifle in hand was considered  --  well , vulgar , to say the least . But , after all , not even a schoolteacher could be expected to know everything . So , with Japlike faces beaming from parka hoods , they clustered around me in a semicircle , women on one side , and all shook hands with me and laughed and shouted their thanks : " Qui-oh-n.4 ! Qua-yah-nal " For some reason , it surprised me to find them so much like white people both in stature and intelligence . But what were they thanking me for ? Perhaps for coming at all . Presently , out of the semicircle stepped one taller and prouder looking than the rest . This was Robert Mayokwok , who introduced himself in excellent English as " one who will be your interpreter . " l ; le apologized because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the coast hunting seals . But here was Dwight Tevuk , in temporary charge of the school building , already arranging for the young boys to carry up my goods  --  for a hinted " five cents a box . " At Tevuk 's suggestion , I paid the youngsters in raisins and was delighted to see what a nickel 's worth of raisins meant to an Eskimo kid . Then I made my second mistake by giving one of the hardest workers an apple . Whereupon , to appease the rest of the village , I ended by handing out a box and a half of apples all around . Pay , it seemed , was an individual matter with Eskimos , but a gift something to be distributed equally to all . The schoolhouse was a barnlike structure with eight coal stoves to stoke , besides the worn-out range in our kitchen . Our kitchen boasted an upright steel drum to be kept filled by sledding water from a distant spring often buried deep in drifts . Later I showed the boys a way to protect that spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first snow igloo they had ever seen . But what really caught . my eye about the kitchen was an honest-to-goodness bathtub in one corner . Wo n't Ruth be tickled ' I thought  --  before learning that lack of pipe connections had caused it to be used solely for garbage by some previous occupant . Both bedrooms in the loft seemed cold and uninviting . I decided we 'd better sleep in the kitchen for fuel economy . So , to make room for our bed , I moved the bathtub into our living room , where it remained all winter , disguised as II library table . There was a small office just inside the front door . Here a cabinet of official-looking tiles tempted me to quit on the spot . Frivolous City Fathers N O ONE had explained that along with teaching school I would be postmaster , manager of the cooperative store , village doctor  --  me a doctor ! ? secretary of the village council and superintendent of a 8.5000 PWA project , besides being responsible for 14,000 reindeer , each of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reindeer Company . My first move was to call a meeting of the village council  --  all twelve members  --  in our living room that same night . The city fathers at on the floor , legs stretched straight in front , feet incased in fancy mukluks . As a special treat , I passed out cigarettes , then addressed them through the interpreter : " I 'm here to help you all I can , but you 'll have to help me a lot too . Now , what 's the first thing to do ? " A long silence pregnant with suppressed emotion . Then out it came in gutturals : " We want to dance ! " Through Robert they explained at length how they , as well as their fathers and forefathers , used to keep fit in winter by dancing the old dances and singing the old tribal songs in a big central igloo , or kusge , until some well-meaning missionary astonished them by proving how wicked it all was . The big igloo , abandoned , had long since rotted away . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-old pastime . " You can dance right here in the schoolhouse , " I promised , " provided some of you older men will help my wife and me teach the children ivory carving and all the native crafts you 'd like revived . Is it a bar-gain ? " It was . Only they did n't want to start the dances too soon . They were ashamed to show one another how rusty they 'd grown . They 'd have to practice up first . And for this secret practice I promptly offered our living room . thought , was to start that PWA project , a wooden bulkhead reinforced by rock , and represented so far only by several hundred dollars ' worth of timber lying on the shore . Since its purpose was to keep the schoolhouse from washing out to sea , I agreed that the work could n't begin too soon . It was while we were getting this project under way the following week that Ruth and Skooker arrived . I had been scanning the weather , hoping for a fair day that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , we had finally selected a stretch of smooth beach , only to have a sudden storm wreck it overnight . Still , I was n't overly worried next morning . It was still spitting snow . Surely they would n't , choose sin+ weather for their flight over the mountains from Nome . We were all down digging the bulkhead trench when one of the men yelled , " Quo-main ! " We looked up . High over Cape Mountain came a small cabin plane , which circled over us so low that I could see Ruth 's face pressed against the cabin window . This circling continued for nearly an hour , during which Skooker , I learned afterward , was establishing an all-time record for air sickness . Meanwhile we below were searching frantically for some makeshift landing place on the snow-covered tundra where the pilot could come down safely with wheels , Without much choice , we picked what seemed best . Then , with most of the village lined around it to indicate the area , he headed down , ehanced an upset , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days were not always so murky as that following M-onday morning when we opened school beneath the lamp-lit scrutiny of forty-eight pairs of black . tnisehievous eyes . The Shut  --  Up Strike Our children ranged in age from five to sixteen . Besides a small class of beginners whom Ruth instructed largely with a scrubbing brush and liberal use of paper napkins for running noses , she had the primary department and grades one to three , while I took grades four , five and six  --  our two main groups being separated by an eight-foot wooden partition . Neither of us had ever taught school before , and the technical knowledge gained from my one year at California Institute of Technology proved helpful only in enabling me to rip out that partition in the shortest possible time . Erected on the theory of helping each group concentrate better , it worked just the opposite , whetting curiosity to the bursting point as to what the other crowd was up to . With all mystery removed , things went better . For a time . Then one day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because it was always hard to get them to talk , I was trying to develop what little English they had learned by asking questions . Replies , of course , came in strangely enunciated syllables , since native Eskimo is spoken entirely with vocal cords rather than tongue and lips . Still , they were answering in a fashion , when suddenly , for no reason at all , the boy I was questioning $ closed up like a clam . I tried the others , one by one . The whole class stared silently at me with that passive , half-amused look which only an Eskimo 's face can assume . But there was a. reason . We had n't realized how sensitive Eskimo youngsters really were . Thinking , perhaps , that I was laughing secretly at their efforts , they chose to keep still . As soon as I exaggerated my own enunciation and , in addition , asked the class to repeat the words in unison , it worked . English came hard , and what they learned at school was quickly forgotten later through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home was when they did n't want the old folks to know what they were saying . Learning on Me Run Nor did we discover a way to interest them in spelling and arithmetic until one recess when we stood watching two teams in a strenuous game of soccer . " I wish they 'd study that hard , " I remarked . " Well . " Ruth answered with a flash of true inspiration , " why not divide them into teams and play it into ' em ? " After that we put school work on a competitive basis , with instant success . For spelling I had the boys cut six-inch alphabet letters out of plywood . Then we divided the Mass in to two teams , each armed with two complete alphabets distributed among its members . The word , say , was " walrus . " At my signal , a W from each team would race across the room and set up his letter . Next would come the A 's , then the L 's , and so on . The team which first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . Always keen for competition , each student studied hard to keep his side from losing . In arithmetic we used numerals 0 to 0 , cut from wood in the same way . The first group to get the answer to a problem and spot it up in numerals across the room was declared the winner . Even Ruth 's primary grade absorbed the astonishing fact that two and two make four by showing it with highly colored blocks which we made by painting old oil-can cases . Oddly enough , they all liked writing ; possibly because this was something they could do with their hands . But I reading and geography were hopeless until we hit on a letter campaign which killed both birds with one stone . We would pick out a small town in each state , or possibly some English colony in the Far East . Any place on the globe where there might be an English-speaking school . Then wo would help our boys and girls write letters to those distant youngsters , in care of their superintendents , telling them how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expense was nothing , because , you see , my fourth-class postmaster fees for canceling outgoing stamps exactly balanced the cost of mailing . And in time replies came in  --  so many that I received an official inquiry from the post-office authorities at Anchorage . Having divided the PWA bulkhead workers into two groups according to skill , I had arbitrarily fixed the wages for carpenters at seventy-five cents an hour , ordinary laborers fifty cents . What was my surprise , then , to have the carpenters complain bitterly . But when I learned the nature of their complaint , I nearly fell over . ? A man was only a man , they informed me , and if I did n't out their pay to fifty cents like the others , they 'd quit . I promised to correct my silly mistake by adjustment of their next month 's wages . With work on the bulkhead finally stopped by ice , though our thermometer rarely registered lower than thirty below all winter , the schoolhouse was put to wider use than ever . True to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native arts than the others joined our faculty and helped with ivory carving , fancy skin sewing and making seal nets and hunting weapons . Evenings , the shop was turned over to the men and older boys for practical work such as ripping up ickory planks and making them into tog sleds . Along with teaching and housework , certain amenities were expected of Ruth as well as me . Clad , as usual , in conventional Es-Aimo garb  --  parka , skin pants , mukluks , sealskin mittens  --  our first social call had been a flop . It was n't her fault . Having crawled after me through the fetid tunnel entrance of a typical igloo and emerged into the still more pungent living quarters of a family of eleven cooking food , Eskimo style , the smells got Ruth . I could n't have blamed any white woman for crawling out again in a hurry . Nor did it cheer her to remember that the scent of white people was just as repugnant to them . .5 It was n't a matter of downright per : sonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . Well . reasonably so . But soap was costly and hard on the skin in that rig , orous climate , and the various blubber oils they used instead enveloped them in a reek that would " get " anyone at first . For some time the visiting job fell on me . Postscript to Emily Post ? I Once accustomed to the smells , I found Eskimo home life not only interesting but enjoyable ; even the taste of seal oil which permeated all t heir cooking  --  although it usually helped to be hungry . Nothing pleased them more than to have me stay for a meal . When I did , I was always impressed anew by the fact that their dining etiquette , which would have given Emily Post a headache , was based on rules quite as inflexible as our own . Squatting on an igloo floor with the family meal in a single , hollowed-out driftwood dish between us , my host would pitch right in without showing the slightest concern for me , in order to prove that his food was safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five minutes , unless I remembered to show my confidence by pitching into the boiled seal or dried walrus meat too . On state occasions we might even top off with Eskimo ice cream , called kamamock , made of frozen reindeer fat shaved fine , creamed with seal oil and flavored with bitter black berries out of a seal poke bag . An ice-cream sunlae made with cod-liver oil would ' taste similar . Try it . When Ruth and I entertained in turn , we began to understand what an acquired art is that of the fork . Our guests regarded forks as dangerous novelties , and were actually afraid of jabbing their faces . It always worried us . Only after they had extracted mysterious tin cans from beneath their parkas at the end of the meal and honored us by carrying home all the left-over scraps could we ever be sure that our dinner had been a success . We had ordered a little tin wind-up train and other toys sent from Teller by dog team for Christmas . Whatever happened . Skooker wouldn't. lose out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real community affair . First , a Christmas tree ; a problem in itself on that barren coast . We made one from an old pole , with tissue-covered wires for branches and fringed crepe paper for pine needles , the tips held up by black threads strung from above . Decorated with popcorn strings and colored-paper ornaments  --  courtesy of Ruth 's " domestic science " class  --  the result was pronounced by Percy Ipalook , " The prettiest tree I 've ever seen . " The Night Before Christmas Festivities were to start in the small hours of Christmas Day , with carols sung before each igloo and hut . For weeks we had been training a chorus picked from the missionary 's choir . Like all Eskimos , their tones were good . And how they loved to sing ! If some woman kept right on while 11 LIMing her baby , it was no more than we 'd seen them do in the church choir on Sunday . Unfortunately , the night before Christmas brought so bad a storm that early morning caroling was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemble at . the schoolhouse , as planned . Only the missionary and one other Eskimo , seeing a lamp burning in our quarters , struggled through . We celebrated just the same . First . I stoked the stove to cherry red . Then , after Ruth made some coffee and sensibly went back to bed , we three men sat on the floor , with howling blasts shaking the whole building , and drank coffee and munched graham crackers and played with Skooker 's tin train until a faint hint of gray marked the arrival of Christmas , 1934 . The real celebration was scheduled for that afternoon in the schoolroom : A pot-lurk feast , to be followed by a program . Everyone in the village had contributed some small , much-wrapped gift , which , with what few we added Ourselves , loaded the platform and insured presents for all . But imagine our embarrassment  --  particularly Ruth 's  --  when the families began arriving without a sign of food ! We were furnishing a tub of doughnuts , two of popcorn balls and a whole wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing our share . Our guests sat around in awkward silence until apparently convinced that we had nothing more to offer . Whereupon , with broad , friendly grins , they pulled out hidden containers of food from beneath their parkas and gathered in family circles to crunch frozen fish , bones and all , eat dried walrus meat soaked in blubber oil or devour other delicacies suited to the day . Afterward , wizened old Oonalik , the tribe 's sole surviving medicine man , played Santa Claus . Ho made a unique Santa . Gorgeous in a red costume trimmed with at least 8100 worth of white fox furs , and with gray wig and whiskers from a reindeer 's belly , he jingled his dog-sled bells and 76 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST F  --  or , iiiary 13 , nu , started the program with a dance curiously like a Japanese beggar dance I once saw in Kobe . Feet wide apart , knees bent , he stomped and cavorted about as if to imitate a reindeer , at the same time keeping tip a patter in Eskimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in without knowing why . We learned afterward that the old boy was merely ridiculing the notion of any sensible reindeer venturing so close to a village . From his monkey-faced hilarity that day , one never would have guessed how worried the old man was over a consumptive wife whom he adored . It was this same Oonalik I later sent to Nome by dog team for a badly needed operation . His case was desperate . Yet , suffering as he had for weeks , he would n't leave his sick wife . Persuaded at last , he declared it was only because of his friendship for me . The Driftwood Cure for Flu Then , when he was cured , it was who had to tell hint that his wife had just died from a sudden hemorrhage which no one could have prevented . Crushed , he never quite forgave me for having argued him into forsaking an-cient charms and incantations for modern surgery . / did n't blame him . But Ruth and I had troubles of our own . On January 17 , 1935 , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have had working at least a month ago , we just received his mail , badly damaged . And then they sent no equipment for setting it up in working order . Now we 'll have to wait another month . I suppose I 'll get caught here with no help at all ! Bill is beginning to read up more on obstetrics . We 'll surely get . the radio working in time though . " Next , rumors of a flu epidemic , filtering in from other isolated tribes along the coast , threw our Eskimos into near-panic . Still vivid were memories of 1918 , when , out of 500 , some 300 of their number had been wiped out by the same disease . No wonder they hesitated now before even letting the dog team stop with monthly mail . The Shishmaref tribe farther north was reported to have met the driver with loaded guns . Having learned something of Eskimo psychology , I realized that any sign of illness now would drive them into their igloos and huts , resigned to fate . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could try to laugh them out of their fear or scare them out of it . We decided to scare them . I called an emergency council meeting in our living room that night . " The tin is corning , " I said , ' and when it does , you 've got to keep warm . That means driftwood . More than you 've ever gathered before . Keep everybody bringing it in . " So the whole village started hauling driftwood like mad , often going as far as thirty miles to find it . If a frightened Eskimo came to me with stomachache or It cold  --  possibly the first stage of flu  --  I 'd give Lim a pill on general principles and send him out after more driftwood ? " before the flu comes ! " Numerous deaths occurred along the coast that winter , but our people escaped with only a few light eases . Working hard in the open air , they were always too busy preparing for the worst to recognize it when it crime , I had plenty of doctoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our records showed more than 100 treatments a month . Most were minor ills . Anything serious meant hours poring over medical books , trying in our ann . teurish way to identify queer spots in the throat , or what have you ? One of my most startling experiences was he , ing called at the birth of twins , only to see the mother cheerfully give one to an Eskimo neighbor who had no chill dren of her own . Our living room was crowded on council-meeting nights . While I seri &; bled down the proceedings interpreted by Robert Mayokwok , Ruth would escape to the kitchen to try , often vainly , for a wink of sleep . Our meetings were loud and long-winded . But decisions , once reached , were sensible , if sometimes unique . There was , for example , the case of a young Eskimo mother who refuse ' to name the father of her unborn child . My notes begin : MAGISTRATE : : We did n't call in for nothing . In this trouble what I speak is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council to answer me truth . I 'm riot honest man myself but or of it . But tell the truth or answer me I ask . Gnu , : I has told it before , but he did n't understand what I talk about . MAGISTRATE : In this kind of trouble there 's always more than one . Who e the one who do it , for we do n't know ? Tell the name . After hours of fruitless cross examination , not one but six young men of the village were each ordered to pay the girl two reindeer a year and her child came of age . Had their ideas of justice sprung from The Mikado itself , our couneil could n't have tried more earnestly to " let the punishment lit the crime . " Witness the sod ease of a village ne'er do-well named Ongtowasruk , who dwelt in a drafty board shack with seven or eight goose-pimply children and a wife whose acute bronchial condition called for plenty of heat . Alaskan Justice He had let his fuel pile reach tie vanishing point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of driftwood . Traveling , far down the coast , he ran into a blizzard severe enough to roll his dogs over . But there , directly ahead , was a reindeer corral . Knowing that he 'd hats to go at least twenty miles farther fur more wood , he helped himself to s couple of driftwood poles . Days afterward , by merest chance some village Sherlock Holmes spied rusty nail hole in a chip of wood hero Ongtowasruk 's shack . The council met , traced Exhibit A to its corral source and pronounced sentences of luckless Ongtowasruk . He must replace those few pieces stolen from the corral with three full cords of wood for fuel at roundup time . It took the pool fellow a month to complete the job . At our Friday-night " hops " ? and use the word advisedly  --  most of the village would sit on the schoolroom floor , musicians at one end , armed with drums resembling barrel lamer with walrus-bladder hides stretched over .

Presently another would join in . The tempo , slow at lirst , quickened until it became a sort of frenzy wheel brought every muscle into play . I have seen the best of them get a complete workout in two minutes  --  gymnastics sadly missed during the dance-prohibition era . The women 's dancing which followed was just the opposite ; a thing of rhythmic grace . More , all Eskimo " girls " from sixteen to eighty seemed eligible . Seated on a low bench , they swayed from the hips up , torsos undulating to the beat of drums , their arms alone portraying the story . Only in Siamese temple dancers have 1 seen anything resembling it . By midwinter one team had acquired a unison as perfect as a Follies eborus .

Meantime , another mail  --  the great event of the month  --  came mushing through from Nome . It brought letters for our Eskimo children from far corners of the earth . It brought month-old mail for its from home . But no parts for our balky radio transmitter . Hard as it was to give up our plan of Ruth 's flying to the hospital whenever necessary , what could we do ? Sending her by dog team was out of the question . The mail itself often took ten days to cover those 150 miles . Even if we eat word by the driver , what word could we send ? It might be weeks before we 'd need a plane . Spurred by the uncertainty , I tackled that transmitter again , trying every known hook-up of wires and gadgets . But , without so much as a blueprint to go by , I could not make the fool thing work . Whereupon Ruth calmly announced that , plane or no plane , she would n't leave now anyway . Her mind was made up . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our daughter had the distinction of becoming the first white child ever horn at Cape Prince of Wales .

They would look her over in awe , then , turning to me with broad , beaming faces , exclaim : " all-ni-Ica ! Ah-di-ga ! In-nu-it nagon-rok . Qui-ynh-un ! " ( " So fine ! So wonderful ! She 's as good as an Eskimo baby . Thank you very much ! " ) Ruth and I named her Jo Evelyn , but I confess it brought lumps in our throats to be told that the old men of the village had solemnly christened her Kingekmiu  --  literally , " one of the Wales people . " We felt at last that we were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly spoiled with at tention from the very start . With Ruth 's quick recovery came new interest for her in everything . It was her previous condition alone that had made her so susceptible to those intimate details of native life to which I had grown accustomed . Even the smell of seal oil was no longer repulsive . She began visiting the Eskimos freely in their igloos , grew chummy with the women and found them gratefully responsive , once the shell was broken . unfortunately , they could n't help much when Jo Evelyn took sick in May . She scared us so badly that we made a cradle out of a cracker box and rushed her to Nome by umiak  --  a thirty-six-hour round trip through grinding ice floes . But it did the trick . Late in May , Naturo started opening up in earnest . Days grew longer . Often our thermometer rose to freezing or above . Dark patches of open water showed in the strait , making possible an umiak journey to the Diomede Islands , which the International date line passes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " tcroorrow " on the other two miles away .

But . its robbery feel and the way it squeaked between my teeth made me appreciate Ruth 's cooking more than ever when I returned to The Best , Laid Schemes- We donned goggles against snow blindness and got beautifully tanned trampieg the countryside . At such times we would leave Jo Evelyn with one of the women while Skooker and a hunch of his Eskimo pals slid downhill on a Polar-bear skin placed hair side down , the screaming crew invariably landing in a heap at I he bottom . The mothers encouraged l his sport , since the scrubbing that a bear skin got relieved them of a tedious cleaning job .

Fact wag , we should have felt financially sunk , except for the practical certainty of new con tracts . And so , waiting confidently for official notification , we drew our school year to a close , saw many of our older boys off to hunt seals and walrus with their dads , watched some of our girls hunt husbands at home .

Thanks to an EskiMo friend , finally sent word to the captain of a small freighter reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw a big American flag when he passed Cape Prince of Wales , going south , would ho please stop and pick up a woman and two children ? Then I got the promise of a little work beyond Cape Mountain , where some tin-mining operations , abandoned in winter , would soon start up . I could n't be quite sure that Ruth would leave if the freighter did come . But I got out the flag . For some reason , I never thought of fog . Yet there it lay over Bering Strait one morning , so thick you could n't see 200 feet from shore . Our signal was useless . And it was that same day , July 19 , 1035 , that a steamer 's whistle cut through the fog . Another blast , closer . Somewhere out there she was edging in , guided by the echo from Cape Mountain .

She followed with Skooker and Jo Evelyn , and I paddled them out to the waiting freighter with all our possessions  --  or all she had n't forgotten in the mad rush . The skipper lowered a platform affair to the water . They stepped on , Ruth holding the baby .
