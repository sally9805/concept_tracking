The most stay-at-home Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court , 75-year-old Bachelor James Clark McReynolds , last week stirred from his Washington apartment to attend an alumni banquet at his alma mater , Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tenn . What brought Alumnus McReynolds ( Class of ' 82 ) and 500 other alumni back to Vanderbilt was a long-awaited , long-dreaded piece of news . At 77 , their Chancellor James Hampton Kirkland , the Grand Old Man of Southern Education , was going to retire . <P> As tall , bald , stringy . as ever , the " Chance " seemed to many an alumnus no older . To Justice McReynolds he spryly observed : " I should be very glad if I could get on the same platform with you and run for President and Vice President . I have a suspicion that such a combination would be successful . " But his voice cracked as he recited to his guests : <P> My boat is moored upon the strand , My face is to the sea . I hold the tiller in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Next day the news overshadowed everything else at Vanderbilt 's commencement exercises , even an address by the Bank of England 's eminent Economist Sir Josiah Stamp , for not only had James Hampton Kirkland been the " Chance " longer than almost anyone could remember but his 44 years at Vanderbilt had spanned one of the most successful university presidencies in the U. S. <P> When James Hampton Kirkland of Spartanburg , S. C. , eight years out of the University of Leipzig , took over Vanderbilt in 1893 , it was chiefly because the bickering Methodist Episcopal bishops who ran it could agree on none but a dark horse candidate . Twenty years earlier Bishop Holland McTeyeire had extracted from his wife 's cousin-in-law , " Commodore ' ' Cornelius Vanderbilt , a $500,000 endowment . An unexpectedly dark horse , Chancellor Kirkland insisted on appointing his own Board of Trust to manage it . When the Church refused to relinquish control , Chancellor Kirkland broke its grip in Tennessee 's supreme court . Soon Vanderbilt 's were the first Southern classrooms to hear about Evolution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanderbilts and the General Education Board , Chancellor Kirkland replenished his faculty , secured in 1919 the General Education Board 's then record single outlay ( $4,000,000 ) to build a Medical School . <P> Chancellor Kirkland has always put Vanderbilt first ( current endowment : $28,000,000 ) . But more than any other Southern educator he helped to prime the flow of Northern money that has enriched such schools at Tulane , Atlanta and Tuskegee . And the voice of Southern education is the Association of Colleges &; Secondary Schools of Southern States which he founded in 1895 to step up admission requirements , arrange transfers , regulate athletic competition .
