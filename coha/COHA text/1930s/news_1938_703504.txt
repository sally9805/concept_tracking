txt The Queen Mary passed Bishops Rock at 1:42 P. M. today , establishing a record for the eastward crossing of the Atlantic of 3 days 20 hours 42 minutes from Ambrose Light , and clipping 1 hour and 25 minutes from the record Set by the French liner Normandie on Aug. 8 , 1937 . The average speed of the last day 's run from noon to noon was 32.07 i knots . The average speed front Ambrose Light to Bishops Rock was 31.69 knots . The time to Cherbourg was 4 days 2 hours 37 minutes . The Normandie 's average speed on her 1record eastward run was 31.29 knots Ito Bishops Rock . 1 The officers still maintain they had no intention of breaking the record , saying that it was all a matter of a good ship , good engines and good luck . When the ship passed Bishops Rock there- was no outward jubilation , not even a blast from the siren . Nor was there much relief for the weary , noncommittal officers , inasmuch as the ship pressed on to Cherbourg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was apparent to seasoned voyagers that , though the weather and sea were not bad , conditions were far from ideal for a record run . Hence it is possible that the Queen Mary may some day outdo even this magnificent record-breaking round-trip voyage . But there was no celebration , no popping of corks . Even when passing Bishops Rock most passengers were packing their trunks for the disembarkation at Cherbourg . The seeming indifference was explained by the earlier realization that a record surely would be made . The Queen Mary uses up about 300. tons of fresh water for her boilers daily . How much oil is consumed the line never gives out . Since some of the liners burn about six-tenths of a pound per horsepower per hour , the Queen Mary probably consumed around 1,200 tons of oil daily . Her turbines rated around 185,000 horsepower , but when the Queen Mary made her first voyage it was officially admitted that they could generate 200,000 . How much power was ' used on this voyage will never be given out , it is safe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum was not reached . The Queen Mary 's sixteen turbines drive four shafts at 3,600 revolutions , , a minute at about top speed . Gearing reduces this to 240 revolutions a minute for the propellers . Ship gossip has it that not more than 200 revolutions a minute were made on this voyage . Remarkably little vibration testifies to the effectiveness of the changes made after the early runs . The ship was in drydock in Southampton before the last westward record voyage . It is generally understood that the record runs are in the nature of engineering tests to gather data for the power plant of the Queen Elizabeth . Commodore Silent on Trip Wireless to TEE NsW YORK Mass . CHERBOURG , France , Aug. 14 . ? Commodore Robert B. Irving of the Queen Mary and other British of ; ficials seemed unwilling to talk about the record run of the ship when she arrived here at 9 o'clock tonight , nine hours ahead of schedule . Commodore Irving , who was very fatigued , excused himself when news men came aboard because he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take command on the night trip to Southampton . Newsmen , received by the purser , were told that the record both ways was a surprise to the crew as there were no particular preparations . It was stated that the Queen Mary had been overhauled before the westbound trip , but it could not be learned whether the engines had been revised and new propellers installed or any other important changes made in order to shatter the ? record . The chief engineer , William C. Sutcliffe , commented that the engines did extremely well considering the head winds . The ship 's officers would not say whether they would apply for the blue ribbon , but the chief engineer declared that the most important thing about this crossing was that it would furnish valuable information that would be used in installing the engines of the Queen Elizabeth , now under construction . Following are the official figures on the Queen Mary 's eastbound crossing : Left New York at 11 A. M. Wednesday , Aug. 10 , arrived at Bishop 's Rock today at 1:42 P.

SOUTHAMPTON , England , Monday , Aug. ** Queen Mary arrived at Southampton from Cherbourg at 2:52 A. M. , British Summer time , after a record-breaking eastward crossing of the Atlantic . The passengers are expected to land at 8 A. M. Increased Cost Cited Steamship managers said yesterday they did not think it likely that the French Line would try to get back the record from the Queen Mary for the Normandie for some time . It is estimated that the record cost the Cunard White Star Line fully 1,500 extra tons of fuel each way at $6 to $10 a ton . Experts said that every knot above twenty-eight for these two big ships means an increase of 50 per cent in the fuel consumption . Press Acclaims Achievement Special Cable to Tste NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Monday , Aug. 15 . ? The Queen Mary 's success in winning back the Normandie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic was acclaimed in all sections of the British press today . A typical headline was : " Queen Mary races to triumph . " Although the Cunard White Star Line continued to emphasize its lack of interest in the blue ribbon , The Daily Mail declared proudly : " The Queen Elizabeth , a. faster and bigger sister ship to the Queen Mary , will be launched next month and should be able to eclipse whatever reply may be made to the Queen Mary 's performance . " Several editorials , however , pointed out that the German seaplane Brandenburg 's successful round trip from Berlin to New York showed the competition the Queen Mary and other liners would have to face from the air in the near future . The Daily Herald , arguing that American lack of preparedness was delaying the start of passenger plane service across the North Atlantic , urged Britain to go ahead with a British service using a western terminal in Canada .                    @
