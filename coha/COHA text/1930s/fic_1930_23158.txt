THE OTHER ROOM A STORY BY DON MARQUIS D R. HARVEY HERBERT was not only an M.D. but a Ph.D . His familiars referred to him as a " psychological shark " ; but the world in general did not permit itself such slangy informality . What the world saw was a man who had attained an unusual position at thirty-eight years of age , who was acknowledged to be solid as well as brilliant , and who was spoken of with enthusiasm by his professional and academic brethren . Doctor Herbert specialized as a neurologist , but his private practice was not large , and it was not easy to get him to take a case unless it had some extraordinary feature which piqued his interest . He lectured on psychology in one of the universities and he had written extensively ou his subject . He was , among other things , a recognized authority upon criminology . He had devoted a great deal of time to the study of hallucinations . Some strange cases came to the attention of Dr. Harvey Herbert , cases involving very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of conscience often lay concealed under the surface of some mental trouble , just as a bit of broken needle may work itself through the flesh of the body for years causing physical disturbances difficult to diagnose because its presence is unknown . Doctor Herbert was a rather acutely conscientious person himself . But with all his exploration of the shadowy caverns of the subconscious mind , no case ever came to the attention of Dr. Harvey Herbert that was stranger than the case of . . . Dr. Harvey Herbert . It was one day last spring that Doctor Herbert called at the office of his friend Dr. Howard Yokes , after telephoning to make sure that Doctor Yokes had time for a lengthy consultation , and dropped into the big chair in front of Yokes ' desk , a picture of weariness . Vokes , a general practitioner and a lifelong comrade , looked at Herbert with keen eyes , noted his fag , and offered him a drink . Doctor Herbert nodded his acceptance . " Which one of my patients has been sneaking off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I 've sent anyone lately . " " None of them , " said Doctor Herbert . " I 'm here to consult with you about  --  about myself . " " Quit drinking , " said Yokes , with a smile , pouring a liberal allowance of whiskey into a glass for the famous psychologist . " Give up smoking , " he went on , pushing his cigarette case towards his friend ; " and have your teeth , tonsils , and appendix taken out at once ; take a trip to Bermuda , play golf more , raise violets , eat pineapples , and come back in three days and tell me how you feel . " But this facetiousness elicited only the feeblest of smiles from his famous friend ; Doctor Herbert was twisting his pointed brown beard with his slender fingers , his face and worried eyes averted . Doctor Yokes went on , seriously : " Stomach , Harvey ? Liver ? Kidneys ? Something in my line ? " " I wish it were , " said Herbert , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nerves . " " Consult the eminent neurologist , Dr. Harvey Herbert , " said Yokes . His remark was really a question as to why the specialist had come to a general practitioner to confer upon a case involving his own specialty ; and Doctor Herbert understood it so . He shrugged his shoulders and said in a tired voice : " I 've been to Dr. Harvey Herbert . The man does n't do me any good . " And then , after a brief pause , " Howard , you 're the oldest friend I have . " He paused again , and resumed , with a smile which made his face very attractive in spite of the ravages of his worry , " And , with the exception of my wife , about the best one , Howard . " The two men exchanged that glance of perfect understanding which is so much more eloquent than words . Presently Yokes suggested , " I suppose you 've been down in the sub-cellar of the human mind again , hunting your ghosts  --  and one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , " admitted Doctor Herbert . " You prowl into some queer , dank places , " said Doctor Yokes . " They almost frighten me . " " This time , " said Doctor Herbert , " I was frightened . I still am . I saw . . " His voice trailed off into a brooding silence . " What did you see ? " insisted Dr. Yokes . " Myself , " said Dr. Harvey Herbert . He shuddered , took another drink , and presently began . I 'm hoping that when I 'm finished ( said Doctor Herbert ) you and I may be able to get together and diagnose my case as something physical  --  but if we ca n't , at least I will have told everything to a friend . As a psychologist , I can assure you that there is sometimes great value in a sympathetic father confessor . And now that I 've said that word , I recognize that I am really coming to you for the assurance of absolution  --  an assurance that I 've not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago that I got the jolt I 'm still staggering from . You remember Aunt Emma Hastings , who lived with us for so many years ? Well , it was three weeks ago that Aunt Emma died . She was distantly related to both my wife and myself , although Margaret and I are not related to each other . Although we both called her Aunt , she was really a second or third cousin of Margaret 's grandmother ; she was connected , even more remotely , with my mother 's father . We were the only people left in the world who could by any stretch of the imagination be called kinsfolk . So we gave her a home , took care of her . I do n't mean that we took care of her financially . She was a great deal better off than I am . I 've grubbed for knowledge , rather than money , as you know ; always giving more time to research than to my practice . We took care of Aunt Emma Hastings physically ; and not even our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Aunt Emma tyrannized over us . Entrenched in invalidism , age , sentimentality , the habit of years , she was the very pattern of a petty domestic tyrant . Her death should really be a release and a relief to me ; hut , for reasons which you will gather , it is anything but that . The night she died Margaret and I had planned to go to the theater . We had dined early , and at a couple of minutes after eight o'clock I was waiting in the living room for Margaret , who was putting the finishing touches to her dressing . Getting out to the theater was more of a treat to Margaret and me than you might suspect , for Aunt Emma had grown increasingly querulous if one or the other , or both of us , were not with her . In fact , for some time had we foregone almost all social diversions . Margaret came in from her room , her face shining with pleasant anticipation , and I picked up my top-coat and hat . " Ready at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Murdock entered . Miss Murdock was Aunt Emma 's own attendant nurse , companion , and maid all at once . There had been a long succession of these companions . Aunt Emma seldom kept one more than six or eight months , and she had had as astonishing variety . But they were all alike in one thing  --  they seemed to enjoy the tyranny which Aunt Emma exercised over Margaret and myself and to relish the opportunity to participate in it in a minor way . Miss Murdock said , with a prim exterior , but with a certain latent gusto : " Mrs. Herbert , Miss Hastings sent me to inquire whether you and Doctor Herbert were going out to-night . " " Why , yes , " said Margaret ; " we 're just starting . Does Miss Hastings want anything ? I 'll go to her if she wishes to speak with me . " Miss Murdock became a composite picture of the petty malice of all her predecessors as she announced : " Miss Hastings said , in case I found you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . " " Not to do so ! " I exclaimed . I felt a flush of anger , a sudden red rush of itall over me . If my face looked like Margaret 's , I showed what I felt . This was a little too much ! " That 's what she said , " returned Miss Murdock ; and I saw the tip of her tongue run along her lips as if she tasted a creamy satisfaction . " She said , in case you were going out , you must give up your plans and stay at home . " With a triumphant glance , Miss Murdock started for the door . But she paused to give us her final thrust . " Since you will be here with Miss Hastings , " she said , " I think I 'll go out myself . " She left . Margaret and I sat in silent humiliation for a moment . The anger that had gone all over me seemed to culminate in something that writhed in my head  --  fluttered and writhed as if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere among the convolutions of my brain . I rose , with the words forming themselves upon my lips , " Come on , Margaret , let 's get out of here at once  --  she 's gone too damned far this time ! " But I did not utter those words . I saw something , suddenly , that made me pause . I saw another room , with Margaret and myself sitting in it . Listen carefully , Howard ; for just here is the beginning of the train of events that has brought me to you . I say I saw another room . I should have said I saw the room that we were in , or a part of it . Our own living room , and she and I sitting in it , dressed to go out for the evening , just exactly as we were . I saw it as if I were looking into a mirror , only it was dimmer than that , as if a fine gauze were in front of the mirror . No , not so much a gauze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat denser mist , a heavier fog , made a framework around the finer mist  --  a framework irregularly oval in shape . And through the medium of the fine mist I looked into a room which was the exact replica of the room in which Margaret and I actually were . I looked into it and saw ourselves there . Our apartment , as you know , is high up in one of the new buildings on the upper East Side . The east windows of our living room look out over the East River . The apartment , which is large , is one of the corner ones . The north windows of the living room overlook Fifty-Seventh Street . My first flickering notion , of course , was that I was seeing the actual reflection of our living room in the east windows , as in a mirror . But that comforting thought lasted only the merest fraction of a second . For I , Dr. Harvey Herbert , was standing up  --  and the man who looked just like me in the other room beyond the mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered my eyes with my hands . I have been , as you know , a student of the various phenomena loosely listed as hallucinations . I have had a certain amount of success in my attempts to analyze the mental states back of these phenomena . But I had had no previous experience of a personal nature . And I realized , in the moment that I sat there with my hands over my eyes , that it is one thing to attempt to diagnose the condition of a patient , and another thing to give an answer to one 's own problem during the time when it is actively presenting itself . That wriggling grub , about to become a butterfly , was still stirring in my head , trying to flutter his new , feeble wings ; and I thought when he went away , as he should in a moment , that would be the end of my aberration . Margaret spoke , and there was a struggle for kindliness in her voice  --  a struggle to regain the altitude of forbearance , love and pity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma . I knew from her voice that shewas not sharing my hallucination with regard to that other room . " Aunt Emma is n't so well to-night , Harvey , " said Margaret , " or I 'm sure she would have put her request in some other way . " " Yes , " I replied , trying to imitate Margaret 's spirit , trying to conquer the anger that possessed me  --  and that , no doubt , had brought on my queer vision ? " yes , she 's getting pretty old , and we must remember that she 's very fond of us . We 'll have to bear with her . " I had hardly finished speaking when I heard another voice  --  and it was Margaret 's voice , but yet it did not have in it the Margaret I knew . It said : She gets more spiteful every day ! She knows her power ; and the more childish she becomes the more malevolent delight she takes in playing tyrant ! " And then a voice answered  --  a voice that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey Herbert I had ever visualized in the full light of consciousness : " Cheer up , Margaret ! It ca n't last forever ; and if the old hell-cat does n't change her will before she dies it means fifteen thousand dollars a year for us . That 's worth a little trouble , is n't it ? " " A little trouble ! " said the voice of the Margaret whom I did not know , with a passionate vibration which I had never heard in the voice of the Margaret I knew . " You 're away , at your office or your lectures , most of the time , but I 'm here at home with her day and night . A little trouble ! It 's killing me ! " I tcok down my hands and opened my eyes . The other room was still there . The Harvey Herbert in it , and the Margaret in it , were on their feet now and were facing each other with a bitterness of face and tone that , surely , my wife and I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was still there , but it was not where I had first seen it . 1 had first looked towards the east wall of our real room , where the windows were that overlooked the East River . Now I was looking towards the north wall , where the windows were that overlooked Fifty-Seventh Street . I turned and looked towards the west wall , which had neither door nor window in it . The other room was there , too . I stepped to the middle of the real room and looked at the south wail , which had two doors in it and no window . The other room was there . I looked above me , and I looked up into it . I looked at the floor , and I stood upon the verge of it , opening below me . And the two figures were in it , the figures of Margaret and of me , walking and talking independently of us . Let me tell you just what it looked like again , Howard , so that you can realize something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . A thin , fine mist , and around it , framing it , a denser , heavier mist . Beyond the thin , fine mist , the other room . The opening in the thin , fine mist , framed by the denser , heavier fog , an oval in shape . I walked towards the oval entrance , towards the other room . It receded before me . It kept about ten feet ahead of me . When I turned it was still the same distance ahead of me . I went to one of the windows in the east wall and looked out . The other room was out there in the night , overhanging the water front ! I came back and sat down by Margaret . She was brooding . " Did you see anything peculiar ? " I asked her . She moved her head with a brief negative gesture , without looking at me . " Or hear anything ? " I asked . " Why , no , " she said . I was sure she had neither seen nor heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strained and puzzled , as if she hadalmost heard and seen something , if you follow me . The two people in the other room looked out at Margaret and me with a faint satirical smile upon their faces . I tried to ignore them , thinking maybe they would go away if I could get my mind off of them . No matter how much this interested me as a student , at the same time it was distinctly uncomfortable . I said to Margaret : " What are you thinking of ? " " I was thinking , what a poor lonely old soul Aunt Emma is , Harvey . " And as if in answer to this , the man in the other room turned to the woman in there and spoke : " Damn her ! She 'll live to be a hundred and ten ! " I made a gesture of repudiation  --  this creature , this vision , this person , whoever or whatever he was  --  did not speak for me , although he had somehow seized upon my appearance and my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aunt Emma like that ! And the man peered out at me with an immense , disconcerting knowingness . I knew that Aunt Emma had come into the room before I saw her . I knew it by the actions of the people in the other room . They leaned forward eagerly , and there was a tense , rapid interchange of low voices : " You see , " said the man , " she stumbles ! " " She totters , " said the woman ; " she 's getting weaker ! " Aunt Emma had , indeed , stumbled on the edge of a rug just within the door . Margaret and I ran to her and supported her to a chair and settled her in it . And as we did so , those other voices kept on : " She 's not really much weaker . She 'll live forever ! " " Perhaps  --  the mean kind always do ! " Margaret , leaning over Aunt Emma in her big chair , said solicitously : " Sha n't I get you a wrap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneering face and broke out in her high-pitched , feeble voice : " You 're mighty anxious about a wrap , Margaret ! But you were thinking of going out and leaving me practically alone -- with nobody but Miss Murdock ! " " But , Aunt Emma , " I began , reasonably , " Miss Murdock is employed to ? " " Do n't excuse yourself , Harvey ! " she interrupted . " Ca n't I see you were going out ? Ca n't I see your evening clothes ? " I could tell by the look Margaret gave me that she was schooling herself to gentleness  --  as she always did . I tried to imitate her . Margaret said , " Aunt Emma , we 're going to stay with you the rest of the evening  --  are n't we , Harvey ? We 'll go change to something else . " " No ! " cried Aunt Emma . " Do n't take off your evening clothes . I do n't want you to ! What do you want to take them off for ? Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as anyone you 'd see if you went out ? Eh ? " " But , Aunt Emma , I meant ? " " I know what you meant ! You meant to slip out and leave me alone , both of you ! It 's lucky I caught you in time ! lt 's lucky I have money of my own . I 'd be left alone , to starve , if I were poor ! I 'd die of hunger and neglect ! " Margaret and I looked at each other helplessly . Aunt Emma put her hands in front of her face and began to whimper . Margaret tried to soothe her , to take down her hands and pet her , but Aunt Emma resisted like a spoiled and spiteful child . In the other room the man murmured ; " This is to be one of Aunt Emma 's truly pleasant evenings ! " The woman over there retorted with vehemence , " This sort of thing happens a dozen times a day ! " I looked over Aunt Emma 's shoulder at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's not really crying , " said the man . " Pretense ! " said the woman . " She works it up at will . " " The old hell-cat ! " Aunt Emma lifted her head with a startled look , almost as if she had seen and heard ; and a puzzled expression , confused and puzzled , fitted across Margaret 's countenance . But neither of them had quite got it ; it was for me alone that the full perception of this phenomenon was reserved . " Aunt Emma , " said Margaret , soothingly ; " you know Harvey and I try to be good to you , do n't you ? " " You try to he good to my money ! " said Aunt Emma . " But I may fool you ! I may fool you yet ! It 's not too late to change my will ! It 's not too late yet to leave it all to charity ! " She spoke with a cunning leer . The man in the other room nudged the woman beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing just that , too , Margaret ! " Aunt Emma lifted to me a disturbed and pitiable face . She took one of my hands , she took one of Margaret 's ; she took them in both of hers , and she clung to us . For that moment , everything dropped from her except the expression of her dire need  --  her need to be loved . Her gestures , her manner , were infinitely pathetic . They were a plea for genuine affection . It was as if she had said that she was an isolated human spirit on the brink of the unknown , and that she dreaded the next step which she must take ; dreaded it , and must have our understanding , our kindliness , to go along with her . What she really said was : " Margaret . . Harvey . . you really do care for me , do n't you ? It is n't all on account of my money , is it ? " I was profoundly touched . All religion , all life , all art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of the human soul to break through its harrier of loneliness , of intolerable loneliness , and make some contact with another seeking soul , or with what all souls seek , which is ( by any name ) God . She pleaded and she clung . She said : " If you knew I had n't a cent , you 'd still be good to me , would n't you ? " " Yes , " I said eagerly . And , " Yes ! " said Margaret . Eagerly , and sincerely . And in that instant I know that both of us were grateful for the patience we had shown to the old woman through the years ; grateful that we had been able to rise above our frequent exasperation , to trample it down , and act and speak from worthier impulses . " If I lost it all . .. if I told you that I 'd lost it all , " said Aunt Emma , " you 'd both still be just the same , would n't you ? " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own emotion and thankful that I was conscious of nothing in me that did not move spontaneously with my answer . " Yes , " I said . But the man in the other room said to the woman there : " My God , you do n't suppose she 's really lost her money , do you ? " " No ! " answered the woman . " This is just one of her cunning spells . She can be as crafty as a witch ! " This , while they looked out of their room at the old woman in her agony ! I faced them sternly ; I was minded to denounce them , these figures , whatever they were , that had stolen the outer aspects of me and of my wife and spoke from sentiments we had never acknowledged or acted upon ! I was about to cry out to them that they didnot represent us , that they were not we . But I did not cry out . Again they turned upon me that faintly satirical smile , those faces informed with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep springs of knowledge ? I became confused , and did not speak to them . " I 'm hard on you at times , " said Aunt Emma . I have never found it very easy to face expressed sentiment , and now the old woman broke down into a mood that embarrassed me . " I 'm unjust , " she said , and there was no doubt of the genuineness of her contrition . " I do n't mean to be spiteful , but I know I am spiteful . When you get old , you get suspicious of people . " I tried to avert my mind from her self-accusations ; it is neither pleasant nor inspiring to witness any sort of dissolution , and she was dissolving into a self-pity that I found it harder and harder to face . " Suspicion makes us spiteful and unjust  --  and I 'm suspicious of everybody , " she went on . " Oh , I know I 'm not easy to live with , Margaret ! " There was n't anything to say to that ? God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and woman in the other room grinned at me with a touch of frank malice . My pity for her , momentarily clouded by my embarrassment at her own self-pity , returned . Presently Margaret said : " Do n't you think you 'd better go to bed now , Aunt Emma ? " At that she jerked herself up in the big chair she was sitting in , immediately all suspicion and meanness and snarling petulance again , and spluttered at Margaret : " To bed ? Why to bed ? Why do you want to pack me off to bed ? Oh , I know ! " Her pinched countenance was a mask of cunning malignance as she went on : " I know why  --  so you can talk about me , talk me over ! So you can speculate on how long I will live ! I know you ! I know what you talk about when I 'm not around . I know what you 've been waiting and hoping for the last ten years ! " She began to cry again . She stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that terrible appeal in her manner , terrible to witness , terrible to have directed towards one . " Well , you wo n't have long to wait now , " she whimpered . " The time 's almost come . " The tears ran down her cheeks in silence for a moment  --  those daunting , weak tears of the aged who accuse us and the gods because death can not be delayed so very much longer  --  and then she said , " You 'll get the money soon enough . " Distressed , Margaret said , " There , there , Aunt Emma ; you must n't go on like this . " " You 'll live ten years yet , " I added . It is one of the things one says . " If I thought she 'd live ten years ? " began the man who was peering out from the other room . " Well ? " cut in the woman beside him . " If you thought she would  --  what ? " " My God  --  ten more years like the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Margaret turned upon him fiercely and shot at him a tirade that mounted from step to step of bitterness : " You see it mornings and evenings ; but I have it all day long  --  and every day ! I 've had it for ten years . I go nowhere . I see no one . I have no pleasures . I have no friends . I 'm losing my youth . I 'm losing my looks . Harvey , I 'm losing my very soul ! I shed my life 's blood drop by drop to keep that querulous fool , that dying viper , alive  --  just merely alive ! I 'm tired of it  --  I 'm sick of it  --  I 'm wearied , wearied , wearied to the soul ! I 'm dying from her , I tell you , dying from her ! " She sank to a chair , shaken and pallid ; and there came a silent moment .. But something -- -a note that had been struck  --  the impulsion of occult wings . . . something . . . vibrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what are moments ? What is time ? Some theologians , some men of science , say there is no such thing as time ; that we live , always , in eternity . A moment is long , or it is short , because of the stuff that is packed into it . Can we , somewhere in illimitable space , somewhere in the valleys of infinity , catch up with old moments and live them newly again ? Well , I do not think we can ever again take out of a moment what we have put into it , even though we should catch up with it again . Am I speaking foolishly , Howard ? I want to cling to the moment before . . . before it had occurred . . . before what happened , did happen . I want to . . . Listen : for all the events of that night I can advance as good a theory as most psychologists . There are rational explanations for the phenomena I witnessed , and was a part of . I know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can write you a thesis on who and what he was , and why I saw him and Margaret did not ; I can discourse to you , as cleverly as anyone , on every angle of this case . But it is n't the mechanism of this thing that concerns me now . I am concerned with the things that lie behind the mechanism . I want to cling to the moment before . . before it had happened : what did happen . To the moment before what we call the conscience had become involved . Margaret said , " Come , come , Aunt Emma , you really should go to bed . " " I wo n't go to bed , " she said , with the pettishness of a small child . " I wo n't go to bed until I 've had my medicine . I want my sleeping tablets now . " " Where are they ? " asked Margaret . " In my bathroom , " said Aunt Emma . And Margaret went out of the room for them . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't Miss Murdock give you one of those tablets right after dinner ? " " No , " she said . And then , " I do n't remember . I want one anyhow ! My nerves arc on the jump . You 've got my nerves to jumping ! take one and nap here in the chair . " The man in the other room said in a low , speculative tone : " I suppose if one ever gave her the wrong medicine by mistake it would be called by some ugly name . " The woman answered him : " People like her never get the wrong medicine given to them by mistake , and never take it by mistake themselves . They live forever . " I turned and spoke to them , " There is a volition in your words , " I said sternly , " that is not my volition nor my wife 's volition . " " What did you say ? " asked Aunt Emma , looking about in bewilderment . " Nothing , " I answered . The two figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They looked at me steadily , levelly . Margaret returned with a small phial . I took it from her and examined it . " I 'm afraid she had one an hour ago , " I said . " I do n't think it is quite right to let her have another one so soon . They are what Dr. McIntosh prescribed , and they have a powerful , depressing effect on the heart if taken in excess . " As you know , IIoward , I did not treat Aunt Emma medically myself  --  you once had her case until you gave it up  --  and she has gone from doctor to doctor , always intimating to me thatshe had little faith in me . That was one of her ways of annoying Margaret and me ; but it was no real annoyance , as she did not come within the limits of my specialty . " You did have one right after dinner , did n't you , Aunt Emma ? " said Margaret . " No ! No ! " said Aunt Emma . With a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached and snatched the phial from me . She clutched it to her breast , in a childish triumph . " I did n't have one , " she said . " I will take one . You do n't want me to get to sleep ! You do n't want me to get any rest ! You want me to die ! " Her hands trembled as she hugged the bottle to her ; her jaw chattered , and her lips shook ; her victory in getting the bottle had made her all one tremor . I took hold of her hands , and tried to take the phial away from her gently . She grasped it with her crooked claws until white spots showed on the knuckles , and rocked herself back and forth . Her fingers were interlaced about it . " See here , Aunt Emma , " I said ; " you must n't be stubborn about this . I think you did have a tablet right after dinner , and another one now might be dangerous . " I used a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . Margaret interposed : " Do n't struggle with her , Harvey . Doctor McIntosh says the least strain is likely to prove fatal . " I knew that was true and released her hands . She had had a dilated heart some years previously , from which she had never really recovered . Emotional strain as well as physical strain was dangerous . " You want me to die so you can get my money , " she said , leering up at me from under her thin white eyebrows . Tentatively , I reached my hand towards her again . She suddenly grasped it and sank her teeth into it . And then she pulled the cork from the phial . I was in a quandary as to the right thing to do . If I struggled with her , I should almost certainly kill her . On the other hand , I was not absolutely certain whether she had taken one of the tablets previously or not . She had said she had n't . I had heard Miss Murdock speak of giving her one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't sure . I did n't know then what I should have done . And I did the wrong thing  --  I did nothing . It is easy enough now , Howard , to see that it was the wrong thing . It is easy enough now to say that I should have risked the struggle , risked killing her by the struggle . But I put it to you , man to man , how was I to know then that it was the wrong thing ? She shook two tablets from the bottle and put both of them into her mouth . " Not two , Aunt Emma ! " I cried . I actually tried to take them from her mouth , and I got myself bitten again . The situation was now changed , in a way that no one could have foreseen . Two tablets within the hour might not kill her ; but three almost certainly would . " Aunt Emma , " I said , " you did n't have one before , did you ? " She had closed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tablets , as if thoroughly exhausted by such struggle as there had been . Now she opened them again , and looked up at me with a look indescribably impish  --  impish and foolish , and puerilely triumphant . She rocked herself from side to side , and she said : " Yes ! " And then , " I 've had three , now , and I 'm going to sleep  --  you hateme  --  you both hate me  --  but you ca n't keep me from going to sleep . " And she leaned back in the chair again . " I do n't believe she did have three of them , " said Margaret . " She 's only saying that now to worry us . " " She says she did , " I returned ; " but she does n't know . I think you 're right  --  she 's probably only saying it to irritate us . I know she did n't . " She opened her eyes a little , opened and closed them , with a blink of cunning . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't known it  --  had n't been sure of it  --  hut evidently the man and woman in the other room had been sure of it . " She did have one before , " said he . " Yes , " said the woman ; " I know she did . " Margaret and I stood and looked down on the old woman , whose shaking agitation was now leaving her , who had now begun to breathe quite quietly , in a condition that was strangely helpless ; in a sort of suspension of the will-power . I can think now of several things that I should have done . But I give you my word , I could think of nothing then ; the only thing that filled my consciousness then was the desperate , working hope that she would not die . And while I looked down on Aunt Emma 's silent and shrunken figure I heard the man and woman in the other room speaking . Their voices were cool and quiet ; they came to me clearly enough , but they seemed to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the man . " Shall I see her die ? " " I should hate to look on while she died , " said the woman . " But she will die ; she is dying and I am looking on . " " She was very old . " " She was very old . She will be better dead . " " She has not died yet . " " She is breathing very quietly . Old people breathe very quietly . " " Old people die very quietly . " " And she is dying . " I heard this monstrous litany , and every fiber in my being was in revolt against it . But , for a time , it seemed impossible for me to speak or to move . I tried to combat , in my own mind , what they were saying in the other room . Aunt Emma stirred , feebly . Her eyes said that she wanted to say something . Margaret and I bent over her , and she whispered faintly : " Margaret . . . Harvey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . do n't you You really . . . really . . She relapsed , relaxed . Her head was slightly on one side . She did not speak or move again . Margaret said , with a note of alarm , " Harvey , she 's scarcely breathing ! She does not seem to be breathing at all ! " " If I had struggled with her , " I said , " it would have killed her . " The man in the other room spoke , " And now she 's dead because there was no struggle ! " Margaret cried out , " ' Phone for Doctor McIntosh ! I 'm alarmed ! " " Too late for any doctor , " said the man in the other room ; and the woman there echoed , " Too late ! - Margaret said to me , " Harvey , I 'm afraid . . I 'm afraid that Aunt Emma has left us ! " " Thank heaven , " I answered , " that we 've always tried to be good to her . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried to do my best . Poor Aunt Emma ! " For the pathos of her last words clutched at my heart . " Poor Aunt Emma ! " I said . Somehow I could not stop saying it for a moment ; I chattered it over and over again , " Poor Aunt Emma ! Poor Aunt Emma ! Poor Aunt Emma ! " " Fifteen iliousuid a year ! Fifteen thousand a year ! Fifteen thousand a year ! " chattered the man in the other room . I turned angrily and faced him . I wanted to have it out with him . For he was not I ! Oh , I know what had happened  --  any man in my profession knows what had happened ! In that other room I was seeing my other self . The part we all hide and deny , the ungenerous part , the selfish part , the hideous part if you will , had come up out of the caves of the underworld , out of the realm of the unexpressed , out of the repressed subconsciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell , in talking with you , on the mechanism of it  --  as I have said , the mechanism interested me far less than the things behind the mechanism . The man in the other room was compounded of all the unuttered things in my nature which I consciously disavowed , which I fought down , which I never permitted to get into the field of fact and deed . We have all fought them down or there would be no such thing as civilization to-day , not even the imperfect semblance of it which exists . But I cried out within myself , and I cry out to you now , Howard , that the man in the other room was not and is not the real I ! But he was saying that he was ! He was claiming to be ! It was his will that had triumphed here , for he had willed the old woman 's death ; while I , the conscious I , had fought against it . I cried out and I still cry out against the monstrous injustice that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thing that was his doing ! Are all the years when I was consciously kind , in spite of my exasperation , to count for nothing  --  all the years in which I fought down my irritation , all the years in which Margaret had acted , as I told her , like an angel ? We had had our ungenerous thoughts , our angers , our selfish impulses ; but we had trampled them under our feet , and was that light , that struggle , that victory , to be as if it had never been ? Was not the better part of us , whose deeds were gentle and considerate , to be accepted as the real individual , the real ego ? Werc these cold and selfish usurpers to be able to pretend that they were we ? Able to make us feel that , guiltily ? Is the fight towards decency , after it has been won , after its victory has been sealed and signalized by deed and fact , to be lost again merely because of the sneering assertion of these creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? Are the whispers and nods and looks of those cave men to impose on us and make us think that we are cave men again ? I protested , and I protest , that this can not be ! It is not merely my own case that have brought you , Howard ; it is the case of all men , of all humanity . I turned angrily towards the man in the other room with this protest rising to my lips . But again I was stopped from speaking . He was gazing down on the big chair in his room . Aunt Emma was in it  --  over there in the other room , beyond the mist . Her eyes were open , and she was looking out at me . On her face was the same faintly satirical smile as on the faces of the other two people in that room . Margaret was bending over the big chair in our room , weeping . Aunt Emma , from the other room , gazed on Margaret 's attitude with something like ironic amusement . Doctor Vokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his narrative . Then he said , " No , the case is scarcely in my line . " " Nor in mine , " said Doctor Herbert . " When I have considered everything that comes within the province of the psychologist , the essence of it all escapes me  --  the thing behind the thing . " " Why should a sense of guilt cling to you ? " said Doctor Vokes . " That sense should belong to the man in the other room . Ca n't you make him take it and keep it , and dive down with it into whatever strange and shadowy hell he came up out of ? " " He wo n't stay down there , " said Doctor Herbert simply , and with a despairing gesture . " He keeps coining up again , asserting himself . " There was another silence ; presently Doctor Vokes said , " And his assertion ? " He hesitated ; then murmured , " I suppose it turns upon the fact that , after all , he spoke and acted with a direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have thought several times I was rid of him , " he said ; " but he keeps coming hack . To-day I knew certainly that I was not rid of him . I discovered it when I found myself arranging with my lawyer to turn over Aunt Emma 's fifteen thousand a year to a charity , a home for old ladies . " " You did that ? " " Yes . For a few moments after the transfer was completed I felt a relief . And then there floated in front of me the face of the man who had been in the other room , with a quizzically sarcastic grin upon his lips . The expression said he knew just why I could never touch any of Aunt Emma 's money  --  he knew , that grin said . "
