He calls himself " the Vermillionaire " because of all bright colors he likes the reds best . Vermilion was therefore the predominant color in the most vivid art exhibition of the season which opened last week at New York 's Marie Harriman Gallery . On view were a succession of carefully drawn studies that might be landscapes , trees , sky , the ends of old houses and narrow streets , but were actually elaborately conceived studies in pure color , psychologically akin to the huge abstractions of Pablo Picasso . <P> No matter how gay the canvases , they paled beside the personality of the painter . Still unknown to the general public , Oscar Florianus Bluemner has been a pet of the U. S. art world for 25 years . His friends jammed the gallery last week . Fellow artists , retired critics , dealers , fell over each other in their eagerness to tell newshawks about his cat Jochen , his accent , his cigars , his career as portraitist , architect , bartender , philosopher . <P> Oscar Florianus Bluemner comes from Hanover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up a nice practice in Italianate brick churches in the south Tyrol . At the age of 18 Oscar Bluemner gave his first portrait exhibition in Berlin , shortly afterward won medals at the Royal Academy where he was studying painting and architecture . In 1892 an artistic argument with the All Highest , Wilhelm II , caused him to leave Germany suddenly for the U. S. For two years he lived in Bowery flophouses , working as a bartender when he could , selling packets of needles on the sidewalk at other times . <P> Then came a wave of prosperity . He resumed his profession of architect , practicing for 20 years in an office on Manhattan 's 42nd Street . As a painter he exhibited in the Armory Show of 1913 that introduced Matisse , Picasso and the French moderns to a baffled U. S. public . Since 1929 the Whitney Museum has bought three of his canvases . Since his architectural practice evaporated he has never made much money , but he has not lacked critical appreciation . <P> Now at the age of 67 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in South Braintree , Massachusetts " with his musical daughter Vera , his son Robert , a black cat and a pair of bluebirds . Forty-three years in the U. S. have not changed an accent that would make the fortune of any <P> German comedian . His enormous Gladstone collars generally have the patina of an ancient manuscript . He hates beds and regular meals , cooks what he wants when he is hungry and sleeps on the attic floor rolled up in a blanket . To counteract his habit of forgetting things his watch , his pocketbook , fountain pen , keys , etc. are attached to his clothes by an intricate system of safety pins and odd bits of string . He knows Goethe 's Faust by heart , writes and speaks Latin fluently , discourses familiarly on the philosophy of Nietzsche , Spengler , hates beer . <P> With the greatest of gusto and good humor he ceaselessly tries to explain his theories of the emotional value of color , and in particular his fondness for brilliant reds . Slow-witted listeners generally retire baffled , content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mean , are pure , shrewdly chosen , and form most decorative patterns .
