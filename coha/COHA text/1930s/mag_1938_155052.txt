At Lima , five German correspondents stalked out of a committee session in a huff when Dantes Bellegarde , Haitian delegate , declared that the Americas could not " possibly have anything in common with a nation that had reverted to customs of the Middle Ages . " <P> At Brussels , the German Ambassador refused to allow an Austrian singer and two German dancers to entertain the Foreign Press Association at its dinner until assurance had been given that Nazi newspapermen would not be humiliated by having to listen to Josef Schmidt , German-Jewish tenor , sing in German . Instead , Tenor Schmidt sang songs in French , Rumanian - and Italian - which made the Italian press attach hopping mad . <P> Most pointed gibes at Nazi Germany were made at the Anglo-American Press Association 's annual dinner in Paris last week . A playlet depicted an imaginary second Munich conference at which Mr. Chamberlain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2 p. m. next Saturday , " asked : " What would you have said , Adolf , if I had answered ' No ' when you asked for the Sudetenland ?
