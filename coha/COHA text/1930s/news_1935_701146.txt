txt Preferred dividend arrearages of approximately $14 000.000 are due stockholders of Deere &; Co .. J. I. Case Co , Oliver Farm Equipment Co. and MinneapolisMoline Power Implement Co . Holders of the common shares of these concerns have received no payments for the past few years when the bottom fell out of demand for agricultural machinery and the companies were forced to live on the liquidation of receivables . Outlook for the current year . however . is considerably brighter than it has been recently , and stockholders of certain preferred shares have a chance of receiving in 1935 more money than they have in the past few years . Much , of course , will depend on demand in the remaining three quarters of the year . but sk:olgood crops looked for and the farmer 's pocketbook in the best shape it has been in a long time , outlook for the farm machinery makers . at least at this early date , seems to be promising . Deere 's first dividend in 1935 was 20 cents a share on preferred , against 10 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters before that . The regular rate is 35 cents and Deere 's accumulation on the senior shares aggregates approximately $5,000,000 or $3.20 a share . Last ' Year 's Profit First Since 1931 Showing a profit last year of $379,734 , the first since 1931 . Deere was quick to share in the improvement which came into the farm equipment picture . Operations so far this year reflected a continued betterment . and there is at least an even chance that the next change in the preferred dividend payment will be upward rather than downward . It seems likely to assume that unless the company expected to maintain at least the 20 cent payment it would not have made the change in the first quarter this year . Maintenance of the 20-cent rate throughout 1935 would make this year the best for preferred stockholders since 1931 when the full rate was paid . In 1934 a total of 30 cents a share was received which compares with 20 cents in 1933 and 65 cents in 1932 . J. I. Case J.

Labor trouble , however . which has shut down its plants for nearly a month , has doubtless affected the company 's ability to cut clown its pre*erred arrearages in the immediate future . Case 's plants are located in a " labor hot spot " and the laws of the state of Wisconsin are not exactly sympathetic to industry .

Subsequent heavy charge-offs and large interest requirement to carry the loans have contributed importantly to the losses reported Despite the subnormal demand for farm machinery in the recent past , Oliver has substantially reduceu its bank borrowings and by the close of 1934 would seem to hay " written off the bulk of its inventory difficulty . $27 a Share Accumulations on l'rior Preferred Accumulations on the pi Mr preferred amount to slightly more than $5,000,000 or $27 a share and 3850,000 or $1.621 , a share on the convertible participating stock , evidenced by scrip , and representing unpaid cumulative dividends to January 15 , 1931 .
