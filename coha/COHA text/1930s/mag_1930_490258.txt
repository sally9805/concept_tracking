AVIATORS flew low over South- ern California , sprinkling artificial snow , and Christmas came to Hollywood . The false flakes , trickling gently down , took the thoughts of the unregenerate settlers hack to the New England winter of their yesteryear . What a picture  --  the warm snow , durable in the Christmas sun , the warm gaze and frozen hearts of the expatriates , looking homeward . There must have been a faction in the city government opposed to snow : there must have been a reactionary sunshine group . Even up to the last minute there must have been a movement afoot to spike the plans for : t snowfall , by substituting rose petals . SADDENED , we have just returned from a sentimental journey . The holidays set our heart , and our little nieces and nephews ' hearts , on Pfefferkuchen . Not just any old Pfefferkuchen , but the kind one used to buy at a little German bakery from a kindly plump woman in a big white apron . Of course , one might phone Charles or some place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons , but we wanted the tradition and the beaming German blue eye , so off we went to Yorkville , full of hope . Once , we recalled , both sides of Third Avenue teemed with small German bakeries in which the rites of spice cake and gingerbread began in mid-October . Now , in the whole journey from Fifty-seventh to Eighty-sixth , we came across nothing but bakeries with soda fountans and radios , delicatessens that sold bread , cake counters in lunchrooms . Not a bakery , nut one Pleffernuss that had n't Coale from a factory , not even a beam except from a pitying eye . A man in a cider Stuhe said they used to make Pfefferniisse in a place he knew of in Manhattanville but it had gone out of business  --  the implication being that it would go out of business . The best we got out of our expedition was a furniture-store window full of old-fashioned hassocks at ninety-nine Cents . L-rR favorite employee is the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia , who works for Bergdorf Goodman . Last week she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's connection with the firm , on a salary . This turns everything topsy-turvy and gets us mix-ed up . The first thing you know the policemen who watch the Bergdorf Goodman picketers will he giving them a lunch , the Duchess ( who also writes ) will he autographing fur coats , and Mr. Goodman will he selling apples . A we passed Broadway and Forty-third Street of an evening this holiday week and looked at the gay tree , and listened to its triple-loud loudspeaker , we could not help wondering just how much of a raucous hullabaloo is necessary to announce peace on earth in Times Square . THE high fever of New York 's noontime is not entirely a matter of the blood , we realize . It is partly a matter of restaurant economics . Even though a New Yorker finds it difficult temperamentally to linger , like a Frenchman , over his luncheon table , in many restaurants he also finds it impossible physically . We lunched at a familiar place the other noon and were not in the slightest hurry . Indeed , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , seemed to catch our serenity , for she failed to show us much attention . The hostess observed this , and pretty soon she was raising the roof in her attempt to get some food pushed into our complacent maw . Turnover is the thing . We quickly fell in line , gulped down a bite of something , and got out  --  making room for the next American . WE have just received an announcement of the Associated Writers , a group of people who will write anything you want written . They are just like a business house  --  they even have salesmen out on the road selling the unfinished product . It occurs to us that this may prove a solution to our own prohlems : Heaven knows there are lots of things we want written , if we could just come to terms with somehas done the most for the promotion of apples during the year . Mr. Sicker has won eight of the cups . The most conspicuous thing in Mr. Sicker 's office is a painting of Queen Marie holding a yellow apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wall . Mr. Sicker says the apple people brought her over here really . We're. not quite clear on how they did it . N.Ve were shown a scrapbook of clippings of newspaper stories about apples . It contained , pictures of prominent people holding or eating apples ; Tom Heeley , Mayor Walker , Marilyn Miller , Mrs. Ira Nelson Mewl-is , Senator Wadsworth . Clippings about Mr. Sicker 's present apple venture have come in from Liverpool and Australia , from Kansas and Nebraska . It 's a national movement , we learned . Apples are being sold by the jobless in all the big and medium-sized cities of the country now . It helps the apple business , of course . This will he the biggest apple year ever , probably , and hot for Sicker 's idea millions would have rotted unsold . The market was glutted . Boxes of Northwestern beauties now selling for two dollars would have sold for one or less . Half a million boxes of apples have been sold in Greater New York alone in the past tight weeks . Sicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed , the benefit to them seems tangible . Ten thousand men have subsisted on the profits of apple sales in New York , for instance . They make about two dollars a box , so their gross profit has been a million dollars , or an average of one hundred dollars each . That 's twelve-fifty per week ; which will do , apparently . As a matter of fact , more than half a million boxes have been sold , because some of the men buy their apples in the regular wholesale markets . Sicker had a rule of two hexes to a man per day but this was enforced vaguely . Some men were known to sell ten boxes , at a profit of twenty dollars . No check at all is kept , of course , in the regular markets . The men get their apples in a chilly room at Desbrosses and Hudson Streets . We went there and saw a million boxed apples stacked on the concrete floor . It was noon and there was n't much doing . Only a dozen vendors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They get to their places of business by taxicab . The apple stunt has been an aid also to the owners of antiquated taxis who ca n't compete with the new luxurious ones . They take the apple men around for from fifteen to twenty-five cents each , several at a time . While we were there a cab started off with three merchants and nine crates of apples . Corners are not allotted by anyone in authority . This led to difficulties at first but now possession of locations is recognized generally . Mr. Sicker settled the argument as to what varieties are sold . Jonathan and Mclntoshes were at first , but their season passed and now it 's Winesaps and Spitzenburgs . Information rr HE Times naturally is highly effi- cient at giving out information . The other night a gentleman was awakened by the fire engines , whole squads of them apparently , roaring and screeching in his neighborhood . Full of excitement , he telephoned the Times and asked where the fire was . At once its exact location was given him . " Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated and then asked " Where are you now  --  in bed ? " The gentleman , a little surprised , said he was . " Well , " said the Times , " I 'd stay in bed , then . This fire certainly wo n't be worth getting up for . " Signs A FELLOW reports a sign in a I Sixth Avenue barbershop , in the Forties , reading : " Selling Out . Haircuts Ten Cents . " He did n't inquire about it , but concludes it is a subtle satirical comment by the barber on several of his business neighbors who are always selling out , have been doing so for years . Another sign which might cause speculation is in the window of the Hudson Storage Warehouse far west in Forty-third Street . It reads : " Bargain Sale of Husbands . " We can explain that . It does n't mean anything . Mr. Flint , who runs the warehouse , found the sign in the effects of a theatrical troupe which stored its stage sets at his place and never came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , just for the fun of the thing . It has been there twenty-two years now , and Mr. Flint has n't laughed over it for a long time , although an average of four or five people will stop in to inquire about it daily . These callers help break up his day and , moreover , some of them linger and get interested in the unclaimed furniture he sells on the ground floor of the warehouse . He has the sign touched up every few years , when the paint begins to fade . Al nu Ben Einstein THE celebrities tell us that of late there has been a revival of interest in autograph-collecting ; they 're bothered nearly everywhere . The autograph people were after Einstein when he was here , naturally , and with some success . One youth hung around the entrance of the scientist 's cabin all one morning without getting a chance at his hero , until he got an inspiration when he saw a messenger boy bearing flowers admitted without question . He rushed off the boat , bought a dozen cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and asked " Who sent you with those ? " he replied firmly : " My boss . " That passed him . Mrs. Einstein met him , accepted the flowers , and offered to sign for them . At this the fellow confessed . Mrs. Einstein called her husband and told him about it . The scientist laughed and wrote his name for the visitor . A German who used to live in Schbneberg , not far from the Einsteins , also got the scientist 's signature . He was stopped outside the cabin , but when he pleaded that he was from Schiineberg , he was announced to Mrs. Einstein , who said he might sit at a nearby table and look at the great man . He did so , and made a sketch of Einstein . The latter saw him at it and smiled and this emboldened the German to walk over and exhibit the sketch . He mentioned he had been practically a neighbor and Einstein signed the drawing . He also wrote a little poem over his signature . " Maybe the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " said her husband , " I 've written it near the bottom of the page so he can tear it off if he wishes . " ' We did n't get the wording of this poem but we did get one of Einstein 's rhymes . He likes to write them , incidentally , and does them rather well offhand . The one we have he wrote for Hendrik Willem Van Loon , who was on the ship with him and gave him sonic pointers on talking over the radio . It goes , freely translated : " Perfect in English is Herr Van Loon , who helped me well with the microphone . " At a reception given here for Einstein , a maid named Elfreda also got his autograph . She was so awed by his presence that she did n't bring in the refreshments at the proper moment . In fact she did n't bring them in at all until after she had carried through a desperate plan . This was to bring the distinguished man a piece of folded paper on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was hearing a message and did nothing . Einstein unfolded the paper and found it quite blank . " Sign , " hissed Elfreda , blushing , and he did . Milk and Water IF you were n't shivering too violently , you may have noticed in the Army-Navy game program the advertisement of Hertn.s of Paris , showing a beautiful big flask . We hear that the Salvo tion Army , for whose benefit the game was played , objected to advertising a liquor flask in the program and tried to keep the ad out . Finally the Frowert Company , advertising agents for HermCs , persuaded the Salvationists to let it go through , pointing out , rather brightly , that the flasks were intended to be used for milk and water : it was only in a few isolated cases of depravity that they were used for liquor . The agency 's argument was borne out by the picture of the flask itself , which clearly showed the words " Milk " and " Water " engraved neatly thereon . Even the Salvation Army has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate the business of Mr. I. Davis , the broken-doll mender of the town . In his shop in lower Sixth Avenue he has mended more dolls this year than ever before  --  and he customarily mends about three thousand in the few weeks preceding Christmas . We never realized , before talking to him , what intense feeling people have about dolls , and what jams whole families get into sometimes over a sick doll . A year ago Christmas Eve Mr. Davis received a phone call from a distressed father in Malverne , Long Island . " My wife is a wreck , " the man cried , " my little daughter is a wreck , I am a wreck , Christmas is going to be a wreck . I will give you anything you ask if you 'll let me bring this damn doll in tonight . " The man came in , and Mr. Davis revived the doll before midnight . One large doll shows up at the Davis shop every Christmas to be redressed and cleaned and to have her hair done . She is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion of a bachelor , aged sixty-five , who seats her at table with him when he dines , and likes her to look nice . While we were in the shop we saw a doll that had been in a family for eighty years , during which time its torso had gradually disintegrated . Mr. Davis likes problems like that , for the doll 's checks were still pink , her hair still beautiful , and her position in the family still unchallenged . The basement , where the operating table is , seemed to us to be in a fine state of disorder  --  legs , arms , torsos , and heads scattered about . From one curlier , eyes stared at us , just eyes . It is always a minor miracle how a shop like that picks up its business  --  you would n't think so many people with broken dolls would know about the white-haired surgeon of Sixth Avenue . Some of the dolls come from distant points  --  sent by people who knew Davis ' skill when he was located in Detroit and was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the trade knows about him . It is literally true that he can fix any dull , no matter how far gone it is . Dulls that have been silent for years have his shop saying " Mamma . " This Culture AFTER much struggling with serv- ants , a young house mistress came upon what she concluded was a jewel , colored , named Bessie . She was recommended as neat , painstaking , and industrious , and she seemed to be pleasant and willing ; and she said she was n't particular about having days off . " Alt aim ' much to gad about , " she said , " ' ceptin ' I like to get off now and then to go to the Metropolitan . " This seemed surprising but laudable to the lady . In fact , it impressed her deeply . " Do you go there often ? " she asked , hoping that the reply would reveal whether it was the opera or the museum that Bessie visited . " Well , " said Bessie , " I'se been goin ' there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to see an ' evvy time he 's out . I - got to get him to change the beneficiary of mah life insurance . " ? " Where did we ever get the idea we loved children ? " y uLETIDE speakeasy scene : Policeman enters , goes up to bar , and ? says heartily to owner : " Merry Christmas . " Owner punches " No Sale " key on cash register , takes out hill , hands it to policeman , and says , nut quite so heartily : " Merry Christmas . " Policeman exits to continue his rounds . Lessons of the Master THERE are darn near as many philosophers in town  --  visiting philosophers  --  as there are apple men . Gurdjieff , Orage 's master , is one of the latest to stir up aesthetes and ladies who think deeply . Unlike Tagore , who is old and a little tired , Gurdjieff is only sixty-seven , muscular , and vital . He is here from Fontainebleau , where , eight years ago , in a chateau once owned by Dreyfus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man . The French government gave the chrttuau to Dreyfus as compensation , Dreyfus gave it to his lawyer out of gratitude , and the lawyer gave it to Gurdjieff out of admiration . After two years he had an automobile accident and gave up the Institute , but he still has the chateau . The philosopher expects to he here for a month or more . Every night in Studio No. 61 at Carnegie Hall some one of his disciples reads a few chapters from the Master 's honk ( admission two dollars up ) , upon which he has been at work for seven years . It is called " Beelzebub 's Tales to His Grandson , or an Objective Criticism of the Life of Man . " Gurdjieff sits near the platform during the reading , smoking and watching the audience , which is generally made up of forty or so people , some of them unusual-looking . His own English is not so good . A man who listened to one of the readings could n't get enough out of it to get a hold on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Yale , about the theory or belief of the Master and was told that Gurdjieff does not advance theories or beliefs , but that everything is his private knowledge . Gurdjieff and his party , which numbers nine or ten , have several apartments at 2 ( 14 West Fifty-ninth . When he is bored with one apartment he goes to another . When he is bored with them all he goes to a Childs restaurant . He usually spends a couple of hours every morning in the Childs in Columbus Circle and a couple of hours every afternoon in the Childs at Fifth and Fifty-fifth , drinking coffee , observing life , writing metaphysics . He never eats in these restaurants , just has coffee , for he cooks his own meals , and excellently , too , they say . Despite his accident , Gurdjieff still likes motoring . He drives himself . Several times he has led a small caravan of cars filled with his followers out of New York . He has no objective , just turns into any road he feels like taking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonica , the other cars stop and wait until he has finished . At Fontainebleau Gurdjieff usually entertains forty or fifty people Saturday nights with a bath , a feast , and dancing lessons . The bath is a sort of super-Turkish bath which puts one in fettle for the feast and the dancing . Gurdjieff weighs two hundred pounds but is surprisingly light on his feet . Occasionally he makes his pupils lie on their hacks while he steps from stomach to stomach without hurting anyone . Fault PING-PONG purists have been up in arms about the Theatre Guild play , " Roar China ! " There is a ping-pong game in the first act , from which Mr. ViIliam Gargan ( the Mr. Hall of the play ) is shown to emerge victor . The ping-gong purists say he emerges nothing of the sort . They say his serves are illegal . He always serves overhand . - ? just stands there and serves fault after fault .
