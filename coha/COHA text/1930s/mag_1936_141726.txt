Fifty years ago in southern Indiana lived an Orange County farmer named Ballard , who had five sons . One of them , Edward , early showed enterprise . He used to deliver the laundry which his mother did for people who were taking the cure at neighboring French Lick . Soon he was graduated into a saloon in adjoining West Baden , next became a croupier in a gambling room run by a Negro in the West Baden Springs Hotel .

After a decade or so more , he bought Brown 's Hotel in French Lick and converted it into a gambling casino , known thereafter simply as " Brown 's . " <P> Situated across the street from the great French Lick Springs Hotel belonging to Indiana 's late Democratic Boss Tom Taggart , Brown 's prospered . Spring and autumn , businessmen and politicians of the Midwest flocked to French Lick to drink Pluto water , rest , golf , enjoy themselves losing money at Brown 's . Illinois ' politicians still confer there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament , but in running his casino he was shrewd and businesslike .

Y. ) , and he and his wife were enjoying their usual autumn holiday at Hot Springs , Ark . In a bedroom of the fashionable Arlington Hotel he met the one-time associate of his Florida days , Silver Bob Alexander . That afternoon the double zero of life 's roulette wheel came up for Gambler Ballard : Alexander , 33 , was said to be down on his luck , bitter against Ballard , whom he had unsuccessfully sued for $250,000 for breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next room , was struck by a piece of plaster when a bullet crashed through the wall . When detectives broke down the door they found Ballard seated in a chair with a bullet through his heart , Alexander dying , a suicide .
