Unlikely to forget the Johnstown Flood of 1889 is Jacob Leonard Replogle , potent retired U. S. steelmaker . The direct result of the flood upon 13-year-old Master Replogle was that he was carried several miles downstream , clinging to the onetime roof of his onetime home . The indirect result was that , his family penniless , he entered the steel industry as an office boy for Cambria Steel . Rapidly he climbed , his invention of a thread-rolling machine giving him additional impetus . In 1916 , a director and member of the executive committee , he was instrumental in selling Cambria 's control of Midvale Steel &; Ordnance Co . <P> During the War , every order of steel , for any purpose , had to have his approval . In this capacity he performed many a notable feat , great among which was the lowering of the price of steel plate to 3 per pound against 12 before government control . For his work he received the U. S. Distinguished Service Medal , awards from Italy , France , Belgium . He likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused their plea , thus helped change the line of fashion . In 1919 he organized Vanadium Corp . of America and Replogle Steel Co. the latter being succeeded three years ago by Warren Foundry &; Pipe Corp . Lately , however , he has been in practical retirement although he is a special partner of Harris , Upham &; Co . But last week the name Replogle again figured in the steel industry of the world . <P> Great Britain , eager to strengthen its industrial position , has vigorously pursued a policy of rationalization by merger . From the first it was known that the Bank of England , guided by able Rt . Hon. Montagu Collet Norman , instigated most of these deals . Recently the Bank , through a holding company , actually entered the industry and subscribed for 25% of the stock of the $30,000,000 Bankers Industrial Development Co . ( TIME , June 2 ) . <P> Last winter Mr. Replogle eyed this British situation . He made a comprehensive study of it , conferred with Britain 's iron-masters and political-masters . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , details of which became known for the first time . <P> In his report he mentions the growth of the steel industry in France , now the world 's largest steel exporter , mentions England 's decline from its former steel prestige , exhibits lengthy statistics on world steel . Daringly he especially attacks the cherished British policy of primogeniture and " family management . " <P> Summarizing the plan are six points . Two are generalities on why Britain should do something about its steel . The others are specific . Mr. Replogle says practically all English blast furnaces are obsolete and should be scrapped , supplanted by modern furnaces of 1,000 tons a day capacity . The present average capacity of British blast furnaces is a paltry 120 tons . The largest type of Koppers or other by-product coke ovens are a necessity . Immediate attention should be given to semi-finished products , now com posing 60% of Britain 's steel imports . A main plant should be located on seaboard . <P> Although the U. S. exports much steel to Britain , Mr. Replogle is no expatriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invigorate world trade .
