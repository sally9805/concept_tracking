txt Will Rogers Finds Signs Of Better Times in West To the Editor of The New York Times : SANTA MONICA , Calif. , April 3 . ? Plying through Phoenix , Ariz. , this morning and an old boy standing there that I got to talking to , as I always do , as to how things were going . He said they shipped 190 cars of lettuce out of that one valley yesterday . Now a carload of lettuce is considerable lettuce , but 190 cars . And at a good price . Talking to a cattle man in Claremore yesterday . He had just shipped a bunch of steers to Kansas City and netted $128 a head . Three months ago he tried to sell ' em for $30 . These just show you how quick your business can change . Now , a sheep man wires me that mutton has n't gone up . Now I do n't want to be caught helping out a sheep man , but it sounded like he may be right . Yours , WILL ROGERS .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
