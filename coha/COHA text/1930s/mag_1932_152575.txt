The Protestant Episcopal Church is discreet and polite , maintaining toward other sects an attitude of quiet , slightly superior neighborliness . Last week many an Episcopalian was startled to read in The Churchman a statement that " the Episcopal Church is not making the most of , indeed is barely touching , its opportunity in the Mormon field . " In Utah there are 337,200 Mormons . The Roman Catholics , second in Utah with some 19,000 communicants , have for some time been working to build themselves up in the West ( TIME , July 18 ) . Utah Episcopalians number about 3,000 . The Churchman 's article points out that " seven large counties in Utah alone-and when a western county is large it is large- have no non-Mormon church of any kind , and there are hundreds of communities where there is no regular preaching of the Christian Gospel . . . . " The breakdown of Mormon theology in the light of modern education , the drifting agnosticism of the younger generation . . . the respect and confidence of the Mormons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormon youth through their doubts into a better and more modern and spiritual faith . . . . " If the church could begin an itinerant work in Utah ... it would be a movement which . . . would . . . build up a Christian force in these intermountain sections , which will become agnostic unless we do this . It is peculiarly our job because through the past we have built up a feeling of trust and confidence . . . . " Mormon agnosticism was very little in evidence last month when the church celebrated " Pioneer Day , " the 85th anniversary of the arrival of Brigham Young and 148 followers in Great Salt Lake Valley , Utah . Many Mormons went up to Palmyra , N. Y. to visit their Mt . Sinai , the Hill Cumorah where the Law was handed down to Founder Joseph Smith in the form of a book written on golden plates and the Urim &; Thummim ( breastplate with silver bows ) which enabled him to translate it . The Hill Cumorah , humpy and treeless , is marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hedge ; at its foot is the Cumorah Hill Gasoline Station .
