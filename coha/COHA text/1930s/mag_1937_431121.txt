MEN HAVE WASTED a deal of breath , paper , and ink describing the ideal woman . So it happens that women , trying valiantly to become ideals , have neglected the important task of being themselves . As a matter of fact , men have n't really known what they wanted . So women have been put to much trouble to no good purpose . Just when all the foolishness started I 'm not exactly sure ? though John Erskine probably could give the historical source with nonchalant facility . At any rate , Dante had a great deal to do with the pedestal tradition that was carefully nurtured by his imitators . Fortunately , however , Beatrice bestowed upon her admirer only a fleeting smile , married another man , and died before she had a chance to live down being an inspiration . I have no intention of mentioning the medieval courts of love and their devastating influence on men and women and marriage and other solid realities for I 'm not particularly interested , at the moment , in the past . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the task involved in straightening out a relationship that has been horribly twisted all because men would n't leave creation to the Deity and attempted to make women into all sorts of strange images that momentarily satisfied their cravings . FASHIONS IN WOMEN IF MAN HAD KNOWN what he wanted , he would n't have changed the fashions in women every score of years . Parenthetically , if women had possessed more wisdom and less desire to please , they would never have allowed themselves to be poured into molds and stood on pedestals that were both unbecoming and uncomfortable . Born at the end of Victoria 's reign , I have seen girls trying to be at least three kinds of people for the sake of man 's passing whim . In my childhood the blushing , fainting , hysterical lady who squealed when she saw a mouse and depended on a courtly gentleman to carry her reticule and fan was adored by the swains . Through sweet inanity and simpering dependency the lady hoped to be an in spiration . Then came the Good Fellow , who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that she might guide her pals towards paths of rectitude . Both these creatures , supposed to be passionless as eunuchs , sometimes simulated and sometimes actually achieved the ideal . The War and its mad aftermath , competently aided by the Eighteenth Amendment , reduced Victorianism to a messy wreck . The lid was off ; the pot boiled over ; literature went wild , and so did girls . Nobody was really happy . Men , however , were more distressed than were women , for their finest handiwork lay shattered at their feet ? a product they had spent centuries creating , a thing different from themselves to which they could show whatever better side they might have . Most men are n't poets , of course , and so they were merely feeling and not actually putting into words what Browning meant when he said , God be thanked , the meanest of his creatures Boasts two soul sides , one to face the world with , One to show a woman when be loves her . Naturally enough , the reaction came . Now discontented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surround her by the unreality that can satisfy neither him nor her . The only similarity among all these ideals men have attempted to shape is that they must appear brainless . Through the ages , therefore , girls have tried to controvert laws of heredity and to persuade men that foolishness descends from mother to daughter and sagacity from father to son . So brilliant women have passed on to men ideas , unlabeled and unclaimed . Consequently , it does seem important , before an ethereal pattern again makes a botch of perfectly good human stuff , to let men know what we really are and what we want them to be . With a sort of hopeless philosophy women have accepted men as God made them . Whatever reforms wives have attempted seem to bear on minor matters of human conduct or preparation for heaven and have not dealt with the basic relationship of man and woman . It would be vastly profitable to gather together a group of immortal women beside a pleasant stream that flows among pale asphodel and poppies in a heaven of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Zion fixed beyond the Jewish firmament , not the Buddhist nirvana , not Valhalla peopled by fair Norsemen but a celestial abode where pagans , Christians , Mohammedans , and forthright agnostics contemplate Ideas and Essences ? and hear intellectual women admit the infinite longings that finite hearts have never been able to satisfy . Edifying words might be spoken by burning Sappho ; by Deborah , wife of Lapidoth , who for 40 peaceful years judged Israel from beneath her palm tree ; by Diotima , who taught Socrates the sublimated meaning of love ; by Aspasia , who is perhaps the only woman ever to have heard a man admit that she wrote his odes and speeches ; by Cornelia , who found compensation in her Gracchi sons ; by poor Khadija , who managed to make Mohammed think he was God 's prophet ; by Joan of Arc , who sacrificed her life to save a man 's kingdom ; and by Elizabeth of England and Catherine of Russia , who , in different ways , succeeded in climbing to greatness on the shoulders of stupid men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to use whatever human material was easily available . You 've no idea how hard it is to get women , whether spinsters or matrons , to discuss men in an abstract , analytical way . It does n't seem quite decent to them , you know , even in these modern times , to put a specimen of opposite sex on the dissecting table . Yet , because I go about as a sort of specialist in women 's problems and pass quickly by into the enveloping mist , women pour out to me their personal troubles in so unrestrained a way as to leave me emotionally unfit for the next day 's tasks . THE IDEAL HUSBAND I HAVE ASKED groups of women whose ages range from 18 to 8o to tell me the qualities with which in their opinion the ideal husband should be endowed and I have answers that enable me to draw conclusions that seem reasonably sound . Admittedly , I have n't wasted time on foolish women ? of whom there are many , of course , but whose ideas ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since among men only the intellectuals are sufficiently articulate to set down in written words ideals to which women must attempt to conform . John Erskine , for instance , in a book that tries to cure an influence that scarcely exists at all , devotes many pages of type to " the matrimonial difficulties of the intellectual and his wife . " On the other hand , so far as I know , little or nothing has been written about the intellectual and her husband . So undoubtedly the time has come to say many things left unsaid , perhaps because women know the futility of words , perhaps because we have loved men too well and too unwisely to complain concerning their connubial shortcomings . I am about to pass on , moreover , no mere opinions of my own on the subject of husbands , for , not claiming to be an intellectual and having been married to only one man and not wanting to endanger my future happiness , I have neither the experience essential to form conclusions based upon personal a priori reasoning nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my notes , I am shocked into realization that not one woman to whom I talked made the faintest reference to the personal appearance of the man she would like to have for her husband . So it would seem that motion-picture stars are not impressing brainy women . Lest the blow fall too heavily on the advertisers of collars and other masculine apparel , I must hasten to suggest that the omission was merely an oversight on the part of women starved for intellectual companionship , who took the existence of physical charms more or less for granted . Surely , no woman actually wants a man to cultivate a bald head and a pouchy front , to take no heed to the color scheme of his ties and socks and to the creases in his trousers . These matters , however , are n't of major importance . Nor does wealth figure in the intellectual 's quest for a man . On the other hand , it is rather more feared than desired . Perhaps most of the women who finally opened their souls to me had n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Sims 's feeling about being the kept wife of a man who could buy his way to a fame in which she had no part . Perhaps the Cinderella story is outmoded at last . Perhaps women with any brains at all realize that stupid girls who sit in the ashes ca n't get princes with whom they could live happily for any length of time ? much less ever after . The younger intellectuals talked exclusively of other matters . It was only the middle-aged women who mentioned material security as an essential to happiness in marriage . Looking toward the day when their own earning capacities would be either decreased or wiped out , they were being practical . I am thinking now of one group that sat with me at a long bare table in an inn . All were unmarried except one woman who was divorced . All were successful in business or professions , and only two were young . " You did n't mean , " I asked , " that you want security in marriage because you would like to give up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . The women loved their work . They had no desire to give it up . Yet in their fields there was sweeping discrimination against married women . Because the economic system , as it is now run , excludes many married women from providing their own security through continuing businesses and professions for which they are trained , they felt that sensible women must add to romance the security which for human beings , like it or not , is essential to happiness . The woman beside me held an important position in an insurance company . Across the table sat a librarian , a school principal , a railroad executive , a petty officer in a bank . And only the women who worked for themselves had any chance of going on with their professions if they accepted benefit of clergy . So , after all , a lover is only a lover , but a hard-working husband is a meal ticket . MONEY AND MARRIAGE SO , HERE WE ARE ? face to face with a consideration that ought not to be injected into marriage and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that successful marriages are dependent on both parties ' being interested in work that fills the hours intervening between emotional heights that should dot the monotony of life with fiery exclamation points . I have friends who have contrived to get their daughters married to rich men 's sons . I want my girl to marry the boy she loves , whether or not he has a cent . I want her to work with him , as our grandmothers worked . Because of the faith that is in me , I am willing to help her through whatever trying years there may be . Until the machine and mass production , instigated by the profit motive , robbed woman of the creative toil that had been hers perennially , our foremothers worked themselves into pleasant mental and physical fatigue and came to their husbands in such equality as alone makes companionship and enduring love . The woman of brains does n't want to be converted into an inferior being because someone supports her and therefore can command her comings and goings and even attempt through artificial absurdities to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf knocks at the door , love flies out of the window . So , romanticist at heart , she has become destructively practical . Persons capable of great love ? and these are the important people of the world ? should not be entangled by purse strings . With some hesitation I am about to make a personal allusion just for the sake of clarifying what I am trying to say . The depression let loose in the direction of my family all the arrows in its terrible quiver . Only because I had not given up the small professional status that was mine , our little family managed to survive the experience that wiped out many of my friends . I look back now on that period between 1930 and 1934 as the happiest time in my life , for I ? essentially an egotist as are most people ? knew that I was serving those I loved and that I was therefore useful and important , much as my grandmother had been in another day . The intellectual woman wants in a husband much the same qualities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , the human attributes that go into the making of a man are n't vastly different from those that a woman inherits from a long line of forefathers . The intellectual woman , I am told , knows how to love with all the abandon of a Burns or a Byron ; but , in addition , she wants , as men have always wanted , intellectual understanding of the ambitions that motivate her everyday life . That , at least , is what she has told me wherever I have found her , however old or however young she may be . Naturally , she has talked a bit about the personality of this hypothetical husband . He must not be much older than she or much younger , for she has seen the tragedies brought about because of disparity in ages . She has wanted him to like people , to be the sort of person with whom she can share sports and other recreations , but she has n't mentioned his height or size , the worldly goods with which he can endow her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . Always , when talking to me , she has reverted to one theme ? a man must be fair to women ; he must believe in a square deal for his wife ; he must be as interested in her career as she is in his . In other words , the intellectual woman is in revolt against the egotist who insists on being the beginning , middle , and end of some woman 's existence and takes no thought of the contribution he should make thereto . Frequently , married women have expressed longing for husbands who are articulate . Seemingly , good deeds and kindliness are n't enough . Incurable romanticist that she is , the modern intellectual demands that love find expression in words and that she hear now and then that her husband loves her with the " breath , smiles , tears " of all his life and if God choose " shall but love her better after death . " BRAINS VS . SPOUSE NoT LONG AGo a man ? a painter , to be exact ? told me that he had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then refused to see it . He had obtained no divorce . Of course there were no legal grounds . Yet to my way of thinking here were grounds more solid than those based upon adultery or physical cruelty . Similarly , a woman who writes poured out to me a brokenhearted story that had to do with her husband 's failure to read her latest book . It seems that the man had helped her enormously , had fetched and carried reference works to and from the library , had attended to sending her manuscript by express , had even acted as secretary par excellence during her absence from home . But he had not read her book ! He could experience neither her pleasure nor her pain when the critics praised or attacked it . In loneliness of spirit , she was desolate beyond consolation . Though she could not doubt that her husband loved her , the quality of the love was not high enough . What she wanted to share he had refused to accept . So , for the intellectual woman , physical love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thinks deeply can also feel deeply . Byron knew perhaps more about a woman 's and a man 's love than I do or than do the women who have confided in me , for poets may have a sixth sense that is not bestowed on ordinary mortals . Yet I wonder sometimes if the best of poets do not speak now and then as mere men and if love is really a woman 's whole existence or just the major part of her life , merged with all else she does and motivating her highest endeavors . Byron probably meant that women are more dependent on love and appreciation than are men . Through the centuries our work has been done for the people we love . We started agriculture , that our families might be better nourished . We invented the household arts , to give comforts to our husbands and children . The individual has been always our chief concern . All we received in return was the satisfaction derived from our work well done , from the realization that we had brought comfort and happiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrown our inherent and cultivated individualism and still we must labor , not for the masses but- for someone we love and who loves us . It was a modern cynic who spoke of sex as something that a man must get out of his system so that he may be about the important business of life . I do n't believe he was right . I think I know that the highest type of man lets love become a part of him , of his ambitions , of whatever creative work he is capable of performing , just as the highest type of woman lets love teach her " the whole of life in a new rhythm . " BODY AND SOUL YET INTELLECTUAL WOMEN have seldom had the complete understanding that is essential to success in creative endeavor ? and I am not talking about the silly , misunderstood wife but about something much deeper and infrequently mentioned . Of course , I know the notable exceptions . Lewes recognized the genius of George Eliot and developed it . Robert Browning loved both the body and the soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not waste time mentioning . But I am talking not about geniuses but about women above the average , who have intellect and ability but are not set apart from other people by transcendent talents . Such women , married to men who take for granted separate careers and ambitions but who cherish a community of interests amassed through sharing hopes and realizations , achieve happy marriages . Not long ago in New York I was a guest at a dinner attended by couples who used their own names and had their own work . Miss Smith , for instance , was Mr. Brown 's wife . Everybody knew Mr. Brown and Miss Smith for what they had done in their own right . These men and women respected each other for achievements . No woman was a relative being , dependent for her identity on some man 's accomplishments . Nor was any man holding to the apron strings of a woman 's prestige . That was marriage ? and , more important , that was romance " to the level of each day 's most quiet needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foolish , trivial sort but with real women who want to be competent human beings . I know them , why many who ought to be mothers of sturdy sons and daughters have never married , why others have been unhappy in marriage . They are asking for something that men have not given , that men do not even know women want . Men have honestly believed that women are willing to dethrone their intellectual accomplishments when they marry and to make men their sole life work . Guided by concepts handed down from father to son , the average husband does not satisfy an intellectual wife . I know , because women have told me so ? women in every state in our Union women who talk to the itinerant speaker a : they would never confide in friends and neighbors . They do n't want to be Dante 's Beatrice who smiled in passing , married , died , and then was immortalized in poetry . They do n't want to be some seventeenth-century lyrist 's Lucasta , Althea , Corinna , or Electra . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord to women the right to lead interesting , independent lives and to share those lives with companions who care about achievements that are not masculine in gender . Of course , there are men who have caught the basic idea . Ibsen did when he allowed Norah to grow up and slam the door behind a relationship that had become intolerable . Children born of a physical union should n't be enough to hold together men and women who have no spiritual and mental interests . Our silly man-and-woman-made code has placed devastating emphasis on carnal things , to the destruction of all else . I have known intellectual women to forgive husbands for the sort of physical infidelity that comes because men are momentarily swept off their feet but I have never known an intellectual woman really to recover from the knowledge that a husband is mentally unfaithful and fails to evaluate fairly the work she is trying to do . Perhaps it is true that Byron through all his amorously adventurous life never made an improper proposal to a woman and that other brilliant men are similarly pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erskine ascribes to the part woman plays in the chase is not founded on fact and that the intellectual man is attractive to women not because he is the leader of the herd but because women think him capable of loving something more important than the softness of their bodies . Intellectual women also are pursued by men who in their youth have married the other sort ? pursued because physical love is never permanently satisfying to either the man or the woman of brains . If false standards and false ideals could be wiped out , there could be sensible unions ? combining mind , soul , and body ? that could complete human beings already born and bring forth a better future generation . I am old-fashioned enough ? if that is the adjective my attitude deserves ? to believe in marriage and the sanctity of the home . Yet I think that many marriages that lack spiritual and mental bases are legalized fornication , without either sanctity or reason for continuance . They are , moreover , as destructive to men as they are to women . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paean of praise honoring real men who are fair to women and to men as well , who , whether they know it or not , are working to create a social order that gives dignity to both women and men . Much has been said about the dangerous age that comes to people ? in the forties perhaps . I have seen real men and women pass through it and I know that the groping is spiritual , not physical . Intellectuals often are reaching out for companionship that has its basis in common interests , mutual understanding . Sometimes they are justified in defying conventions and in taking what they need and what they have been denied because earlier in life their thinking was twisted by false standards not of their own making . Love , when it comes to intellectual men and women past 40 , may not be wholly of the mind , but sex is not its basis . Many men and women can no longer carry their heavy responsibilities without the help and support of the women and men they love . The conformist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a king who can not continue his work alone . The person whose thinking has liberated him attaches another that is more nearly accurate . MARRY YOUR INTELLECTUAL EQUAL AT ANY RATE , after talking to intellectual women , I have reached these conclusions concerning marriage : Neither brilliant men nor brilliant women can be happy married to their inferiors , and they ca n't be happy married to equals unless both husband and wife recognize and respect equality of opportunity and status . All the artificial differentiations between the sexes have tended to destroy a relationship capable of being permanently satisfying . A man ca n't love an ideal , but he can love a flesh-and-blood woman whose faults and virtues he knows . The intellectual woman who does not share her achievements with a man who loves her and whom she loves is perhaps the loneliest creature on earth . The one who does comes very close to happiness . Whatever a woman may do in the workaday world , she wants to come at eventide to a shelter where there is love and faith and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I have been drawn recently into several futile arguments that concern men and women and now I have been guilty of writing many pages on a subject that really ought not to be discussed at all . Men wrote the first words , however , and a woman merely tried to have the last . Despite our reputation with respect to controversy , women have been almost always silent when men have mentioned their shortcomings . Women have n't even bothered to answer the satirists . Why should we , as a matter of fact ? Whatever antagonism exists between the sexes is only skin-deep . So long as men and women are the fathers and mothers of boys and girls , their interests ca n't be separated . Though I am no believer in the perfectibility of the race , I think the species would show a distinct improvement if more intellectual women were provided with husbands who recognized the existence of feminine brains and feminine ambitions and if the celibates among creative women were decreased . So to the argument I have added more words , futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
