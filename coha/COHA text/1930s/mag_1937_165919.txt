Much as it might like to , the public can not possibly invest in big security underwriting houses like Morgan , Stanley &; Co. , Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. or Lehman Brothers . <P> They are , of course , strictly private affairs . The only top-flight underwriters with stock outstanding in public hands are First Boston Corp . and Bancamerica-Blair Corp . <P> In volume of business First Boston is the biggest underwriter of them all . Stemming from the divorced securities affiliate of Boston 's First National Bank and the old Chase Harris Forbes organization , First Boston Corp . <P> last year originated or participated in bond or stock flotations footing up to nearly $4,000,000,000 . Its share of these underwritings was $318,532,000 . Last week , like any corporation president , First Boston 's Colonel Allan Melvill Pope , who learned to dispense with an office desk during his 17 years in the Army , mailed out his annual report for 1936 . <P> First Boston 's reports are interesting to a far wider group than its 9,500 stockholders . Now that Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied with other things than Wall Street , First Boston 's figures are the primest clue to banking house profits . In 1936 First Boston took in $7.348.000 from underwriting and trading operations , another $1,253,000 from interest and dividends , $229.000 from commission , service charges and miscellaneous sources . General expenses were $4,000.000 . <P> interest costs $400,000 . After taxes and a few minor deductions the year 's profit was $3,172,351.19 . This profit was earned on total capital &; surplus of less than $13,000,000 . Like all banking houses , like many a good merchant . First Boston operates to a large extent on borrowed money , loans payable amounting to some $55,000,000 at the year end . As one of the biggest government bond dealers in the U. S. , First Boston had $30.000,000 worth of Treasury issues on its shelves . Other securities , including those in joint trading accounts , footed up to $15,400,000 . It had sold short about $2,000.000 worth of securities , carried under the liability item , " Securities Sold Not Yet Purchased . " For other investment bankers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Total corporate financing , reported the Commercial &; Financial Chronicle , amounted to $4,600,000,000 , over twice the figure for the year before and about twelve times the total for 1933 when the Securities Act went into effect . Most of it was refunding - swapping new money for old-but the volume of fresh capital was above $1,000,000,000 for the first time since 1931.
