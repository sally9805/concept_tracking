IF I use the word ' I ' a good deal in these pages , it is not from self-importance , but because I would rather talk about my own school clays than generalize about schools . Schooling is perhaps the most universal of all experiences , but it is also one of the most individual . ( Here I am , generalizing already ! ) No two schools are alike , but more than that ? a school with two hundred pupils is really two hundred schools , and among them , almost certainly , are somebody 's long-remembered heaven and somebody else 's hell . The schools I write of were my schools ; to others at the same schools at the same time , everything may have been different . I went to three schools altogether ? an elementary school , a grammar school , and a public school . I matriculated at London University and spent four years at Christ 's College , Cambridge . Thus from the age of six , when my mother led me through suburban streets for presentation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of twenty-three , when I left Cambridge supposedly equipped for the world and its problems , the process called my education was going on . Seventeen years ? quite a large slice out of a life , when you come to think about it . And yet the ways I have earned my living since ? by writing newspaper articles , novels , and film scenarios ? were not taught me at any of these schools and colleges . Furthermore , though I won scholarships and passed examinations , I do not think I now remember more than twenty per cent of all I learned during these seventeen years , and I do not think I could now scrape through any of the examinations I passed after the age of twelve . Nor was there any sort of coordination between my three schools and the university . For this , nobody was to blame in a free country . To some extent , I learned what I liked ; to a greater extent , my teachers taught inc what they liked . In my time I ' took , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the elementary school , for instance , I spent an hour a week on ' Botany , ' which was an excuse for wandering through Epping Forest in charge of a master who , in his turn , regarded the hour as an excuse for a pleasant smoke in the open air . The result is that Botany to inc to-day stands for just a few words like ' calyx , ' stamen , ' and ' capillary attraction , ' plus the memory of lovely hours amidst trees and bracken . I do not complain . Again , at the grammar school I spent six hours a week for three years at an occupation called ' Chemistry , ' and all these hours have left me with nothing but a certain skill in blowing glass tubes into various shapes . In mathematics I went as far as the calculus , but I do not think I could be quite sure nowadays of solving a hard quadratic equation . Of languages I learned ( enough to pass examinations in them ) Latin , Greek , French , and German . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of a dictionary , but I do not do so , because it would give me no pleasure . My French and German are of the kind that is understood by sympathetic Frenchmen and Germans who know English . The only school learning of which I remember a good deal belongs to English Literature , History , and Music ; but even in these fields my knowledge is roving rather than academic , and I could no longer discuss with any degree of accuracy the debt of Shakespeare to Saxo Grammaticus or the statute de haerelico comburendo . In fact , although I am , in the titular sense , a Scholar of my college , I do not feel myself to be very scholarly . But give me a new theory about Emily Brontii or read me a pamphlet about war and peace , and I will tell you whether , in my view , the author is worth listening to . To make up for all I have forgotten , there is this that I have acquired , and I call it sophistication , since it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flexible armor of doubt in an age when too many people are certain . What all this amounts to , whether my seventeen years were well spent , whether I am a good or a bad example of what schooling can do , whether I should have been a better citizen if I had gone to work at fourteen , I can not say . I can only reply in the manner of the youth who , on being asked if he had been educated at Eton , replied , ' That is a matter of opinion . ' II The elementary school was in one of the huge dormitory suburbs of Northeast London ? a suburb which people from Hampstead or Chelsea would think entirely characterless , but which , if one lived in it for twenty years as I did , revealed a delicate and by no means unlikable quality of its own . I am still a young man , and I suppose that for the next twenty years people will go on calling me ' one of our younger novelists , ' but whenever nowadays I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is since I breathed its prevalent smell of ink , strong soap , and wet clothes . Just over a quarter of a century , to be precise , but it can not be measured by that reckoning . The world to-day looks back on the pre-war world as a traveler may look back through a railway tunnel to the receding pinpoint of light in the distance . It is more than the past ; it is already a legend . To this legend my earliest recollections of school life belong . My father was the headmaster of another school in the same town , and I was a good deal petted and favored by his colleagues . There were quite a few dirty and ragged boys in the class of seventy or so ; the school itself was badly heated and badly lit ; schoolbooks were worn and smeary because every boy had to follow the words with his finger as he read ? an excusable rule , for it was the only way the teacher could see at a glance if his multitude were all paying attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading lessons a bore . At the time that I was spelling out ' cat-sat-on-the-mat ' stuff at school , I was racing through Dickens , The ckeray , and Jules Verne at home . The school curriculum had its oddities . Mathematics was divided into Arithmetic , Algebra , and Mensuration ( why this last had a special name and subdivision I have no idea ) . Geography consisted largely of learning the names of capes , bays , counties , and county towns . When a teacher once told use that Cardigan Bay was the largest in Great Britain , I remember asking him promptly what was the smallest . He was somewhat baffled . But I have always been interested in miniature things , and per-Imps I was right in supposing that England 's smallest bay , were it to be identified , would be worth knowing . The teacher gave me full marks , however , because I attained great proficiency in copying maps with a fine-nibbed pen ? a practice which enabled me to outline all the coasts with what appeared to be a fringe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , in the beginning , I could not make head or tail of most of it . When I read that Soand-So ' gathered his army and laid waste to the country ' I could not imagine what it meant . I had heard of gathering flowers and laying an egg , but these other kinds of gathering and laying were more mystifying , and nobody bothered to explain them to me . They remained just phrases that one had to learn and repeat . I was also puzzled by the vast number of people in history who were put to death because they would not change their religion ; indeed , the entire fuss about religion throughout history was inexplicable to a boy whose father played the organ at a Congregational Church during the reign of Edward the Seventh . Since then I have helped to write school history books and have found out for myself the immense difficulty of teaching the subject to children . It is not the words only that have to be simplified , but the ideas ? and if you oversimplify ideas you often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a series of gags , anecdotes , labels ? that So-and-So was a good ' king , that Henry the Eighth had six wives and Cromwell a wart on his nose , that the messenger came to Wolfe crying ' They run , they run ! ' and that Nelson clapped the glass to his sightless eye . When later I studied history seriously for a university scholarship I was continually amazed by the discovery that historical personages behaved , for the most part , with reasonable motivation for their actions and not like the Marx Brothers in a costume play . ' Scripture ' was another subject I did not excel at . It consisted of a perfunctory reading of a daily passage from the Bible ; and our Bibles were always dirty , ragged , and bound in black . They left me with an impression of a book I did not want to handle , much less to read ; it is only during the past ten years that I haveread the Bible for pleasure . Our school Bibles also suffered from too small print ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody explained to me that the reason for this concerned scholars more than schoolboys . Not long ago I heard a local preacher who seemed , when reading the Psalms , to give certain sentences an unusual rhythm , and on inquiry I found he had always imagined the words in italics had to be accented ! Perhaps the chief thing I did learn at my first school was that my father ( then earning about six pounds a week ) was a rich man . When , later on , I went to schools at which he seemed ( in the same comparative sense ) a poor man , I had the whole social system already sketch-mapped in my mind , and I did not think it perfect . The school was perhaps a better-thanaverage example , both structurally and educationally , of its type ; so I can only conjecture what conditions were like at the worst schools in the worst parts of London . I do know that there have been tremendous improvements since those clays ; that free meals and medical inspections have smoothed down the rougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , under Hitler and Stalin and Neville Chamberlain alike , the starved and ragged urchin has become a rarity . Such a trench is common throughout the world , and we need not be complacent about it , since its motive is as much militaristic as humanitarian . But it does remain , intrinsically , a mighty good thing . I believe I should have benefited a lot from the improved elementary school of to-day . I might not have learned any more , but I should probably have had better teeth . III From the elementary school I went to a grammar school in the same suburb . It was an old foundation ( as old as Harrow ) , but it had come down in the world . I had the luck to have for a form master a man who was very deaf . I call it luck , ' because he was an excellent teacher and would probably have attached himself to a much better school but for his affliction . As it was , his discipline was the best in the school ? with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do vigilance for his ears . The result was that , in addition to Latin , English , and History , I gained in his class another proficiency that has never been of the slightest use to me since ? ventriloquism . I was devoted to that man ( and I am sure he never guessed it ) . His frown could spoil my day , his rare slanting smile could light it up . I was conceited enough to think that he took some special interest in me , just because he read out my essays publicly to the class ; and after I sent him in an essay I used to picture the excitement he must feel on reading it . It did not occur to me that , like most good professionals ( as opposed to amateurs ) , he did his job conscientiously but without hysterical enthusiasm , and that during out-of-school hours lie would rather have a drink and a chat with a friend than read the best schoolboy 's essay ever written . Once he wrote on the blackboard some sentences for parsing and analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now like evening clouds before me ; when I think how beautiful they seem , ' t is but to feel how soon they fade , how fast the night shuts in . ' I was so struck with this that I sat for a long time thinking of it ; and presently , noticing my idleness , he asked me rather sharply why I was n't working . I could n't tell him , partly because I hardly knew , partly because any answer would have had to be shouted at the top of my voice on account of his deafness . I let him think I was just lazy , yet in my heart I never forgave him for not understanding . Children are merciless ? as much in what they expect as in what they offer . Not only will they bait unmercifully a schoolmaster who lacks the power to discipline them , but they lavish the most fantastic and unreasonable adorations . The utmost bond of lover and mistress is less than the comprehension a boy expects from a schoolmaster whom he has singled out for worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school than the one in which this grammar school found itself . Flanked on one side by a pickle factory , it shared its other aspects between the laundry of the municipal baths and is busy thoroughfare lined by market stalls . Personally I rather liked the rococo liveliness of such surroundings . I grew used to the pervading smell of chutney and steaming bath towels , to the cries of costers selling oranges and cough drops , and it was fun to step out of the classroom on winter evenings and search a book barrow fit by naphtha flares , or listen to a Hindu peddling a corn cure . And there was a roaring music hall near by , with jugglers and Little Tich and Genie Gitana ; and on Friday nights outside the municipal baths a strange-eyed , long-haired soap-boxer talked anarchism . Somehow it was all rather like Nijni Novgorod , though I have never seen Nijni Novgorod . I probably learned more in the street than I did in the school , but the latter did leave me with a good grammatical foundation in Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woodworking tools . ( Since then I have usually made my own bookshelves . ) One of the teachers made us learn three solid pages of Sir Walter Scott 's prose from The Talisman , the intention being , I suppose , that we might somehow learn to write a bit more like Scott ; but as I did not want to write like Scott at all , the effort of memory was rather wasted . I worked hard at this grammar school , chiefly because homework was piled on by various masters acting independently of each other . I was a quick worker , but often I did not finish till nearly midnight , and how the slower workers managed I can only imagine . I have certainly never worked so hard in my life since , and it has often struck me as remarkable that an age that restricts the hours of child employment in industry should permit the much harder routine of schoolwork by day and homework in the evenings . A twelve-hour shift is no less harmful for a boy or girl because it is spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to be pitied . Unless conditions have changed ( and I know that in some schools they have n't ) , there are still many thousands of child-slaves in England . The chief reason for such slavery is probably the life-and-death struggle for examination distinctions in which most schools are compelled to take part . And that again is based on the whole idea of pedagogy which has survived , with less change than one might think , from the Middle Ages . It is perhaps a pity that the average school curriculum fits a pupil for one profession better than any other ? that of schoolmastering . It is a pity because the clever schoolboy is tempted into the only profession in which his store of knowledge is of immediate practical value in getting bins a job , and is then tempted to emphasize the value of passing on precisely that same knowledge to others . The circle is vexatious , but I would not call it vicious , because I do not think that the whole or oven the chief value of a schoolmaster can be measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten , anyway , and far more easily than the influence of a cultured and liberal-minded personality . Indeed , in a world in which the practical people are so busy doing things that had better not be done at all , there may even be some advantage in the sheer mundane uselessness of a classical education . Better the vagaries of tolio than those of a new poison gas ; better to learn and forget our Latin verbs than to learn and remember our experimental chemistry ; better by far we should forget and smile than that we should remember and be sad . So I defend ( somewhat tepidly ) a classical education for the very reason that so many people attack it . It is of small practical value in a world whose practical values are mostly wrong ; it is waste time ' in a world whose time had better be wasted than spent in most of its present activities . My Mr. Chips , who went on with his Latin lesson while the Zeppelins were dropping bombs , was aware that he was wasting ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he believed that at any rate he was wasting them with dignity and without malice . INT The war broke out while I was still at the suburban grammar school ; during that last lovely Juno of the pre-war era , I had won a scholarship to a public school in Hertfordshire . I remember visiting a charming little country town and being quartered there at a temperance hotel in company with other entrants . The school sent its German master to look after us , a pleasant , sandy-haired , kind-faced man with iron-rimmed spectacles and a guttural accent ? almost the caricatured Teuton whom , two months later , we were all trying to hate . I never saw him or the place again because my father , poring over the prospectus , discovered that the school possessed a rifle range and an Officers ' Training Corps ? symbols of the war that , above all things , he hated . He had been a pacifist long before he over called himself one ( indeed , lie never liked the term ) , and it is literally true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my mother could never use a fly swatter if he was in the same room . Yet I know that if anyone had broken into our house and attacked my mother or me ? the kind of problem put two years later by truculent army officers to nervous conscientious objectors ? it would have been no problem at all to my father ; he would have died in battle . He was no sentimentalist . When a bad disciplinarian on his teaching staff once asked him what he ( my father ) would say if a boy squirted ink at him , my father answered promptly : It is n't what I 'd say , it 's what I 'd do . ' And he would have taken action ? though I can not imagine that he ever had to . Boys in his presence always gave an impression of enjoying liberty without taking liberties . He was a strong man , physically ? a good swimmer , a good cricketer , nothing of the weakling about him ; and to call him a pacifist is merely to exemplify his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me then , and it rarely occurs to me now , that any of his ideas were fundamentally wrong . He was , and happily is still , a mixture of Cohbett and Tagore with a dash of aboriginal John Bull . I was just fourteen then ? the age at which most boys in England leave school and go to work . It was the first autumn of the war , when our enthusiasm for the Russian steam roller led us to deplore the fact that we could not read Dostoievski in the original ; so , with this idea in mind , I began to learn Russian and tried for a job in a Russian bank in London . Worse still , I nearly got it . If I had , it is excitingly possible that I should have been sent to Russia and been there during the Revolution ; but far more probable that I should have added figures in a City office until the bank eventually went out of business . My father , however , was beginning to daily again with the notion of a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he could not make up his mind , I should choose a school for myself . So I toured England on this eccentric but interesting quest and learned how to work out train journeys from York to Cheltenham and from Brighton to Sherborne , how to pick good but cheap hotels in small towns , and how to convince a headmaster that if I did n't get a good impression of his school I should unhesitatingly cross it off my list . When I look back upon these visits , I am inclined to praise my father for a stroke of originality of which both he and I were altogether unaware . It would , perhaps , be a good thing if boys were given more say in choosing their own schools . It certainly would be a good thing if headmasters cared more about the impressions they made on boys and less about the impressions they made on parents . Only a few of the headmasters to whom I explained my mission were elaborately sarcastic and refused to see me . Eventually I spent a week-end at Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally made the choice , despite the fact that the school there possessed both the rifle range and the cadet corps . Relying on the fact that my father was both forgetful and unobservant , I said nothing about this at home , got myself entered for the school , and joined it halfway through the summer term of 1915 . Not so long ago I read a symposium contributed by various young and youngish writers about their own personal experiences at public schools . These experiences ranged from the mildly tolerable to the downright disgusting ; indeed , the whole effect of the book was to create pity for any sensitive , intelligent youngster consigned to such environment . I do not for a moment dispute the sincerity of this symposium . I am prepared to believe almost any specific detail about almost any specific school . Of my own school I could say , for instance , that some of its hygienic conditions would have aroused the indignation of every Socialist M. P. if only they had been found in a Durham or a South Wales mining village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main latrines were next to the dining room ; that we were apt to find a drowned rat in the bathtub if we left the water to stand overnight ; that in winter the moisture ran down walls that had obviously been built without a damp course ; that the school sanatorium was an incredible Victorian villa at the other end of the town , hopelessly unsuited to its purpose . Most of these things have been reme- died since , but they were true enough in my time ? and what of it ? Their enumeration can not present a true impression of my school or of any school , because a school is something more than the buildings of which it is composed . I know that a visiting American would have been sheerly horrified by the plumbing and drainage , but no more horrified than I am when , having duly admired some magnificent million-dollar scholastic outfit on the plains of the Middle West , I learn that it offers a degree in installment selling and pays its athletic coach twice as much as its headmaster . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better to have rats in the bathtub than bats in the belfry . I am , as I said just now , prepared to believe almost any specific detail about almost any specific school . But a book or even a page of specific details must be considered with due allowances for the age and character of the writer . Many men after middle life remember nothing but good about their schools . Their prevalent mood by that time has become so nostalgic for past youth that anything connected with it acquires a halo , so that even a beating bitterly resented at the time becomes , in retrospect , a rather jolly business . ( Most of the ' jolly ' words for corporal punishment ? spank , ' whack , ' and so forth , were , I suspect , invented by sentimentalists of over forty . ) The kind of man who feels like this is often the kind that makes a material success of life and whose autobiography , written or ghost-written , exudes the main idea that ' school made him what he was ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher praise . On the other hand , in reading the school reminiscences of youths who have just left it , one should remember that the typical schoolboy is inarticulate , and that by putting any such reminiscences on paper the writer is proving himself , ipso facto , to be untypical . In other words , recollections of schools are apt to be written either by elderly successfulmen who remember nothing but good or by youths who , by their very skill in securing an audience at such an early age , argue themselves to have been unlike the average schoolboy . There is nothing for it , therefore , but to be frankly personal and leave others to make whatever allowances they may think necessary . V I am thirty-seven years of age . I do not think I an old enough yet to feel that school was a good place because I was young in it , or self-satisfied enough to feel that school was a good place because it ' made me what I am . ' ( In any case , I do not think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . ) But I enjoyed my school days , on the whole , and if I had a son I dare say I would send him to my old school , if only because I should not know what else to do with him . I was not a typical schoolboy , and the fact that I was happy at ( shall we say ? ) Brookfield argues that the school tolerated me even more generously than I tolerated it . Talking to other men about their school days , I have often thought that Brookfield must have been less rigid than many schools in enforcing conformity to type . Perhaps the fact that it was , in the religious sense , a Nonconformist school helped to distill a draft of personal freedom that even wartime could not dissipate . At any rate , I did not join the almost compulsory Officers ' Training Corps despite the fact that the years were 1914-1918 . My reasons for keeping out ( which I did not conceal ) were simply that I disliked military training and had no aptitude for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should add that it was really no stand at all nobody persecuted me ; if anyone had , no doubt I should have joined . When later I was called up for military service I responded , chiefly because my friends were in the army and I guessed I should be happier with them there than on committees of anti-war societies with people whose views I mainly held . If this seems an illogical reason , I shall agree , with the proviso that it is also a more civilized reason than a desire to kill Germans . I did not conceal my views about the war , but I did conceal my general feeling about games . I like outdoor pursuits such as walking , sea bathing , and mountaineering , but the competitive excitements of cup finals and test matches bore me to exasperation . The only contest oven remotely athletic into which I ever entered with zest was the saying of the Latin grace at my Cambridge college ; it was a long grace , and I was told ( how accurately I can not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fourteen and one-fifth seconds . At Brookfield , however , grace was said by the masters , so that my prowess in this field remained unsuspected , even by myself . The craze for clipping fifths of seconds raged elsewhere . Most of my friends were tremendously concerned about ' the hundred yards ' and the various School and House matches , and I would not for the world have let them know that I cared nothing about such things at all . Sometimes , if there was absolutely no one else loft to fill the team , I took part in some very junior house match , and I always hoped that my side would lose , because then I should not have to play in any subsequent game . Outwardly , however , I pretended to share all the normal enthusiasms over victory and despairs over defeat ; and I think I carried it off pretty well . There is always some ultimate thing you must do when you are in Rome , even if the Romans are exceptionally broad-minded . I never received corporal punishment at Brookfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with anybody ; and the only trouble I got into was for breaking bounds . I used to enjoy lazy afternoons at the Orchard , Grantchester , with strawberries and cream for tea ; I likedto attend Evensong at King 's College Chapel ; I liked to smoke cigarettes in cafes . Most of these diversions were against school rules , and I have an idea that often when I was seen breaking them the observer tactfully closed an eye . Perhaps it was realized that my desire for personal freedom did not incline me to foment general rebellion . Many things that I care about do not attract others at all , and awareness of this has always made me reluctant to exalt my own particular cravings into the dimensions of a crusade . On tho whole I thought the school discipline reasonable , if occasionally irksome , and when I transgressed I did so with neither resentment nor regret .. Strangely , perhaps , since I was not the typo , ' I was quite happy at Brookfield . The very things I disliked ( games , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rarely been so happy in my life as when , taking a hot bath after a football match in which I hardly touched the ball , I reflected that no one would compel me to indulge in such preposterous pseudo-activity for another forty-eight hours . I had many acquaintances , and a few close friends with whom my relationship was as unselfish as any I have experienced since in my life . I do not think I had any particular enemies , and I got on well enough with authority . Despite the sexual aberrations that are supposed to thrive at boarding schools , I never succumbed to any , nor was I ever tempted . I played the piano dashingly rather than accurately at speech-day concerts , breakfasted with the Head once a term , argued for or against capital punishment ( I forget which ) in the school debating society , and cycled many windy miles along the fenland lanes . The magic of youth is in the sudden unfolding of vistas , the lifting of mists from the mile-high territory of manhood . It sometimes falls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new writer , but never to discover a whole shelf of new books at once ? as happened after I had deleted material event of those years that I do not associate with a Brookfield scene ; Kitchener 's death reminds me of cricketers hearing the news as they fastened pads in the pavilion ; the Russian Revolution gives me the voice of a man , now dead , who talked about it instead of giving his usual geography lesson ; the Lusitania sinking reminds me of the first headlines , read hastily over a master 's shoulder at breakfast . I composed a sonnet on the Russian Revolution , which my father had the temerity to send to Mr. A. G. Gardiner ( then editor of the London Daily News ) , eliciting from him the comment that it ' showed merit . ' I also wrote a poem on the Lusitania which appeared in the Cambridge Magazine , a pacifist weekly run by Mr. C. K. Ogden , who has since distinguished himself by the invention of Basic English . These things I recount , not for vainglory ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal something of the mood of Brookfield , in which a boy could be eccentric enough to write poetry , and subversive enough to write pacifist and revolutionary poetry , without being either persecuted or ostracized . As a matter of fact , I was editor of the school magazine , and wrote for it articles , stories , and poems of all kinds and in all moods . Nobody tried to censor them ; nobody tried to depose or harass me . Looking back on this genial indifference , it seems to me that Brookfield in wartime was not only less barbarian than the world outside it , but also less barbarian than many institutions in what we have since chosen to call peacetime . Is there a school in Soviet Russia where a student may offer even the mildest printed criticism of Stalin ? Is there a debating society throughout all Nazi Germany that would dare to allow a communist to defend his faith ? I suspect that nowadays the boys of Brookfield , members of the despised bourgeois capitalist class , are nevertheless free to be Marxian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them are writing wildstuff which in twenty years ' time they will either forget or regret . Let us hope , however , that they will not forget the spirit of tolerance which to-day is in such grave peril because it is in the very nature of tolerance to take tolerance for granted . VI I do not know whether this spirit obtained at other schools besides Brookfield . Probably at some it did and at others it did n't . But I stress it because the quality of any institution can be tested by the extent to which it withstands attack without compromising too much with the attacker . Granted that during the war all civilized institutions were subtly contaminated , which of them passed such a test most creditably ? Perhaps we can say that England as a whole , though suffering vast changes , has survived more recognizably than any other country . She is more than the ghost of her former self ? she has a good deal left of the substance .

No upstart authority has yet compelled him to click his heels and begin the clay with juju incantations of Veils and Vivas . Ho can still say , without fear of rubber truncheons , Umph ? Mr. Neville Chamberlain ? umph ? I used to know his father when he was the wild man of Born ? I mean Birmingham . . . but his sons have turned ? umph ? respectable . .

' Unfortunately , it looks as if they were going to be snuffed out . Mr. Chips was too valiant an optimist to face the tragic impasse of the twentieth century ? the fact that civilization , because in its higher manifestations it is essentially organized for peace , can not long survive war , even a war supposedly undertaken on its behalf .

Here the reader may protest that much of the above argument depends on the assumption that England and our institutions deserve to survive . There was a time when I would not by any means have taken this for granted . It was possible , then , to feel that the pre-war world , having encouraged or permitted a system that led to catastrophe , might as well be destroyed completely to make way for newer and better things . It was possible then to decry the public schools as the bulwark of a system that had had its day , to attack them for their creation of a class snobbery , to lampoon their play-the-game fetish and their sedate philistinism . That these attacks were partly justified one may as well admit . The publicschools do create snobbery , or at any rate the illusion of superiority ; you can not train a ruling class without such an illusion . My point is that the English illusion has proved , on the whole , more humane and more endurable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are challenging and supplanting it ; that the public-school Englishmen who flock to a Noel Coward revue to join in laughs against themselves are patterned better than the poly-chromed shirt-wearers of the Continent who not only can not laugh but dare not allow laughter . Granted that the long afternoon of English imperialism is over , that dusk is falling on a dominion wider if loss solid than Rome 's . Granted that the world is tired of us and our solar topees and our faded kiplingerie , that it will not raise a finger to save its from eclipse . Time will bring regrets , if any . For myself , I do not object to being called a sentimentalist because I acknowledge the passing of a great age with something warmer than a sneer . But the accusation of sentimentality conies oddly from those who extol the Russian collectivist as Rousseau extolled the noble savage . In some circles to-day it is even fashionable to decry the more literate occupations altogether and to redress the undoubted middle-class overweight in pre-war art by refusing hallmarks to anything modern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to a confession ( snobbish if you insist ) that in my opinion a man need not be ashamed of having been educated ? even at Brookfield and Cambridge . When I reflect on the manner in which the Gadarene pace of 1938 is being set by an ox-house-painter , I do not need to apologize for being an ex-public-schoolboy ( comic phrase though it is ) , and I can even turn with relief to the visionary ideals of a man whose reputation , faded to-day , will bloom again as we remember him more and more wistfully in the years ahead . And Woodrow Wilson was an ex-schoolmaster . Let history write the epitaph : England , liberalism , democracy , were not so bad ? not so good , either , on all occasions , but better , maybe , in a longer retrospect . Some of us may even survive to make such a retrospect . All over the world to-day the theme and accents of barbarism are being orchestrated , while the technique of mass hypnotism , as practised by controlled press and radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification for any and every excess . The English illusion is dying ; on dune and headland sinks the fire . But there are other and fiercer fires . It is remarkable ( if only a coincidence ) that the first victims of the new ferocities have been countries in which there is a long tradition of cruelty ( Chinese tortures , Ethiopian mutilations , Spanish bull rings ) ; one is almost tempted to a belief that the soil can be soured by ancestral lusts , and that English freedom from actual warfare within her own territories for two centuries has been , in effect , a cleansing and a purification . Perhaps this is too mystical for proof ; perhaps it is just nonsense , anyway . But it is true that violence begets violence , that delight in the infliction of suffering is a poison in the blood stream of nations as well as of individuals , and that soon we may be faced with the prospect of a world impelled to its doom by sadists and degenerates . In the next war ( that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no heroes charging splendidly to death because ' someone has blundered , ' but gray-faced morituri , prone in their steel coffins , diving to kill and be killed because , in the reckoning of authority , no one has blundered at all . VII Do not think I am blind to the faults of the age of which Mr. Chips and his type were the product as well as the makers . Its imperialism was , at its worst , smug , hypocritical , and predatory . Its laissez-faire capitalism resulted in such horrors as child-slavery in factories . Its vices were as solid as its virtues . But one fact does emerge from any critical analysis of the period beginning , roughly , with the Queen 's accession and ending with her death ? that it was possible , during this time , for an intelligent man in Western Europe to look around his world and believe that it was getting better . He could see the spread of freedom , in thought and creed and speech , and ? even more important ? the spread of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal , even if it could not be immediately conceded . He could watch the transplantation of parliamentary government into lands where , though it might not wholly suit the soil , few doubted it would eventually flourish . He could believe that mechanical inventions were spreading civilization because the chief mechanical invention of the time , the railway , was not ( like the airplane ) diabolically apt for use in warfare . He could observe each year new sunderings of barriers between lands until traveler and student could roam through Europe more freely than at any time since the breakup of Christendom . True that the boy Dickens toiled in a blacking factory , but he grew up free to scarify the system that had forced him to it ; he had been a child-slave , but he was never a man-slave . True that Huxley was attacked for teaching that men and monkeys were somewhat the same ; but he was never exiled for refusing to teach that Jews and Gentiles were altogether different . Scientists may have incurred the wrath of bishops for spreading what the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by government to teach what every acknowledged authority considers to be Aryan nonsense . And while Karl Marx laboriously constructed his time bomb to explode the bourgeoiSie , his victims rewarded him with a ticket to the British Museum instead of a Leipzig trial , and a peaceful grave in Highgate Cemetery
