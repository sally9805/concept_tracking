Exempt from duty : . . . Original paintings in oil , mineral , water , or other colors , pastels , original drawings and sketches in pen , ink , pencil or water colors . . . . <P> So reads Paragraph 1,807 of U. S. Public Law No. 361 , the Tariff Act of 1930 . Its legalistic loophole : the word " original . " Last week it appeared that Manhattan customs officials had squeezed certain of the grey-and-chalk Paris street scenes of Maurice Utrillo through the loophole , ruling that they were copies of postcards , therefore commercial rather than original art , therefore dutiable at 15% of the price they fetched in France . Duty was applied specifically on one importation of Manhattan 's Perls ( pronounced perils ) Galleries , Rue Saint-Vincent a Montmartre ; and on a score imported by the Valentine Galleries for a show which opened this week . Both galleries paid and appealed . <P> What saddened the two victims of the ruling was that they had to pay duty on the paintings not as reproductions of postcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings , worth from $200 to $2,000 each . What saddened dealers , critics ( including the Museum of Modern Art 's President Anson Conger Goodyear and Director Alfred H. Barr Jr. ) and artists in general was the ruling 's implication : that an artist 's model rather than his method determines whether his work is original or not . <P> Utrillo partisans could not deny that he often uses postcards as departing points for paintings of Paris street scenes which he knows well . But they could think of other Utrillo inspirations besides postcards . Among the earliest were lumps of sugar soaked in absinthe which his mother tossed him when he was ten to shut him up . By the age of 15 he was drawing steady inspiration from gin and whiskey bottles . By the ' 305 he had moved on to lamp fuel , mentholated alcohol , petroleum , benzine , eau de cologne , ether , with opium and hashish on the side . In 1936 London 's great Tate Gallery publicly and prematurely proclaimed him dead of drink . Utriilo was not dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imagination ( by praying instead of drinking ) and painting pictures . In any case , admirers last week remembered incidents which went to show that his imagination needed no prodding , and that no postcard would stay a postcard under his brush . For instance : <P> He once decided to paint Kiki , Queen of the Paris models , favorite of Artists Pascin , Kisling , Soutine . After meticulously arranging her pose and drapes , sitting at his easel , squinting at her , measuring her with his thumb , dabbing at his canvas so laboriously and long that Kiki was sure he had painted a good likeness , he declared his work done . Kiki ran around and looked at it . He had painted a great , bleak barn . " Perhaps , " says catlike , sleek , sophisticated Kiki , " perhaps it was my farm-girl appearance . "
