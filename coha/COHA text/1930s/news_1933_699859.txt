txt Formal negotiations " for an ultimate settlement of the whole war-debt question , " between the United States and Great Britain will be initiated here shortly , probably next month . - mu ; Is the upshot or the long series of discussions between America and England , culminating in the exchange 01 formal notes published yesterday , and accompanied by explanations in London and Washington by Mr. Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer , and President Roosevelt , respectively . The prolonged controversy across the Atlantic over the vexed war debt issue is headed toward final settlement at last , it is confidently hoped here , and beside that possibility even the prospective accomplishment-5 of the London Economic Conference sink temporarily into second place . Token Payment Accepted In the meantime , President Roosevelt has accepted a $10,000,000 silver bullion " token " payment of Great Britain as an earnest of its $75,050,000 semiannual obligation falling due today and has taken the oven more Important step of accepting this " acknowledgment " of the debt as indicating that no default has occurred . Under a congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rate of 50 cents an ounce . Silver advocates hoped large scale purchases would boost the price . The bullion was actually pbtained at 3811 cents an ounce , apreaenting a saving of some $2,157,000. -A succession of ambassadors and ministers called at the office of Mr. William Phillips , Acting Secretary of State , today , in connection with war . nount Britain would offer to pay C.1 halt-year when a revised scale I. ? fixed . the $10,000,000 represents about 13 per cent of the installment actually due June 15 , namely $75,000,000 . This is a higher percentage than Germany alreed to pay at Lausanne , which w Ili 10 per cent . Working out the actual details of the final settlement is expected to necessitate a further visit of Sir Frederick to Washington , and this Is to be arranged as soon as possible . There is considerable prospect that the British Government will wish to transform its indebtedness into an ordinary loan , floated In New York , in view of its known dislike of intergovernmental obligations . Meanwhile it can be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that President Roosevelt had agreed to a tentative arrangement became known . There was widespread objection to default due , as Sir Robert Horne pointed out in the Commons , not only to moral considerations , but to the fact that Britain is still the world 's greatest creditor , and the example of default is apt to be catching . Britain 's foreign Investments are computed in round figures at ? 2,000 , 000,000 , yielding in normal times f200.000,000 interest yearly . These sums would have been jeopardized by a deliberate default . Yet It had been definitely decided to default if President Roosevelt hpd been unable to accept a token payment and had insisted on the letter of the bond being fulfilled . In this connection tribute is paid here in many quarters to President Roosevelt 's statesmanship , courage and sympathetic understanding of Britain 's difficulties . Sir Herbert Samuel , in the House of Commons last night , made an eloquent reference to " the deep appreciation " of the House at the President 's attitude . Anglo-Ameridan " cordiality and friendliness , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British policy . " The whole House cheered these sentiments . Though official statements do not say so , The Christian Science Monitor learns that considerable progress has already been made toward final settlement of the war debt problem which reaches its penultimate stage with the British payment of $10,000,000 in silver today . The announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer . Mr. Neville Chamberlain , that President Roose ? velt had accepted this sum " as an acknowledgment of the debt and pending final settlement , " and that he does not " characterize " the resultant situation as a default " received warm cheers from all parts of the House of Commons last night . The House was pleased too , that payment had been accepted in silver at 50 cents an ounce as permitted by terms of the farm relief bill . This graceful gesture , made Possible by an act of the United States Congress , saves the British Treasury about 1400,000 on today 's transaction , the market price of silver here being only about 33 cents an ounce The ' necessary amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Monitor indicated last week it would be done . Move Well Under Way While Mr. Chamberlain and President Roosevelt both said that negotiations for final settlement would be begun at Washington as soon as convenient , the Monitor understands that comparatively little remains to be done to complete the negotiations . Mr. Chamberlain laid stress upon the widespread effect of the British decision . He said : Considering their decision , the Government felt they must have regard as to its effects not only upon this country , but upon the whole world . The co ference now sitting in South ** was recognized by all as ttddhhllost momentous in character , and delegate after delegate has already urged most disastrous consequences would ensue if it failed and the necessity for a sense of confidence if It was to succeed . We had already made a payment in December in the hope that it would pave the way for a settlement before another payment became due . If we paid again there would appear to be no reason why we should not be called upon to make payments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us impossible to contemplate that this country should continue to make payments of this magnitude while under the Lausanne provisional agreements we had suspended corresponding claims upon our debtors . Further payments would therefore have necessitated putting an end to the Lausanne agreement and reopening all the vexed questions of reparations and war debts , which were provisionally settled , and plunging the world once more into a condition of uncertainty and despair from which it was rescued last year . These considerations appear to the Government to be of such fundamental importance as to outweigh all others . On the other hand , we felt the strongest objection to any course would have placed us in a position of having repudiated our obligations . In our view , the proper way to treat the June installment was to consider it as merged in the body of the debt which we have already discussed informally and as to which we were prepared to enter upon formal negotiations as soon as they could be arranged . Settlement Sought We , therefore . decided in order to make perfectly clear our view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to prejudice the ultimate settlement which we proposed to make by payment of 810,000.000 as an acknowledgment of the debt pending final settlement . A White Paper issued here last night says the talks started " even before the new Administration was inaugurated . " They continued when Mr. Ramsay was In Washington and made " preliminary explorations as to the basis of a clearer understanding of the situation . " This is all the official documents disclose on the subject . But Sir Frederick Leith-Ross , British Treasury officer , who remained in Washington after the Prime Minister left Is understood to have carried the matter a stage further . And since he returned to England Sir Ronald Lindsay , the British Ambassador , made another advance . It is even suggested that todars payment closely approximates the debt payments , following Meat Britain 's action . So far as is known little Finland is the only country out of 19 war debtors which intends to make complete payment . The Finnish debt dun at this time is $148,502 . An official statement covering the record to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until then , press reports must depend upon unofficial announcements , dispatches from Europe and the comments of diplomatic envoys here . Italy intends to pay $1,000,000 out of an installment of approximately $13,500,000 falling due today , the Em-base ) , here announced . France is expected to repeat its default of last December , on the A note from Poland announces its intention to default on the $3,560,000 now due . Czechoslovakia , owing $1,500,000 , is expected to make part payment . Roumania , with a payment of $1,000,000 , also is expected to pay in part . An uncertain situation surrounded the position of the following countries owing small amounts : Estonia , $284,322 ; Hungary , $28 , - 260 ; Latvia , $118,961 ; Lithuania , $132,073 and Yugoslavia , $275,000 . Meamehile the Senate , which like an autumnal leaf , still clings to its special semion here , today divided its reaction between praise and blame . Such a division of opinion was the reaction expected in any case , on any settlement . Some Senators fussed and fumed over the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and applauded the move . As a matter of fact , the negotiations thus far appear to give the Senate very little to attack . The Senate is still left as the arbiter of any debt settlement . So far as the Senate goes the situation is about where it is . President Roosevelt has carefully managed his stage , so that the debt negotiation actors will be Upon it when the senatorial heavy tragedians are far away . Furthermore the expected agreement will be achieved and announced when there is the longest breathing spell free from Congress to let it sink Into public consciousness undisturbed by political harentitles . Question of Authority Only one difficulty confronts the plan . Congress will not meet again till next January , and before that time , on Deo. 15. still another debt installment falls due . How much authority President Roosevelt has to mitigate or defer this second British ? installment remains to be seen , but it is assumed that he can . if necessary , take one more " token " payment . The President 's action was defended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas , majority leader ; Carter Glass ( D. ) of Virginia , and William E. Borah ( R. ) of Idaho . It was attacked by Hiram Johnson ( R. ) of California and David A. Reed ( R. ) of Pennsylvania , as covering a plain " default . " President Roosevelt 's strategic reiteration of the final authority of Congress in the matter , both in his note to London and in the accompanying statement for the press issued here , Is expected to take much of the wind out of Senatorial onoonente ' sails . Helps London Conference The action on debts in Washing- ton came at a time when the World Economic Conference was threatened with an impasse over the same issue . Mr. Roosevelt emphasized that he had not authorized debt discussions at London , but the develop , ment in Washington nevertheleits may breathe new life Into the negotiations there . Action of other American debtors remains to be seen . France is expected to default , with all the other countries in the French bloc save Czechoslovakia .
