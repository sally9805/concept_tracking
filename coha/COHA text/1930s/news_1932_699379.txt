txt Die It would be hard to find in our political annals a precedent for the correspondence between President HOovER and Governor ROOSEVELT , now made public . JOHN ADAMS would have scorned communication with JEFFERSON about the difficulties of the Government which the latter was to take over . There is no evidence that BENJAMIN HARRisoN ever consulted with GEovEit CLEVELAND about the financial embarrassments of the Administration which were certain to have a cumulative and disastrous effect after March 4 , 1893 . President TART is said to have exchanged views with WOODROW WILSON after the election of 1912 , but what subjects were discussed between them , and what conclusions were arrived at , we do not yet know . The telegrams which passed between Mr. HOOVER and President-elect ROOSEVELT reveal an admirable tone and temper on either side . They are courteous and friendly . Neither man shows distrust of the other , nor seems to fear that a political snare was being laid for his feet . The correspondence , as printed , does honor to both sides . It may be helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , taking up the agreements , Mr. HOOVER and Governor ROOSEVELT are of one mind in holding that " ( 1 ) the intergovernmental debts must be revised ; ( 2 ) no time should be lost in setting about the task , sounding out the debtor nations , ascertaining all the facts ; ( 3 ) the debtor , countries should be approached separately , and the questons of disarmament and tariffs should be kept , if possible , distinct from the war debts ; ( 4 ) the present Administration should not undertake any commitments which would even seem to have the effect of binding , legally or morally , the Administration which is to take office on March 4 . Where the President and the President-elect differ chiefly , in the matter of a new commission to begin an official examination of all the related problems which tie themselves up , despite all efforts to keep them severed , with the war debts . Nor is Governor ROOSEVELT willing to fall in with the President 's suggestion that he join in urging some eminent Democrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee , or delegation , instructed to explore the whole international situation connected with the debts . That would seem to the European nations , argues Mr. ROOSEVELT , as if such a leadership were authorized by him to present his views on " matters of large and binding policy . " Such an inference he would not wish to have drawn . But short of any means or measure that tie his hands before he becomes President on March 4 , the Governor is more than willing to cooperate in every helpful way open to him with the President in instituting and pushing the preliminary inquiries which must precede any decision that will stand up . As regards the general policy of disarmament , Mr. RooszvELT heartily assures the President : " Your policy is clear and satisfactory . " Again and again he reiterates his desire that the advance studies of the debt question should be expedited by such agencies as the President may select . He declares that he will be " happy " to receive reports of progress from time to time , en4 adds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely " during all the period when the investigation is under way . Mr. HOOVER appears now inclined to drop the whole subject . He states that he will " respect the wishes " . of Governor ROOSEvELT . But those wishes distinctly favor the idea of proceeding without delay through the established diplomatic agencies , or through specially appointed men , in order to clear the ground as fully as may be before March 4 . The President has been compelled to abandon his proposal of a new general commission , or a revival of the old Debt Funding Commission . This he could not have got from Congress , even if Governor ROOSEVELT had joined him in asking for it . But there is no reason why Mr. HoOvER should not go ahead in the ways suggested by Mr. ROOSEVELT , and , without trying to set up that distinctive " machinery " of which he spoke in his message to Congress , see what can be done toward directing and energizing the existing agencies of diplomacy . In any such plan , it is now clear , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor ROOSEVELT .
