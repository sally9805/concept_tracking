" They ' ve quit , Bub . They ' re all to hell and gone . We 've licked the pus clean out of them . Come on . Doc will fix you . " He sat Gil down on a mound , and then Dr. Petry 's big fleshy face , muttering , looking enraged and tired , bent down . The Doc was splashing alcohol of some sort on his arm . He was being bandaged . The stinging revived him , and he looked up and saw just above him old Herkimer , white in the face now , but still puffingat his pipe , which he held in his mouth inverted against the rain . " They ' 11 come back , " Herkimer was saying . " They ' re bound to . But we ' 11 rest while it rains . " A little way off a man was eating on a log . The rest were standing , lying on the ground , steaming in the rain . Everyone looked tired , a little sick , and ugly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody was keeping watch . They merely stood there in the rain . The rain passed as suddenly as it had broken . The men got up and kicked other men to get up , and picked up their rifles . They drew the priming and reprimed , or loaded entirely fresh . Gil got to his feet shakily , surprised to find his rifle still in his hand . It seemed a long time since the rain . The woods had changed so that he did not know where west lay , or east , or any direction . Then he saw that Herkimer had moved the position so that the militia were in the centre of the level ground between the first ravine and a smaller , shallower watercourse . Any new attackwould have to take them on a narrow flank , or directly up the new slope on top of which their line was formed . The first shots came scatteringly . The Indians were firing from long range . They seemed to have lost their taste for war . They were being very careful now . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but kept to cover . P201In a line running north and south through the new position , a broken mass of men lay on the ground , like an uneven windrow of some preposterous corn . They seemed almost equally made up of militia and the green-coated troops that had come through the hemlocks . They lay in queer positions , on their arms , grasping knife or hatchet or musket , the purpose still on the blank face like an overlying plaster ; or else they lay on their backs , their empty hands flung out as if to catch the rain . The militia stepped over this line impersonally . There was an Indian transfixed to a tree by a bayonet , waist high , with his legs dangling lifelessly against the ground . But he kept his eyes open and the eyes seemed to Gil to turn as he went by . A little way along a face struck him as familiar . He looked at it again . The possessor of the face had fallen with his chin over a log so that the face was tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christian Reall 's face . He had been scalped . The top of his head looked flat and red ; and the circumcisionof the crown had allowed the muscles to give way so that his cheeks hung down in jowls , tugging his eyes open and showing enormous bloody underlids . The two armies merely sniped at each other for an hour . Then the second attack by the enemy developed from the southwest along the level ground . At first the militia mistook them for reenforcementsfrom the fort . The direction they came from and the fact that they had pinned up their hat brims to look like the tricorn hats of Continental soldiers were deceptive . The militia broke cover , cheering , and rushed forward to shake hands , and the enemy let them come . There was no firing . It was only at the last moment that the sun came through the wet trees , dazzling all the ground and showing the bright green of the approaching company . Gil was not in the direct contact of the two companies . From where he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of green coats was coming round the first in his direction , with the same quiet march , and the same bright glitter on their advanced bayonets . He became aware of the instinct to run away . It suddenly occurredto him that he was hungry . Not merely hungry as one is at supper or breakfast ; but a persisting , all-consuming gnawing in his intestines that moved and hurt . He felt that it was not worth staying for . He was too tired . And the oncoming men looked tired . And it seemed to take forever for them to make a contact . But they came like people who could n't stop themselves , while he himself could not make his feet move to carry him away . They made less noise . The rainstorm which had broken the drought had not had power to take the dryness from their throats . They seemed to strike each other with preposterous slow weary blows , which they were too slow to dodge , and they fell down under them preposterously . It could n't last . Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few men near him , but there was no one whose face he recognized . They kept looking at each other as if they would have liked to speak . On the flank , the firing continued where the Indians still skirmished . But that , too , broke off except for stray shots , the last survivors of all the holocaust of firing . The Indians were calling in the woods . A high barbaric word , over and over . " Oonah , Oonah , Oonah . " Suddenly a man shouted , " They 've pulled foot ! " At first they thought another thunderstorm had started . Then they realized that what they had heard , with such surprising force , had been three successive cannon shots . The messengers had reached the fort , and the garrison was making a diversion.  |p203A  deliberate understanding gradually dawned on all their faces . They leaned on their rifles and looked round . The woods were empty , but for themselves , for their dead , and for the enemy dead . The living enemy had run away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knoll on which Herkimer was sitting under his tree . The old man was looking at them ; his black eyes , yet ardent , passing feverishly from face to face , and then turning slowly to the lines of dead . One of the officers spoke fatuously , " Do we go on to the fort now , Honnikol ? " He paused , swallowed , and said , as if to excusehimself , " We know they know we ' re here . " The little German swung his eyes to the speaker . The eyes filled and he put his hand over them . Peter Bellinger and Peter Tygert came up to him and touched his shoulder . They said to the officer , " We ca n't move forward . " They picked Herkimer up by the arms . " I ca n't walk , boys . " He swallowed his tears noisily . " There ' s still Sillinger up there . With the British regulars there ai n't enough of us . I think we ' d better go home . " He asked first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a slow business , getting them to their feet and lining them up under the trees . The earth was still steaming from the rain . There was a sick smell of blood from the ravine . The naming of men took too long . The officers went along the wavering lines , cutting notches in sticks for every ten men . They figured that after Fisscher pulled foot with the Mohawk companythere had been about six hundred and fifty concerned in the ambush and battle . Out of them about two hundred were judged able to walk . There were forty more who were not dead . How many had been killed and how many taken prisoner no one could say . Stretchers were made of coats and poles , and the worst wounded were piled onto them . Those who were not acting as bearers dully reprimed or loaded their guns . They started east . It seemed a long way to the ravine where the battle had started . It seemed a long time , longer than they could remember , since they had seen it last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek . From there men were sent ahead to order boats rowed up the Mohawk , to meet the wounded at the ford . The whole army lay down when they reached the ford . They lay in the darkness , along the edge of the sluggish river , until the boats came up . They were apathetic . Only when the boats arrived did they get onto their feet and help put the wounded men in . Several of them afterwards rememberedHerkimer 's face in the light of the fire . He had stopped smoking , though the pipe was still fast in his teeth . He was n't saying anything . He sat still , holding onto his knee . At the time they had just stood around watching him being loaded aboard the boat and laid out in the bottom . Then they had been told to march through the ford , and along the road . They went wearily , too exhausted to talk , even to think . And tired as they were , they were forced to do the same march they had taken three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at the terrified white faces of the people when they came to the settlement . They were too exhausted to see . The word had already gone down the river . People were expectingthe appearance of the enemy . It was a calamity . The army had looked so big going west that nobody had thought they would not get through to the fort . Now they were back ; they looked licked , and they acted licked , and they had not even met the regulars . It was pointless to think that the enemy had left the scene of battle before they had . An officer , some said afterwards that it was Major Clyde , yelled from the foot of the fort stockade that they were dismissed . They were to go home and try to rest while they could . They should expect another summons very soon.  |p205But  the men did not stop to listen to him . Ever since they had come out of the woods at Schuyler they had been dropping from the ranks . The instinct to get home was irresistible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it better than anyone could have told them.  |p206MRS  . MCKLENNAR simply would not hear of removing to a fort . " What ' s the use of women being left behind in a war , if they ca n't stay home and do the man 's work ? " " Yes , ma'am . " Captain Jacob Small , who had been placed in command of Eldridge Blockhouse , shifted his feet on the kitchen floor , turned his hat over twice in his hands , and looked anxiously towards the fireplace . " It 's orders , though . Where women and children shall be gathered together , ' it says . And me and other men over sixty and under sixteen is to collect with them and protect them . " " Pshaw , Captain Small , do n't you think I can look after myself ? " " Yes , ma'am . " Captain Small was uneasy . " But them 's the orders . You ' re rightly in my district . But if you do n't want to come to Eldridge , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only we 've been keeping the corner space in the shed for you . " " Shed ! " snorted Mrs. McKlennar . " Do I look like the kind of woman at my time of life who ' d go live in a shed ? Herded up like a freshened heifer . With everybody else , eh ? " " Yes , ma'am . " Captain Jacob looked appalled . " I mean , no , ma'am . " " Well , look at me , damn it , man . Ca n't I take care of myself ? " " Yes , ma'am . " Captain Small raised his eyes and turned them abruptly away again towards the fireplace  | " If you want to spit , " said Mrs. McKlennar , " for God 's sake , spit , and get it over with . " There was an almost piercing look about her long nose as he availed himself of the ashes . " I suppose it ' s nice of you to come down here to make a damn-fool woman see some sense . The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The captain said , " Well , I only tried to he neighborly . But if you change your mind we 'll have the corner space ready for you . Phil Helmer has got his cows in it now , but we ' 11 move them right out any time . " " Thank you , captain . " Captain Small hawked a little , as he reached the door . He looked over his spit at Fort Herkimer beyond the river . " See there , " he said significantly . " Ma'am , there ' s some women coming to the fort now . " A line of teetering carts , overloaded with goods and women and children , dragged across the flats from the southern hills . Mrs. McKlennar blew out her breath . " I ' ve been seeing them for two days . I ' m sick of the sight . Scared as rabbits . " Mrs. McKlennar watched him trudge away down the road . Then she stamped over the porch and down the steps and went towards the barn . " Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down from the springhouse with a crock of butter in her arms . " How much did it make ? " called Mrs. McKlennar . " About three pounds , " Lana replied . She looked cool and pink , but her eyes seemed to darken . " Was that Captain Small , Mrs. McKlennar ? " " Yes , it was . " " Did he have any news ? " " He was down to try to persuade us to move into his blockhouse . He ' s got a stall ready for us . There ' s some cows in it now , but he was cordial enough to suggest he would prefer us. "  | Lana smiled slightly . She was getting used to the widow 's way of talking . Mrs. McKlennar said , " And then he pointed out some women going in to Fort Herkimer . And he said a lot more about the way Indians handled women . " She paused and looked keenly at Lana . " What do you think about it , Magdelana ? Getting scared ? " Lana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't looking at Mrs. McKlennar ; with the crock still hugged up in her arms , she was staring westward . " Gil expected I ' d stay here , unless we got news things had gone wrong out west . When he comes back , he ' 11 probably expect to find me here . " " Good for you , " said Mrs. McKlennar . She tramped away to the barn to curry the horses . It was a job she fancied just then . She did n't have the faintest idea of what might happen , but in any case she had no intention of living like a pig in a sty and havingall the farm women constantly peering at her to see what kind of underclothes she wore ... . On her way from the stone house to her own kitchen , Lana heard the widow hissing like a whole stableful of grooms . She stopped again in the doorway to look out over the valley . Two days  --  and they had had no news . The valley was still and hot ; the earth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked across it , Lana had a feeling of the hills drawing together . She felt the presence of the woods behind her back , as if , on the north bluff , the wilderness crept close and watched her movements through the day with an invisible intelligence . At the departure of Gil , life as it was known on the farm seemed to have departed too . The three women , in spite of Mrs. McKlennar'snoisiness , were imprisoned in a green silence . There was nothing to hear but the crows at evening , or the sounds of their own voices . There were not even any wagons on the Kingsroad , now . No boats on the river . It was as if the valley held its breath ; as if the going of the militia drained it of all the things that made for life . One stopped one 's talk suddenly for no reason except an unexpected instinct to listen . Listen for what ? Lana did not know . But her breast ached . A thought lived in her with the beating of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her that since last fall both of them had been dead . Even in the little Schuyler hut she had had that feeling , though they had felt crowded there , so near that they withdrewfrom each other , as though to avoid physical encounter . Later , in the early summer , life had seemed easier . Work had been good for Gil . He was the kind of man who needed to be tired . But on Lana 's part , living had been merely a slow regulation of the breath . What they did , what they said , had lost all personal significance . Then had come the first muster and Gil 's departure for the Unadilla . And then he had come home , and her first quickening had come and gone like a moth 's temptation . She was healthier . But she had not been able to regain her vanished impulse towards happiness . Gil seemed unaware , detached , and baffled . Often Lana had heard women say of other women that they " got along " with their husbands . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She submitted to him as she had submitted to the fact of the destruction of their farm , wordlessly , blindly . Blindly until she had seen him making the turn in the road to Fort Dayton , with the erratic fiamadiddles of the Palatine drums passing after him . When it was too late she had had the choking thought that he would surely die . As she looked westward she could see the Schuyler house . The little shack stood by the river , shuttered and forlorn ; but it seemed to her that she was again lying on the narrow bunk bed , exhausted , still , cold , pressed down entirely by the bleak terror and her sense of outrage . She struggled against the memory . Her mind worked vaguely with the words with which she must try to tell him they were not themselves then . That she had got past that time . That it was neither his fault nor hers , but that they both had been forced by something which was neither of their making nor of their understanding . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrenched herself away from the sight , turning into her own kitchen , with an awareness that when two people acted so against each other it was beyond the power of their minds ever to retract the moment . It was Mrs. McKlennar who first heard Gil coming home . The night before , she and Daisy and Lana had been roused by the noise of Fisscher 's fleeing rabble . She had come down to the farmhouse and knocked on the door . Lana went down the stairs in her nightdress to open it . Mrs. McKlennar was standing in the moonlight , her hair stringily fringing the edge of her white cap . " Did you hear them , Magdelana ? " " Yes . " " Something ' s gone wrong with them , " said the widow . " I ' m going down to the road and see if I can find out how bad it is . Give me something dark to throw over this and go up and make sure Daisy do n't scuttle off somewhere . " " I ' d like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't . No telling who they are . They sound almightylike licked militia to me . But if there ' s anybody chasing them , a pretty girl has got no business hanging around in a night-gown . " Lana fetched her shawl . " Will you be all right ? " Mrs. McKlennar grunted . " Do n't be silly ! " But as she went down to the road , Mrs. McKlennar almost wished she did n't feel so safe . She remembered how Barney once said co her , " Now do n't you go traipsing round the militia camp at night . You ca n't tell about militia . And , begod , in the dark you 've got , a figger would make a lion out of a rabbit . " But that was long ago , when he liked her in a green ' silk night/gown , to go with her red hair . Now her body had taken after het face , with angles and joints , and no waist that Barney used to try to enclose in his two big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the militia were an unpredictable force . She stood by the rail fence until she saw a man drop beside the road to take off his shoes , and she moved over behind him and prodded him with her forefinger . He jumped and yelled and swung his gun round . " I ' m only a woman , " said Mrs. McKlennar , " and I ' m too old to bite . " " Oh , my Jesus , " he said . " I thought the Indians were still afterLIS . " What happened ? " He cast a look down the road after his comrades , a dark disorderlyshadow hurrying on the white dust . " God ! I got to get going . " " Is the army licked ? " " I do n't know . I guess so . We was in back and then they started shooting out of the woods . You could n't see . Fisscher came back and yelled the army was licked . That ' s all I know . We ai n't seen anybody since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . And I seen some . All painted . To look like devils . " He was already down the road . Edging off from her , breaking into a weary shuffling run . Mrs. McKlennar sniffed and turned back towards the house . There was no use waiting for more , the way those men had gone . She walked into the kitchen , getting an " Oh , my Gawd , Mis ' , " from Daisy , shut the door and dropped the bar . " We ' d better stay here to-night . You too , Magdelana . And I think we ' d better not light a candle . " She made her way through the moonlight from the window to the settle and sat down . " Stop your jibbering , you black baboon . " When she had sat down she repeated what the militiaman had said.  |p2I2  " Fisscher ' s run away . And I guess they 've surrounded the rest of the army . John Butler always was a clever devil . " Lana 's voice surprised herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Some of them . Magdelana dear , that ' s the business of war . " " Gil will be killed , " Lana said . Mrs. McKlennar pulled her shawl tighter . " Go ahead and think so if it does you any good . I used to be just a baby myself when Barney was away . But there ' s no sense in it . " She straightened herself with a slight shake . " I think we 'd just better sit quiet here until morning . Then we ' 11 see what 's actually happened . I ' 11 even move to a fort if necessary . Hush your noise , Daisy . " " I was only saying de Praise-God-from-whom . " The widow would not even let them light a fire until she had come back from the road . She went down , dressed , soon after sunrise , and held up a horseman with her brandy flask . He turned out to be a dispatch rider from Fort Dayton , starting down to General Schuyler 's camp somewhere below Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disoblige a lady with a flask . " No , ma'am , we do n't know what 's happened to the army . We 've just got word they had an action up the river . They 've sent for boats to fetch down Herkimer . He 's bad hurt . But they say the British left the field . " " God bless you , " said Mrs. McKlennar . " Take the flask with you . " The rider accepted it , touched his hat with it , and spurred his horse . Mrs. McKlennar watched him go with a small swelling of her heart . A nice-looking lad , a poor soldier  --  God knew what would happen to this country if a regular army ever came against them . She was humming a dim alto to something or other as she came back to the stone house . " There 's been a fight . They 've stood the British off . I do n't see why we should move yet . Magdelana , get some sleep . Youp213look a sight . I ' m going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk this morning . " Lana was upstairs in her house . She had prayed for Gil . It seemed futile to pray , now that the battle was over , but it was the only thing she could think of to do . She was still on her knees , her elbows deep in the bedtick , her head in her hands , when Mrs. McKlennar shouted from the yard . " Magdelana , Magdelana ! Here he is ! " For one breath Lana was like ice . Then she got on her feet and went down . She went out into the yard , where , in the hot sunlight , she saw him kneeling at the horse trough , drinking , while Mrs. McKlennar stood at his side and splashed cold water on his head with her hand . All Lana could think of was how dirty he looked . His face was dirty , almost black with grime ; his hair was matted with sweat and hemlock needles . His shirt was torn and his trousers looked as if he had been lost in a briar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough , and she thought he looked indescribably old . Then , as if he had seen enough of her , he put his lips to the cold surface of the water and drank . Mrs. McKlennar nodded . " Come here , he ' s had plenty . We must get him to bed . " Lana went to his other side . His shirt sleeve had been torn off and there was a dirty rag round the upper part of his arm . The rag was stiff with a brown clot . " Gil , " she said softly . But Mrs. McKlennar was abrupt . " Up , lad ! " He got up . The two women bolstered him on either side as he made slowly for the farmhouse . " We ' 11 get him some brandy , " said Mrs. McKlennar . " It ' 11 put him to sleep like a poleaxe , the way he is , We can look after him when he ' s sleeping . "  | " Do n't you think we ought to fetch the doctor ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old fool Petry can do , I can do . And this arm is nothing . He walked home , did n't he ? All he needs is a little sleep . " " Yes , " said Gil , unsteadily . " I ' m tired . " He had gone to sleep , as Mrs. McKlennar had foretold , within ten minutes of swallowing the brandy . Mrs. McKlennar had taken charge in a way that allowed Lana no protest . As soon as Gil 's eyes had closed , she started cutting free the bandage with her sewing scissors . She held the dirty rag by the tips of the scissors and took hearty sniffs of it . " It is n't mortified , " she said . " But anyway we ' 11 swab it out . " She dipped the chewed birch twig that was her toothbrush in the brandy and swabbed it through the bullet furrow . To Lana it looked like a brutal operation . " Nonsense , " said Mrs. McKlennar . " So long as he do n't feel it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up . " " Do n't be a fool . I do n't know whether you 've ever seen him drunk before . But he could n't be any drunker if he was lying in a ditch . " She bandaged the arm deftly . " Now , " she announced , " I ' 11 help you bathe him . You get his clothes off while I fetch some warm water . " While she was gone , Lana worked quickly . Gil lay like a log . She found that he would not wake no matter how she shoved and heaved , and for some reason she was glad to have him stripped and a blanket over him by the time Mrs. McKlennar returned with towels and a pail . " Pull back the blanket , " ordered the widow.  | " Thanks , " said Lana . " I can do the rest myself . " Suddenly Mrs. McKlennar laughed . " Do n't you think I ever saw a naked man , Magdelana ? And I old enough to be his mother , or his grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ! " Her decisive hand laid hold of the blanket and peeled it back , and she looked down on Gil 's straight brown body with frank curiosity . Then she raised her eyes to Lana 's . " Do n't look so shamefaced , girl . He ' s nothing to be ashamed of . Why , damn it , you ought to feel proud ! " But Lana could not feel that way . It seemed unrighteous for her and the widow woman to be working over Gil like that . But she said nothing , only dried the parts of him that Mrs. McKlennarhad done washing . The widow , to do her justice , wasted no time . " There , " she said . " He ought to have one blanket . He ' s tired . But no more , or he ' 11 wake up with a head like a punkin . " She picked up the pail and the soiled towels and said , " I ' m going now . " " Thank you , Mrs. McKlennar . " The widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re just wondering when the old fool ' s ever going to take herself off . " She stamped deliberately down the stairs . Gil slept all through the day . He was still asleep when the sun set . But as darkness came he had a spell of restlessness . In the first dusk , while Lana was getting a bite of supper , she heard him muttering overhead , and stole swiftly up to him . He was saying over and over , " I wo n't run . Oh , God , I wo n't run . " She put her hand on his forehead and he flung round in the bed and shouted , " For God 's sake , kill the next one . " She shuddered . His face had not changed , but his voice frightened her . His forehead was slightly feverish , and she went down again to get cool water , with which she bathed his Bead until his muttering stopped . Then she fetched the Betty lamp , lit it , and sat down where she could watch him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of age went gradually out of his face . He had turned on his side with the complete rest of a boy . As the night crept over the valley , she heard the widow finish milking and turn the cattle into the yard . A little later the light in the window of the stone house went out . There was no further sound except the last sleepy clucks of the hens settling on their roosts . All the farm was dark but for the light in their own room . It brought her a queer feeling of the world withdrawing , leaving them together , just they two . And as she watched his face , hour after hour , she lost all track of time . A breath of air stirred in the room , flickering the lamp . Lookingup from her hands , Lana saw Gil 's eyes upon her . She got up from her chair and went to the bed . His eyes followed her . His hands lay on the blanket in front of him . " It seems a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " You did n't see me . " " I did n't see you wake up . " " I was watching you . You made me think about the way you were when you were burning flax . In Fox 's Mills . Do you remember ? On the side of the hill ? " Her voice had a small catch . " I was thinking of it too . " " Were you ? " Suddenly she put out her hand to touch his . At the touch he turned his hand over and grasped her wrist . " Have you been sitting up with me ? " " Yes . " " How long was I asleep ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know what time it is . " He did not comment . But he began increasing his pressure onp217her wrist . It frightened her , and she had to force herself to look at his face . She made herself relax until his grip was so strong that her fingers spread apart and stiffened . He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to do that . " " It did n't hurt . " " It must have . " " A little , " she admitted . " I ' m sorry . " " Do you want to do it again ? " she asked suddenly . " Do you want me to ? " " I do n't know . " She felt that a spell had come upon her . Whether it was the darkness or his hand upon her wrist , or both , the fatigue of her long watch was transmuted . She was no longer afraid of him , and yet she was afraid . In that moment when he had taken hold of her wrist his dark eyes had lost uncertainty . " Sit down . " His hand guided her so that she sat beside him . She could feel herself trembling ; but if he felt it , he did not mention it . " What are you looking at ? " " There ' s a light , " she said . " Up beyond the fort , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame was lifting from the hilltop . He hoisted himself , without letting go her wrist , and looked at it . While he watched , it mounted rapidly , and sank again . " That ' s Indian fire . " " What does it mean ? " " I do n't know . It makes you realize we ' ve got no way of tellingif the fort surrenders . They might come down any day . " " Yes . " " Are you afraid ? " The fire dropped , before she could answer . In a moment it was gone . They were just they two again , in the low-ceilinged room , with the wide bed and its swelling feather mattress.  | " Tired ? " " I was . " He was watching the small oval of her face , with its dark hair . As she spoke her lids closed and the curves of her lips softened and filled . She sat beside him as if entranced . She could not stir for the swelling blood ; she felt it in her helplessquiet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenlyhe let go her wrist , and she raised both hands to her temples , pushing the hair back . She turned her face to him . He saw that she was tremulous , half shrinking . " Lana . " " Yes , Gil . " " When I was up there , I kept thinking about you . " " Did you ? " " About what it would be like coming home . " The pause drew out . Her heart started beating . He said quietly , " Are you coming ? " " If you want . " " Yes . " She got up slowly from the bed . Her fingers had a feeling of fullness as she took the laces of her short gown . She met his eyes and flushed painfully , and slowly . It was no use to think that he was her husband . He was a strange person who had acquired a right ; and she felt completely without power or desire to thwart him . But her instinct made her turn from him towards the far corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't go away . " She hesitated . " Turn around . " Again she obeyed . Then her hands went to her hair . " No , " he said . He was smiling now . His eyes were deliberate . " Leave it for last , " he said . She felt the last drop of strength going out of her . It almost made her cry out as she surrendered . She pulled away the lacesp219of the short gown , put it back over her shoulders , and let it drop from her bare arms . The lamp put a soft shine on her skin as she bent her neck and undid her petticoat . It fell round her ankles . For an instant she stood so , half bent , in its encircling rough folds . Then she stepped from it , timidly , and for a brief moment encountered his eyes , her hands raised tentatively to undo her hair . She had no will of her own under his deliberate and amorous dominance ; and she seemed held for an eternity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers flew to the pins , loosening them and letting her hair fall of its own weight down her back . Her breath came out of her breast with a shudder , and the pins dropped from her hair with a little sprinkle of sound on the broad planks . She stood quite still with her hands hanging limply at her sides , the palms turned childishly forward . For a moment more Gil watched her . Then he smiled slowly , stretched out his hand , and pressed it down over the small flame of the Betty lamp . AT HERKIMER FORTThe same evening , across the river in Fort Herkimer , Emma Weaver sat on the hearth considering all the things on her mind . What chiefly troubled her was the effect this garrison life was having on her oldest son . John had turned fifteen during the winter and grown fast . Already he was almost as tall as his mother , and since he had been issued an old French musket and appointed to regular sentry go , he considered himself a man . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell that in the last few days he no longer acknowledged her authority in his personal affairs . She had only to look up from her shed against the stockade wall and see him passing , lanky and rawboned , with stiff strides back and forth upon the walk , to know that John had passed beyond her reach . And when he came in from his duty and sat down to supper she saw the impatience in his face to be through with the meal and get off to the blockhouse on the east , where the squad of soldiers bunked and where he could listen to what he now considered man 's talk . The rough laughter , in the evenings , would pass heavily across the enclosure . Emma did n't mind man 's talk . Men together were entitled to their own ways of fun ; but John was too young yet . Careless ideas took hold too hard . And with the way the place was crowded , so that there was no privacy , she was afraid that John would get entangled with some girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and there were plenty of times when she had seen John , with the exhibitionism of the first impulse of manhood , stretching himself out in the sun before the blockhouse . He would take off his shirt , like the other men , baring his skinny torso , and drawing deep arching breaths with his chest , while he pretended to doze . So far , she thought , he had not made a shine at any particular girl . It was just the idea of manhood getting at him now . But there were one or two girls her maternal eye had noticed watching John . Young Mary Reall for one , the Realls ' oldest . She had no special urge against the girl , except that the Realls were idle , shiftless , loose-thoughted people , and if John were to marry early he ought to marry a girl with a settled way of seeing things . She wished George would come back so she could put the matter in his hands . George was sure to stamp on any nonsense . For all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put a curb on the boy , as it had curbed her own quick temperin their first married days . The Realls , two partitions down , all reveled in the life . There was no steady work to do . They had no cattle to look after . Mrs. Reall eased about all day , letting the brats run wild . Peebles , the baby , had been weaned , and scurried like a puppy all over the parade ground on his hands and knees . In the evening he had to be hunted up and brought to bed , but Mary had taken on that duty . Mary was doing all their cooking , and it was also Mary who swept out their eight-foot square of space when she could borrow a broom , shook up the hemlock bedding , and saw that one of the boys carried their night 's pail of slops to the dumping ground outside the stockade . It was a comfort to have a child at last grow up , and Mrs. Reall let herself luxuriate . She had anotherbaby on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reall was fourteen now , a colorless girl , with light brown unbraided hair down her back . She had her father 's rather pointed and effeminate features , but in her narrow face they were appropriate . On the rare occasions when excitement or heat or worry brought color to her face , it startled one who knew it , seemingbeautiful . Not until the gradual cramped settling down of all the people had she noticed the lads being handed out guns . There were thirty boys , and only seven guns , and looking at them while she leaned idly against the wall of the shed , her eyes had singled out John Weaver . Like the other boys he looked excited and tense . It would be an honor to be given a musket by the army sergeant  --  a man who knew war and men and guns . He was a grizzled old fellow with a swollen red nose and a lewd mouth and sharp eyes , and he lined the lads up before him and learned their names and looked at them . John Weaver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sergeant , but he also felt that people were watching his hack . He sent a sidelong estimating glance round the stockade , and met Mary Reall 's gaze . He did not show that he recognized her . He let his eye run past , quickly faced front , and colored to his hair . It had surprised him to see how she had grown . Her faded cotton short gown was tight over her breast and her long slender legs looked less slatty . " You first , " said the sergeant , and tapped John with the point of his forefinger . John turned quite white and weak and unbelievinglystepped forward to accept the musket . Though some of the boys were older , he had been singled out the first , He felt the envious stares of the other boys on his back , as surprised as himself , then , following the sergeant 's nod , went forward into the door of the blockhouse , walking a little stiffly like a young clog , into the company of men . Mary Reall did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , thinking about how often she used to meet John Weaver up in Deerfield and how he had seemed to her just any dirty boy . But now she saw how tall he had become , how his shoulders had begun to fill at the back like a man 's ; and it came to her with a sense of awe that she had been brought up almost next door to him , so that in a sense she shared the honor of his first promotion . When she went inside their hut , she was ashamed to see that supper had not yet been started . Mrs. Reall snickered when the fact was pointed out . " What difference ? " she wished to know . " What difference ? " Mary could not say rightly even to herself . But there was a dim apprehension that if John could do a man 's part it was time for her to think of a woman 's . She set to work at supper , and then cleaned out all the magpie mess of their inhabiting , picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusty earth of the floor , shaking them and hanging them up , and borrowing a broom from the next shed to sweep with . " I declare , " said Mrs. Reall . " You ' ve made it look real homey . " Mary felt proud and tired , but also ashamed when she was through and , looking up , beheld John , for the first time , marching back and forth across the opposite sentry walk . His beat took him behind the church , so that she saw him first at one end , then the other . She could have cried because they had not even a tallow dip that she could light , for him to see her work , and herself sitting in the entrance . Instead she had to move over to another door and stand there , trying to be noticed by him while at the same time she kept out of sight of the people whose light she had unobtrusively borrowedIt was there that Emma first noticed her , and it was there also that John saw her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting interior of the stockade as he was to the outside and faceless night . And on being relieved he went back to the blockhouse the long way , passing the hut , and finding her still there . " Why , hello , " he said carelessly , " ai n't that you , Mary Reall ? " " Hello , " she said , with an effort at surprise . " I had n't seen you before , John . How are you ? " " You did n't ? " he could n't help contradicting her . " I thought you was watching when they passed the muskets out . " " Well , I was , " she said . " But I did n't notice anyone particular . " He was huffed . But he did n't like to say he was the first selection . So he said , " I hope you ' re all well . " " Nicely , " she said . " And you ? " " We ' re fine , " he said . " It 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this morning . " " It ' s so crowded , " Mary said . " You know how it is . " " Yes , " he said . " We ' re awful crowded . " He paused a moment , then shouldered his musket awkwardly . " Well , I got to report to Sergeant , " he said , and stalked off . " See you again , maybe . " Mary watched him go . Then she hurried back to her own space and crept in over the sleeping bodies of her family . She lay down in the corner space reserved for her , glad that there was no candle now . For she was crying , and wondering what in the world had made her talk the way she had . The fort was a stifling place . The twelve-foot pointed logs of the palisade cut off what air might move . The bark-sheathed roofs of the sheds , only a foot over the people 's heads , were them only shelter against the sun , which burned through the heavy air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , whose stone walls kept it relatively cool , the air grew so stale that people Deft it for the outdoor heat.  | The life was enervating ; there was no chance to exercise , except to walk round the fields in sight of the stockade , keeping a safe distance from the woods or fields of standing corn that might give cover to an Indian . They dared go only to the nearest farms , since the garrison could offer them no protection beyond the walls . And after their first few morning chores were performed , the pails emptied in the ditch , the sheds brushed out , and the water drawn . there was nothing left to do but get their meals and talk . Even the talking petered out . There was not a family who did n't have a father or brother or son in the army that had gone west with Herkimer . Once the first conjectures had been interchangedand the family news caught up with , nothing remained to be talked about except the heat . They had no news from the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no news from the east . All they could do was to listen and wait , and watch with a growing concern for the first possible appearance of the enemy . Only the squad of Massachusetts soldiers in the blockhouse kept up a kind of conversation in their nasal Yankee voices ; but they kept their talk to themselves . They feared and disliked the Palatinesas much as the Palatines disliked them . Most of the time their captain , who commanded at the fort , went over the river to pass the time with Colonel Weston , at Fort Dayton , returning after supper in the dusk , giving the countersign outside the gate , marchingthrough in his rust-colored coat and cocked hat , looking neither to left nor to right , as if he held his breath against a troublesome smell , until he reached the blockhouse . He passed through the guardroom with a curt good-night and mounted to his quarters in the upper room . The people could see his shadow there at times , drinking brandy by himself  --  or sometimes he leaned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how quickly all these things became familiar parts of their existence , as if they had spent long lives already in a confined space . It made them apathetic , resigned , and fearful , and the soldiers spoke contemptuously about the German race.  |p225In  the midst of it , Mary and John continued their gradual approachin a kind of hushed expectancy . They moved their separatelives through the crowdedness and the dirt and the hostility as if they made a mist in which they apprehended each other 's shapes , dimly . Yet the meetings had poignance that only two such beginnerscould be aware of . The time when Mary , rising in the middle of the night , heard the sentry steps halt overhead and recognized them for his , and realized that he must have heard her stirring , was mysterious and intimate ; and the next morning when she encountered him at the well and they said good-morning to each other with formal politeness , they saw in each other 's face that both had shared it . In spite of Emma Weaver 's doubts , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of the sixth , when , long past sunset , a boat was rowed across from Fort Dayton and the news of the retreat delivered . Then , three hours later , the first bateaux had arrived with GeneralHerkimer . The fort had been hailed . The gate opened , and the general was carried in past the waiting silent people , holding torches here and there , to the church . After the gates were closed the people moved up to the church windows and talked softly to those who had their beds inside , and learned that the general was wounded in the leg . The men who had brought him lay down in the western blockhouse and would not answer any question . They slept like animals . In the next few hours other boats arrived . One of the first brought George Weaver home , and John was one of the garrison sent to help him to the fort . As he entered with his father , he saw Mary standing beside the gate , her eyes searching the faces of the new arrivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family she had the interest to look for her father . He helped put his father down on the hemlock bed and stood back while his mother unwrapped the bandage from his chest . His father said , " Hello , John . "  | " Hello , " said John . Emma said , " I ' 11 tend to Pa . You ' d better get back where you belong . Cobus can fetch me things . " " I will , " said John . He looked down on his father 's big body hesitantly . " Where ' d you get the gun , son ? " Emma said , not without pride , " He ' s one of the watch . " " You ' d better get along . " His father lay back and groaned as Emma ruthlessly pulled away the cotton . Then he opened his eyes and met John 's . " What ' s on your mind , son ? " " Did Christian Reall ... ? " He saw his mother 's back stiffen . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacNod ' s outside . He ' 11 know . " George closed his eyes . Without opening them he said almost apologetically , " I got this at the first beginning , son . " John left them with a sudden realization that they might like to be alone . He returned to the gate where the schoolmaster sat in his tattered black coat , hatless and unshaven , a venomous kind of terror still printed on his face . He looked up at John 's question . " Kitty Reall ? " he said . " You want to know where Kitty Reall is ? Well , I can tell you . He 's laying with his face over a log . He ' s scalped . But he ai n't half of what there is to see . . . . " John said savagely , " You know he ' s dead ? " " I ' m telling you .... What do you think ? They ai n't satisfied with just killing . I never saw Indians before . It ai n't war . My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the church . She was watching him still , her thin pale face a little lowered , looking out from her brows . A wave of sick pity went over John and he walked up to her , taking her arm without a word . She did n't protest , but went with him quietly . As he walked her forward he kept searching for a place they could be private in . But there was no unoccupied cor-p 227 ner within the stockade , till it occurred to him to look up at the ; entry walk . All the men were round by the gate , looking down over the points of the palisades at the river . " Come up with me , " said John , and climbed the ladder . They could stand in the angle of the walk made by the palisade and the blockhouse wall . No one could see them from below . John waited for her , with his eyes on the faceless night beyond the stockade . She came up quietly beside him on her bare feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the nearest to him she had been since he had first become aware of who she really was . Her dress touched his side , and through the dress he could feel the slim round hardness of her body . Her hair had a faint smell of its own , like spice over the body scent . She waited for him to speak . She had not yet said a word on her own part . But she leaned beside him against the stockade , taking one point between her breasts like a spear , and when he turned his head she did not turn hers . " Mary , " he said . " Yes . " She waited again ; but when he could not go on she asked quietly , " Did you hear anything about Father , from that man ? " " Yes . " It seemed an awful thing to say . As if he were killing Christian Reall with his own words . " He ' s dead , is n't he ? " She was making it easy for him . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that he might have expected . But she turned suddenly to him , so that he saw her face oval against the peeled logs of the blockhouse . " It was kind of you , John , to find out . I would n't have known how to ask . " " It ' s nothing . I wanted to help . "  | " I ' m grateful to you . " He felt himself grow stiff and his voice tightened . " It 's awful . But , Mary , I 'll always be willing to help you . Whatever there is you need , you ' 11 let me know . I think you ' re the finest girl in German Flats . " It was n't what he had set out to say , but he meant it . And she was standing just as stiff as he . " You 've been so good , " she was saying . " 1 ' 11 always remember how good you 've been , John . " " I wanted to tell you myself , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She bent a little towards him and they kissed each other , briefly . He pulled back quickly , and then , as she looked at him , held out his hand . She put her own in it and they held hands for a moment . Then he said , " I ought to get back to the gate . " " Yes , John . " " You ' d better go down here , and I ' 11 go down the walk . " They stood silent for a moment and he added , " It would look better . " " Yes , John . " She went down under his eyes , shy and swift , and he turned round the sentry walk , marching openly with his musket on his arm . It was a wonderful thing to have a girl like Mary Reall . It made him feel protective , as if the musket really meant something . As if Sergeant had picked him out for the very purpose . And it was a wonderful thing to have someone accept your opinions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be betrothed , he thought . MARINUS WILLETTAs the wounded were brought into the stockades , and the last of the Palatine and Canajoharie companies departed for their own precincts , a pall of terror settled on German Flats . Even the gar-I risons in the two forts became irascible and bitterly sarcastic about the German race . Everyone thought it was only a matter of days before the Tories and Indians would be among them . Word got round that among the wounded at Dr. Petry 's house was a man who had been scalped , and many people were moved by a morbid curiosity to see him . He turned out to be George Walter , a stout German farmer living below Fall Hill , well known for his good humor . It had not deserted him now . He was entirelywilling that people should come and look at him and offer him drinks behind the doctor 's back . " Ja , ja , " he would say . " I was lying behind a tree , and the Indian comes and shoots me , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top off mine head , and he goes away mit it . He thought I was dead . " He would pause to grin , and say , " I thought I was dead too , " as if that were a peculiarly funny coincidence . It was that grin that was described around the settlements . They said his face had lost all its fatness and the features seemed on the point of running out of his chin , and that when he grinned all his features seemed to get together there , down below his face . He did it so much that the stitches tore out and the doctor had to work on him all over and lock him up on the top floor . But even so , small boys climbed the maple tree across the road to look at him through the window . Other sufferers , less picturesque than Walter , had circumstantial stories of Tories recognized in the opposing side . People began to repeat from them how Ritter had been dragged off by two Indiansand how the Indians had been driven off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cut Ritter 's throat with his own hand . There were stories of some Scotch Highlanders in Sir John Johnson 's regiment scalping the militia just as if they were Indians themselves . A few people made feeble efforts to the effect of combating these horrors . Domine Rozencrantz read in church from the Ninety-first Psalm .  --   | " He shall cover thee with his feathers , and under his wings shalt thou trust : his truth shall be thy shield and buckler . " Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day . " But the Lord 's presence was not an active thing like John Butler 's before Fort Stanwix . People in the stockades began to talk about how he used to be Sir William Johnson 's right-hand man when the Indians were taken care of , bribed and pampered , so that any man might take up land in safety , and Joseph Brant was just a neighbor . More than one man began to shake his head and think that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again . The members of the Committee of Safety in German Flats were well aware of the swing of popular feeling . On the ninth of August , Peter Tygert wrote the Albany Committee as spokesman for his district by virtue of his own survival . Demooth and Helmer and Joe Boleo had left Fort Stanwix on the night of the sixth , and it had taken them three days of circuitoustraveling to elude the Indian scouting parties . They brought news to German Flats of the increasing shortage of provisionsand ammunition . Colonel Gansevoort had put the garrison on a single daily ration . The one bright spot was the account of a sortie led by Lieutenant Colonel Willett against the Tory camp on the day of the battle . It was a daring raid and it resulted in the removalto the fort of all the munitions and food the enemy 's camp contained , together with Butler 's and Johnson 's papers and half a dozen flags . They spoke with admiration of Willett 's conduct . They said he was a cool , unhurried man . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely , that the Indians and the regulars were keeping a tight network of lines round the fort They said that in Butler 's papers they had found endorsements foi scalps taken , at eight dollars per scalp . When they got through , the sortie seemed a drop of victory that was ironical . Tygert , writing these things down , continued with the battle itself :  --   |p231Gen  . Herkimer is wounded ; Col. Cox seemingly killed ; and a great many officers are among the slain . We are surrounded by Tories , a party of Too of whom are now on their march through the woods ... . Gentlemen , we pray you will send us succour . By the death of most of our committee members , the field officers , and Gen. Herkimer being wounded , everything is out of order ; the people entirely dispirited ; our county at Esopus unrepresented , that we can not hope to stand it any longer without your aid ; we will not mention the shockingaspect our fields do show . Faithful to our country we remain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days after this letter had been dispatched by Helmer , a scout escorted two men into Fort Dayton . One of these was a young lieutenant named Stockwell ; the other was Lieutenant ColonelMarinus Willett . As soon as they arrived they were taken to Colonel Weston 's quarters , and he in turn immediately sent for Tygert , Demooth , and Dr. Petry . These three took comfort from the very look of Colonel Willett . He was standing before the fireplace , and at their entrance withdrew his hooked nose from the glass in his hand , a drop hanging from the tip of it , and eyed them with unwavering hard blue eyes . As he was being introduced to the three Committee members , the drop fell to his waistcoat . He said to them bluntly , " Gentlemen , I ' ve had you sent for to know what you ' ve written to Schuyler . " He nodded again when Tygert had repeated the gist of his letter to the Albany Committee . " You put it to them pretty strong . But they ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m going to see him myself . " He smiled at them . " Somebody needs to raise a stink , and Gansevoortseemed to think I could do it . " His big nose seemed to arch . " Just how bad are things up at Stanwix ? " asked Dr. Petry . " Bad enough . We 've got food enough for a while , but we ' re low on shot . Right now St. Leger ' s busy writing letters about what he 's going to do to us and to you people if we do n't surrender , But the troops are taking them right , We made a flag on the new Continental pattern and flew it over the flags we took in the sortie , and that tickled them . And then I thought to read them the passage in the Book of Joel . " His blue eyes twinkled close on either side of his high nose as he solemnly quoted :  --  " But I will remove far off from you the northern army , and will drive him into a land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , and his hinder part toward the utmost sea ; and his stink shall come up . ' " There was a commotion in the parade yard , and an orderly looked in to announce a dispatch rider . He entered with his papers in his hand . " Colonel Weston ? " " Yes . " " Papers from General Schuyler . " Weston did not ask to be excused . He immediately opened his letter . Then he looked up . " Schuyler ' s sending up General Arnold and Learned . He hopes to add the First New York Line . " There was a silence in the room through which the panting of the dispatch rider 's horse came heavily . They all looked at one another . Then Willett wiped his mouth . " Maybe you ought to give this lad a drink , " he suggested . " Yes , yes , " said Weston , and filled his own glass . He turned to Willett . " Do you think you 'll have to go down to headquarters , now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they do n't waste any time . Is that decent horse you spoke of ready yet ? " " He ' s outside . " They all went to the door , then walked to the gate after he mounted . He paused there , gathering up the reins . " Who do I have to pay if I spoil this horse ? " He grinned and kicked the horse into a canter before he was answered . They watched him down the road towards the creek ford . He sat straight in the saddle , like an electrified ploughman ; but as they saw his square shoulders disappearing under the lowp 233 maple branches they remembered the hardness of the blue eyes , and the big nose in the long face . He was n't the kind of man who would return without what he was after . " They ' 11 hear him even if they hold their fingers in their ears , " the doctor said . " What was that flag he was talking about , Mark ? Did you see it ? " Mark Demooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red and white ones , and a blue box in the upper corner , with thirteen white stars in a ring . They made it out of ammunition shirts , and a blue cloak , and a woman 's red petticoat . " He grinned thinly . " She ' s got to be a heroine with the men up there . They say it ' s the first time she ever took the petticoat off in an honest cause . " Tygert looked solemn . " I had n't heard of it before . It sounds like a fancy pattern for a flag , though . " NANCY SCHUYLERThe party of one hundred Tories that Mr. Tygert had mentioned in his letter to the Albany Committee materialized in the form of a party of fifteen who turned up on the thirteenth at Rudolph Shoemaker 's house . Shoemaker was an anomalous person . Before hostilities commencedhe had been a Justice of the Peace under the King . In ' 75 he had signed the Loyalist manifesto against sedition and treason . But he had not chosen to move west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relying on his kinship to Nicholas Herkimer , he had joined the German Flats Committee of Safety . Since then his public house had become a sort of neutralground , and it caused no particular surprise when the news went through the valley that the hostile party had taken up quartersthere.  | Captain Demooth first heard of it when he asked Nancy at suppertime where Clem Coppernol was . She flushed , as she always did when the captain asked her a direct question . " He said he was going up to Shoemaker 's . " " What ' s he doing there , do you know , Nancy ? " " He said there was some people from the westward . " Captain Demooth frowned , and Nancy , looking down on his dark head , saw his neat hands hesitate as they put the pudding on his plate . He hurried to finish his supper and then went out again . He said to his wife , " I ought to ask Weston about this , Sara . He may have heard something . " Mrs. Demooth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to her that this news , more than any other news , could have any importance in her life . She cleared away the dishes , washed them , wiped the table , and fetched Mrs. Demooth 's lamp , and then retired to her own corner of the room . Nancy Schuyler had not been happy in German Flats , though she had expected to be . She had thought the life would be excitingthere , with the soldiers in the two forts and the young men ' on the farms . In such a place she had supposed there would be unmarried men who might be interested in her . But such men seemed not to exist for Nancy , and , if there had been , Mrs. Demooth kept her so closely under watch that she would have had no opportunity . Her one moment of excitement had been that night in early winter when Gilbert Martin had stopped in with the deer meat and she had felt so sorry for him . Whenever she thought of that night , she felt a shiver take her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert Martin on that night ; at the time she had thought that he was in love with her . As she had sat in his arms , she had felt her very being swim into a high kind of happiness . And then abruptly , for no reason she had ever discovered , he had left her and gone home . Later she had recalled how her brother Hon Yost used to warn her against married men . He had said a girl should never put dependence in a married man . She supposed that must be Gilbert Martin 's trouble . Sometimes she wished that she could talk to Hon , who was the one member of her family who had ever understood her . Perhaps that was because , as he said himself , he was light-headed too . Nancy 's mother had made a visit at the end of the preceding year , coming , as she said , to see what kind of girl Nancy had grown into , and also to collect her daughter 's pay for the year , and Nancy had glowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so well to the captain 's wife . " I hope Nancy ' s satisfactory to you , Mrs. Demooth . " " Oh yes , Nancy means very well . " Mrs. Demooth used her chilly , lady voice ; but it had no effect on Mrs. Schuyler 's dark dominant Herkimer eyes . " She ' s never been lazy , " said her mother . " 1 ' m sure she earns every penny of her wages . Now , if you ' 11 kindly settle the account , Mrs. Demooth , I ' 11 get back to my brother , the general . " " Will you fetch my pocket , Nancy ? " Though Mrs. Demooth had not apparently noticed what Mrs. Schuyler said , Nancy was aware that she was impressed . She fetched the pocket and Mrs. Demooth took out three paper bills , saying , " Captain Demooth left the money in case you called . " Mrs. Schuyler looked at the bills . " Why , " she said , " these are n't pound notes . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re Continental dollars . They ' re five-dollar bills . " " They are pretty with those harps drawn on them , " Mrs. Schuyler said , " but I ' d rather have the money in English if you do n't mind . " " I ' m sorry , but it ' s all 1 have in the house . Of course , if you like , I ' 11 speak to Captain Demooth about it . But he says these are just as good . " " The contract called for three pounds a year , " Mrs. Schuyler objected . " I ' m not used to these new dollars . " " They ' 11 buy just the same , Mrs. Schuyler . As a matter of fact Captain Demooth said you were getting more than three pounds ' worth , but as we did not have the change and Nancy had been a good girl he said you might give her the change as a present if you did not want to take more . " That was what her mother wished to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' 11 buy her something with it . But , you know , I think she ' s better without money of her own . " The two women bowed to each other , and then Nancy walked out with her mother to the corner of the road . There they had parted . " Mrs. Demooth speaks highly of you , Nancy , " her mother had said with satisfaction . " I am pleased . Your uncle will be pleased . Be a good girl . " " Yes , Mother . " " You do n't get homesick , do you ? " " Oh no , " said Nancy . " Well , good-bye , daughter . " That was the way her mother always said good-bye . Calling Nancy " daughter , " as if the word were a gad she pricked her own heart with . But it was a relationship that had no meaning . Her mother did not really belong to her . She was the general 's sister . All her talk was about the general , or his big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never mentioned Nancy 's father . That was a mistake the general wished to have forgotten , since the man was dead . Nancy and her brother Hon were the only reminders of their mother 's indiscretion , for the other brother , Nicholas , was black-complexioned and quite steady . Mrs. Schuylernever talked about Hon any more than she did of her dead husband . Sometimes , sitting by herself in the corner of the room , Nancy could feel her heart swell with her own loneliness , and then she would pray that Hon might come down to German Flats as he had promised a year ago . She wished that he could write and she could read , so he might tell her what he was doing . He wasp237such a light-hearted man that Nancy felt that it would do her good just to hear what he was up to . Now , as she stitched away on her piece of handkerchief linen . she amused herself with remembering all the things she could about Hon Yost . She knew , for instance , that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of it  --  the Eighth King 's Regiment . And she remembered his last message . She had once repeated it to Mrs. Martin when they were in Deerfield . The very words came back to her . " He said he ' d try to fetch me an officer , too . " Her mouth curved over her sewing , and Mrs. Demooth , lookingacross the room , thought petulantly how easy it was for a simple-witted woman like Nancy Schuyler to be happy . It startled both Mrs. Demooth and Nancy when they heard the captain 's voice outside hailing Clem . " Where 've you been , Clem ? " " Up to Shoemaker 's . " " What did you go up there for ? " The captain sounded stern . Clem answered gruffly . " I heard there was some British there . I thought it would n't do no harm to hear what was going on . " " What were they doing ? " " Nothing much . " " Look here , Clem , if you do n't tell me what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to the guardhouse in the fort . " " Why do n't you ride over there yourself ? " the Dutchman said sourly . " Stop your impudence . " " They ai n't doing nothing but set around and drink . Ensign Butler has a paper he ' s reading out of . " " Butler ? " " What I said . " " John Butler ! No , he ' s a colonel . " " No , this is a young man . Nice-spoken , too . He 's Ensign Walter Butler of the Eighth King 's Regiment , he says . Wears a red coat . They all do , barring the Indians . " " How many are there ? " " Ten or a dozen . I did n't count . They was reading this paper saying how anybody going over to their side will be pertected . And anybody not will be cut up by the Indians . There was only four Indians , so I did n't put stock in that part . " The Eighth King 's . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nancy ! " she went out to the two men . " Clem , " she said breathlessly . " Did you see Hon ? " " Hon ? " Both men turned . Then Clem guffawed in the midst of his aura of rum . " Yes , by God ! I did see him . Why ? " But Nancy had stepped back into the house . Already she had made up her mind to do a desperate thing . She would go up and see Hon herself . It might not be safe for him to come so near the fort , so she would go to him at Shoemaker 's , no matter what Mrs. Demooth would surely say . She would n't even let them know . As she sat down on her stool her heart beat so fast that she was unable to thread the needle . She tried again and again , knowing that Mrs. Demooth 's unsympathetic eyes were watching her . Finally , in desperation , she merely pretended that she had succeeded . She made the motion of drawing the thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take fine stitches in the handkerchief seam . The color glowed in her soft cheeks . She realized that she had fooled Mrs. Demooth . She had never been clever like that before . It seemed like a good omen . Outside of the house the night was uninterrupted . Clem had gone off tipsily to his bed in the barn . The captain had hurried back to the fort . All through the grass crickets were singing . The rhythm of their united notes swung into the beat of Nancy 's heart , bringing the darkness close to her . All she need do was wait until Mrs. Demooth should go to bed , and Mrs. Demooth was already yawning.  |p239TORIES  AT SHOEMAKER'SIt was nearly a two-mile walk to Shoemaker 's . Nancy followed the road as fast as she could , but though she knew her direction , and had traveled the distance before , the darkness handicapped her . Now and then on a good patch of the road the ruts failed to guide her and she found herself walking in the rough grass at the side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life showed anywhereexcept the light of two torches that appeared in the main gate of Fort Dayton . But they were too far behind Nancy to look like more than sparks , and shortly after she had first noticed them , they vanished . With their going the intensity of blackness became deathly . Even the crickets were still , as if they felt the imminenceof storm . In her secretiveness she had pulled a dark shawl over her head , so that with her plain dress she was nearly invisible . A man rising suddenly in the darkness on the other side of the road never saw her at all , and she had time to shrink into the grass with the timid stillness of a deer . He was coming away from Shoemaker 's , and like herself he seemed in a hurry and anxious not to be noticed . She could not tell who he was , but she smelled the rankness of tobacco in his clothes and a strong breath of rum was left behind him after he had gone . Nancy waited until his footsteps had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not frightened , but she did not wish to be seen by anyone who might know her , lest the word of her adventuremight get back to Mrs. Demooth . She was too absorbed in her desire to see Hon to feel afraid . It took her half an hour to reach Shoemaker 's house . As shep240approached it she encountered more men coming away ; and one or two men overtook her , going in her own direction . The queer thing about them was that none of the men spoke . They moved furtively , and they seemed anxious even to avoid each other . Since her first encounter she had traveled more cautiously , listening for every footfall on the road , so that she had time enough to step out of the way , sometimes standing by the side of the road , and sometimesfinding one of the old river willows near enough to hide behind . Shoemaker 's house stood back a little from the road . When Nancy reached it , it was merely a darker square against the sky . The shutters were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by threads of light . The only sign of life was the recurrent faint mumble of voices . Nancy stood on the far side of the road , pressing herself against Shoemaker 's pasture fence . Now that she had come so far , doubts overcame her and she felt suddenly shy of Hon. It seemed to her that the business the men were conducting must be very important , and her original plan of walking up to the door and asking for Hon , if he were not outside , was quite impossible . She did not want to do anything that might embarrass him in front of so many people . Not that she thought that Hon would be annoyed with her ; but all her life she had been made to realize her unimportance before people . With the opening of the front door , she suddenly discovered herselffull in the light . She had one glimpse of the interior of the house . It was full of farmers , standing along the walls . They did not appear to be saying anything . Their faces looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door into Shoemaker 's taproom . Nancy could see through the door also , but only enough to have a flashing glimpse of a scarlet coat or two , and , beyond , the face of one man , pale , young , and dark-haired . He was addressing the gathering in a high , decisive voice . Then the men who had come out on the stoop closed the door , p 241 and the darkness was returned . As the men stepped off the stoop , Nancy felt herself seized from both sides . She was taken by the arms and hauled stiffly erect . She started to cry out , but a hand put over her mouth checked the cry . The men who held her did not move until the men leaving the house were well away down , he road . Then a voice said , " You come now . " She was led quickly towards the house , but not to the front door . They turned the corner to the left towards the kitchen porch . Nancy stumbled a little on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised , and bitterly ashamed that she should have been discovered and have been brought to Hon 's attention in so humiliating a fashion after she had tried to be so careful . She could not understand how the men had got so close to her . She had not seen them even when the door was open . And now on the porch boards their feet made hardly a sound . One spoke to the other , and she felt him taking hold of her with both hands , and as the other moved towards the door her nostrils were filled with a strong sweet greasy odor and she knew that the two men must be Indians . As the door opened she looked up at the man who held her . He was a powerful thickset man . He wore a red cloth headdress , with a single eagle feather hanging down over his left ear . From the waist up he was naked , his hairless chest beaded through the grease with tiny drops of sweat , so that the light shimmered on his skin with a bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes a strange parody of intelligence behind the red and yellow painting of his face . " You be good , " he said , and relaxed the pressure of his hands slightly ; but he did not let go of her . The door opened again , showing her the second Indian and a soldier in a scarlet coat . " You can let her go , " the soldier said to the second Indian . He looked down at her . His coat was unbuttoned . Between the flaps Nancy saw that his shirt was wringing wet . Ht blew out his breath . " God , it ' s good to get some fresh air . It smells like a Dutch funeral in there . Well , Missy , what do you wa here ? " Nancy flushed within the protection of her shawl . She tried find words . " All right , Missy , " the soldier said . " Nobody ' s going to hu you . " " I know , " Nancy replied . At the sound of her fresh young voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean to mak a bother , " Nancy went on . " I just heard my brother , Hon , w here and 1 have n't seen him for two years and I wanted to sa something to him . " The soldier said kindly , " You 've got a brother with us ? " Nancy nodded . " What did you say his name was ? " " Hon Yost . " " We ai n't got anybody named that with us . What ' s your name ? " Nancy Schuyler . " " Nancy is a nice name . " He hesitated , still looking at her . Then , as if he could n't help himself , he took his hands from his pelt and put the shawl back from her face . She stood in the light , hesitant and flushed , looking up at him with large eyes . Her full lips trembled a little . He seemed to miss the simpleness in her eyes . He kept looking at her face , her lovely mouth , her heavy yellow hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin dress . " Is your brother Jack Schuyler ? He looks a little like you . Not really , you know . Jesus ! " He drew his breath . " I have n't seen a pretty girl since I left Montreal , last April . " He seemed to recollect himself with an effort . " Jack ' s got yellow hair like you . Do you think he ' d be your brother ? " Nancy was staring in a trance . But her eyes were on the glittering sergeant 's stripes , on the red coat , and the white breeches , now stained from his passage through the woods . She did notp 243 see at all the eagerness of his face , the almost feverish brilliance of his eyes . " I do n't know , " she said timidly . " He had yellow hair . But I always called him Hon. " " That ' s Dutch for John . The Eighth is supposed to be all English . I ' 11 fetch him out , anyway . I ' d do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately at her . " You just stay here . " He put his hand on her shoulder , letting it slide down her arm as he turned away to the open door . " Where ' s that half-wit Schuyler ? " she heard him ask another redcoatedman . " What do you want him for ? " " His sister ' s outside . She wants to see him . " " His sister ? " The man laughed out loud . He disappeared in the throng and one of the Indians closed the door , leaving Nancy and themselves in darkness . She heard their catlike tread moving past her along the porch , and presently she made out their heads , shadowy silhouettes , staring east together from the steps . She had to wait quite a while before the door opened again . But it was not Hon Yost ; it was the soldier who had gone to look for him . " Jack ca n't get out right now , " he said . She asked timidly , " Did you tell him I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to wait . I told him I ' d look after you . " He leaned himself against the wall of the house and stared at her . He had left the door open a crack , so that the light shone on her , but when she moved he put his hand out . " Do n't move . Please . You do n't know how it is , in the woods . So long . You get half crazy with the heat , and the flies , and there 's nothing to see but men like yourself . You do n't know what it is for a man just to look at a pretty girl . " Nancy stood still . She could n't see his face now  --  only his brown hair over his ear in the edge of the light ; but she could see where his eyes were.  | He said , " I used to live down here . Down beyond Fort Dayton On the other side of the Canada Creek . I worked for an old woman named McKlennar . It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not think of anything to say . She was listening and looking for Hon. But the soldier 's voice sounded so unhappy that she turned her face a little towards him and smiled her slow smile , with its meaningless warmth . He said , " My name 's Jurry McLonis . " " Yes , Mr. McLonis . " She smiled again and he was silent for a time . Through the door the same decisive voice she had heard before came with the stilted precision of a man reading : For which reasons , the Indians declare , that if they do not surrender the garrison without further opposition , they will put every soul to death  --  not only the garrison , but the whole country  --  with out regard to age , sex , or friends ; for which reason it is become your indispensable duty , as you must answer the consequences , to send a deputation to your principal people , to oblige them immediately to what , in a very little time , they must be forced  --  the surrender of the garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christians , to protect you from the violence of the Indians . " Surrounded as you are by victorious armies , one half ( if not the greater part ) of the inhabitants friends to government , without any resource , surely you can not hesitate a moment to accept the terms proposed to you by friends and well-wishers to the country . " It ' s signed by John Johnson , D. W. Claus , and my father John Butler . It ' s plain honest sense , and the last chance you people will have to save your necks . I 'm going back day after to-morrow . Every man who goes with me gets a uniform coat , a musket if he needs it , pay in good English money , and a land bounty when this war ' s over . " Again the silence , and again the low mumbling of voices . " God , I 'm sick of hearing all that , Nancy . The same thing over and over for two days . " Jurry McLonis touched her arm . " Jack ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out where it 's quiet and 245 dark . " Her eyes turned to him , large and questioning and hesitantand foolish . " He told me to look out for you , you know . " " Yes , Mister . I do n't mind . While Hon ' s busy . " The steady sound of Butler 's voice had muddled her head . McLonis 's arm round her waist was comfortable to lean against . The . Indians moved over on the steps and glanced at them , and moved back . McLonis led her out , his arm tightening round her as she found the footing uncertain in the darkness . He took her behind Shoemaker 's barn . There he let her go and leaned against the log wall . But Nancy did not move away . She stood where he had left her , within reach of his arm , quite still , thinking that it was a long time to have to wait for Hon , but glad to be away from the house and the Indians . She could hear his steady breathingjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and swung in front of him . His free hand came behind her back , forcing her against him so hard she thought she could almost feel the logs through his body . She felt his face feeling for hers , his chin scraped across her shoulder in the opening of her dress , moved over her cheek , and his mouth fastened upon hers . For an instant , startled and dizzy , she was inert against his chest . Then under the pressure of his arms her strength came to life . She put her arms around him , pulling herself even closer to him , and lifted her face . She was silent as an animal . When suddenly he let her go , she stood before him trembling and still ; but when he put his hands out again , she moved hard into his embrace . Her hands pressing into the small part of his back became clumsy . Her breath came out with a little moan at the end and her breast arched . She had no recollection of Hon left , only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " You . . . " without finding any other word to add to it . Nancy lay in the long grass . The soldier was standing up , like a tower in the darkness rising from her feet . For an instant he was motionless . Then without as much as saying good-bye , he broke into a run away from the barn . Not towards the house , but back up the hill from the river . For an instant her disordered senses followed his crashing progress through the underbrush . Abruptly , the sound ceased , and Nancy , coming to herself at last , knew that something had gone wrong at Shoemaker 's . She heard men shouting , and feet stamping on the other side of the barn as men ran past . She sat up in the grass , fumbling for her shawl . Her hair was snarled and full of grass . Panic swept over her , and without thinking of Hon , only of the instinctto get hidden at home , she found the shawl and started running towards the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , " There goes one ! " A musket roared behind her head , but she was too close to hear the bullet . She ran frantically , sobbing , and yanking at her skirt . For a moment she heard men pursuing , then she was out down the road and going for her life . She did not stop until she was nearly home , and she stopped then only because she could not run another step . She veered from the road like a hurt deer and fell full length . She kept drawingher breath in great sobbing gasps . She was still there when she heard the men tramping towards her down the road . Her first instinct was for renewed flight , but immediately afterwards she drew down into the sheltering brush like a hare in its form , to stare with horrified eyes at the approachinggroup . Several of the men were carrying torches , and under the smoky light their bodies made a dark throng in the road , with the willow limbs like arms lifted above them . They came without talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soldiers from the garrison at Fort Dayton , with the prisoners between them . With them , at the head of the procession , Nancy 's appalled eyesp 247 recognized Captain Demooth , and Gilbert Martin , his arm still bandaged , and one of the officers from the fort , a Colonel Brooks , who had sometimes come to supper at the Herter house . But as the files passed her she took her eyes from them and stared into the prisoners ' faces . The first was the man who had been reading in Shoemaker 's house , the man she had heard addressed as Ensign Butler . It was her first sight of Walter Butler , with his whittled attorney 's face , black hair cut short , and black eyes . His mouth reminded her a little of McLonis 's , long and thin-lipped , but , unlikeMcLonis 's , tipped with a passion of contempt . He was dressed in a scarlet coat with an ensign 's tabs on the shoulders , and the men who followed him between the tramping files of Massachusetts soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLonis , but he was not with them . He must have escaped . Her heart rose , even in her fright , until , as the last of the white prisoners passed , she saw her brother . Even in the uncertain light Hon Yost looked as she rememberedhim , his yellow hair reaching to his shoulders , his straight features and red cheeks , and the blue eyes , irresponsible . He walked jauntily , as if he had n't a fear in the world ; but watching the faces of the garrison , Nancy sank down still lower in the brush , and bit her hand to keep from crying aloud . Before she could think what she should do , the tail of the procession was going by with the last torch shining on four captured Mohawk Indians . The light flashed over their painted cheeks , picked out a wolf 's head on the chest of the first , a drooping eagle 's feather in his headdress . The light made a dark shine on their oiled skins . It was not till long after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water of the ford , that Nancy stumbled to her feet . The Herter place was dark when she reached it , but , though she was still sobbing softly , she moved as quietly as she couldp248round the corner of the barn . She had crossed halfway to the house when Clem Coppernol rose up in front of her , surrounding them both with his fog of rum . " Who ' s that ? " he asked unsteadily . As she tried to elude him , he stumbled forward and caught her skirt . He used it to help himself off his knees . " ' S a pullet anyways , " he mumbled . " ' S you Nancy , ai n't it ? " " Yes , " she whispered . " Been out . I seen you going . I seen you . You ca n't lie . " He nodded against her shoulder . " Been to Shoemaker 's . See Hon ? " She shivered and the tears gathered under her lids . " No . No . I want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I ' 11 let you go , " he said slyly . " Yes . I saw a soldier . " He chuckled . " Nice girl . So awful nice with me , ai n't you ? Bet a dollar you got laid . " " No , " she said frantically . " Did , though . Or you would n't act this way . Where ' s Hon ? " Her sobs started again . " They caught him . They 've taken him to the fort . What are they going to do , Clem ? " " That ' s good . Good business . " He scratched his head with his free hand . " Probably they ' 11 hang him . Hang the bunch . Yes , sir . " Nancy managed to whisper , " Please let me go . " " Maybe I will , and maybe I wo n't . You got to be nice to me now , or I ' 11 tell . " " I ' 11 be nice . " " I ' m still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I ai n't real drunk , neither . " He paused to wipe his mouth " You ' re a good girl just the same , Nance . I ' ll stand up for you . If you 've got fixed , I 'll marry you if you want . "  |p249Nancy  sprang out of his grasp and fled for the house . He made no move to chase her . He was open-mouthed in the darkness , trying to recollect what he had just said . Long after she had crept inside the house , he remembered . " By God ! " he said aloud . " I am drunk . " DEATH OF A BRIGADIERThe unexpectedness of Butler 's capture and the ease with which it had been accomplished did much to hearten the Committee members of German Flats . It had had an immediate effect upon the people , checking all danger of wholesale desertion to St. Leger 's camp . Word got out about when the prisoners were permitted to exercise and curious people went to look at them in their regimental coats , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fort . It seemed a wonder to them . The last time they remembered Walter Butler was on that day in the spring two years before when he had ridden up the valley with Sheriff White to cut down the liberty pole in front of Herkimer Church . Then he had been a man to fear , as all the Johnsons and Butlers were , with the law in his fist . Now they saw that he was a slight man of nervous action , who took his exercise deliberately , making ten circles of the parade ,  --  they counted them , always ten ,  --  looking neither right nor left , his pale face inclined slightly forward . His soldiers might stop and chat with the guard or with the Palatines themselves ; I-Ion Yost sometimes greeted former acquaintances and asked about his family ; but Walter Butler seemed unaware of his surroundings . To the spectators he was more like the four Indians who always kept apart by themselves , not even speaking to each other . Gilbert Martin , like the others , stopped one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Captain Demooth . He found the captain at the Herter house and asked , " When will those men be tried ? " " They 're under military law . They 'll have to be court-martialed , Gil . And Weston wants to wait for General Arnold . Technically he ' s under Arnold now , you see . " Gil said , " I should think it was better to get it over with . Some people there at Shoemaker 's will lose their nerve . " The captain smiled a little . " There are plenty of witnesses who wo n't . You , for one . That ' s why I sent for you the other night . " His face grew serious . " And personally , Gil , I ' m just as glad to have it put into the army 's hands . I used to know the Butlers . They 've got powerful friends . Some of our Committee would be afraid to convicthim if the responsibility was on our shoulders . " " What will they do to him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demooth said dryly . " How about the others ? " " I do n't know about them . They were under orders . Prison , I guess . Except Hon Yost Schuyler . He ' s a deserter . He ' s on the rolls of the Third Company of Tryon militia . We ca n't let him off light . " " Has Nancy seen him ? I 've heard she was very fond of him . " " Mrs. Demooth ' s been having trouble with Nancy . She was hysterical when she heard about it . We thought it was better for her not to see her brother . Her mother thought so , too . " " He 's just a half-wit , " said Gil . " I do n't see why he should be shot . " " It ' s not in our hands , Gil . And as I said before , I ' m glad it is n't . How ' s your arm ? " " It 's doing fine . But I ca n't use it much yet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Mrs. McKlennar wants to know where she can hire a man . Our wheat ' s begun dropping . " " So has everybody 's . If it is n't reaped inside the next two weeks we ' 11 lose more than half the crop . " He shook his head.  | " I do n't know where you can find a man . There are plenty doing nothing in the forts . But they do n't want to work . They do n't want to do anything until Arnold gets here . " Gil said , " Yes . " He hesitated . " Mrs. McKlennar wanted to know if you 'd heard how General Herkimer was . She thought she might be able to rent one of his slaves for a week . " " I have n't heard from Herkimer for several days . His leg got mortified . And Petry ca n't get down to see it , so we do n't know much . " " Do you think it would be all right if I went down to see him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some news . You can tell him from me we ' ve heard the First New York has got as far as Klock 's . " Gil went down on the brown mare next morning . It was the first time he had ever been at Herkimer 's house , and the size of it , together with the well-kept fields , impressed him . A full-breasted negress met him at the door and said , " Gener'l ain ' seein ' nobody , " in an impressive voice . Gil was ready to turn away when the right-hand door opened into the hall and Mrs. Herkimer came out . " What is it , Frailty ? " " Dish yer man he ' s askin ' fo ' de Gener'l , " Frailty said contemptuously . Gil removed his hat . " I ' m from Mrs. McKlennar , ma'am . She wanted me to come down and find out if you could rent her a slave for a few days to get her wheat in. 1 work for her myself , but my arm 's no good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were you at the battle ? " " Yes , " said Gil . The , pained look in her eyes increased . But she stepped back through the door . " Come in . Honnikol ' s always glad to see anyone who was with him up there . "  |p252The  general 's big bed had been set up in the northwest room with its head to the fireplace so that he could look through the windows towards the river . Herkimer was wearing a flannel nightshirtopen at the throat , showing the black hair on his chest , and to Gil , seeing him against the pillows , his shoulders looked heavier than he remembered them .. Herkimer 's face was drawn , the mouth set , and it was obvious that he suffered a good deal of pain . But the black eyes stared keenly at Gil as he said , " Good morning . " His wife came over to the bed with a lighted candle for his pipe and he sucked on the stern without turning his eyes from Gil 's . " You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . How ' s Mrs. McKlennar ? They keep me cooped up here , and I do n't hear anything , not even how my neighbors are . I ' m done with  - -  old Herkimer  - -  he lost his army . . . . Look ! Are n't you the lad who picked me up mit Peter Bellinger and histed me up the hill ? " Gil turned brick red . It seemed to him a miracle that Herkimer , badly wounded , in the midst of that confusion , should remember a strange face . He nodded . Herkimer said nothing either . Then he held his hand out . His grip was still strong . " Sure , " he said suddenly in a deep voice , " you can have a nigger . " He looked across at his wife , who had sat down again in a corner , looking on with swimming eyes . " Tell Trip he 's to go back with  --  what ' s your name , young man ? " " Gilbert Martin . " " Tell him with Mr. Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ll lick him myself when I get on my two feet . " He made a gesture with his hand , as if he brushed the business aside , and at the same time he lifted his eyes to Gil 's . His eyes were tired and sad and , in a queer way , very shy . " Will you be honest with an old man ? " As Mrs. Herkimer made a cluck of protest , he shook his head . " I know . I ' m only fifty- one , Maria , and young women do n't like their husbands to say how old they feel . " His smile made Gil feel the sadness more . " But it makes me feel old , nobody coming down here , nobody telling me anything . The army gets licked and I am brought down here in a boat and left here , ja . Tell me , Martin , what they ' re saying about me . " Gil did not know what to say , but the general did not help him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They ' re saying nothing . " " And what do they think ? " " I do n't know , " said Gil miserably . Then he remembered the knoll before the second charge . " But , by God , there are plenty who were up there who wish you were back and kicking , Mr. Herkimer . " " Kicking . " He looked down at his leg . He looked up again and sucked on his pipe . " I let myself get into a mess . I did n't have the insides to stand up to all those downriver gentlemens . This house , it was a mistake to build a big house just because I could . They did not like it . " He came back to the point suddenly . " It was a good fight , though , once the fools was killed or run away . " The room was silent . Finally , Herkimer asked from the pillows , " What 's the news ? What are they going to do with Butler ? " " They ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedict Arnold . He got up to Quebec , and then he did n't take it . I heard he was coining . Trip heard it in Frank 's across the river , " he added bitterly . His wife spoke . " Honnikol , people do n't think the way you think they do . " " No ? Hardly anybody comes here . Only Warner and Peter Und John Roof , because he ' s staying with me here . " He shifted his shoulders . " When ' s Arnold coming ? " " Captain Detnooth said to tell you the First New York was at Klock 's last night , They ought to come by here this morning . "  | Herkimer 's eyes brightened . " That ' s good , " he said . " Ja . Maria , open the window , so I can hear them when they come . " His depression lifted and for a while he talked to Gil about the early days in the valley . He talked about Oriskany and the mein and what he had seen during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many individual acts he had seen , until Gil remembered how he had sat up on his saddle throughout the whole six hours , in plain sight of everything . He was still talking when they heard the first sound of the troops . At the moment it was like the distant ruffle of a drummerpartridge in the still air . Then , suddenly , all three people in the room recognized the beat of drums . They heard the slap of bare feet running round the corner of the house from the slave cabins ; a boy 's voice shouting down at the dock . " I can see them . " The voice was shrill . Some of the negro children took it up . " 1 can see them . 1 can see them . " Inside the room the three people stared at each other . For a moment all the yelling had obscured the sound of the drums . Mrs. Herkimer moved towards the window . " Nein , Maria . Let them make a noise . I feel the same way also . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see them . " Maria Herkimer 's eyes filled again . Then she looked at Gil . " Do you think we could drag his bed to the window ? " " No , " said Herkimer . " Call in the men . Trip , Joseph . Martin ' s got a bad arm . " Gil understood her silent pleading . She could n't bear to have anyone else in the room . " Sure we can drag him . " It took all their strength , he with his bad arm , she a slight woman , but they got the bed beside the window , and Herkimer heaved up on his elbow . The drums , even from across the river , had now mastered the raised voices of the children . " It 's the flan , " said Herkimer . The staccato double tap brought the shivers to Gil 's spine . These drums had n't the rattletrap sound of the  --  militia . He felt courage as the flam was repeated , three times , a pulse between each beat p 255 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening bar of " Roslyn Castle . " With the pronouncement of the rhythm a sigh issued from the negroes ' throats . Herkimer 's fingers started picking at the blanket . " Fifes , " he said suddenly . " Ach Gott ! It is the army . " Through the beating of the drums the squealing of the fifes swept over the river like a cold wind , and close on the heels of the sound , made small by the distance , but clear against the dull green hillside , the troops came marching up the Kingsroad . They made a compact blue stream above the fence rails , keeping close ranks , their rifles slanting rays of wood and iron on their shoulders , their cocked hats in rows for the eye to see . They marched like men who were accustomed to covering the ground , with a long stride , their faces stretched forward against the pull of the blanket rolls . They reached along the straight stretch of the road , two hundred and fifty men behind the drums , and slowly covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the line , and wagons passed to the same pace , the teamsters alert , keeping their horses up to the mark . Anotherbreak and two light cannon bounced on their light carriages . Behind them rode a group of officers , their horses ' heads on the edge of the white powdery rise of dust . Then the rear guard . Fifty men . Already the drums had passed from sight behind the river willows . But the fife sound floated behind . Long after it was still and gone , Gil thought he could hear the sound of them . He turned suddenly to Herkimer 's voice . " Ach Gott . One gompany . If they had only sent me up one gompany . His face did not change . He did n't hear the quiet crying of his wife . Gil helped to move the bed back to its first place so nothing showed that it had been moved but the scrapes of its feet on the wide boards . Then he left . He did not say good-bye to the general , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herkimer followed him into the hall . " Trip will go back with you , Mr. Martin . God bless you . " She reached up both her hands and took his face and kissed him . Outside , Gil looked round him for the negro . He was surprised to see him coming from the ferry with an officer he had just rowed over , a fresh-faced young man in blue regimentals carrying a bag . He asked Gil , " Is this the Herkimer house ? " Gil nodded , and Mrs. Herkimer came out again to the hall . " I ' m Maria Herkimer , sir . " " General Arnold 's compliments . I had instructions to stop in at General Herkimer 's and see whether I might do anything to help him . " He took his hat off , bowing . " Robert Johnson , ma'am . Surgeon , pro tem , First Regiment , the New York Line . " Waiting for Trip to reappear with his belongings , Gil overheardtheir voices . " Come in , doctor . fa . You can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold far behind ? " " Ought to come by to-night , sir . He ' s been in a tearing hurry . " " It was kind of him to send you here . " " He was particular . Said something about you being too good to lose . Said it must have been a great piece of fighting . " Herkimer 's voice deepened. " fa . He should have been there . " Another silence . The doctor , saying in his fresh young voice , " I see . I see . " " You think it should come off ? Petry said I should keep it . But he iss hurt and ca n't come down . " Off ? By gad , sir , it ought to have been off a week ago ! With all respect . But these back-country surgeons sometimes . . . " " Petry ' s a stubborn cuss . Do n't get sick , Maria . It ' s no good to me anyway . I want some rum and my pipe . The one with the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trip was standing beside him . The negro 's eyes rolled round to his.  | " Yassah . " Without a word , Gil went down to the ferry . It was all over in the northwest room . The surgeon , hat in hand , was saying good-bye . " I have to report to-night at Dayton . " Herkimer looked at him calmly with his black eyes . The room was full of smoke . The negress Frailty was gingerly carrying out the bloody sheet they had used to cover the table . Mrs. Herkimer , pale face swollen , swayed a little as she waited . " Goot luck , doctor . Thank General Arnold for me . " " Thank you , sir . " " Tell me something . Did you ever cut off a leg before ? " The surgeon blushed . " No , sir . " " Do n't pe ashamed . A man has to start somewhere . I remember the first deer I shot . " His face brightened suddenly . " Maria , have one of the poys find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his pipe in the candlestick . His eye fell on the bundle in the corner . " Give it to Johnny Roof to bury . It should please a poy to do that . " He sank back and closed his eyes . Nobody had heard him make a sound beyond the grinding of his teeth . Now his breathing was like a blow repeated and repeated against the walls of the room . While he slept , two boys took the severed leg and walked with it in the orchard . They did not know where a good place would be until one thought of the ox-heart cherry tree the general was so fond of . They dug the hole and filled it . While he slept , one of the negro lads went up to Warner Dygert 's tavern and gave the news of the amputation . Joe Boleo started getting sober then . " My Jesus , what did they do that for ? " He picked his rifle from the corner and ambled unsteadily in the negro 's wake . Already it was getting dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept , for Maria , from exhaustion , had fallen asleep herself in the chair by the hearth . She was awakened by Joe Boleo 's hand on hers . " It ' s Joe . " " Oh , Joe , " she whispered back . " They took his leg off ? " " Yes . " " I thought the nigger was lying . " She stirred softly under his hand and left the chair and went into the dim light of the hall . She fetched a candle back . Togethershe and the gangling trapper leaned over the bed . " Poor old Honnikol . He never could get round very fast , any-ways . " She gasped . She was n't pointing at the white face in which the nose seemed to have grown overlarge . Her finger pointed at the blanket . Joe looked at the drench of blood and swore . He went right out himself and woke the entire lot of negroes . " Get up to Fort Dayton , " he ordered . " Get Petry . Doc Petry . Bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him a fool army man cut off Honnikol 's leg and it ' s still bleeding . " He returned to the house . " Hello , Honnikol . " " Joe ? " . " Shut up , " said Joe . He helped Maria Herkimer twist a tourniqueton above the bloody stump . " We 'd better leave the bandage on . It might clot yet . " " I do n't think so . " Herkimer spoke quietly . " Get me my pipe , Maria , and one for Joe , and beer for both of us . We both need beer . Me , I ' m thirsty . How about you , Joe ? " " Oh , my Jesus , Honnikol . I ai n't drank in two weeks . " They smoked and drank through long hours , while Herkime : talked fitfully about old hunting trips . They did n't mention war . " Remember the trout above Schell 's riff ? " " Sure , " said Joe . " Sure , Honnikol . " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p254When  Herkimer finally went to sleep , Joe left the room , wanderinghopelessly to the river side . There was nothing to see . They could n't bring Petry down before morning . And the bleedingdid not stop . Making a restless circuit of the house , he met Johnny Roof and the other lad standing in the orchard with two spades . " What you doing ? " Joe asked sourly . They said they ' d heard the generalwas dying . They were wondering about digging up his leg . " What for ? " They said to bury with him . He merely cursed them . He walked around for an hour in the dark , leaving Honnikolto his wife . It was what a woman expected . In the morning , Herkimer was not talking . Even when Colonel Willett came over the river and reported that General Arnold was passing on the north shore , Herkimer did no more than stare . About nine , however , he rallied and asked for his pipe . When he had been smoking a little while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started to read aloud in a strong voice , but as he went on the voice started to fail . He did not appear to be aware of it , but read on , moving his lips slowly , and only now and then achieving utterance , so that his wife and the lank , uneasy woodsman , who leaned against the sunny window frame , heard only snatches :  --  " O Lord , rebuke me not in thy wrath ... : " ARRIVAL OF A MAJOR GENERALThe death of Herkimer shook the people . He had been the squire , the man with the money who had built a great house that rivaled Sir William Johnson 's Hall . Now they remembered that he had been one of themselves , a quiet man , who came to dinner in his shirt , likely as not . They missed his steadfastness . The men who had been with him at Oriskany battle recalled how he had lit his pipe . Now that he was gone they had no one to de  --  pend on . For three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good mounts , wearing the blue coats of the regular army , rode the length of German Flats reading a proclamation . By the Hon. BENEDICT ARNOLD , Esq. , Major-General and Commander  --  in-chief of the army of the United States of America on the Mohawk River . WHEREAS a certain Barry St. Leger , a Brigadier-general in the sere ice of George of Great Britain , at the head of a banditti of robbers , murderers , and traitors , composed of savages of America , and more savage Britons ( among whom is the noted Sir John Johnson , John Butler , and Daniel Claus ) , have lately appeared in the frontiers of this state .. . It was not what the proclamation said that roused the people . There were too few Tories left in German Flats to make the promised amnesty applicable to themselves . It was rather the choice of words . Here was a man who put down what he said as if he meant it , who was n't afraid of calling scoundrels by ' their proper names . Militiamen who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going along with Arnold 's army . He was the man who had taken troops overland through Maine and would have conquered Quebec and all Canada but for one unlucky bullet that got him in the knee . In the knee , like Herkimer ; the coincidencewas striking . They listened to his invitation to all ablebodiedmen , militia or exempts , to join him in a victorious march against St. Leger 's camp . But they waited awhile to see what he would do . He did a lot . He made an inspection of the forts round GermanFlats . In each he made another speech about his expedition . He also urged the people out to take care of the wheat . " This valley ' s not only got to feed you ; it ' s got to feed GeneralWashington 's army . And the army will pay you high . Right now it ' s buying unmilled wheat at seven shilling . " They listened to him , watching him  --  a black-visaged , hawk-like man , with arrogant round eyes and an opulent mouth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for here . You 've got the bread of the army in your care . That ' s what St. Leger ' s after . And that 's what Gansevoort ' s saving by hanging out in Stanwix , and that 's what we 're going to save Gansevoort for . " His face was flushed high ; his voice had a queer habit of sliding up the scale ; but they liked the way he walked up and down , light on his feet , like a man who knew the woods . " Listen to me . Over in Bennington , Vermont , Colonel Stark and a bunch of minutemen captured and licked and manhandled five hundred Hessian cavalry . Do you know why the Hessians went over there ? Because Burgoyne 's getting pinched for food . General Schuyler has him bottled up . His murdering Indians have gone home , they ca n't find any more girls to kill , like Jenny McRae . He 's just sitting still and praying for St. Leger , and that 's what we ' re here to stop . Lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . You damn near did . I ' m here to help you take another whack at it , and both of us together can win this war , right here . " He had Learned 's artillery manoeuvre in Petry 's field , and the men went from all the forts and stockades to look at cannon dragged on wheels . The soldiers lined one up and fired it down the river , and the awed people saw the heavy ball send up a tower of spray three hundred yards downstream . They thought of what that would have done to the Indians at Oriskany , and Arnold had a battery . " By Jesus , " said Joe Boleo , making his first emergence from his gloom , " I calculate I ' 11 go along and see one of them balls let loose after Sillinger myself . " Arnold 's next step was to court-martial Walter Butler . He appointedWillett Judge Advocate , which made men shake their heads and say conviction would ' be pretty near conclusive , with that arrangement . When they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they so crowded Dr. Petry 's store that a guard had to be thrown round it to keep out late corners . It gave them a strange thrill to see one of the men who had run the valley standing up before an officer . Butler was self-contained but scornful . He argued in his clear attorney 's voice that he had come with a flag to parley with the inhabitants of German Flats , He did not know anything of this new law , he only knew the King 's law . He did not consider it necessary to report to Colonel Weston , for he did not know of any Colonel Weston or of any Fort Dayton . The natural pallor of his face was not accentuated when he was brought back into court and sentenced to the pain and penalty of death . The new law he had scorned , as administeredby Willett and Arnold , had ground him down . It gave all men pause for thought . By contrast the succeeding trial of Hon Yost Schuyler as a deserterfrom the Tryon County militia was an anticlimax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any tricks at all ; uld some of the spectators were reminded how nearly they might have found themselves in Schuyler 's shoes , guilty , and sentenced ' to a hundred lashes . Arnold had no authority for court-martialing Butler . Both Gates and Schuyler had sent definite orders that the captured men be removed to Albany . But he and Willett had been putting on a show to divert attention from their unavoidable delay . The militia were not coming in as they had expected , and the commissary train as usual was lagging no one knew quite where . That night while he and Willett sat together in headquarters tent trying to think up some new game and wondering whether they dared disobey instructions and execute Butler anyway , the guard announced two women to see the general . The women were Mrs. Schuyler and her daughter , Nancy . Both officers were men to whom directness invariably appealed . Mrs. Schuyler wasted no time in pleading her own shame , she only mentioned that she was Herkimer 's sister , they could see her position for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Arnold let him off , he guaranteed to go to Sillinger'sp263camp and , pretending he had escaped from the American army , to put the fear of death into the Indians . He volunteered the information that when he left with Ensign Butler , the Indians were already getting restless . He believed that if the Indians left , the Tories , and maybe Sillinger himself , would lose their nerve . It was the kind of notion to appeal to men like Arnold and Willett . They admitted it . But Arnold said , " What guarantee can you give us of your son 's good faith ? " " I 've brought my daughter with me , " said Mrs. Schuyler . " You can keep her for a hostage . " Arnold studied Mrs. Schuyler and then glanced at Nancy 's face . Nancy was pale and her eyes were wide with emotion . As she met the general 's eye her lips parted . She had made the suggestion herself to her mother , and she was ready , if anything happened to Hon , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuyler , you ' re too intelligent to think I could accept a girl for a hostage . What would people think of me if I ordered my sergeant to give a girl a hundred lashes on her bare back ? " Mrs. Schuyler sighed . " I thought so . Very well , my son Nicholas has agreed to put himself in your hands till Hon returns . " Nancy 's face flushed darkly , then it went pale again . And she stood there shivering . The two officers smiled sympathetically . It seemed quite natural ; they admired her heroism . Her mother said , " Be still . " Nancy did not move or speak . RELIEF OF STANWIXOn the twenty-first of August , militiamen began to appear at Fort Dayton . They came from as far east as Klock 's , and with the arrival of the first groups the men of German Flats startedp264to turn out . By nightfall the count had reached three hundred , and Arnold called Willett and all local militia officers into his tent for a council of war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the circle of faces , and fastened on the hesitant ones . Peter Tygert murmured , " Give us another day and maybe we can get another hundred rifles out for you . " " In another day , " said Arnold , " Colonel Gansevoort may have to cut his way out of Fort Stanwix . It 's my opinion we could be more useful there than here . You can fetch the other hundred along to-morrow . " His eyes protruded at them . " This couptry ' s rotten with its hemstitch policies . It ' s time somebody acted . I ' m going to . How about those militia ? Are they decently or-ganized ? " Captain Demooth said quietly , " They ' re pretty disorganized . A lot of the officers got shot or captured . Most of these men were in the first two companies . " Arnold nodded . " Very well . I suggest that they be turned over to the surviving officers and made into an irregular brigade . Bring them along in the rear . They ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise . " It was a still morning , a little cooler than usual . The river lay like glass between the rifts , not stirring the reflection of a leaf . At dawn , so still was the air that from Little Stone Arabia Fort to Eldridge Blockhouse people heard the muster rolling of the army drums . Gil Martin , reporting , was appointed temporary sergeant of those of the Schuyler company whom he could get together . Of twenty-five he found eleven . Reall was dead , Weaver wounded , Kast wounded ; of the other eleven men one was known to be dead , two taken prisoner , three wounded , and the rest disappeared . Survivors of other companies even more unfortunate , Joe Bola , and Adam Helmer among them , asked to be attached to Demooth'sp265company . They made a compact knot of men when Demooth himself rode up to count them . " Good work , Martin , " he said , and wheeled his horse to let General Arnold pass on the narrow road . But the general reined his horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " " They are n't all sound . " " Sound enough , I think , " said Captain Demooth . Arnold smiled suddenly . " By God , then , let them come . Do they know the woods ? Good . I suggest they act as an advance guard . " He turned to Gil . " Keep a quarter mile ahead of us . " The way he said it made Gil feel inordinately proud . " Yes , sir . " Then he asked , " How far will this day 's march go , sir ? " " Just as far as we can get . " Arnold grinned again . " You do a thorough job of combing the woods and I reckon we 'll keep up . They took the road , with the rolling of the drums recommencingbehind them . It prickled their scalps to hear the fifes break out . The woods covered them with their green silence and they went swiftly westward . In Gil there was a lifting of the heart . He nodded when Helmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own men and eating nobody 's dust . " As soon as they had passed Schuyler , Joe Boleo and Helmer took over the direction of the company , but Joe Boleo was tactful about it . " You ai n't timber beasts like me and Helmer , Martin . The . wo of us can find out a whole lot more of what ' s going on if we do n't have you to keep track of . The rest of you keep on the road and go a little slow . We ' 11 let you know fast enough if we find anything . Wait at the ford until we pick you up , though . "  | The two men broke away and trotted forward into the woods , one on each side of the road . Their moccasined feet made no sound . Gil and the others continued along the road . They could still see traces of the first march towards Stanwix ; deep ruts off the road where an ox cart had bogged down , a ruttingblanket , a dropped bayonet . But already the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The ferns had straightened round the edges and grass was growing through a hole in the blanket . A deer runway crossing the road had blottedout the wheel tracks . Well before noon they passed Deerfield and turned toward the river . There , where the oxen had balked , they sat down on the bank and ate . They were still eating their food when Gil heard a hail from the woods across the river . Helmer appeared with his hand raised . A moment more and he had splashed over the ford . One look at his big handsome face told that he carried good news . " Joe ' s got a squad of Gansevoort 's men up the road . They say Sillinger ' s pulled foot . " " Pulled foot ? " " Yes , pulled foot . Bag and baggage . The Indians lit out yesterday . The whole mess of them , and Sillinger pulling his foot with the rest . They 've left everything they 've got behind . " He burst out laughing . The other men suddenly joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloping hell for leather down the Indian track towards Oneida . They could see it themselves . Bed , tent , writing desk , and chest of likker , cooking pots and silver forks , sword , spurs , epaulets , and oaths . They saw the whole shebang . " Pulled foot . " It was a joke . They fell silent after a few minutes and started looking at each other . Where ' d you find them ? " Gil asked . " About where Honnikol camped , at the crick . " " What are they doing there ? "  | " Eating , " said Adam . " Eating their lunch . When Joe walked n on them they asked him to set down and eat . " Inexplicably they all burst out laughing again . The rest of the march went swiftly . As soon as Arnold was notified he let his baggage and artillery come on at their own pace and pushed ahead with the troops alone . The army crossed i he Mohawk early the next morning . Two hours later they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company marched at the head of the column . As they went on they began to recognize the lay of the land and their talking gradually stopped . It was Joe Boleo who first began sniffing . He stopped his shambling stride and lifted his face , and the others crowded up behind them . " What ' s the matter , Joe ? " Gil asked . " Smell for yourself , lad . " He started forward again . The road was familiar now , running in the gloom of hemlocks above the river bottom . And as they proceeded they began to pick up more strongly the odor of decay that the woodsman had spotted long before . It became an overpowering stench . It rose up in their faces , like a wall , through which they felt they could hardly pass . They found themselves suddenly on the edge of the ravine , staring down at the causeway . They all stopped again . Then Helmer said , " God ! Come on , " and they went down the incline and out along the corduroy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Gil , after one glance , kept his eyes to the track . And even then more than once he had to step carefully round the disintegration of the dead . They lay , not as they had fallen , but as the foxes and wolves and Indian dogs had left them . The grass or ferns were trodden down around each body , impartially , horse or man , Indian or white ; and the half-opened skeletons were like white roots of a miasmal wilderness . Along the rising bank the corpses thinned out , the air seemed to lighten , and the men could hear each other breathing . Then on the plateau the frequency of dead was resumed , always thicket till they reached the edge of the gulch of the farther side ; and here they lay so close together that the preying animals had not disturbed them all  --  postured as they had fallen , in the attitudes of fight ing , or grasping the earth with swollen hands . As they saw the end of the battleground ahead , the little knot of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finally rose on the far side of the gulch . Presently , while they waited , they heard the sounds of the marchingarmy far behind across the blanketing silence of those bodies . The tramp of feet coming down on the corduroy , the rattle of harness , and the jolt and clatter of the munition carts . There was a momentary disorder and halt , and Joe Boleo 's sardonic voice inquired at large , " I wonder what Mr. Benedict Arnold makes of that ? " It was the first word any one of them had spoken . They looked in each other 's faces , seeing them sallow and wet . But then the first bluecoats were visible along the road . They came in two columns , their white breeches and the white facings on the buttoned-back skirts of their coats swinging steadily , as their solid boots trod heavily on the rough ground . They were marching at attention , eyes to the front , muskets at right shoulder . Above the heads of the first company , the shoulders and flushed face of Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lips moved as if he talked to himself . His eyes looked blazing mad . Demooth 's company of militia turned , all twentyfiveas one , and took up the march again towards the fort . At three o'clock the advance companies came out on the vlaie land at the great bend of the Mohawk . Half a mile ahead , the walls of the fort stood square and brown above the grass , surrounding the low roofs of its four buildings . The sun , westering , picked out the sticks of the stockade along the south wall facing the army and shadowed the sally port . But above this shadow , on the main or northeast flagstaff , thep269new flag hung in its bright colors . Even at that distance the men were able to make out the red and white stripes and the blue field . The air was too still to move it . Men were moving across the fields outside the gate ; a wagon was crawling towards the sally port from some abandoned tents on the high ground to the north ; nowhere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep army drums reached onwardpast Gil 's moving head . He saw a man spring up on the sentry walk and the men in the field scramble to their feet . The wagon halted momentarily . The horses turned their heads . The banging of the drums grew stronger , putting a lift in the trampingfeet . The sun over the fort glanced in two sparks from the shoulders of an officer . Man after man appeared behind the points of the stockade . They seemed to stand in a frozen silence . Then , suddenly , hats were scaled in the air . Four cannon on the southeast station let loose orange bursts of flame and the entire side of the fort was engulfed in a black cloud of smoke . The thudding roars beat down the sound of drums ; but they swelled again triumphantly . At a. signal , the fifers licked their fifes and filled their cheeks . The shrill notes leaped upward , piercing the valley . As he walked , Gil watched the black smoke from the cannon rising over the stockade until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually towards the north . When it had vanishedhe saw the flag as it had been , limp against the flagpole . But now it brought him a strange sensation that it was his and that it hung in victory and peace . DR . PETRY SEES Two PATIENTSThe mid-October sun was already low over the southwest hills as Dr. Petry rode his old gray horse homeward past Herkimerp270Church . The fort looked almost deserted . Only George Weaver 's family and the Realls were living in it now , besides the small remaining garrison ; and George Weaver no longer needed his services . He was just as glad , for Emma Weaver had become so concerned about her son John and one of the Reall girls that she was unpleasant company . The jealousy of an ambitious mother : Emma , for all her homely face , had strong passions for all her menfolks . And then , he was tired . He was so tired that if it had n't been for Bell 's abominable hen squawking in the sack behind the cantle , Dr. Petry would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trick of sleeping in the saddle . The old gray horse had a steadfast sort of ambling gait ; - his back was flat and broad enough to lay a table on , and he knew every road , bridge , ford , and footpath in the western half of Tryon County . People said that he knew every patient as well , and what was wrong with him , and what the prescription ought to be . Now the doctor took off his hat and banged it behind him against the sack , causing an unexpected fluttering commotion . The silence was grateful and complete . He put his hat back on his head , tilting it well forward , and closed his eyes under the brim . Well , when he got home , he 'd take his boots off and sit down and have a drink before the fire . A fire would feel good . The cold was getting more pronounced and he thought they were not far off from frost . He could feel admonitory twinges in his wounded foot . It was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had got it all in at Andrustown ; they were going to have a bee there next week for the husking and had asked the doctor to spread the word of it . " God damn that God-damn hen . " She was making a little moaning in her nose , or bill , or wherever it was . He had n't wanted her . He was sick of poultry round the house , but George Bell swore she was a layer , and an egg in his rum , now . . . Well , a man ought n't to complain . It was all Bell had to pay with . It was all the pay he had collected for his thirty-mile ride . He had started at four o'clock that morning , and here it was past five in the afternoon . But a man ought not to complain . The crops were in and they were good this year . The price of wheat was soaring . Bill Petry ought to collect on a few back accounts this winter . It surely looked as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Canada , frightened off by the simple lies of Hon Yost Schuyler . Hon himself , the hero of the day , seemed to have returned to his American allegiance . Fort Stanwix was in first-rate order , with that unswerving , stolid Dutchman , Gansevoort , returned to the command . And best news of all , a battle had been fought with Burgoyne at a place called Freeman 's Farm , three weeks ago , and it had been a stand-off . But they said the American army had swelled to twenty thousand men ( that ought to make an earful for the King of England ) and Burgoyne could n't even run away . They had him , and they ought to lick him any day . There was n't any question that Great Britain would have to give in and recognize American Independence ... . Let the damn hen squawk . The doctor grinned a little and the old horse pricked his ears and turned for the ford . They were home in half an hour ; the horse amiably waiting while Doc uncreaked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own way to the barn . The doctor let him go . He entered his kitchen , carrying the bag , and sniffed at the pot on the fire . " What is it ? " he asked the negro woman . " Dar 's rabbit stew "  --  with turnips and cider vinegar and flour gravy thickening in the pan to a dark , rich , voluptuous brown . " Bring me a glass of the Kingston rum , " said the doctor , " and here ' s a hen for you to mind . " The negress , eager for something new , made little soothing sounds as she cautiously opened the sack . " You ai n't been ' busin ' her , has you , Doc ? She lay so daid . My Lawd , de messin'es ' bird . My Lawd ! Oh , de poor perty . . . Watch out ! You make any of dem desperate messes in mah kitchen and you 's gwine to fin ' yo'se'f de makin 's of de gravy , chickun ! " Her black hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went to the store to enter a note in his ledger against the government . He was writing it down in his careful hand :  --  1777 , October 14 , George Bell , to one stab wound in thigh , and scalped . Dressed scalp twice a day . Under my steady care six weeks and this day visited and dismissed , cured L 16. o. o . A knock on the store door startled him . The evening was al ready growing dark , but he could hear a timid hand fiddling with the latchstring . " Come in , " he called . The door opened and closed quickly at the farther end of the store , and the doctor said heavily , " I do n't see people this time of day . " The woman stopped short , timidly . He peered at her . But she wore her shawl all the way over her head . " Who the devil are you ? " he demanded . " I ' m Nancy Schuyler . " Her voice was hushed and breathless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ; but Captain had to go to the fort after supper and Missis went with him ; she wanted the air . " " Well , girl , what 's that got to do with it ? " " I did n't want them to know I was here . " " Oh , " he said . He began grumbling half aloud , something about the old business , and a man having supper , and he supposedhe ought to look . " Well , what ' s the matter ? " he asked aloud . Nancy was flushing inside her shawl so painfully she thought something in her would burst . But at his question she turned white . " I do n't know , " she said . " I ' ve been being sick . Sometimes I ca n't hardly get to do my work in the mornings . But I do n't know . "  |p273The  doctor groaned and heaved himself out of his chair . He went to the windows one by one , closing the shutters , and then pulled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the kitchen and lit it at the fire , and came back and lit the lamp on the counter . He cleared away some blankets , a jar of bear grease , a pot of bean seeds , and some Indian beads . " Well , " he said roughly , " get up on it . " Nancy was trembling so badly that she hardly had the strength to get up on the counter and lie down . When he touched her she shivered convulsively . " That ' s all , " said the doctor , going behind the counter to a pail and basin and starting to wash his hands , giving her time to get down and straighten herself out . " When did it happen ? " " In August , " said Nancy in a hushed voice . " When , I said ? " " I do n't know . It was the day they arrested Hon. " " Was it one of them ? " She nodded . He glared down at her through his frowning long-haired brows . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked intelligent . As now , when she was worried ; the way she lifted her chin at him , chewing at her lip . " How in God 's name did he get at you at Demooth 's ? ' ' " I went up to Shoemaker 's that night . " " Where were you when we got there ? " " Out back of the barn . " " I bet . " Nancy did n't notice . " He got away , they never heard him , but they chased me . " " Then you were the fellow they chased down over the fields ? They shot at you ? " Nancy nodded , and the doctor breathed through his nose . " They said it was a heavy man , about six foot tall , with long black hair ! You must have run like blind destruction . " " I was scared . " " What are you going to do about this , Nancy ? "  |p274She  was silent . " You want that I should straighten it out , hey ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jurry McLonis , " she said in a hushed voice . The doctor swore . " That black-complected Mick , eh ? " " He was nice to me , " Nancy said . " He seems to have been . Well , there 's no way I can get hold of him that I can see . He ' s probably in Niagara , Oswego at the nearest . I guess you ' Captain Demooth , if you like . You went up to find Hon , of course , , and then this fellow took advantage of you . " He was sarcastic . Her eyes filled with tears . " I did . But he did n't , doctor . It just was . " " You ' d like to marry him if I can get hold of him ? " " Yes , doctor . " " Well , I ' 11 see what I can do . Now get out . I want some rest . I 've ridden thirty miles to-day . " He put his hand on her shoal der , marching her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ... " " You did n't say was I going to have a baby ? " " What do you think I was talking to you about ? Yes . Yes . Yes ! " " Thank you , doctor . When will it ? " " It takes nine months . " He counted his fingers savagely just in front of her face . " May . " " It would n't be sooner ? " she asked eagerly . " Hell , no . The insides of a girl like you are just like a clock . Say May thirteenth at half-past twelve at night . " He pushed her through the door , slammed it after her , and went back to his chair and called to Chloe . " Chloe , bring that rum here and then get me another glass ready . I ' 11 drink the second one in there . " " Yes , soh ! "  |p275Chloe  came sweeping in behind her bosom , the little finger of the hand that carried the glass cocked doggily . " Missis say supper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Chloe . I want to sit down first . Here . And then by the lire . I want to edge up to eating . " " Yes , suh ! " Chloe whipped her huge bulk away with her uncannynimbleness . The doctor sipped his glass . The door was tapped . " Who ' s that ? " roared the doctor . A woman answered . He did n't recognize the voice . " Go . sway , " he shouted . Then he was ashamed . If he had n't been so tired he could have sent her away , but being so tired he could n't defend himself . He would work himself to death . " Wait a minute , " he shouted , and closed the door into the house . Then he opened the store door . " I did n't mean to disturb you , doctor . " He peered into the darkness . " Who is it ? " " Magdelana Martin , doctor . " His face cleared suddenly . Of course , Martin 's pretty wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her after that half-animal half-wit . " Come in , Mrs. Martin . You must n't mind my growls . Did you want to see me about yourself ? " " Yes , doctor . But it wo n't take long . " " Well , come and sit down . Do you like egg and rum ? Never tried it ? Where were you brought up ? Taste some of my glass . " Lana obligingly bent forward towards his hand . It pleased him to hold something to her lips . She took it like a bird . He began to feel sentimental . " Like it ? " Lana nodded . " Chloe . Bring that second glass . " " Oh no , thanks , doctor . " " Do you good . " " I ought n't to now . That ' s what I came to see you about . " She looked at him frankly . " I ' m pregnant , doctor , and I want to find out if after  - -  -  after that time , I ought to be especially careful about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re all right . If you want it . " " Yes , I do . " " That ' s fine . I ' m eternally glad , I tell you . I was sorry about you . It ' s the best thing . It 's woman 's natural function , Mrs. Martin , and you 're a fine healthy girl . When do you expect it ? " Lana , remembering , colored slightly ; but she smiled at the same time . " Sometime after the first week in May . " The doctor did n't even swear . He just popped out his eyes and stared . He looked so funny that Lana started laughing . " I must be kind of a ghost . " " Oh , no . No , indeed . " He cleared his throat . " It just happens another girl is expecting almost the identical time . She was in just before you and I ' m beginning to wonder what 's been going on with my patients . " He glanced at her . " Will you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil said we 'd stay till the baby was born . He seems so pleased . " Her lips trembled . " Oh , doctor , I feel as if I 'd just begun living again . " " Yes , yes . " Chloe knocking , he called her in . " Give that to Mrs. Martin . Drink it , girl . It ' s a good thing to celebrate with . Here 's to Gilly or Magdelana second . Or both ! " He laughed . Lana laughed and drank with him . " Afterwards , Gil talks about our moving back to Deerfield . He thinks we might get back in time to get our spring corn in . The Weavers will go with us . " " Fine , " he said . " Fine . How 's your husband , by the way ? Arm troubling him any ? " " Not a bit . He came down to meet Captain Demooth at the fort . We thought it might be about their taking Burgoyne , and I walked along hoping I ' d see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having news . " He showed her out and sat down again . A fine girl . He was feeling better . He was going to have a busy spring , though . Very busy . Well , he might as well get in to supper . He went in and kissed his wife dutifully and Chloe served them . He was just starting on the rabbit stew when Demooth appeared . " Doc , " he said . " Can you come down to Ellis 's at the falls ? Right now . I said I ' d drive you down . " " What ' s the matter , Mark ? " " There 's been trouble in jerseyfield . You know that man George Mount who would n't move down when St. Leger was at Oriskany ? " Petry nodded and stuffed his mouth full . " Well , I saw him in Ellis 's a few days ago . He ' d brought his wife down to buy some things at Paris 's . They were gone from home a week , and they ' d left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went back . He found his place burned and the two lads scalped . One of them was still alive and he brought him out with the nigger . They had n't touched the nigger . The boy ' s only seven and they say he ca n't live , but Mount wondered whether you ' d come down . " The doctor dropped a morsel of rabbit . He stared like a fish . Then he wiped his mouth , and spoke slowly , " It is n't over , then . " Demooth 's face was drawn and bitter . " It was two Indians that used to stay with Mount . Caderoque and Hess . The nigger recognized them . There were some white men in the same party . They did n't do any scalping . They only shot the first boy . " " Did the nigger recognize any of them ? " " He recognized Suffrenes Casselman . And he said the head man was called Caldwell. "  |p278JOHN  WOLFF had been in Newgate Prison for over a year , but he was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lust the sense of time . There were days when he could n't have said offhand whether it was to-day , or yesterday ; they were days be yond track . Sometimes he would catch himself saying the days of the week , " Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday ... " Or the months of the year . There were many things he used to say . " Lucy Locket , lost her pocket . . . " Sometimes he would wake up some of the near-by prisoners and they would throw odd pieces of rock at his bed and yell . It was awful when the men yelled . It started the echoes whirling in the high air shaft , seventy feet high . It was fifty feet across at the bottom , they said , though you could n't find that out by pacing because the water lapped against the far side . But at the top the shaft was four feet across with an iron grating fixed into the stone ; and what with the smoke from the charcoal braziers one could hardly tell where the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and a little after summer solstice , you could see the sun itself upon the grating if you waded out into the water fax enough . You could even imagine a faint warmth from it on your head . John Wolff had felt it , and the next man , walking out , felt it also , but he started a convulsion , and they had to haul him out of the water for fear he would drown . But when the men started yelling and got the echoes going , it used to make John Wolff feel sick . The voices would start picking each other up , catching and passing each other , and coming up and down , until the echoes managed to acquire individual personalityof their own , having echoes of their own , and the echoes had echoes , and it went on and on , a bedlam that would n't die even when the trapdoor opened above the iron ladder and the guard looked down and yelled back furiously . Then the men would work on the echoes and a queer singsong rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired , kept the echoes working endlessly . It was like the eternal drip of water magnified . The drip of water had the same effect , when everyone was silent . At first you would notice it on the wall right beside you . Drip , and a pause ; drip , and a pause . Gradually this soft impingement of a single drop would lead you to listen for drops farther away , and soon your ears would become attuned to drops much farther off . ' ! ' hen you would begin to be aware of the graduation of loudnessthat distance made , and all at once the drop you had first noticed would have the regular clang of a ringing bell . You could n't then put it back into its proper equivalent in the sound of sense . Sometimes a man would get up from his wet straw and work at the bare rock for hours to change the direction of an individual drip , so that its sound would be altered and thus restored to a sane proportion . But one night when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard was drunk . Maybe the guard went a little crazy himself . Anyway , he opened the trap and fired his musket . They could all see him , fifty feet above their heads in the lighted square of the trap , his furious red face , and the musket pointing down like the finger of wrathful retribution . The bullet striking made no sound through the yelling voices and they yelled twice as loud . Even John Wolff yelled that night . And the guard lost his head entirely . He fired again and again , and finally a ball ricocheted and killed one of the prisoners . He was the man who had come in with John Wolff , the man who had beaten soldier for molesting his wife . But they did not notice he h died till it was time for them to go up the next day . They had to haul him up with a rope and carry him to ti smithy so that his irons could be taken off . Then he had lice buried , and the commandant , Captain Viets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men flogged , choosing the ones the outraged guar . who had committed the murder pointed out , and one man , wl owed the guard three shillings , was hung by his heels for a hour and a half . Nobody had had any food for two days , b the guard did well instead , for it was necessary for the prison to consume its full ration of beef if the commandant were to receive his regular allowance . It was odd , after that , to think of the dead man . He was buried in the prison yard . And yet he was sixty feet above any of his fellow prisoners . He was decomposing somewhere underground , but they were still more underground than he . Waiting for him to come down , one man said : " to come down in drops of water . " He embarked on an intricate calculation of how long it would take the first drop to come down to their level . John Wolff started watching the drops on the stone beside his bed . Now and then long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British army . They all knew one was on the way . But the guard would give them no news . The guard struck a man if he asked . They gathered from that that the army was making progress . But one night the commandant himself opened the trap and they saw his bare legs squatting under his nightshirt as he yelled down , Did they want to hear about General Burgoyne ? They let the drops answer . But Captain Viets was n't to be stopped . " He 's surrendered his entire army . Seven thousand men , " he bawled . " And the Hessians have been licked at Bennington , Vermont , and Sillinger has been driven off from Fort Stanwix by Benedict Arnold . How do you like that ? Hey ? " Purely from habit they started their singsong and he had top 281 slam the door shut . They kept the singsong up all night . They knew now that all hope of their being rescued from the caverns must be deferred . In fact it was a question now if they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , a lot of them . They did n't really know themselves . They were consciousonly of the vast formation of rock that was above them . Black tons of it , they thought . A person would n't think of looking for a man so deep down in the rock . For a week afterwards they beguiled themselves by saying what they thought of General Burgoyne . They imagined General Burgoyneif he were put down among them . They wondered if he would be . But people like General Burgoyne , who made war and brought Indians and wore epaulets and carried his private whiskey with him , were n't ever put in places like this . Only a person who preached in the pulpit for the King , or who said he was a Loyalist , or who owed a new Yankee judge some money , or who hit a soldier who was raping his wife  --  only that man was an atrocious villain . THE DRAINAGE LEVELMost of them thought John Wolff was going crazy . He was not aware of it himself . Only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated to himself letters to his wife every week , though he had n't money to smuggle them out if he had been able to write them . He would ask her to write what she was doing and then he would say what had happened in the prison . The letters sounded pretty much alike even to himself . He got tired of them . The day after the captain delivered the news of Burgoyne 's surrender , he wrote Ally about it ; but then he could think of nothing to add . The Mr. Henry who had first welcomedp282him to the caverns asked what the trouble was . " I 'm writing my wife , Alice , " explained John Wolff , " but I ca n't think of anything new to tell her . " " Have you described this lovely home of ours ? " said Mr. Henry . " No , I have n't . " " Why do n't you ? Take a look around and see what there is to see . " Several men laughed , but John Wolff did not mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made up his letter , about the air shaft and the beds and the queer beach of sand and the water . " The water is queer , " he said , " the water keeps dropping clown off the walls all the while and the water do n't never get higher nor lower . " He realized that he was saying something nobody had noticed . Suddenly John Wolff came out of his daze and he had a long fit of the shakes . But they were not the damp shakes that every body had . He was shaking with excitement . He went and looked at the water . He said , " Has anybody ever tried to wade out there ? " " It ' s too deep , " one of the men said . " Has anybody tried to swim ? " asked John Wolff . A roar of laughter went up . One of the men reached out and rattled the chains connecting his ankle and wrist fetters . " Try and swim with forty pounds , " he suggested . John Wolff stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy with rock dust and charcoal smoke and unwashed beards . It came to him that he must look like that himself . His hand went to his beard . He had never had a beard before . He had always shaved . Then his eyes grew cunning . He felt them growing so and closed the lids lest the other men should see it , and he went and lay down . They were still making jokes about him when the guard opened the door and shouted at them to " Heave up ! " for their exercise.  |p283From  his bed , John Wolff watched them clambering toilsomely up the ladder , their chains clashing against the iron rungs , as they fought upward with one hand and carried the night buckets with the other . The smoke from the braziers drew into the guardroom and the guard stepped away from the door . John Wolff lay there till they had all gone up . " Hey , you ! " the guard yelled . " What ' s your name , Wolff ! " John Wolff did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filth he had ever heard and sent it up to the guard . The guard laughed . " All right , " he said . " Stay down . Stay down for a week . " Wolff was a harmlessman , not worth coming down for and lugging up and flogging . He slammed the trap shut . John Wolff got up . He clanked slowly down to the beach , looking at the water . Then he started rummaging in the straw beds . Some of the prisoners had bought pieces of plank from the guard , to put under the straw . He had n't any himself because they cost a shilling a foot . Moving with the slow , half-hopping motion the irons forced him to use , he took down planks and put them in the water . They floated soggily . He got more . He laid them on top of each other , side by side . Then he waded out and straddled them and tentatively pulled up his feet . The planks sank underhim and he rummaged for more . He finally had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn from his blanket . He straddled the raft and pushed it out with his feet . He paddled with his hands . The weight of the irons made his hands splash no matter how careful he was . But he had only a little way to go to get out of the brazier lights . John Wolff had thought a long time about which shaft to choose . But as he could not make up his mind he chose the farthest . When he entered it , the noise of his splashing diminished . The light behind him was circumscribed by the low ceilingof the shaft and the flat level of the water . Looking back , itp284seemed to him that he had come a great distance . He could not see far ahead , because the shaft made a turn . He paddled slowly round that , and then in the darkness that instantly became complete he felt the front of his raft strike the rock . The blow was very slight , but it almost knocked him forward off balance . He barely saved himself by lifting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that the drift was filled to the ceiling , and that there was no way out . He felt all round the water level to make sure and then tried to turn his raft . There was not room to turn it in the darkness , and he had to back out . It was a laborious and painful process . His arms dragged and his legs had gone cold and numb , except for the ache the cold made in his ankle scars . When he came back into view of the sand beach and the smouldering braziers and the mussed straw of the beds he had despoiled of planks , he was sobbing with exhaustion . He lay forwardalong the boards , eyes shut . From a vague sense of habit he started dictating a letter to Ally . " The right drift is full of water so I ca n't get out that way . I shall have to try the other one . It is so hard to paddle . " Then it occurred to him that he could not wait another day . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore as to paddle into the next drift . In either case he would not have time to put the planks back under the straw . They ducked men who monkeyed with the beds of others . It took two weeks to get dry . John decided to paddle into the next drift . Again the splashing he made seemed to crash against the upwardwalls of the air shaft . But again the noise was shut off when he finally entered the second drift . He had been working for an hour to cover his hundred feet or so of progress and the men should be coming down soon . He forced himself to keep at it until the last reflected light of the water was left behind . Then he came to a slight curve and continued round that , and then he stopped.  |p285He  had a sudden new sensation . The sweat was pouring out of his skin . It was the first time he had sweated for months . It made him feel weak , as if the whole energy of his body had been put to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time he felt an access of courage because he was able to sweat . It gave his hands power to paddle on . Behind , and far away , shut off by the rock wall , he heard the muffled clanking as the men started coming down the ladder . He kept on . It was dark now , and he was scraping the side of the drift . But he kept paddling . When he heard his name called behind him , the sound was dim and the echoes that entered the drift were mere whispers of his name ,  --  John Wolfi , John Wolfi ,  --  like voices for a person departing this world . His arms lifted and fell and lifted . He had gone a long way . He was not completely conscious any more of what he was doing . He was quite unprepared when the raft struck a projection of the wall , dumping him sideways off the board into the water . His last flurry broke the wrappings of the raft and the boards came apart . He thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and his head came out of water . Against his wet face , in the dark , he felt an icy draft of air . He started wading . The bottom was quite smooth , but the water deepened . It reached his chin . He knew that he was going in the right direction , because the air still drew against his forehead . The boards were now out of his reach and it was too dark to see anything , anyway . John Wolff stood still in the water , thinkingaloud : " Dear Ally , the water is up to my mouth . It is gettingdeeper . But there is surely air coming along this drift and I ca n't get back and I figure to go ahead . It is better to drown than to stand still in water . It is not very cold water , but it makes me shake some . Otherwise I am well and hoping you are the same . . . . " He drew a deep breath and took a full stride forward.  | The water fell away from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air against his wishbone . He drew another breath and took still another step and the water dropped halfway to his waist . He shouted . It was thin sound and it was drowned by his sudden threshing in the water . All at once he was reaching down , holding tight the chains to his ankles and floundering knee-deep along a narrow stream . The air was cold all over him . He went on for half a dozen yards and shouted again . There was light on the righthandwall . Faint , but actual light . Daylight . He turned the corner to the left and saw the dazzle on the water which now ran downhill quite fast through a small tunnel that seemed to narrow to the dimension of a large culvert . He had to bend and get on his knees . He took another turn as he dragged himself in the water , and he saw ahead of him the gray of woods in Oc tober . But between him and the woods was a wooden grille . It shocked and amazed him to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to him a malicious manifestation of the godlessness in man . In its way it seemed to him infinitely more wicked than the trial which had sent him to prison in the first place . He dragged himself up to it and put his hands against the lower bar and rested his head on his hands . The shakes were getting hold of him again . He closed his eyes , and let go of his body . He felt the grille shaking as he shook and opened his eyes . It came to him that the wood was old and the joints the crossbars made with the frame were very rotten . He braced his feet against a stone and threw his weight against the grille . The whole business gave way , tumbling out under him down the steep hillside . He fell with it , with a last clank of his irons , rolled over down the slope , and came to rest with his face upwarda the breast of the hill against the sky . He lay still , weeping , A cold rain was falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours , he had covered a mile and a half through the woods . He had got beyond caring about the noise he made . Just after sunset he struck a path that led him into a pasture . The pasture sloped toward a valley through which a road ran . On the road were a small house , with a barn attached to it by a woodshed , and a building that had a chimney and looked like a forge . The wet bricks shone faintly in the light from the house window . He stopped with the rain beating down on him , and stared at the lighted fire visible through the kitchen window . The whole world smelled wet and cold . Presently a man came out of the house and went to the barn . John Wolff could hardly credit his good luck as he saw the man lead out a horse and take it to the front door . The man waited there while a woman came out , shawling herself against the rain , and let the man help her onto the pillion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in the house to bar the door till they came back . John Wolff could hear the answer in a negro voice . It sounded like a woman 's . The man said they would return in two hours . He kicked the horse to a trot down the road in the rain . As soon as he was gone , John Wolff started down the hill . He went first to the building he thought might be a smithy and opened the door . There was enough light in the banked fire to show him the anvil and the hammers and files . He was like a man obsessed . He made no effort to be quiet , but picked up one of the hammers and started striking on the seams of his wrist bands . It was hard to get a good swing . His aim was clumsy from the cold and the hammer head kept rollingp288off the iron onto his arm . But the seam cracked finally and he pulled the iron loose . For a minute he stood looking at the rusty imprint on his wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head . He felt as if his fist could strike high heaven . He broke the other fetter handily enough and began to work on the anklets . These were harder to break , for it was almost impossible to keep his leg on the anvil within striking distance of his arm and yet get a free swing with the hammer . , Finally he thought of tipping the anvil over . It took all his strength to do it , and the anvil teetered a long time before he could overbalance it . It fell with a terrific crash , but John Wolff did not seem to notice the noise until the screaming of the negro woman in the house broke in on his hearing . He lifted his chin and automatically started to join her  --  as if it were the singsong starting back in the cavern . Then he remembered what he was doing and held his ankle against the anvil and swung the hammer with both hands . The seam smashed all to pieces . He broke the second at the first blow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Wolff listened to her , cocking his head a little ; while a queer look of cunning came into his eyes .. The hand which held the hammerbegan to swing with little jerks . Suddenly he became aware of the motion of his hand and stopped it . He stood quite still with a growing excitement on his face and his breath coming and going sharply . At his first step he nearly toppled over on his face . He recovered himself , went out through the door , and closed it behind him with great care . He stopped for a moment more , turning his head towards the house as if he tasted the fear in the black woman 's shrieks . The hand holding the hammer twitched again . He started for the house . Habit forced his legs into the queer hobbling gait the shackles had trained them to ; but the release from the weight deprived them of all sense of balance . He kept lurching forward ; and on the second hop he measured his length in the mud of the yard . Hep289scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got onto the porch . He knocked on the door . At the first blow the woman stopped screaming . He forced his hand to knock gently again : this started the woman off on her shrieks and he listened with his ear to the panel . When she stopped , the house was quiet as death , with only the sound of the rain dripping from the eaves . The drip distracted him until he heard the woman moan inside the house , and then the sound of her feet sneaking towards the hack . It infuriated him . He raised the hammer with both hands and smashed it against the door . It was an eight-pound hammer and he broke in a panel in half a dozen blows . He became intoxicated with the destruction he was making of the door and forgot all about the woman . He knocked in the panels one by one and hammered at the bar behind them until the bar fell away , brackets and all . Then he opened the door and walked into the warm lighted room . A fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had not seen a kettle with a spout for more than a year . The hammer dropped out of his hand , clanked on the hearthstones , but he let it lie . He thought he was standing steady , but he was weaving on his feet . He had forgotten all about the woman ; even when she stole down the stairs to see what had become of him he did not hear her . She stood there watching him with her round eyes rolling the whites in her black face and her lips hanging flabbily open . She saw a man so thin he hardly seemed like a man at all , with a mess of light brown hair showing white streaks and hanging clown on his shoulders , and a matted beard and a torn shirt , and rotten wet trousers and bare feet . The feet were bleeding . She saw the blood on the hearthstones . And then she saw the fetter scars on his ankles and wrists . " Lan ' sakes , " she breathed . " You ain ' no booger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glazed eyes did not shift from the kettle " If I could have a cup of tea . . . " He sat down weakly . The negress was a young wench . Her curiosity and sympathy were powerfully aroused . " You one of de prison people , " she announced . She nodded as he did not contradict her . " Soon as I lay my eyes on you , I say , Leeza , dat am one of de prison people . He got put in jes ' like ol ' Massa . Dat ' s what he did . ' " She came forward . " Co'se you can have some tea . And I ' 11 jes ' bring along some eatables wid it . " She flurried about her job , chattering , " Dey takes away de hones ' people . Dey takes me away f'um ' em . Mistah Phelps he join de Committee of Safety and he get to be a powerful big man and he get me when dey lock up my ol ' fambly . He 's gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but since he tuk to fallin ' off de horse , Missis she jest obliged to go wid urn . Lot of de wimmen folks has to now . Dey have their party and de man they have theirs . " John Wolff shivered with the tea . It scalded him , but the taste was so penetrating that he could not stop drinking . Warmth flooded him . The negress stood beside him , offering a collop of cold pork and a slice of heavy bread . She watched him with a kind of pride . " Whar you gwine ? " she asked softly . " You cain ' stay here . " " No , " said John Wolff . " No , I ' m going to Canada . " " You cain ' go dat way . " Her courage made her swell herself . " Here , " she said . " I ' 11 fix you fo ' de trip . I use ' to shave old Massa . " John Wolff was content just to sit still . He let the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's razor and she hacked his hair short . Then she went upstairs and rummaged an old pair of shoes , and a coat and a pair of trousers . " Dey ' re kind of monst'us-lookin ' on you , " she said , " but you got to cover up dem iron marks . " Her face was proud over her handiwork . She was a clean-lookingwench , quite young . " Thanks , " said John Wolff . " Maybe I better be going . " " You take me wid you ? " she suggested , making eyes at him.  | He said , " I ' ve got to find Ally . " " I he'p you . " " No , " he said . " It ' s too far . I ' m going out to Niagara . " He felt strength coming back to him . He had n't thought of going there , before . But it occurred to him now that he might be able to find someone who had heard of Ally at that place . The negress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along nohow . I guess I ' 11 have ro stay here . " She watched him sidelong . " I ' 11 jes ' have to chase myself out into de rain , " she went on , as he made no sign of having heard her . " Less'n you bash me wid de hammer a couple of times . " He shivered . " No . " " Den ' I got to say you bus ' in here and took dese things . Oh , Mr. Phelps , he 'll lay into me . But he air ' so smart . Ain ' none of dese folks is so smart . " John Wolff took his eyes from the hammer . He turned and went out into the rain . The negress called after him shrilly : " You take de lef ' branch , Massa . Dat bring you into Canaan bimeby . " He went along without a word . NIAGARAIt was late in November . A light snow had begun early in the afternoon . It drifted down without noticeable wind . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . The walls of the fort looked brown and close to the earth . Even the stone mess house and its two flanking towers seemed to huddle between the parallel expanses of lake and sky . The river and the flat of the land were gray with cold . The smoke from the barracksand the officers ' mess rose thinly against the falling flakes and mingled with the smoke from the small Indian camp and the huts of ' trappers , traders , and independent rangers that made a struggling kind of village beyond the gate . The people moving down desultorily to the shore seemed pinched . They talked a little and they stared with a kind of deferred eagernessat the small sloop that was approaching the dock . The freeze was due on the lake any day ; and the sloop was the last boat expectedtill next April . In their scarlet coats a squad of soldiers from the fort marched down among the Indians and whites and took their station at the head of the makeshift dock , grounding their muskets and standing at a chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people . At the last boat 's arrival it had been swamped and the outer end broken off . But nobody was expecting much of this boat .... John Wolff , staring from the foredeck , watched the low land creeping towards the boat . His eyes wandered slowly over . the crowd . He had been six weeks reaching Niagara . He was gaunt and footsore . But his pallor was disappearing . He had crossed the Hudson at the mouth of the Hoosic and made his way to Ballston village , and there , by chance , he had picked up two men named Kennedy and Miller who had come down from Saint John 's to visit their families . They had used their leaves to cross Champlain and tramp sixty miles of enemy country , and the day John Wolff arrived they were planning to return . They took him with them . At Saint John 's he learned that Major John Butler was in garrison at Niagara . There was talk that Butler was recruiting a regiment of his own . Nobody knew very much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve under . If you liked frontier service . As the boat drew in , people began calling out to the sloop from the shore , and the deck hands yelled back . Nobody said anything in particular . There was nothing to say.  |p293The  boat warped alongside the dock and the business of unloadingbegan at once without ceremony , for the master wanted to get back across the lake before the freeze . He moved up beside John Wolff now , smoking his short pipe , the tail of his red knitted cap hanging down beside his cheek . He said , " Here ' s where you get off . " His voice was sarcastic in spite of his joke . John Wolff said , " Maybe I can get to see Mr. Butler and he ' 11 lend me the money . " The master spat over the side . " I ' 11 collect it next spring . Ai n't no hurry . " He sucked his pipestem free and stared westward across the river . " That ' s where you ' 11 live , I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort . " " ' T is . But that ' s where they 're building the barracks . They ii n't got any nails . I just as soon not see Major Butler till I got some nails to bring him . Maybe I ' 11 have them next spring . " John Wolff looked west . Well back from the river shore a low line of log buildings raised bark roofs against the sky . They looked even more bleak , even more huddled under the snow , than the fort . " God , " said the master . " I do n't see how folks can stand to live here . They must be crazy . Ai n't more than eighty women in the whole place , barring the Indians . And what I 've seen of most of them , they would n't raise the hackles of a six weeks ' rabbit . " He looked companionably at John Wolff . " You said you ' d lost your wife , did n't you ? " " Yes . " " That ' s how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose them , or something . " He gestured with the pipe . " But out here you ca n't even find them . I do n't see why you came out here . " He cocked his head . " By God , " he said , " hear the falls . When they sound that way I begin to expect ice . Well , you might as well get off . I ai n't spoiling my time here much longer . "  | The dock was now loaded with boxes and barrels  --  shoes , flour , rum , powder kegs , pork , salt beef , blankets . " I wish there was some nails , though , " said the master . He shook hands . " There ' s a couple of the new rangers coming down . Maybe it ' s Butler . Guess I ' 11 get below . " Wolff saw three men in green coats coming down to the oppositeshore . They got into a skiff and rowed over the river . In the stern sat a short gray-haired man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mouth . " Grange ! " he shouted . " Mr. Grange . Did you bring me any nails ? " " No , I did n't . " The master stuck his knitted cap out of the cabin . " Why did n't you ? " " I could n't get them . That ' s why ! " " Did you hand over my requisition ? " " Yes , I did ! " Major Butler 's face was black with suppressed rage . " Did n't they say anything ? " " They said nails was scarce . " " That ' s a lie . " " I ai n't saying it ai n't , am I ? " " What did they say ? " " They said , Jesus Christ , you ' d think the old bastard was going to win the war with a kag of nails . ' " The major drew in his breath . Then he seemed to collapse back into himself and his eyes became helpless . But he started to grin . " Why could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The master grinned back . " Well , I did n't just want to crucify you , Major . " In his relief , he prodded John Wolff to the side . " Here ' s a man wants to jine on with you , Major . Come all the way from Simsbury Prison in Connecticut . I thought he might kind of take the place of a kag of nails . He ' s kind of built like a nail , ai n't he ? "  | John Wolff flinched at the major 's direct stare . Then he drew in his breath and stared back . Butler lowered his voice . " What 's your name ? " " John Wolff . " " Wolff ? Wolff ? I seem to remember the name . " " I kept store at Cosby 's Manor . " " Oh , I remember you now . You want to join Butler 's Rangers ? " His voice had a kind of pride at the name . As if the organizationwere something tangible , like hand work . " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir . I was arrested a year ago last August . " " That ' s a long time . " The red face quieted . " Get into the boat , man , and come back with us . This is Sergeant McLonis . He came from your part of the valley . You may know him ? " John Wolff shook hands with the young man as he got into the boat . He felt shy . He thought he might feel better when he had a good warm uniform coat like McLonis 's . He studied the uniform . Green coat , with crossed buff breast straps . The lining of the coat was scarlet . The hat was a skullcap of black leather , with a leather cockade over the left ear and a brass plate over the forehead . The waistcoat was of heavy green woolen , and the fulllengthleggings of Indian tanned deerskin . It was a good uniform , Wolff thought , fixed for use in the woods . " Sit down , " said Major Butler . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see Bolton to-day . " He turned to Wolff . " I hear that Thompson 's house and your store were burnt by the rebels , Wolff . is too bad . It 's going to be a long while before you can get back , I guess . With the mess St. Leger and Burgoyne made of it . We ca n't get any government support for a full-sized campaign . By God , we ca n't even get nails from them . " The skiff smacked over the slight ripple . The drip from the vat 's had an icy sound . The air was raw and piercing.  | " We ' 11 have to do the best we can ourselves , " said Butler . " How old are you , Wolff ? " " Fifty-odd . " He was holding his breath to ask . He could n't seem to get the question out , he wished so desperately to ask . " That 's not too old if you 're in sound health . But it 's hard work , campaigning through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can give you work round here . " " Thank you , sir . I ai n't so strong now . But I ' 11 be all right . I used to have good health . " The other men kept watching him . Then he saw that Major Butler was looking too . He saw that his sleeves had drawn back showing the iron scars . " You 've had a hard time , " said Butler . " Maybe you ca n't forget it , but it 's better to try to , Wolff . " He raised himself stiffly as the boat landed on the shore . " They 've kept my wife and childrendown there . I ca n't get them exchanged . " " Yes , sir . " Wolff 's face started to work . He blurted out , " Do any women come here from the valley , sir ? " " Some got through . " He was brief . " Why ? " " You have n't seen my wife  --  Alice Wolff ? Ally , she ' s called . Kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Butler shook his head and glanced away . The men shook their heads too . McLonis said , " It would be known if she was here . It would be bound to . " His voice was gentle with sympathy . " Can you send letters down there , ever ? " Butler said , " I can send one under a flag , when a flag goes . But a letter ' s not likely to reach her unless you know where she is . " John Wolff , walking behind him towards the low log barracks , said , " Yes . I ' d forgot . The store got burned , did n't it ? " The snow began to drive a little before the first breath of the wind.  |p297PAID  OFFTHOUGH there had been several light falls at German Flats early in November , the snow had not lasted . But now , as Lana looked out from the kitchen window of Mrs. McKlennar 's house , it seemed to her that snow must surely come soon . She had prayed for snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of the Mount boys in Jerseyfield . Deep snow alone , in the woods betweenthemselves and Canada , could ensure their safety . Until it came , no family living beyond easy reach of the forts could feel secure ; and many of them had once more moved into German Flats . At Mrs. McKlennar 's , Gil and Lana had moved into the stone house , while their own log house had been turned over to Joe Boleo and Adam Helmer . Both were homeless men , but Gil said that in the event of a raid , he and they together could hold a stone house like McKlennar 's safe as a castle . For two days long lines of steely clouds had been moving out of the northwest . People in the valley could feel no wind ; there was no visible sign of it except the clouds , or the sudden bending of the trees on one of the higher hills . As Lana looked through the window she saw Joe Boleo emerge from the farmhouse , drawing on his foul pipe and studying the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard . " Do you think it ' s going to snow ? " she asked . He held his position , eyes aloft , the sparse hair on his half-baldp300head shivering as if with cold . " Women are the devil , " he replied at large . " Why , Mr. Boleo ! I only asked a question . " He turned a sober face on her . " That ' s so , " he said in obvious surprise . Lana flushed , then laughed . Her cheeks were bright , against the gray background of the winter trees ; her eyes shone . She enjoyedthis shambling , indolent , gangling man for all his musky smell that reminded her of pelts . Now she made her voice sound humble : " Well , is it going to snow , do you think , please , Mr. Boleo ? " Joe kept grinning to himself . He was n't like Adam Helmer , who hated the sight of a pretty girl carrying a baby in her inside because it seemed to take the point out of her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown especially fond of Lana 's . " Sure , " he replied . " It ' s going to snow hard . There 's a real storm coming . Feel the cold . No , you ca n't feel it on your skin . You 've got to feel it in your nose . You can smell a big snow before it comes . And look there ! " He pointed his long finger at a gap in the tumbling rollers of the clouds . " Just watch there a minute . " As Lana came close to sight along his finger , Joe 's eyes slid sidewise . He thought she looked happy to-day . She was a real nice girl , he thought , the way she brought him and Adam things to eat and cleaned their house out for them . " You keep watching . " He moved his shoulder so that it touched hers and he could feel the round soft solid curve through her dress . He even felt her draw her breath . " Oh , the geese ? " " Geese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . Higher than hell and straight south . " She saw them come and go , leaving the clouds in their wake , a rippling line . " And there ' s another thing , " said Joe . " Keep still . Do n't even breathe . "  |p30I  He liked to see her when she held her breath . " You mean that singing sound ? What is it ? " " That ' s high wind . You can hear it that way in the westward country where the land lies flat . Down here we get it when the wind blows high . " Her lips were parted , quick and red to breathe the cold . " Now you ' d better get inside , " he said . " A girl in your shape has got responsibilities . And anyways , Gil will be hungry for his dinner . He ' 11 want to get started right after . " " Oh yes , " she exclaimed . " The paymaster ' s coming to-day . " " Yes , " said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By God , we ought to be rich . Rich enough so I can buy you a present maybe . " He eyed her with sly eyes . " Oh , thank you , Mr. Boleo . But you ought to save your money . " " I ai n't a hand at saving . Why , sometimes I ' ve made thirtypounds and spent it all in a couple of throws in Albany . " " Throws ? " " Well , maybe I got tossed around by the girls a little . " He spoke with a kind of boastfulness . " Down there the girls get at a man like me . He ca n't hardly help it . " His wrinkled face expanded . " God , " he said , " the things that have happened to me , though ! " " Why , Mr. Boleo ! " Lana was bubbling with delight . " Well , I had n't ought to talk this way to you . " " I ' m sure a girl would n't rob you . Not up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the trouble . Women are the devil . " Gil and Adam came in at noon . Gil with the cart piled high with firewood to add to the corded tiers already in the woodshed , and Adam carrying the hog-dressed carcass of a buck on his broad shoulders . The three men hung up the deer in the woodshed , and all came up to the stone house for dinner , sitting down at the table with Mrs. McKlennar , who derived a monstrous satisfaction from all Joe 's stories . She was delighted also with Adam Helmer . Any big man could put a flutter under her ribs , and Adam , with his coarse , good-featured face and long yellow hair , pricked her mettle . The kitchen reeked of their tobacco-tainted clothes , and there was a wet bloodstain on the shoulders of Adam 's deerskin shirt . 1k. side the two , Lana always noticed Gil 's cleanliness with pride . But to-day he was as excited and noisy as they . All three men were bursting with the prospect of ready money coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Gil had earlier said to Lana that they would need the money . What little cash he had had dwindled away to nothing , and he would not receive his year 's salary of a hundred and twelve dollars until April . Militia money would be handy to buy some necessary stuff for clothes , shoes , and store flannel , out of which Lana could work things for the baby during the winter . Besides , their powder was getting short ( and the price was high ) . Lana and the negress , Daisy , served them with samp and pork , and slices of dried squash fried in lard and flour , and apples baked in maple sugar . In the midst of dessert , Mrs. McKlennar got up suddenly and fetched a bottle of sack from the cellar , pouring them each a glass . " My husband always celebrated on pay day , " she explained . " I aught to start you boys off right . " Joe Boleo rolled the liquor on his tongue . " I ' d like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some right good notions , " he said politely . But as they went out of the door , he whispered to Adam , " I ' 11 bet that horny Irishman got him a good stiff drink of rum to wash it out with . " Mrs. McKlennar watched them go . " Look , " she said to Lana , " it ' s started snowing . " Fine white flakes were driving down upon the valley . Already they had made a thin dusting over the earth and the three men tramping abreast towards Fort Dayton left muddy footprints in it . " Lord , " said the widow , " they ' re three fine boys . " Then she flung her arm round Lana 's shoulders and her horselike face softened . " Come upstairs , " she said . " I was in the attic before dinner and I found some things I thought you might use for the baby . " Lana wondered what Mrs. McKlennar could possibly have that would be useful to a baby . The house grew warmer as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap into the attic , the air was cold again . It was darker too , with the snow falling outside the one small gable window . The loose boards clattered under the widow 's tread . She bent down suddenly . " I got these out , " she said . Lana looked down . She saw a cradle and blankets , a miniature plate , and a silver spoon . The widow breathed harshly through her nose . Two bright spots had flushed her gaunt cheeks . " One of Barney 's soldiers made the cradle , and Barney got the other things and showed them to me on our wedding night for a joke . I remember how we both laughed . But we never used them . I do n't know why . We tried the best we knew , too . " Lana said softly , " I think it ' s awful nice of you to let me have them . " " Nonsense , " snorted Mrs. McKlennar . " Do n't get sentimental . " She rubbed her nose . " Take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry them ; you better not lift such heavy stuff . " The snow was driving hard against their faces when the three men forded West Canada Creek and came in sight of the fort . The number of footprints on the road made Adam laugh . " I bet the militia never turned out as good before . " Joe Boleo grinned . " How much do you think the pay amounts to ? " Gil asked . " Plenty , " Adam replied . " I do n't know how they figure it , butwe commenced in June , going down to Unadilla , and we was pretty busy right along till Arnold went home . It ' s pretty near three months , up here . Down east the campaign was longer . Maybe they ' 11 pay us for the whole campaign . " They ' encountered George Weaver going through the gate . I k was looking so solemn and embarrassed that they asked him what was bothering him . " Why , " he said , " Mrs. Real wanted to come along to collect what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could come with me . And Emma did n't like it much on account of John and Mary Reall . But I said it would n't be neighborly not to take her . She ' s just ahead . " Mrs. Reall , looking surprisingly cheerful , turned back to greet them . She had her daughter Mary with her . Mary , Gil thought , was growing into a nice girl . There was a still , brown earnestness in her eyes he did n't expect to see in any Reall . And she looked a little appalled by all the men round her and her mother , a little ashamed that her mother should have come , perhaps . Gil held his hand out , introducing his two companions to the Realls . Adam smiled at the girl and said to the mother , " You come with us , ma'am . We ' 11 all go in together . " The soldiers ' mess had been turned into the paymaster 's office for the afternoon , and a couple of the garrison were assigned to guard duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companionsthrough the crowd , the soldiers barred the entrance . " When does this paying start ? " Adam demanded . " When he gives us the say-so . " One of the soldiers jerked his head back toward the door . They stopped and chatted with the men round them . Some people eyed Mrs. Reall and Mary curiously , but nobody took notice of them more than to say " How do you do . " Then a pompous voice cried sharply from the messroom , " All right , lads . " One of the soldiers turned and bawled , " Do I let in the whole shebang , mister ? " " No ! Let in twenty or so , that ' s all the room will hold comfortably ; and then close the door until they ' re paid off . Then let in another lot . We ca n't freeze , you know . "  |p305With  Adam 's broad shoulders clearing a path , Gil and Weaver and Joe and the Reall women were among the first to enter . The room seemed dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow itself , when one looked out at it , seemed to lend to the darkness . A log on the hearth was disintegrating into a mountain range of coals . With his back to it , in a black coat , red waistcoat , and soiled white tie , sat the paymaster , come up from Poughkeepsie at Colonel Bellinger 's request . He had the roll of the regiment before him and the colonel 's muster sheets , and these he was comparing and checking against each other . He finished as the men crowded in and barked a little in his throat . ; Line up , " he said . " Line up down the table . 1 ca n't handle you all at a time . " As he stepped up to the table , Gil noticed that Colonel Bellinger was in the room . The colonel looked grim . Gil could not understand why . " Hey , there , " said the paymaster . " What ' s that woman doing in here ? " Mrs. Reall , who was third in the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before the paymaster . " I came to collect my husband 's pay . " " Hak , hak , hak , " went the little man . " No women allowed in here , ma'am . " " But I said why I came . " " What 's his name ? Why is n't he here himself ? " " His name is Christian Reall , " said Mrs. Reall . " He ' s dead . " The little man examined his list . " He ai n't marked so . Now , ma'arn , will you kindly get out ? " " Just a minute . " Colonel Bellinger came forward . " I do n't know why Christian Reall is n't marked on the list as dead . But he was killed and scalped . I saw him myself . I think his widow is entitled to his pay . " The little man looked angrily at the colonel . " I ' m sorry , " he said . He seemed to swell with the importance of his position . " I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v dead men . " He gave his little barking cough . " But where do I get his pay ? I 'm entitled to it . I 'm his lawful wedded widow , " said Mrs. Reall " Claim against the state . Swear it to a justice . File the claim . flak , heck . " " But I ai n't got any money . I need it . I 've got children , mister . " " They ' re no business of mine . " " Look here , " said the colonel . " Surely he earned his money as well as any man could . I 'll swear to the time of his death and to Mrs. Reall ' s being his wife . Ca n't you pay her for his time up to then ? " " My dear sir , " said the paymaster . " We do n't do things that way . I 've explained the procedure . The claim will be filed ' betorethe auditor-general and passed by an act of Congress . " " Jesus Christ , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with admiration . " Sir ? " . No one answered . Colonel Bellinger took Mrs. Reall 's arm . " I ' 11 see you get it , and I ' 11 see you have something on account . " He led her to the door . The men turned back to the paymaster , who was clearing his throat . " Give your names , " he said . " I 've got the money sorted for you . " A man named Hess and a man named Stoofnagle drew pay Then it was Gil 's turn , " Gilbert Martin . " " Company ? " " Mark Demooth 's . " " Oh yes , Captain Demooth 's . Here you are . The account ' s different from the other companies . You get no pay for the five days ' service with General Arnold . You were requested to act as scouts for Continental troops . Therefore your expenses will be due you from the United States Congress . You will receive it in due course . That makes your pay $4.27 instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer 's militia service in this regiment . " A stunned silence fell upon the room . The two men who had already received pay began counting it . Gil looked down at the money in his hands . Four dollars and twenty-seven cents . Suddenlyhis throat swelled . He thought of Oriskany . He did n't feel like waiting for the others to be paid . He went towards the door . Perhaps the little man felt uneasy , for he started coughing again as Joe Boleo gave his name . The gangling woodsman slouched over him . " Thanks , " he said . " It sure is fun to lick the British . " The little man coughed . " It ' s the regular pay according to the regulations of the New York Congress . Militia serving in its own precincts draws pay only for actual duty . In your case , expedition to Unadilla  --  fourteendays . You were then discharged . Expedition to relieve Fort Stanwix , unsuccessful  --  five days . You were again discharged . Expedition under General Arnold , successful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars and fifty-two cents . It seems plain to me . " " You said the word , bug-tit . " Joe followed Gil out into the snow . The roofs of the buildings were whitened . The stockade looked black against it . The air was getting colder ; soldiers blowing into their hands on sentry walks made clouds of steam that whipped rapidly away among the swirling flakes . Adam Helmer overtook them . He was laughing loudly . " I ought to have brought my purse along . " Gil had nothing to say . He went out through the fort gate and turned left for home . The snow was making fast . The other two men walked in his footprints , Joe at the tail end , muttering to himself . " What you talking about ? " Adam demanded.  | " I was wondering how in hell those buggers got to be that way . " " How in hell what buggers got to be what way , Joe ? " " Those Congresses . " THE SNOWThe snow lay two feet deep when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Emma , had come to stay ; and she walked along on her husband 's bear-paw shoes with a feeling of complete security . She had n't told any of her menfolk where she was headed for . She had merely announced at dinner that she was feeling houseboundand that a romp in the snow would do her good . The cabin seemed awfully small for four large people : herself , and George , a solid man , and John , nearly a man ; and now Cobus was catching up to John . All three had looked at her from over their plates ; all three had said , " All right , Ma , " grinning their boys ' grins . She was proud of her menfolk , and as she left the house she had a comforting assurance that they were proud of her . Even John was , preoccupied though he had been these past months with the Reall girl . She felt sure that he had no idea that she was going to Fort Herkimer , with the deliberate intention of talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left Fort Herkimer to live in the cabin on Peter Weaver 's place , where George had agreed to give his time and the boys ' for a third share in the farm produce . She had had no intention of ever seeing the girl ; when George announced that he was going to take Mrs. Reall to the pay-off , Emma had been hurt , as if by doing this George were taking John 's and Mary 's side against herself . But as soon as he told her how the paymaster had treated Mrs. Reall , all Emma 's natural wrath had risen blazing.  | " I wish I ' d been along , " she said ; and " I wish you had , Emma , " said George . " The girl seemed to take it hard , ashamed to see her Ma put down , and all . " " It ' s a wonder you men did n't stand up for them . " " There was n't nothing we could do . Bellinger was there . He could n't and he ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the idea came to her , now that she felt the Realls had been put upon , that maybe Mary could be talked into a state of sense . It was just as important for the girl , after all , as for Emma 's John , not to hasten to a wedding . As the blood started flowing through her body , she pulled the shawl back from her gray hair , drawn uncompromisingly to its honest knot . The cold whipped up the color in her cheeks . Her stride was masculine ; the weight of the snowshoes made her swing her feet . She ought to have been wearing trousers . She kept kickingthe loose snow from the webs . It was powdery and it glittered when she flung it off . She trod down hard to hear the squeak , putting her weight forward over her knees . God had n't granted it to Emma to have a pretty face ; but she had a fine , well-working body . Walking by herself made her conscious of its strength and vigor , feeling herself in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer muscular delight , was an expression of her underlying femininity . Where pretty women who had looking-glasses might have examined their naked selves , Emma , instead , renewed acquaintance with herself by means of what she called her romps . To Mary Reall , who saw her swing through the gate , Emma 's hearty good health was an expression of ruthlessness . The girl was afraid of her . She knew instinctively , even as Emma asked to see Mrs. Reall , that John 's mother had come down to talk to her . They had a corner of the northwest blockhouse , which they shared with two of the Andrustown families . Mary 's mother was lying on one of the bunks originally built for a garrison . A fire in the centre of the floor gave all their heat to the three families.  |p310The  smoke had blackened the rafters and the ceiling boards . It found its way upwards through the trap and out of the spy loft when the wind allowed . It was a miserable place . " It 's surely nice of you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just out for a walk . " Emma looked round her . Nochance in here to talk to Mary . " How are you making out ? " Mrs. Reall explained that Colonel Bellinger had lent her moneyout of his private purse . He was such a nice man . So gentrified . " Yes , " said Emma , forcing herself to be agreeable . " But youca n't live like that forever . What will you do next year ? " Mrs. Reall was not disturbed . " I 've sent in the claim for damages that Kit made out before he got killed . I guess I ought to hear of it pretty soon . I showed it to Mr. Rebus White , and he said it ought to be honored by the state . " She used the words with importance . " Who ' s this Mr. White ? " demanded Emma . " He ' s the corporal here . He comes from Massachusetts . He ' s a real nice man , Emma , and thinks maybe he 'll settle here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Emma gave a neutral grunt . " George talks about making a claim . How much did yours mount up to ? " Mrs. Reall began to shuffle among her bedding . " I 've got it somewhere . The copy , I mean . Oh yes , here it is . It comes to two hundred seventy-one pounds and fifteen shilling . " " Two hundred pounds ! How on earth did you figure it out that way ? " " Jeams MacNod wrote it out for Kitty . One dwelling house , a hundred pounds . One grist mill , twenty-five ; one bedstet , fourteenpounds ; one hollan ' cupboard , seven pounds . " She rattled ofl the items , having them by heart . Emma 's jaw fell open . " But that ai n't so . They never was worth that much in hard money . That bed . And that hollan ' cupboard  --  you never had one . " Mrs. Reall was not disturbed.  | " I ' ve always wanted one . Mr. MacNod said it was best to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . " Emma stared . " Well , " she said suddenly , " it ' s not my business . " Her eyes swung round to Mary . The girl was watching her . Her thin face was dark red . " My Lord ! " thought Emma . " She ' s ashamed . " " You see , " continued Mrs. Reall , " we got our government now , we ought to use it for ourselves . That ' s what Mr. White says , too . " " It ' s how you look at it , I guess . " Privately Emma considered it stealing ; she never had trusted the Realls . But she must not show her thoughts too plainly . " How are you fixed for the winter ? " Mrs. Reall laughed . " I guess we ' 11 make out all right . They ' re sending food to us , and we all share in here . It ' s hard on the little ones , not having shoes . They 've started chilblains early this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people like the Realls . Out of her sense of shame , Emma said , " There ' s some shoes Cobus has outgrowed . I ' 11 send them down . " She got up and said good-bye . She was glad she had two miles to walk home , to get some fresh air into her . " Good-bye , " called Mrs. Reall . Emma halted outside the door to put on her snowshoes . " Can I help you , Mrs. Weaver ? " Mary had come out with her . Emma said , " I guess I ' m still young enough to put them on my-self . " The girl drew back as if she had been slapped . Her thin face was quite white . It made her eyes seem larger . " Mrs. Weaver , " she said quietly . But her voice had the tensenessof a child 's . She looked like a child in her ragged , poorly sewn petticoat . Even in her rough home-knitted stockings her legs were thin . Emma felt like pitying her as she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on her snowshoes and stamped her feet to settle them in the laces . " What is it , Mary ? " She looked at the child 's face . She was n't getting enough to eat . She did n't look half strong enough for her age ; why , at her age Emma had had a breast and shoulders , whatever her face looked like . The girl drew a shuddering breath . " You must n't think too bad about Ma . She does n't think that ' i stealing . It ' s just the way she thinks . " Emma said heartily , " 1 know . She ca n't help it . " Then she was caught by the girl 's level gaze . Whatever else you could say about her , the girl was brave . She was scared to death , but she was standing up to it . Emma liked that . " What you mean is we ' re all the same , do n't you ? You think so because John and I are in love with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Emma 's lips . " What do you two children know about love ? " " What did you , Mrs. Weaver , when you were fifteen ? " " Nothing , " said Emma , staunchly . " But you got married , did n't you ? " The girl had spunk . Her forehead looked too big for her face , thin the way it was . And her underlip was shaky . But she looked straight at Emma , and Emma , instead of getting angry , found herselfliking it , to her surprise . " Have you ever been sorry ? " " Not more than most women , Mary . " " Has Mr. Weaver ? " Emma suddenly smiled . " He has n't said so . " She drew a deep breath . " Will you walk to the gate with me ? " The girl came . The snow seemed to pinch the calves of her legs as she stood beside Emma outside the palisade . She held her hands in front of her and waited for Emma to speak . Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you and John see each other often ? " " He comes ' down when he can . " Mary 's narrow face was wist  --  ful . " It ' s not often , though . "  | " John 's a good boy . " Lord knows how they make love here in this place , Emma thought . " Mary , I do n't mean to he hard on you . Or on John . But you do n't know anything about getting married . " Again the small half-smile . " I know , " said Emma hastily . " A girl has to begin . I ' m thinking of you , too . How do you know you love John ? How do you know John loves you ? I ' d hate for either of you to be unhappy . " " We ai n't scared to try , Mrs. Weaver . " " I know . I know . You ' re never scared at your age . Or at least not much . Do you think you could make a good wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were downcast . " I do n't know . I 'd try . I never had much chance to learn things . " " I should think you had n't ! " Emma 's contempt got the best of her . " Not but . what your Ma means well , though  --  in her own way . " She saw the girl taking another deep breath . Again the eyes met hers in the same level regard . " I wanted to tell you , Mrs. Weaver , that John and I are in love and we aim to get married . If he wants to keep on we 'll do it anyway . " Her color rose . " You could n't stop me without kill ing me , Mrs. Weaver . " " Look here , " Emma said . " I ' m not going to stand in your way , Mary . But I want you both to be sure . Will you promise me not to get married for a year ? " And meeting the eyes again , " Or not to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted . " After all , it would n't be easy to do that up here , without banns , you know . " The girl gulped . " We wo n't . " Emma believed her . " Do n't start crying , " she said abruptly . She swung away for home , making her best pace . She did n't look round ; but kept at her work . She felt her blood restored to its racing beat that she enjoyed so much . She was flushed andp314breathless when she got back to the cabin , barely in time to start the evening meal . She looked at John 's face . " You ca n't guess where I 've been , " she said , laughing at him . " No you ca n't . I ' ve been to Fort Herkimer seeing the Realls . " John blushed . " I thought it would be nice for John to go down for me with some shoes of Cobus 's I promised . I thought while he was there , he might ask Mary to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red to his eyes . George merely looked at Emma . He was used to her , but there were times when he felt quite confounded . Her and her romps in the snow ! MARCH THAWThe winter in German Flats passed uneventfully enough . The cold continued and the snow lay deep . Unmilled wheat was fetching seven shilling a bushel at Little Falls , where Ellis 's Mills were grinding for the army . Almost every week the mills shipped flour to Albany . When men heard stories of how the Continentalarmy was starving at a town called Valley Forge , they found it hard to believe . They wondered where the flour was going to . Occasional sleds that passed along the Kingsroad , Lilliputian in the still white world of snow , reminded the inhabitants that men were yet in garrison westward at Fort Stanwix . The sleds stopped the night at Fort Dayton and in the morning put out for the upper fort . They followed the river  --  hauling on the ice , a natural road . They went without a guard . The army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people feel secure . Some even came to regard the murder of the Mount boys as the trick of drunken Indians ; nobody could tell what to expect from a drunken Indian . N least of all the Indian himself . It made them discount the story of the presence of white men . That depended entirely on a nigger boy 's say-so . Up at McKlennar 's , the further the winter drew along , the more Joe Boleo expressed misgivings . When he and Adam and Gil were off hunting in the woods , Joe would keep tracking along the ridges spying across country , and he never came to a creek bottom without following it for half a mile or so . " Indians always hang to water , " he said . Gil and Adam Helmer often laughed between themselves at the figure he made , bent over on his snowshoes , his long neck outstretched , among the snow-loaded balsams . " You can laugh , you twerps , " he would say . " But wait till the snow starts going down . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , and he and Adam would begin killing deer . Adam was inclined to be jealous of Joe 's shooting . In his own overflowing strength , Adam liked to strike cross-country , running on his shoes for miles on end . But it was generally Joe , mousing along quietly , who found the deer . Then he would squat with his narrow tail just over the snow and wait for the other two to come back to him . He would sit there , looking at the deer , who always herded to the far side of the yard and stared back at him with their queerly lambent , soft eyes . Joe would be saying , " Poor pretty , poor pretty , " in a sorry sort of way , like an old woman sort of woodpecker , according to Adam , and then when Adam came he would begin shooting . Sometimes the two of them would shoot three or four deer , picking out the marks , calling the shots , pacing off , the distance from the wall of the yard , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Joe , " we got to keep our eye in . " " Shoot at a tree , " suggested Gil . Adam would be scornful . " You ca n't waste powder and ball on a tree . " Then they would select a doe that looked fairly plump and kill her and leave the rest lying in the yard . They kept not only McKlennar 's well supplied with meat , but carried deer after deer to the forts and the settlement , sometimes selling the meat , sometimesgiving it away . It depended on how they felt . In the evenings they would light a great fire in the farmhouse fireplace and lie in front of it , drinking rum and molasses ; and Gil generally went down to sit with them . Up at the stone house the women took to sewing things , making things for the baby , spinning . Mrs. McKlennar liked to spin with her big wheel , working the treadle with her vigorous foot , and making a hum come out of the whirling wheel like a voice against the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daisy , the negress , sitting in a corner , made a rug for the baby with a wooden crochet hook and strips of rags . Daisy could n't sew and she was unhappy till the widow suggested that she make the rug . She embarked upon a five-foot project , though what good a five-foot rug could do a baby nobody ever figured out , unless it was Daisy herself . Sometimes she had a run on a color , like red ; sometimes she spent two nights with brown , as if that were the color of her thoughts . It was no place for a man . In the farmhouse atmosphere , with the two woodsmen sprawled on the floor before the fire , telling each other tales or passing off the gleanings of the valley news , a man could be at ease . Joe liked to have the news from Herkimer 's house . There was talk of raising a monument that had been voted down in Albany , on the other side of the house from the well . Five hundred dollars had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would look . He returned still wondering . In February there was some talk that the Massachusetts garrisonsof Dayton and Herkimer were returning to their homes , havingcompleted their service . It was said that they would leave in March . No provision was made for their replacement . Demooth and Bellinger had been down to Colonel Klock in Palatine to organize a protest . All three men were trying to have Fort Stanwixabandoned and the German Flats forts strengthened . But Congress would not listen to their arguments . Congress held that Stanwix was the strategic defense of the valley . It was in  --   |p317timated  that they might send some troops to Cherry Valley , but that was all . Joe shook his head about it . " They might just as well have nobody at all . You wait till the snow leaves . You ' 11 see . " " See what ? " asked Gil . Joe grunted . " Indians . " Adam Helmer said skeptically :  --  " They got their medicine up there at Oriskany . " " That ' s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they might wait to come along with the next army . But the way it is they wo n't wait . They ' 11 want to get their face back . They ' 11 be after scalps . They wo n't care whose . They ' 11 feel they 've got to . Hell , boy , I 've lived with the Senecas , and I know . " " You lived with them , Joe ? " asked Gil . The gangling trapper stretched himself on the hearth to kick over a log with his heel . The fire blazed upward , pouring a ruddy light across his sweating body . The room reeked of the men 's smell , tobacco , and rum . It was stifling hot , making them all drowsy , and Joe 's voice was pitched low . " Oh yes , when I was young , like you lads . I used to trap up the Chinisee . I got along real good with the Senecas . I had a wife out there . She was a real nice girl , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as light as the Mohawk girls , but they ' re thinner . " He drank a little rum and turned his eyes thoughtfully on Gil and Adam . Outside the wind had died down with the coming of darkness , and the burning of the fire was even and fierce . " I never knew you was married , Joe . " " Sure , " said Joe . " I stayed there with her four years , without ever coming out . " His reminiscent grin made his face unbelievablyhomely . " My God , that girl was set on me ! " Adam was crouched in front of Joe . The firelight made his big face scarlet and threw lights in his long yellow hair . He held his glass in both hands , his hands passed over his knees . The shadowp318of his broad shoulders filled all the opposite wall . Now he turned a facetious eye on Gil . Gil grinned . But Joe knew what was going on in their minds . He said serf ously , " You ought to have been along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gil , now , he 's a settled kind of man . " He drew his breath , slowly , and belched . " Along in those days , a white matt was just about the finest thing that could happen to an Indian girl . It made her important in her town . When I first went out there , the Indians treated any white man like he was one of their sachems . Like a big bug , see , come visiting . They gave him a house in the town and then they sent in all the best-looking girls so he could take his pick and feel comfortable while he was staying . It was a good idea . Only it was n't so easy making your pick . Some of them girls was pretty nice . " He poured himself another drink and stirred the molasses in with his finger . " Some trappers got the idea of staying and then going off for a day and coming back and beginning over . There was n't any harm in that . It do n't matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it did n't happen that way to me . I got to the Chinisee Castle , the one they call Little Beard 's town now , and they sent in eighteen handpickedones . But right away I knew the one I wanted . I knew she ' d suit me fine . I was young-and-coming , see , and I suited her too . Do n't laugh , you timber beast . It ' s truth . She stood with the rest of them looking on the ground , the way they all done , but as soon as she made out all the rest was looking down , she just took one look at me and it fixed me . Boy , she could throw her eyes at you ! " " I believe you , " Adam said . " Go to hell . I reached out at her and I said , You , you me fine ! ' I had n't learned the language then . But she understood all right . The others went out , leaving just her . And as soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of scared and shy . I was pretty young , I guess , but it made me feel big . " She did n't come only to my shoulder and she had braids reach.  |p319ing  down to the middle of her thighs . She was n't only medium dark , too , and she was pretty in her best clothes . She had on a kind of red overdress , what they call Ah-de-a-da-we-sa , and a blue skirt with beadwork on it . She was a great hand with beadwork . It was what made her come high in marriage . And her pant things was doeskin with more beading on the foot . " " She come high ? " " I did n't know how I could pay her Ma , " Joe said seriously . " I did n't have only a bare stake . No beads for trading . I needed everything I had , see ? The girl 's Ma was something big . One of the chief 's lines . They keep their family on the female side . The way the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re going to keep the children anywhere near straight . . . . But I ' ve got away from me and the girl . Soon as we was alone she signed for me to set down by the fire and take off my shirt . She took a bone comb out of her belt and started combing my hair . She greased it and picked out the ticks and took pains where it was curled . She liked them curls . I had fine curly hair , you know . " Even though Joe looked so serious , they had to laugh . They stared at the shiny expanses of bare scalp between the remnants of his past beauty . Joe rolled over and turned his back and lifted his shirt to let the heat strike against the rum in his belly . " Lord , " he said over his shoulder . " When I went to bed with her it was pretty dark . But I did n't have to see her to know she was good-looking . I told her in the morning I ' d like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could n't speak the language . " Joe looked hurt . " You do n't have to when you 've done that to a girl . I just said so , and she caught on all right . She colored some . Most Indians do n't show color , but that was one of the things about her . That and teaching her to kiss . The way she caught on . You can fool around with all the heifers between here and Albany if you want to , but you wo n't know just what teachinga wild Indian to kiss is like . Well , she said she ' d like to fine , so I said fine , and she said what did I have to buy her with ? Well ,  | I opened my pack , and she went through it like a dog after a rabbit . She shook her head . She made it plain there was n't anythinggood enough . I felt bad , and she looked sorry . Then she clapped her hands . " " Yes , " said Adam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Adam . She did . " Joe began to look embarrassed . " I ' d been getting dressed and she come up to me and put her hands on my waist and made the motions I was to take my drawers off . I had red flannel drawers . " The two young men guffawed . " Honest to God , " said Joe . " I told the chief how I felt , and I got him to take them round to the old lady and she went near crazy over them . Later I heard she ' d gone right in and tried them on . They was some tight , but they stretched enough . Though she had to rig a kind of tassel in front when she wore them in the turtle dance . She made a little bark box for them and hung them over her bed . They were still in good shape four years later when the old lady led the Okewa for Lou . " " What ' s that , Joe ? " " It ' s the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , " said Joe . He blew smoke against the logs and watched the flame snatch it up the chimney . " After we got married , I and Lou went up the Chinisee . I built us a hunting cabin up there . It was good beaver country and a wonderful range for fisher . And she was a first-rate woman for a man . Knew how to take care of me . She was the only woman I ever had around that did n't get on a man 's nerves . When I felt like laughing , she was ready to bust with it herself . Never saw anybody so always happy . She would n't call me Joe . Just Boleo , only she could n't ever say the B. She called it Do-le-o . " Joe 's face was deeply concentrated . " And when the trap lines were n't bearing so good , she did n't make a lot of talk  --  what a white woman would call distracting you . She minded her business . I knew she was around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . And she never got lonesome . Seemed as if I was good enough for her . Of course we ' d go down to the Castle every once or twice a year . 1 had to trade my fur pack , see ? . . . It was a good life . And healthy . The way she kept me healthy . Used to make me hemlock tea to keep my skin open . Her cooking was Indian cooking , but she learned a few things , to please me . I told you she learned kissing . But it was a funny thing , she never got to be like a white woman . She was always shy about the way she acted with me . She would n't wash with me in the crick . Sometimes it got me mad . I never saw her naked in plain light . A bear kilt her while she was berrying . " Joe drank and drew a breath . " The queer thing was we never had no children . " " What ' s queer about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have children easy as letting go a crock of lard . John O'Beal now . He come out there and traded ; he bought my furs . He married a girl too , and had a mess of children . One of them ' s got to be a chief . His name ' s Cornplanter . " " You said John O'Beal ? " Adam asked . " Sure , he was quite a lad , too . But he soured on it . He came back here and lives down the valley somewhere . " " Near Fort Plain ? " suggested Adam . " Sure , that ' s the man . I ai n't seen him in some time . " Joe Boleo lay full length on his back , draining his glass . Gil asked , " What did you say her name was , Joe ? " " Well , her Indian name was Gahano . Means something like Hanging Flower . But I told you I called her Lou . You ought to have been out there in those days , Adam . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't so friendly about white men . You can marry all right . But they do n't trot the girls out for you any more . I quit myself when Lou died . . . . " But that was the way for a trapper to live . All you had to do was run your lines , and you had a nice cabin to come back to , and your dinner cooked , and a woman to mend your clothes . You just lay around , and got up warm in the morning . It did n't cost you a cent . " He looked at them again . " Most trappers campp322home in summer . They cleared out with the furs and spent their money , and the woman took care of herself while they was gone . Some kept two families going . But those buffaloes never spent the summer the way I did . We ' d take trips , her and me , and lay around fishing . We 'd go off where there was n't anybody , not even the tracks of anybody but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer shanty and she 'd plant corn . Yes , sir . You 'd just lay around listening to a big fish jump and wondering if it was worth the bother putting the worm in the water . Lou worked all the time we was on our vacation , readying hides and putting up quitcheraw against the winter . I whittled her a little press for making the cakes in , which tickled her a lot . And then she ' d go berrying to make pemmican . That was when the bear got at her . An old she-one with a couple of cubs . I spent a while tracking them and I killed the lot  --  " Joe paused and spat . " But , hell , " he went on , " that ' s not what I set out to tell you . Indians ai n't no good . This country would be a whole lot better off without any Indians . We ' d be better off right now , I tell you . And I would n't be setting here listening to that drip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam had been wishing he had been born in a good time of civilization so he could have gone out to the Indian country . His full lips were compressed and wet just thinking of it . A little lithe hard girl like Joe 's Lou , right now , would suit him fine . " Drip ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Joe with scorn . " Drip . The thaw 's commencing . Gil got to his feet . He went to the door of the cabin , opened it , and stood there , leaning out . The wind had turned to the south . He felt it damp against his face ; he could feel it even with the outrush of overheated air from the kitchen . " You ' re right , Joe , " he said over his shoulder . " It ' s the thaw beginning . Sugaring ought to start early this year . " " Shut that door ! " yelled Joe . " Do you want to freeze us ? " GERMAN FLATS : 1777  --  1778 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in full progress and the smoke from the sugar bushes made pale blue wavering ribbons against the hillsides , a horseman left the Snydersbushstockade and rode full gallop the eight miles south to the falls , turned west along the Kingsroad , and flogged his way through the slushy ruts as fast as his blowing horse could lay foot to the ground . The spattery thudding of his hoofs was audible in Mrs. McKlennar'ssugar bush , high though it was above the road . They were boiling for the fourth day and some of the Eldridge people , the Smalls and the Caslers and the Helmers ,  --  Adam 's cousins , Phil , his wife Catherine , and son George ,  --  were attending . The women were knitting by the fire , minding the kettle . Adam , on his own initiative , was bringing the wood for the fire and hanging round the women as much as possible . He was wearing a new hunting shirt , colored after the pattern Morgan 's Riflemen were supposed to wear . It was of heavy white linen with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bottom hem . He looked inordinately handsome in it ; his yellow hair was carefullycombed , and he had shaved . Gil and Captain Jacob Small and George Helmer were hauling in the sap on hand sledges from the trees where the boys gathered it from the small pails . It was a sunny , windless day , warm enough to make sitting in the open pleasant . The steady drip in the pails was like the ticking of a clock , as if the trees together combined to mark the passage of the time . The distance one could hear a drop fall in a bucket was surprising ; it was audible even above the women 's voices . Of all the men , only Captain Small , and Adam and Joe Bolen.  | had brought their guns . Adam and Small had left theirs in the little bark shanty before the kettle . But Joe was prowling the woods .. They did not know that he was making a cast three or four miles to the north and west . They would have laughed if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in the woods . Even with snowshoes it made heavy going . When they heard the horseman coming up the road , Gil and Captain Small , left their sledges and walked to the edge of the bluff . From there they could look down on him . The horse was floundering , but the man 's arm rose and fell with pitiless fatigue . Jacob Small took one look . " That ' s Cobus Mabee . He looks scared . " He took his hat oil and rubbed his grizzled head and stared incredulously at Gil . Adam , seeing them move to the edge of the bush , left the women and joined them . " What 's going on ? " he asked . Small said , " Cobus Mabee just went up to Daytan . " Adam laughed . " Maybe he ' s after Doc . " " He did n't look to me like that . Did he to you , Gil ?

Joe ' s back there in the woods . " Small said , " One of us ought to find out what ' s happened . Gil , there ' s George Helmer on the edge . You send him down and let him ride your mare up . No sense scaring the womenfolks . It ' s the first party of the year . " Adam went back to the shanty . He got his gun . " I ' m going to see if I can get a partridge , " he explained . " You ladies have got wood enough ? " " Oh yes , Adam . " They smiled at him . They went on with their talk . All except Lana . Suddenly Gil found her staring at him. p 325 He forced himself to smile . But she was n't deceived . And he shook his head and put his finger to his lips . His heart was like something shrunk inside himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's it going to do to her ? " Her face went deathly white . Then suddenly her chin went up and she said something in a quick high voice to Mrs. Small that made the latter laugh and pat her red hair . Mrs. McKlennar nodded , looked at Gil and smiled . Mrs. McKlennar had the instinct for such things . He guessed that she had caught on even before Lana . He made himself go back to his sledge and haul it to the kettle . Nobody had missed George Helmer . The sugaring continued . But he and Captain Small managed to bring the children to trees closer to the fire without anyone 's noticing , and themselves kept a watch on the woods . They would hear Adam shoot if anything went wrong , and he would hear Joe . Now the drip of the sap seemed startlingly loud . Two hours passed before George Helmer returned . He came quietly without fuss , and without fuss Small and Gil joined him at his trees . He told them at once . " The destructives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites was all the Fairfield people who went off before last August . Suffree*es Casselman , and Countryman , and the Empies . They killed little John Mabee and they took everybody else prisoner but Polly . She got away from the Indians . But she seen the rest . They 've burnt every house and barn in the town . There ai n't a thing left . " George Helmer was an earnest young man , and he was scared . Captain Small said , " Did anybody see which way they went ? " " They went out on the Jerseyfield road , " said George . " Cobus Mabee had it all planned to move down to his uncle 's place in Indian Castle . He ' s moved his wife and the baby down and he was going hack to get Polly and John and the cow . He stopped for dinner in Snyder 's . When he got up to Fairfield the houses was still burning . Had n't nobody known a thing about it , any.  | wheres else . " He caught his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you plan to stay here , Jake ? " Jacob Small said , " Yes . Ai n't no sense in moving till Joe or Adam comes in . Do n't you go acting scared , George . We got to make sugar . We got to make enough for next winter , same as we ' 11 have to do our planting . " " My God , Jake ! " The young man 's face was pale . " How can aman go out and plough and plant with them in the woods ? " " I do n't know , " Small replied . " But either you got to die bun. gry or you got to raise food . " George said unsteadily , " That ' s right . " But his eyes kept rolling towards the woods . It was he who spied Joe and Adam coming in abreast . Joe was wringing wet with sweat and snow . He came over to Gil and Small and rested the rifle butt on the toe of one of his snowshoes . " Where 's George been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse lather on the inside of George 's pant legs . They told him . " That ' s good , " said Joe . " Good ? " cried George Helmer . " That ' s what 1 said .

" His eyes were owlish . " There was about twenty of them , nine Indians . They struck out some time yesterday for the north-east . " The five men stood together a moment . Joe asked , " How much more boiling have you got to do ? " " We could finish in a couple of hours . " " I guess you might as well finish , " said Joe . " You do n't think they ' 11 come back ?

" GERMAN FLATS : 1777  --  1778 327p327Nancy was inside the house when the news of Fairfield was kit-ought to the captain by a soldier from the fort . She had just finished clearing up after dinner , and in the silence she heard the aptain go out into the warm sunshine and she heard every word the man told him . When the captain came in she saw that he was worried . He looked almost frightened to her . " Where are you going ? " he asked sharply . " I ' m going to give this to the pigs , sir . " She held a plate of food scraps , and she stared at him with wondering blue eyes . " Pretty good food for pigs , " he said irritably , but Nancy forgavehim that . With the doctor , the captain had stood up for her against Mrs. Demooth . She could n't have borne it otherwise . All day long Mrs. Demooth was after her with stinging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , how big her belly was , and how bastard children always showed more  --  things Nancy would never have believed Mrs. Demooth capable of saying . " Men are fools , " Mrs. Demooth said . " If I had my way you ' d be turned out . Girls like you ought to be whipped before the sown . But your own mother would n't have you round  --  I do n't blame her  --  and the men say you could n't starve . Men all take a sneaking pleasure in it . They always do if the girl ' s young . Get out of here . Get out of my room , anyway , if you wo n't get out of my house . " Nancy knew she was big , but it had seemed natural at first . The soldier had been a big man , and she was a big girl , and sometimesshe thought the child would be big even if he was lawful . But as time went on and the captain seemed to notice her more ,  | the sight seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that what Missis said must be true . Hon Yost laughed about it . Hon Yost would pat her belly at if he were patting the child itself . " I ' 11 bet it ' s going to be a dinger of a boy . Just like you and me , Nancy . But we get fun out of life . " Hon Yost had had a wonderful time the first half of the winter . He had never done less work in his life . For a long time every  --  body seemed glad to talk to Hon. Men slapped him on the back wherever he went and stood him drinks . He had been a regular public hero and generally drunk . But he was a harmless drunkardand came home every night to the barn , where he shared the stall with Mr. Demooth 's horse . Nancy took him out what scraps of food she could steal . That was the plate 's destination now . But lately nobody paid much attention to Hon. At first he had been unhappy about it ; disbelievingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the place across the river , and say hello . Once he even started the story of how he licked Sillinger with his wonderful account of Arnold 's army . He got to where he said to the Indians , " Can you count the leaves on the trees ? " Meaning , of course , that Arnold 's army was as big as creation . But they kicked him out of the tap . He hardly ever got a drink . He once thought that if he enrolled in the militia he would get popular again , and saw Captain Demooth about it . But the militia were disorganized . Captain Demooth said Colonel Bellinger was trying to have new companies organized . New officers were needed . . Over half the old ones had been killed . Captain Demooth was sorry . He said that he appreciated Hon 's patriotic sense and that as soon as the new organization was completehe would be proud to have Hon on his own company 's roster . At first Nancy was happy about it . While Hon had been a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody else would talk to him , he hung around the Herter place . He seemedp 329 to like to talk to her . He was pleased when she asked shy questionsabout McLonis . McLonis was quite a man . The Butlers thought high of McLonis . Some people thought it likely McLonis would get to be a commissioned officer some day . " Yes , Hon. But what is he like ? " asked Nancy . Hon poked her . " Gee , you ought to know ! " He burst out laughing , flinging himself back in the straw so that his long hair gathered chaff . Hon had a nice voice , for all he was dim-witted like herself . She loved to hear him laugh , and she smiled a little herself . Sitting in the cool light of the barn window that day , Nancy looked like a goddessof fecundity . With her yellow hair down her back and the lids of her eyes full and her lips half parted in the remnant of the smile , she might have been the original mother . Hon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now that he was on the subject of McLonis he liked showing his familiarity . " Jurry , " he said , " he ' s a fine , ruthless man . That ' s quite a . vord . I heard Major Butler call him that . I was right close to Major . It was the night we camped at the Royal Blockhouse corning down here . " " Do you think we ' 11 ever see him ? " " I will , " said Hon. " But I ' ve got to see him , you know . " " Well , maybe you will . " " Do you think he ' d like me now ? " " Say , " said Hon. " If you ever got to Niagara you 'd be just about the queen of the company there , Nance . " " What do you mean ? " She was breathless . " Why , there ' s not a white woman there looks half of you . " " Oh . Then he might marry me out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Hon ? " ' Well , " Hon shook his head wisely . " If he gets to be an officer , maybe he would n't . "  | " But you said he would . " " That ' s when he was a corporal . " " Yes , but I ' m me , are n't I ? " " Yes , " said Hon. Hon did have a few ideas . He had seen enough to know that an ambitious man would not marry a girl like his sister . The trouble with Nancy was that she had been happened on by an ambitious man . He liked Jurry and he wanted to keep friends with him . And it did n't seem important . " But I ' ve got to get married , " Nancy said urgently . " Mrs. Demoothsays I am the living sin . " " Old Clem said he ' d marry you . " Nancy shuddered . " I could n't marry Clem . He always smells so sour every morning . " " Listen , Nancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I do n't know . Out there at Niagara lots of the women ai n't married . They ' re nice women too . Some of them in the officer barracks . Maybe you could get in the officer barracks . " " Could n't you take me out there , Hon ? " she pleaded . Again he slapped her belly . " With a load like that , Nance ? " " I can walk all right . " " If you had it on your back , maybe . " Hon laughed at his own joke . But Nancy looked as if she were going to cry . " Sometimes I get scared you ' 11 leave me here . " " Why should n't I ? " " I get so scared , Hon. She keeps talking at me some days . She says it makes girls awful sick . She says sometimes they dir.  --  bad girls do . It ai n't like having honest children . " For the moment Hon was troubled . He was fond of Nance , in a way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe you ' 11 die . " She was called to the house by the tinkle of the captain 's bell , to Hon 's immense relief . She was the devil to reason with . He took himself away from the barn before she could return . Nancy had thought of late that Hon was getting restless . Asp 331 the snow softened towards the end of March , and mists rose in the va1ley , he had been acting more and more uneasy . He kept makingexcursions into the woods . At last he spent a night away . Nance was terrified . But he had come back the evening after ; he was in the barn at supper time when she carried out his plate of left-overs . He was sitting on some straw he had raked out of the mare 's stall , whetting his hunting knife on his boot sole . She thought he looked excited . " I found tracks where a party had been across West Canada Crick , " he said . " Three or four days ago . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was some of ours . " " Ours , Hon ? " He was impatient with her . " Sure . What do you think ? From Niagara , maybe ? " " Oh , Hon ! You do n't want to go with them ? " Immediately he was sly . " How could I go with them ? They ' re way the hell off by now . I wish I knew where they went to , though . " In her relief she wanted to please him , and she repeated everythingthe soldier had told Demooth . But as soon as she was done , she saw that she must have been dim-witted . Hon did n't say anything at all . He reared up like a dog and looked through the open door towards the woods . " Please do n't go , Hon. Not till I ' m through . " When he did n't answer , she sneaked back to the house . She thought if Hon went she would surely die . He was gone in the morning . Clem told her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months that things were bound to come his way .. With that damn fool out of reach , maybe he could work on Nancy . The way she drooped in the soft morning sunlight , there in front of him at the barn door , he felt lustful . He did n't want to be a lustful man , particularly , but he thought what a damn fool he had been to be drunk that night when Hon was captured . Any sober man could have horned in on the game . " Do n't cry , Nance . You 've always got me to look out for you . " She just looked wilted . " Do you know he 's gone , Clem ? " " Yes , he told me to tell you good-bye . " Seeing her frantic glance at the woods , he laughed . " He did n't go north . He went by Unadilla . He 'll need to get food in the Indian villages . Him and Indians get on good . He ' 11 be all right . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy gave a small miserable nod . Clem said harshly , " You need n't figure on catching up with him . He ' 11 he going like a wild hog . You could n't ever keep up with him , girl . " " Why ? " she said like a child . " He do n't want anybody catching up with him . " Clem thought it might he just as well to give her a little plain sense . " Hon may be a half-wit , but he knows what 'll happen to him if they catch him another time . " MRS . DEMOOTHOnly a little over a week later a second attack was made or . Snydersbush . Word came to German Flats on the fifth of April .. This time the information was complete . The enemy were over fifty strong , half white , half Indian . They had left the stockade alone . The people inside the stockade possessed a swivel they had let loose when the enemy first appeared in the road . The roar of it had kept them from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Garter at his mill and burned the mill in plain sight of the fort . At Windecker 's they cut off a threshing party , four men and two boys , and took them prisoner . They sent Indian scouts ahead to pick up the four settlers on the edge of the town and took them all : Cypher , Helmer , Uher , and Attle . They moved with great swiftness and discipline . They burned the farms , houses , barns , barracks , even Attle 's brand-new backhouse . They killed all the horses and cows in their way . They headed for Salisbury ; and swept that settlement at dusk . There they capturedonly three men , for the other inhabitants had moved into the Mohawk Valley down around Klock 's and Fox 's Mills and had n't yet returned . But the destructives razed the town . Then they headed out along the old Jerseyfield road , northwest , past Mount 's , the scene of their first irruption . The leader of the party had attracted a good deal of attention yin Snydersbush because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody had seen anything like it . A green coat , it was said , and deerskin breeches , and a black leather hat like a skullcap with a brass badge on the front of it . He roused a great deal of morbid speculation . Some of the old settlers said it reminded them of the uniform worn by the French commander , Beletre , back in ' 58 . It was over a month before a report from James Dean , outside Niagara , informed them of Butler 's Rangers . With his usual precision in detail he included a description of the new uniform . The conviction gradually took root that John Butler was making an attempt to cut off German Flats . They knew that he had always hated Germans ; and he had always been jealous of their rich soil . . . . They pointed to the fact that the number of each party had been just adapted to the strength of the place struck , Each party had burst out of the woods unheralded , had burned and killed and taken prisoner , and then hightailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even calling out the militia , Ict alone chasing them . They had the whole northwestern wildernessto make cover in . Mrs. Demooth was terrified . Mark would not take her away , he would not even send her . She stayed in the house all day , but she was always listening . She had nothing to distract her , no one to help her in the house but that miserable wench , whose mere presence was an insult to a decent woman  --  first with her constantsickness , now with her swollen belly and her great blue stupid staring eyes . Whenever Mrs. Demooth saw Nancy she had something to say to her ; whenever she sent Nancy out of her sight , she began to think of sayings that would give her pain . Mrs. Demooth was not consciously torturing a half-wit . Far from it . Having , like a dutiful wife , been forced to violate the nicer feelings , in her own household , she told herself that she was merely trying to make Nancy understand the enormity of her fornication . At first she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had not liked it , and now she never spoke to the girl until he had left the house . He was away nearly all day now . He was down at Palatine , seeing Colonel Jacob Klock . Mrs. Demooth could always tell when he had been to Klock 's because he smelled of manure . It made her think that the Klocks must keep the cows in their kitchen . The men were trying to reorganize the militia and above all to get regular troops sent up from Albany . Demooth even went to Albany to confer with General Stark in person . But all the great hero of Bennington would say was that he needed every man he had to defend the Hampshire grants , and the Hudson Valley north and south . He refused to consider the opinion that these raids were parts of a larger plan . He called them mere riotous excursions . He cursed about the useless militia and said that if German Flats and the Mohawk Valley could not take care of themselves like other frontiers they might as well lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein . The security of Albany made all of them sound patriotic . Schuyler showed De . mooth General Washington 's reply to his reports of Klock 's demandsfor troops . Washington said the same thing exactly . Let them take care of themselves like the other frontiers : the New York militia had been the least effective of any state 's . The logic seemed thin to Demooth . He pointed out that troops were being sent to the Virginia frontier . He returned , worn-out and hopeless . By the end of the month , the sum total of encouragement was the announcement that Alden 's company of Massachusetts troops would be sent to Cherry Valley as a base from which they could operate against any important incursions of the enemy . It made one want to laugh . At the end of the month the hamlet at Ephratah , to the north of Stone Arabia , was struck . This time the invaders were a small party , entirely of Indians , according to first reports . They burned the Hart house , killed Conrad Hart , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a day later , the word reached German Flats that the man who had killed the boy had been seen by Mrs. Rechtor to have blue eyes , and when he raised his sleeves to rinse his hands , his wrists showed white skin . Colonel Bellinger , sitting with Demooth and Petry in the Herterkitchen , nodded . " It was bound to start some day . That 's not a regular raid . But there 'll be plenty more like them now they 've seen how easy it is . " Dr. Petry also nodded . " They ' 11 start picking off all the little places . They 'll start hanging round the field fences . And it ' s time planting began . Already they ' re ploughing at Weaver 's . " Demooth said bitterly , " Schuyler told me the Indians had never been effective in battle . He said we 'd demonstrated that ourselvesat Oriskany . Could n't we act like men ? " " If we had wings , " said the doctor in his heavy voice . " But my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too true . No one could be expected to rush off after raiders leaving his own place undefended . They could n't make anybody realize that the valley was ninety miles long , that the Tories had the whole of the wilderness to hide in , but that everything the militia might do would be plain to see . it was as if the leaves of the trees had eyes . " There 's one thing we can do , " said the doctor . " Everybody out of reach of the forts should be told to move in . If they watt% to work their farms from the forts , they do it by themselves . " They all agreed . Demooth made another suggestion . " We ought to have a company of rangers of our own . Som body to watch the trails . Mostly to the south . Any big force w ' have to come at us from Unadilla or Tioga . " " What can they do ? " demanded the doctor . " Give us warning . If we can get inside the forts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how many of them come . It ' s a long way to bring cannon . And men like Adam Helmer or Joe Boleo could make it risky for their scouts . " He paused . " They might be able to pick up a few of these murdering parties , too . " " How ' 11 you pay them ? " " Militia money . We ' 11 list them in different companies and work out ' service ' for them . " " It ' s not regular . They ' re good at making smells in Congress . " I ' m responsible , " said Bellinger . " I can stand some smells . " The doctor got up . " While I ' m here I might talk to thatNancy . How is she ? " " All right . You ' 11 probably find her out in back . " Dr. Petry stamped heavily into the small back room . He foun . Nancy sitting white-faced , very upright , on a chair . Her han were on her knees . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter ? " he asked in his harsh voice . Nancy 's lip quivered . " Doctor , what does the fornication look like ? " " What ! " he exclaimed . " She said the fornication would be my death . " Dr. Petry started a German curse . " She ? That woman . She 's crazy . " He was exasperated an . confused . They were all crazy . He turned on Nancy . " Do n't talk blasted nonsense at me. "  | Nancy began to blubber . " I do n't want to die . " " You wo n't die , " shouted the doctor . " I tell you . LAP-en to e . You wo n't die . " Nancy was appalled at the way the doctor looked down at her ith the breath-making noises in his nose . " Did Mrs. Demooth say that ? " Nancy nodded . Without another word he turned and stamped out . He had is own war to wage and he laid down the  --  law to Demooth. ancy heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rs . Demooth would want to kill her . In her heart she had the navoidable conviction that Mrs. Demooth knew better than the touting doctor . She wanted to find somebody , Hon , McLonis , my friendly person , before she died ... . The doctor had reduced Mrs. Demooth to tears . He not only ressed her down , he told the captain what he thought of him for fling his wife behave so to a poor , defenseless girl . His whole  --  ig face was flushed and his eyes stared at them as if they would burst out of their sockets . Nothing could stop him until Mrs. Demooth began to laugh . She went off into peals of screaming tighter , one after the other , drowning all other sound . The doctor took one look at her , stepped to the pantry , wherefound the water bucket , and doused the woman with the entire ucketful . He slammed the bucket on the floor , swore once , and old her to go and dry her face . Then he stormed out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nancy listened to Captain Demooth ading his wife to her room . She sat where she was , not getting pper , not even moving , but listening to the continued sobbingthe bedroom . Over and over , Mrs. Demooth kept saying , " I ' m  --  frightened , Mark . I ' ve been so frightened . I ca n't sleep . I o n't see how you can sleep . I dream about them . I dream bout Indians . They wo n't let me even sleep .... " The sun t . Twilight came into the small room , cool , with a wet smellp338from the sopping land . The snow was nearly gone . Only here and there stretches of it left in the folds of the land made shim. mers in the dusk . The house gradually quieted . A long time after , the captain came into the kitchen . Nancy could hear him moving there . She saw the light come on in the crack under the door . She tried to stir herself , and she got as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes felt as though they were filled with blood . When she opened the door the captain was standing by the table . He turned his face . " Yes , Nancy . " " Do you want me to get some supper ? " He looked at her gravely . " No , thanks . " Nancy forced herself to speak . " How about her ? " " I do n't think she needs anything . I think you ' d better not go to see her . I think she 's sleeping . " Nancy swallowed . Her contracted throat gulped with the effort . " I ' m sorry , sir . " The captain 's face was not kind . It was not unkind either . It frightened her . She would rather have had him swear at her the way the doctor had . " You ' d better stay in your own room , Nancy . I may have to move you somewhere else for a while . But I 'll take care of you till your child ' s born . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over to the fort for half an hour . I think she ' 11 be all right . She ' s sleeping . " Nancy 's eyes widened as she saw him go through the door . She knew better . She knew that she was n't asleep . It was just a pretense to get him to go . To get him to leave Nancy alone . As the door closed after him , Nancy gave a little moan . She could n't cry to him to come back . Her voice would n't work . She wrestled with her brain to make her voice work , but it would not . The bedroom door had opened . " Do n't you dare to make a sound . " Mrs. Demooth was standing in the door . Her hair was bunched about her head in wild damp masses , but her eyes , which stared at Nancy , were dry and brilliant inside the red lids . Crying had made her voice hoarse and nasal . Totally unable to stir , Nancy watched her in horror ; but Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the diminishing sound of the captain 's footsteps along the muddy road . It was a full minute after they had died away before either woman spoke . " He said I was n't to leave the room . " She did not raise her voice ; but for a moment her eyes wavered , as if even yet she feared that the captain might hear her . For a moment she was silent . There was no sound at all but the rapid beating of Nancy 's heart . Then Mrs. Demooth lifted her chin . " I never hired you . He hired you and then he told me . I did n't want you to begin with . " Suddenly Nancy started shuddering . The shudders brought little repercussions of sound out of her throat , a hushed animal whimpering . Her mouth began to open . " Stop it . " Mrs. Demooth'svoice was raised a note ; it was still hoarse . Nancy closed her mouth and swallowed , and wiped her mouth with her hand and wiped her hand on her apron .

" Nancy 's knees buckled . She seemed to collapse over herse onto her face . Mrs. Demooth watched her . There was no tremor to the ope flame of the lamp . There was no tremor in Nancy 's body . Mrs. Demooth smiled . She looked right and left , listening . Her smile deepened . Her face seemed even paler . Little bunches o. ' flesh swelled beside her nostrils . Slowly she took a step over th threshold of her room and stopped . She looked right and left again and listened . Then she walked over to where the girl lay and bent down and lifted her shoulder . Nancy rolled partly on her side , and lav limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Demooth let go the shoulder and straightened up . " Then deliberately she kicked Nancy . She returned to her room and paused for a moment to look hack at the prone figure with exalted eyes . She raised her eyes slightly , closed the door , and went to bed . The evening mist drifting into the shadows drew across Nancy 's face . Her lids fluttered . Gradually she opened her eyes . There was no sound . Her eyes rolled slowly towards the bedroom door and found it closed . Tears came into her eyes and rolled down over her face . Suddenly she blenched . She put her hand to her belly and pressed against herself . Her face was contorted with the effort to rise soundlessly . Her long legs moved with infinite care . She took off her shoes and tiptoed to her room . There the horror overwhelmed her completely . No longer trying to be quiet , she gathered her belongings in a panic ,  --  her dress , her comb , her nightgown , and her cloth shoes ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the kitchen , bent slightly forward , keeping her eyes from the door , and went out into the darkness . She ran heavily . On Captain Demooth 's return he found his wife rigid on her bed , with a slight froth drying at the corners of her mouth . He could not waken her and called for Nancy . When she did not answer , he went into the kitchen and rang the bell . Then he went to her room and found that she had gone . He took the lamp into the yard , shouting for Clem , and with the old Dutchman searched the yard . By the fence they found Nancy 's fresh tracks . She had climbed the rails and crossed the meadow towards the south . They managed to follow her tracks as far as the woods . But there they had to stop . " There ' s no use in looking any more . " Clem shook his head : " Only an Indian could foller her through that brush . "   " Did n't you hear anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tired . " " I ' 11 have to get back to my wife . " " Anything wrong with her ? " " She ' s had a fit , I think . Her mother told me she used to have them when she was little . Will you go fetch Doc , Clem ? " Clem said , " Tschk , tschk , " in his best manner . " Hurry up , Clem . I feel as if I was going crazy myself . We just had an express from Albany . Walter Butler ' s escaped . " " God help us , " exclaimed Clem ; but he was thinking about fording the river . The water was high , now . THE INDIANWhen , a few hours later , Nancy broke free of the woods , she found herself on one of the bare , hillside pastures . Looking back , she saw the mist lying below her in the valley . She had come a long way . Her shawl was a sodden bundle hanging from her clinched fingers . Her short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her legs . She felt like a flogged person ; she was reeking with sweat and wet from the whipping branches . Her hair hung round her face . A little stream of blood trickled from a cut cheek . She fought hard to gain her breath , turning her back on the valley and fixing her eyes on the stars . Gradually against their distant patterns she made out the dark shoulder of the hill . When she saw it , she started once more at her heavy walk . Her body was like a dead weight precariously balanced on the arch that joined her legs . Somewhere under the mist behind her , a dog rushed out of an invisible house . She could hear his furious barks traveling back and forth . All at once the dog 's voice deepened , fixed , and she realized that it had picked up her scent . But at the same moment a long whistle pierced the mist . It was followed by a man 's incensed shouting . " Prince ! Come back here , Prince ! " Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , a moment later , yelped ; and the night became still . A long shuddering breath went out of Nancy . She set herself with a desperate deliberation against the hill . A half hour later she stopped on top of the hill in a scattered grove of maples to draw deep breaths . Though she knew that she was out of reach of pursuit , she did not dare stop for long . She was convinced that what Mrs. Demooth had told her would surely take place . The pain she had carried out of the house had died , but she was sure that it would come to life again . Even now she could feel its premonitory stirrings . She tramped nearly all night . The general slope of the ground was downward , but at times she was brought up against sharp rises that took interminable climbing . A little before dawn she lost her sense of direction . She could no longer see the stars ; the sky had turned to a dull gray with neither light nor shadow . The ravinein which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wet touch of branches on her cheeks or breast was cold . She stumbled into a small stream without seeing it and came at last to a halt in water that pushed icily against her knees . She put her hand down and lifted a little water to her mouth . Her lips felt swollen to her hand 's touch . She could not drink . After a minute she gave up and wearily forced her way out of the water . Her knees would not lift her feet the height necessary to climb out on the bank , and she struggled futilely , feeling the cold earth against her thighs . She splashed heavily , though she did not hear it , and fell face down on the thick dead sodden grass , and lay there . It was then that the pains returned . Nancy lifted her swollen , P344pale , and tear-streaked face and cried out . Her voice was n loud , it was utterly forlorn . It made the Indian think of a rabbi - in a faulty snare . The Indian had been scouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked . His first intention had been to sneak up beside the corner of the barn to see whether he could pick up an easy scalp . He wanted to save up for a new gun ; his old French trade musket that he had inherited from his father shot very badly . For hunting he even had to carry his bow . He had picked up two scalps that month , one down at Ephratah , and one of a lone trapper between Edmeston and the little lakes . The one he had got at Ephratah had not come off well and he was not sure whether he would be able to get the eight-dollar bounty for it at Niagara . He ought to take another to be sure . But the dog had so obviously spotted him that the Indian decided to give up that chance , and he legged it up the hill with the dog chasing him . The man had called in the dog ; and the Indianhad nothing to show . But then he had heard somebody ' floundering in the wet way above him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared , but the Indian found plain tracks and a tatter of cloth together beside a juniper . He could not understand it ; it was too dark to see the tracks , but just on the chance he had started following . in the dark , that was slow and painful work . As soon as it got lighter , however , he made the surprising discovery that the footprints had been left by a woman . He fingered the pouch under his belt in which he carried his Oki , the skin of a red-headed woodpecker , and realized that at last it was bringing him a little luck . You got eight dollars for any scalp regardless of sex . This ought to be an easy eight dollars . The woman was alone . He went at a trot , for the trail was easy to follow , and a little past dawn he broke out on the edge of a steep ravine and looked down on her . She had fallen forward on the bank of a small stream . The Indian ran down the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her , fingering his hatchet . He had several ideas . He might shoot her  --  he had n't shot anything with his musket this trip  --  or he could bang her on the head and save the powder . He was still considering when Nancy looked up at him and screamed again , and he realized that she had not seen him at all or heard him either until that instant . Then he saw that she no longer saw him . She was unconscious . He caught her by the arm and hauled her out of the water and looked at her . He found out that she was in the act of giving birth . He was very much puzzled . To find a woman like her there alone in such a case was extraordinary . It made him uneasy . He decided that he had better think things over before he killed her , so he dragged her over the ground to a clump of hemlock and built a fire . He left her on a slight incline , with her legs downward , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased gradually while he sat before the fire . Birds moved in the branches . He heard their voices all through the woods and the smooth musical sliding of the water over a sunk log . While he watched the birds he took out of a pouch a piece of pemmican and began sucking and gnawing at it . He considered that his wife had died that winter and that he had no children and that he might get eight dollars for the torn scalp anyway . But he was not sure . He seemed oblivious of the event taking place behind him . But suddenly his dark eyes were attracted by the flashing passage of a woodpecker . Black and white , and the red head like a traveling spark . A great twittering and fluttering broke out in a tree , and a moment later the woodpecker returned in hot pursuit of a female . The Indian grunted , relaxed , and went ahead with his chewing . 1Ie decided that she was a strong girl , or she would not have journeyed so far . And her light long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from most Indians in his own town . He liked to live solitary and had a small log house on the outskirts of Deodesote village . He had never been markedly successful on a warpath . Two scalps and this woman prisoner might make him some reputation . If , now , he decided to marry her , it would n't be necessary to give presents , either . He waited complacently for the woman to finish the business . When some poor order emerged from the flux of Nancy 's con , sciousness and she opened her eyes to the world before her , she saw the Indian sitting in sunlight before his fire with his blanket drawn over his shoulders . The musket was leaning against the stub of a dead hemlock branch and the bow and quiver were hung beside it . The sides of the Indian 's poll were shaved and the scalp lock was braided like some queer kind of handle to his head . One battered feather hung from it . He looked comical to her light  --  headed fancy , and she felt sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she tried to speak , and he turned , she almost laughed at the way his face looked with smeared paint , white and vermilion , in stripes . She even remembered how it had terrified her when she saw it on the bank of the stream ; then it had appeared like the arrival of the abomination itself . But now Nancy knew that she was alive . To her awakening senses came the sound of the water in the stream , the birds ' voices , and the smell of smoke from the Indian 's fire . Her body felt torn and sore and exhausted , but it was alive . She met the Indian 's expressionless eyes with a slight smile ; then struggled to sit up . As she did so he rose to his feet and moved away from her . He went down the ravine to a piece of dry raised ground and started peeling sheaths of bark from a big hemlock . He used his hatchet and scalping knife together . For a while Nancy watched him erecting a tiny bark shanty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the small , soiled , male shape to which she had given birth . For a moment she was chilled by the old fear ; but her movement upset the child so that it rolled over and bumped against her knee ; and suddenly it opened its infinitely small mouth and gave a flat bawling wail.  |p347It  was alive . Nancy laughed . Then she picked up the baby mid moved it into the sun and went down to the stream with unsteady steps and washed herself as well as she was able . While she was there she found her bundle , and , bringing it back , unwrappedit and took out the nightgown , which was of worn flannel . In the dryest piece of this she could tear out , she wrapped the baby , after first wiping its body with the other portions . When she was done , the Indian came back to her and said something she could not understand . He was a squat , slightly bow-legged man who did not quite come to her shoulder . He pointed to the shed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " Nancy smiled wanly and managed to follow him . He did not offer to help her with the child or her belongings , but he put down his blanket for her . He tapped himself on the chest . " Gahota , " he said . " Gahota . " Then he poked Nancy 's breast with his forefinger and stared at her . She giggled slightly . He poked again . Finally she understood . " Oh , my name ' s Nancy . " He repeated it . Then he said , " Gahota . " " Gahota , " said Nancy . The Indian smiled . Some of the paint cracked on his cheek . He watched her sit down on his blanket , put some more wood on the fire , took his bow , quiver , and musket , and disappeared into the woods . Nancy sat still for a long time , holding the baby in her lap . Finally she lay down with it and slept . It was nearly dusk when she smelled cookery and woke again . The Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hark dish in which he was boiling some meat . Every now and then with a small ladle of birch bark he would skim off a wet mass of feathers . But as soon as he saw that Nancy was awake , he moved over and gave her the ladle , signing to her that it was time she assumed the woman 's job .   The two partridges boiling away in the soup smelled strong , for they had been immersed , feathers , entrails , and all ; but Nancy was hungry . She skimmed with good will . When the two ca casses fell apart she took the bark dish off the stones it rested on and set it between herself and Gahota . As she started to dip her ladle , the Indian took it from her hand . He ate slowly and steadily until the soup was half gone . Then he shoved the vessel towards her and tossed the ladle in . Nancy was ravenous . While she was eating the baby began to cry . But she did not heed it until she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the child , and the third time she reached for it and set it on her lap . A little later in the evening she felt the milk filling her breasts . Clumsily she lifted the child . She caught Gahota 's eye . He looked contented now , indifferent . He had removed his shirt and was slowly rubbing his belly . Nancy felt a great friendliness for this kind man . " Will you help me find my brother ? " she asked . He did not turn his head , nor answer . " My brother , Hon ? Hon Yost Schuyler . " He did not answer . " I must find him , " said Nancy , with a slight panic . But the Indian continued to ignore her . She dropped the subject , for she thought obviously the poor heathen did not understand the English language . Besides she felt warm and soothed and preoccupied with the tugging at her breast . Almost as an afterthought she said companionably , " He lives at Niagara , you know . " Gahota , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners in addressing him . But now he grunted . " Deodesote , " he said flatly . He did not look at Nancy . But Nancy nodded behind his funny back . She was contented for the first time in many months . Quite happy . " Deodesote , " she repeated in a dutiful voice . They started just at daybreak.  |p349SMOKEAs  the days of May went by , the settlers in German Flats becameincreasingly aware of the gradual closing in of the destructives . Captain Demooth was asking for volunteers to add to the Ranger service . He had been able to find only ten men willing to spend all their time in the woods . There had been thirty at first , but as the sun grew daily warmer , and the earth dried ; many of them returned to work in their fields . Gil was one of these . He knew that Mrs. McKlennar would have willingly found another man and taken care of Lana into the bargain ; but the farm was on his mind . He had to see to the planting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , edam , he found himself uneasy , after the first two days , to see how the wheat was growing . " He ai n't nothing but a farming man , " Joe would say , disgustedly . They had set up a tiny lodge a few miles north of Edmeston , which was still inhabited by several Tory families . From the hillside , as he lay on his belly in the leaves , Gil could look down on the clearings and watch the small ploughings ; the women putting in the hills of corn and squash and beans ; the children fetching the cattle at dusk and dawn . The children were the only people they had to be careful of . Sometimes the cattle strayed near the shanty and had to be driven off , though once or twice , before he did so , Gil took their kettle and filled it with fresh milk . The other two would never allow Gil to make one of the weekly solitary scouts to the southward . They said he had no sense in the woods ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him coming half a mile . They made him stay at the lodge , and when they thought they had any news , he had to run up theP350 back trail fifteen miles to the next station . There a man was al  --  ways waiting to relay the word . Gil was not as bad in the woods as they made him out to he . He became quieter as time went on , and they admitted that he was turning into a good runner  --  not in Adam 's class , of course , but better than middling . But he had no eye for things . 1 le could n't tell what a crow or jay or kingfisher was chattering of . They said tolerantly that he would never learn . There were odd times when he felt the lazy contentment creep-:lag into him . When for days they just lay round on a hilltop , when the sun was hot and the sky dry , watching the tops of the trees to the south and particularly the east . Once old Blue Back came into the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Unadilla to visit a Tuscarora family as soon as she had her planting done . He had left her there and struck north to give them the news . They saw him sauntering up the hill , shifting his eyes left and right , looking everywhere but in their direction . Joe muttered , " The old twerp seen us a hundred yards back . He looked me right in the eye . Now he ' s going to act surprised . " He did . He beamed all over and said " How " to all of them , shaking hands and holding his hat up to each in turn . He had not shaved his head . He looked greasy and brown and dirty and he smelled of fish . He said they had been curing bullheads for three days in his friend 's cabin . They had all the windows and doors closed to keep the smoke in the cabin . He said it got pretty hot , sometimes , so he came up to see how Joe Boleo was , and his friend , Gil Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Unadilla or Oghkwaga either . The white men laid hold of all of it . He thought somebody up north might have a drink . He had a twitchingin his right leg when he went without it too lung hints : AL Did Joe ever have that ? Joe resignedly handed him a small swallow of rum and Blue Back sat down . He said he needed a new hat .   " Go to hell , " said Joe . " You ca n't have mine . " " Too big , " agreed Blue Back . " Yours too big . " He pointed at I Telmer . " What you going to do about that , Gil ? " Gil grinned and said he needed his own hat himself . " Me make trade , " suggested Blue Back . " No , thanks , " said Gil . " What 's on your mind ? " asked Joe . The old Oneida sighed and said that Joseph Brant was in Unadilla . He was gathering the Indians . There were already about fifty whites under Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't talked to Captain Caldwell himself , because he thought they might not be friends . But Captain Caldwelldrank a great deal . All the white men drank a great deal . Sometimes it seemed to Blue Back that they were sick or afraid of the woods . " Brant still there ? " Brant , said Blue Back , had gathered together about two hundred and taken the party eastward . But he was due to return soon . Ile had to meet with John Butler at Unadilla in the end of June . Boleo whistled under his breath . " Adam , " he said , " you better take a cut through Springfield and pass out a warning . They wo n't pay no attention , though . " " No , " said the Indian . He had been that way himself . People just kicked him out . He had n't even had a drink . He had only managed to steal a couple of young pigs . " What did you do with them ? " asked Adam hopefully . It appeared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brant move out of Unadilla ? " A week ago , said Blue Back . Joe swore . " Why did n't you come here right away , you old timber beast ? " " No good . " He ' s right , thought Gil . The people would n't move , now thatJP352crops were in the earth , and there were no troops to send to them He looked at Joe . Joe was standing up and staring eastward . " By God , " he said , " Grant 's on the loose already ! " Gil could not see the smoke for a long time . It was such a pale , frail , insubstantial thing , a mere mist in the sky . " You better pull foot for home , Gil . Tell ' em Brant ' s burning Springfield way . Me and Adam will make a scout , and Adam will come back here and I ' 11 report at Herkimer. " /They had their own path marked out . They did not use the old Iroquois trail . Their route lay along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil hit a steady pace . He was going all the way through tithe forts . On such long running  --  even on this one , when he knew that the destructives were loose  --  he had a singular feeling of freedom . Often he thought that if he were making such a run with . Adam , he would quite easily break off with the easy-going giant to a party with the Bowers girls . Adam had pestered him about it more than once when they were lying before their fire at night . The sunset was fading when Gil came out on the top of Shoemakerhill . He paused for a moment to get his breath for the last miles down to the river . The sky was like a great silken sheet over all the world , misty in the north , but edged with sunset to the west . Under it , on a level with Gil 's eyes , the wilderness rolled northward  --  mile upon mile , ridge upon ridge , until the mountains lifted against the sky . The color of it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades where the evergreens marked out the long pine ridges or the balsam swamps , and with occasional frothy streaks of white of the wild cherries in bloom . As the light waned , the whole panorama conveyed a sense of motion ; the ridges rolling higher and higher , as the hollows of the balsam swamps were deepened . The valley itself was like a crystal under his feet through which he could look down on a picture painted in miniature . The bright lineP353of the river was still tinged with the sunset ; the two forts  --  from this elevation they looked close together  --  were geometrical shapes in the irregular varicolored fields ; the fences between the fields were like small stitches painstakingly made to patch the surface of the flats . But the houses and barns alone in the farther clearings were infinitesimal blocks in the crooked fingers of the wilderness . As he started down the bald slope of the hill , Gil 's eyes searched across the river , picking up the line of the Kingsroad and followingit towards McKlennar 's . He could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooming apple tree . The sunset made the windows blind burning eyes in the stone face . But the rest of the place was clear , even to young John Weaver turning the cows into the yard . Lana , of course , would not be milking . She was two weeks overdue . Gil trotted downward . Then he saw a familiar figure moving along the road . He knew at once who it was . It moved into a lighted stretch , show ing the gray horse and the heavy , upright , black-clad rider . He was going out from German Flats . He was approaching McKlennar 's . Now he turned in , and John Weaver 's small dog rushed out barking to meet him . It was Dr. Petry . For some reason , Gil remembered what Mrs. McKlennar had once called the doctor , when she saw him riding his gray horse along the road . " Like death on a pale horse , " she had said . NIGHT ON THE FARMYoung John Weaver tingled with excitement , curiosity , and dread . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stone house . He had just finished the milking ; it had taken longer with the spotted cow freshened , as she had that morning ; one hind quarter of her bag had shown a sign of caking and heP354had to work on her . The negress stuck her calico-wrapped head in the barn door and called , " You , boy ! " He knew it then , but he did n't like being called " You , boy , " by a nigger , even though he was hired help ; and he did n't answer . Daisy peered in and said , " Oh , white boy ! " " What is it ? " John asked gruffly . Immediately Daisy put on her importance . " You got to fotch me mo ' wood . " " I took it in before I went after the cows . " " Dat trash ! I want birch . I want a lot of it . Fust thing dey ' 11 holler fo ' hot water , and whar Daisy den ? W'en of Miss wants something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got to have birch split fine to fotch de bilin ' wid de fust brief . Here , give me dat milk and get on de mare and go tell Doc Petry . And don ' you spare de hickory stick on'r . " John wrenched the halter off the mare , bridled her , and mounted bareback . He rode hard , hunching himself over the withers , and wondering , " Will I be in time ? " He drew up at the doctor 's and called in through the window . " They just told me to fetch you . " With agonized eyes he watched the doctor pop in a tart of preserved currants and wipe his mouth . " I thought it might art to-night , " said Doc . " Well , well . You might unhitch my ho sc  --  he 's all saddled  --  and bring him round here . " John flung off the reeking mare and got the doctor 's horse , lugging him by main force . He waited till the doctor came out and mounted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding a piece of clockwork : the spring seemed jammed for a minute ; then the insides of the gray animal whirred and rumbled and his legs started to gesticulate , and all of a sudden you realized that he was actually walking away . John clambered onto the mare and caught up . The mare was hot and full of fettle . " Excuse me , sir , " he said to Doc . " I think I ' d better get on back . They want me to split some more wood . " The doctor , who had got the hiccoughs from starting out on aP355new-filled stomach , put his hand to his mouth , and then turned his staring eyes on John . " Oh , yes , " he said . " Split wood . Just what we need . Half a cord . " But the mare was already helling away up the road like the backsides of forty rabbits . John rushed her into her stall and yanked his axe out of the shed and got to work on the wood . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen . He could hear Mrs. McKlennar moving round the front room and talking . Daisy bustled in . " Dat ' s enough in here , " she said . But John still stood there . He was n't sure . Yes , it was - her voice ! Mrs. Martin was talking ! Thank God she was still , dive ! He went back to the woodpile and chopped and split enough wood to boil water for all the babies this side of China . But he was thinking , would n't this be an awful time to have the destructivesstrike the flats ? Of course the scouts were out . Of course there would be some warning . But to move her ! Move her now ! It was too late . Why had n't she moved into a house close to the fort ? When the doctor came there would be two of them , though . John left off chopping and got down his musket and reprimed it . He wished that Gil was back . He felt a tremendousresponsibility . But he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that he had n't turned the cows out , so he did that . And then the doctor arrived . " Chopped the wood ? " he inquired gravely as John took his horse . " Yes , sir , " said John . The doctor went into the house . When John came back to the porch and sat down with the musket on his knees , he could hear the doctor 's heavy voice rumbling away to Mrs. McKlennar , a pause , laughter , and then Lana 's voice joining in . Young John felt the blood rush all through him . He positively burned with the thought , " By God , women were brave ! " He thought what it would be like when he and Mary got mar- ried . What it would be like , being in there , watching her , seeing her go through it . It seemed awful . Mary was even slimm than Mrs. Martin was . But it had to be . A man could n't gawayfrom facing it . It was right , too . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Then he hear . Mrs. Martin give a gasp and the doctor say with unction , " They ' picking up , are n't they ? " " Well , for God 's sake , John Weaver ! " He turned to see the widow looking at him . Her horse fa . was flushed high with excitement . But she appeared to strugg with something in her own inside . " What on earth are you doing , John ? " He tried to explain . But Mrs. McKlennar seemed to uncle stand . " Very good idea , " she said . " Yes indeed . But I thin you ought to patrol the place . You better keep marching roue . the buildings . Suppose an Indian should be coming up from th back ? " John was n't a fool . He blushed . He knew that she meant he was n't to sit there right outside the window . He could n't i agine how he had come to do it . " Yes , ma'am . " Now he was marching round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking to see if anybody were coming . He leaned again the fence rails , and thought , " Even if we get able to marry thi summer , that could n't happen for quite a while . " For he and Mary had it all settled . They had realized last wilt ter that John 's mother still did n't want them to get married , an . that she had asked Mary up just for John to see how little Mar knew . But Mary had been apt at picking things up , and Mrs Weaver had n't liked that . She had stopped asking the girl in March . George Weaver had taken it pretty much to heart . He had said to his son , " That 's how your Ma is . You 've got to take her the way she is , John . I 've done it , and she ' s been an almighty good wife . She ' s been a good mother , too . If times were differentI could give you something to get married on . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you get enough , you ' 11 have my agreement , and I ' m not going to take your pay , as I might otherwise . You go ahead , and you work it out when you can , and you get married . Mary 's a fine girl , and your Ma ' s just notional now . Once you ' ve gone and done it , she ' 11 come round . " It was the longest talk he had ever had with his father . He had gone down to see Mary about it the next week . That was the day when Mrs. Reall had announced that she was going to go back to Massachusetts with Corporal Rebus White . Mrs. Reall was taking her family , but Mary had refused to go . She was ashamed . She broke down with John and explained that Mrs. Reall would not marry Mr. White until the state had paid her widow 's claim . It was shameful . Mary had stayed . She had , through March and April , eked out enough , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had seemed pretty desperate to them both . At first John could not get work . Then when the spring came there was plenty of work to do for widow women , but there was no cash money involved . There was almost no money left that people were willing to lay out in hired help . But at the end of . April they had had a great stroke of luck . Captain Demooth 's hired girl had run away and the captain had been willing to let Mary go there and try the job . And then Gilbert Martin had joined the Rangers , which took him away part of the time , and while he was gone he paid John half a shilling a day to look after the McKlennar place . They realized they were getting along . For a while they even talked of getting married right away , until it occurred to Mary that it might interfere with her job ; so they decided to wait a few months longer and save maybe twelve or fifteen dollars . John had wanted to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did promise to enroll him in the militia , though ,   when the companies were reorganized . He told Mary about iHis mother never spoke about Mary . Every time John return to see his family , she cooked some dish she knew he would like , but she froze all over if he mentioned the girl . She seemed bit  --  ter and unhappy . And now John , thinking of what one day Mar would surely have to go through , never considered that his motile had been through the same process to bring him into the world . All he thought of was Mary . Since she got her job , she had taken to winding her braids round her head . Her neck showed . slim and pliant . There were moments when she greeted hi with a dignity and fondness through which her slim ardent emerged as a thing so surprising that it took the breath of the . both . It gave John a queer feeling that her visible mature : instead of giving her defenses against himself , was putting her i. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was conscious of the fact that she had come between him and h ' mother , that she wanted to do everything to please him . Even John did not think she was pretty , except in the way an girl that was n't too fat was pretty . He did n't know why it was h had fallen in love with her . She was long-legged and she had a  --  abrupt way of moving ; but every now and then , when she looked at him , she seemed struck in a moment with grace . He tried to figure it all out . She was never malicious , and s was always honest ; and yet she was shy . He realized vaguely tha she was fine , but it was hard to understand that , with her parents . and her upbringing . That was what he called her to himself She was fine . It was quite a beautiful discovery for a boy so young as John to have made . He tried to imagine how it would be when they were married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary would have on . He wondered whether he would be shaving by then . Mary had once said she hoped he would never let his beard grow . He thought of her lying slim and snug under the blankets , and him . self shaving over the slop basin . P359Young John shouldered his musket and marched back to the road with his little brown dog trotting before him like a fox . He wondered how long the dog had been with him ; he had not noticed ; he had not even noticed that he had strayed away from the road . With surprise he saw that it had become dark . A still , black night , in which sounds carried long distances . He could hear a whippoorwill in the cornfield as plain as though it were in the road beside him . The peepers down by the river began to whimper into their night singing . John shivered , and looked back up the slope towards the stone house . The windows of the bedroom were lighted . Against the curtainshe saw the silhouettes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragoon-like figure of the widow . " God , " thought John . " It ' s happening now . " The sweat came pouring out of him . Then there was one uncontrollablewelling of sound that he would never have taken for Mrs. Martin 's voice . The doctor ducked down . Mrs. McKlennar bent forward . They were like people smitten out of the power of life . And then the doctor straightened up , and John suddenly relaxedweakly against the fence . He had forgotten all about destructives , Indians , war , Mary , his mother , himself . It was over . lint John stayed still and struggled with himself , to make himself go up , to find out what had happened . Then the little brown dog started growling . " Shut your mouth , " said John savagely . He aimed a cuff at the beast , but the dog eluded him and spun off down the road lurking high and shrill . Then John heard a man running towards him . " Hello , hello . That you , John ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Dr. Petry coming up when I was on the hill . What ' s happened ? " John said with a strangely controlled voice : " The baby ' s just got born , "  | " Is everything all right ? " " I was just going up to see , " said John , " when I heard y  --  coming . " They turned towards the house . They saw the door open a a path of light shoot towards them down the slope . Mrs. McKlenar was standing there with a bundle . " John ! John Weaver ! " " Yes , ma'am . " " It ' s all right . I thought you ' d like to know . " John 's throat filled . " Yes , ma'am . Here ' s Mr. Martin . He just got back . " He felt Gil take hold of his arm . They ran that way , full t ' up to the porch . Mrs. McKlennar stood waiting for them , ti ping wide , but with tears sliding bumpily down beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a breathfulsmoke . Gil shoved right past her and went into the room ; and Joh could n't help peering through behind him . Dr. Petry was in t act of covering up Mrs. Martin . But the thing that surpris John was that Mrs. Martin had her eyes open . She gave G a small smile . The doctor grunted . " Everything went off first rate , young man . " There it was . There in Mrs. McKlennar 's arms . She pullbackthe wrapping and showed John the red small face with i intimations of humanity quite plainly to be seen already . John breathed hard . " It ' s a perfectly beautiful boy , " said Mrs. McKlennar . ANDRUSTOWNWhatever she might be doing , Mrs. McKlennar beamed like the rising sun She would not hear of Lana 's working more than to wash the baby and change its diaper cloths . One day when Lana was bathing herself and the baby started to yell , Lana asked Mrs. McKlennar whether she would change the cloths for her . Mrs. McKlennar did . " Nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s just like a man already , the way he do n't care how he musses . " That afternoon , when John showed up to say good-bye , she gave him the brightest shilling she had in the house . " Do n't you put it away , " she said to him . " You go down to Petry 's and buy yourirl a hair ribbon with it . " John was amazed . He looked at the shilling in his soiled palm and he looked at Mrs. McKlennar . I lcr horselike face was still beaming because she had been asked to change the baby 's dirty cloths . John went down to the hay piece to see Mr. Martin . He had already been paid ; he had nearly three dollars in his pocket , but he thought he ought to say good-bye again . And he hated to leave the farm . Somehow it had become associated in his mind with the life he and Mary were going to start as soon as they were able . I le had lately imagined themselves in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom land and he rested his scythe on the point of the snathe when he saw John coming and began to whet the blade . The stone against the steel gave ringing notes in the still heat . " Well , John . You ' re going ? " " Yes , Mr. Martin . " " I hate to let you go . " " I kind of hate to go myself , Mr. Martin . " " I ' d keep you here if I could afford to . The hay ' s standing heavy and I ' m going to have a lot of work with it , now my wife ca n't help on the cart . " " They accepted this gravely . But Gil was obviously proud and  --  leased that he was going to have to do extra work . " Yes , sir , " said John . " You 've got another job , John ? " " I promised Mr. Leppard I ' d make a trip over to Andrustown with him and help him get in some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' s all right . "   " They only figure on staying a couple of nights . There ' s h no news in , has there ? " " Not that I know of , " said Gil . " But it ' s pretty far off . " " I guess we ' 11 be all right . " " Joe Boleo ' s down towards Edmeston , right now . Who ' s ing ? " John said , " Mr. Leppard said him and both the Bells , a Hawyer and Staring , and then young Bell 's wife and Mrs. Haw and Mrs. Staring . They ' re coming to rake and to cook fort u " They ought n't to take the women . " " I guess it ' 11 be all right , " John said again . " Well , good luck , John . " John raised his hand . " You 've treated me real well , " he say " When I come back I 'll come around here . Maybe I can give you a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaning on his scythe , Gil watched the lad go . John was good worker and it would have been fine to keep him round t farm . If it had n't been for having to pay Dr. Petry 's fee , t would have hired John out of his own pocket , just for the sa of the place . Another hoeing would n't hurt the corn , with all t wet there had been ; there would be a big hay crop ; and t  --  wheat looked absolutely clean . It looked pretty close to a co harvest all along the line . But Gil could n't lay half a dozen sweeps of hay without havi to look up towards the house . And then he would natural ' swing his eyes across the valley , taking in the sky line from El . ridge Blockhouse to Fort Dayton . Then he would look back the house again . The house was always the same . He could see Mrs. McKlennar and Daisy doing their jobs , and nowadays he could see Lana doing fine work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving back into the farmhouse , any more than she would consider moving down to one of the forts herself . " What ' s the sense of your staying in that hot cabin ? " she would demand . " You , . ought to keep the baby cool nights like these . " And she was right about the forts , too . They were overcrowded . Since the word had come , at the end of last week , of Butler 's attack on Wyoming , the people in Schuyler had moved down . Little Stone Arabia Stockade could not contain all of the local families . Now , with the people from up the Creek Valley and from south , by Andrustown , the forts were jammed . " Me live in a fort ! " Mrs. McKlennar 's voice was raucous . " Have you smelled them ? Have you seen the flies ? I 'd rather be scalped ! " But the people would n't live outside  --  even some people with near-by houses came into the fort at night , since they had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brigade . They had been the ones who had searched out fugitives . They had n't hurt the women and children to speak of ; they had just driven them into a swamp without food , to make their own way to safety as well as they were able . There were n't any berries ripe at that season for them to live on ; many of those who were lost starved to death . Of those who managed to reach the settlement of Wilkes-Barre , more than half were naked and so stung with flies and infected with ague that it was n't expected they would survive . Blue Back , who had got the story from his Tuscarora friend in Unadilla , said the swamp was named by the Indians " The Shades of Death . " It did n't seem possible that civilized man could allow such things even in war . A dog was barking over the river to the eastward . Gil 's scythe stopped . Now all he could hear was the high screech of the locusts in the woods and he cursed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , he saw that men at work in their fields had also stopped . A few were moving slowly to the places where they had left their rifles . The whole valley seemed to have become still . It had happened that way again and again , all the men Gil could see , stopping , and looking in the same direction . He glanced back at the house . That was all right . Up there the baby was squalling about something or other and they had not even noticed . Then the dog 's harking picked up and made a fluent ascentP364of the hillside woods and everybody knew that he must be running a rabbit ; yip-yapping for hell and gone as if the one object of creation were a rabbit and a dog to chase him . Mechanically Gil 's scythe sheared again through the standing stems of grass . Up at the house , Lana opened her dress for the baby 's second feeding of the day . She had never felt so much contentment sin  --  her first wedded days . In her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She no longer worried about herself and ' The baby was a tangible expression of their success together in the world , while at the same time he was a defense against t world and Gil . She took no thought for the future , except , vaguely , thinking of the boy as a man ; she was too full of to and the sense of her own easement in feeding her son to fbeyondthe moment . It made her proud to know that she cou feed him ; small as she was , she had a splendid flow of milk ; a he was a big demanding child , moreover , who had weighed t. pounds on the doctor 's estimate , a child many a larger worn . would have envied having . Mrs. McKlennar often noticed Lana 's passionate preoccupatio at feeding time . She did not , like many women , take it as chore ; her whole day seemed governed by the expectation that led up to the appointed time . She was a natural mother , Mrs. Mcklenar thought , and knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have felt like that . From now on , Gil would have to walk behind the family cart . He would no longer be the girl 's husband , but the father of her family . It was the patriarchal instinct from her Palatine blood . Some of those girls were wonderful things to see before they married ; then they he . came great mothers . " She ' 11 shut him out of both their live . until she wants him . " It seemed queer to an Irishwoman . And yet it was not altogether so . Lana always greeted Gil with happiness and anxiety for his comfort . He was to be pleased , to have just what he wanted . But there it was again ; he was the father . Mrs. McKlennar wondered how Gil would stand up under this attitude . P365Three mornings later , Joe Boleo appeared at the house for breakfast . He had reached the valley late the night before , sleeping in Demooth 's barn . Now he said he wanted a good meal , a wash and shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up in the south that he had seen . There was no news . He must admit that he preferred Daisy 's cornbread to Adam Helmer 's idea of nocake . After feeding he dropped down to the hay meadow to pass a few minutes with Gil . " The boy 's a dinger , " Joe said gravely . " He 's growed since I was here before . " Gil grinned . " He gets lots of nourishment . " " By God , " said Joe heartily . " Who ' s down in the lodge ? " Gil asked . " Hai n't nobody , " said Joe . " I got sick of being by myself , but Adam ' s due back there to-morrow . " " Where 's Adam ? " " He 's picking up John Butler 's trail back to Niagara . There were n't no point in staying down . They ' ve all gone from Una-dilla . " " Listen , Joe . Did you see any of the Andrustown people ? " " No , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swing west of there . Why ? " " There ' s a party gone there to cut hay . " Joe swore . " Why did n't they tell me ? " " They supposed you were down south . " " Well , I ca n't stay there all the time . I hai n't been out of the woods for two weeks . Everybody ' s so busy cutting hay they do n't think of a poor timber beast like me . Dingman was n't at the second lodge , either . " He leaned against the fence . " Hell , nothing ' s going to happen . " " Dingman 's haying for Mrs. Ritter . They spent last night there . " " No , " said Joe . " They ' ve took their women with them . "
