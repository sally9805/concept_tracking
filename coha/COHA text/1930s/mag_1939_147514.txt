The Fight for Peace ( Warwick ) . When first issued for a short run in 1938 , this brutal , literal , newsrealistic record of the war-torn peacetime between World Wars I and II looked like 63 minutes of unnecessary nightmare . Scripter Hendrik Willem van Loon , having cleverly piled up the horrors of four revolutions and four wars , rammed home his main point - that war is beastly-with more armless , legless , headless corpses than had ever appeared on a screen before . The mechanical , impersonal accuracy of lens and film was sickening . Though critics praised the picture , audiences stayed away . But for fascinated fans who saw it again last week , World War II had given the film new , terrible , urgent meanings . Pyramids of women 's and children 's bodies in Shanghai recalled Warsaw ; mangled bodies in bombed Madrid forecast London or Paris . <P> Compared with what was coming , the opening shots were almost idyllic . Beside savagely marching , stiffly saluting Nazis , Fascists , Reds , the blotchy , jerky old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simpler , sweeter time . Beside tough Dictators Hitler , Stalin , Mussolini , the sword-rattling Kaiser and autocratic Tsar looked like kindly , slightly fuddled grandfathers . Beside the Communazi conquerors of Poland and the Moscow pact-makers ( shown first as outlaws , later as dictators over a combined 240 millions of lives ) the Versailles Treaty-makers ( Clemenceau , Lloyd George , Orlando ) looked unworldly and Utopian . <P> Unforgettable were shots of coolies heaping into trucks corpses like flopping fish ; bodies with faces blown away bobbing down muddy Soochow Creek ; mangled flesh being shoveled out of shell-shattered ruins . Unforgettable were the despairing faces of old Spanish women . Most unforgettable of all : a blood-covered , four-year-old Chinese child , sitting bolt upright like a doll on a deserted railway platform , behind him the charred beams of the station . <P> Though the picture ends with President Roosevelt pleading for peace , peace was the last thing The Fight for Peace encouraged . Audiences tough enough to stick it out until the last bomb-burst were as dazed as some survivors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad as others . For The Fight for Peace shared this much with great art-though it was unable to tell its audience what to do for peace , it let them see with their own eyes what Poet T. S. Eliot meant when he wrote : " I will show you fear in a handful of dust . "
