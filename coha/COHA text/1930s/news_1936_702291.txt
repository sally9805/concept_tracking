txt One of the most significant developments on the eve of the meeting of the seventy-fifth congress is the sentiment favoring a constitutional amendment to limit the tenure of the presidency to one term of six years . A resolution proposing such amendment will be introduced in both the senate and house early in the session and is likely to receive favorable committee action unless President Roosevelt should interpose effective opposition . In view of the fact that there is much talk of Mr. Roosevelt being a candidate for a third term in 1940 , despite the anti-third term precedent set by George Washington , the attitude of the President on the question assumes unusual importance . In fact , there is reason to believe that some who will ' press for action on the single six-year term amendment are more interested in smoking out Mr. Roosevelt on his attitude toward a third term . - Defeated by Wilson . If the President should support the movement for limitation of the  --  tenure of the presidency he would close the door to a third term for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did Woodrow Wilson , he would keep the door open for a third term . Numerous Democrats , such as Gov . George H. Earle of Pennsylvania and Gov . Paul V. of Indiana , who are being groomed for the 1940 nomination , will be watching these proceedings with intense interest . The chief argument in favor of a single presidential term is that under the existing system a President spends his first term maneuvering for reelection to a second term . Most , if not all , of his acts are likely to be influenced by the consideration of the necessity of building up an organization and consolidating support generally that will assure him of reelection . Influence Shown in Election . With the tremendous concentratibn of power in the central government that has taken place under the New Deal the last presidential election revealed the enormous influence which it has become possible for the President to wield in his behalf for reelection . Thus this argument for ' the limitation of the tenure of the presideney to one term has become more potent than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce the single term amendment resolution in the Senate . Representative George H. Tinkham Rep. , Mass. said he contemplates offering a similar measure in the house . " I will urge cuick action on the proposal , " said Senator Burke . " This appears to be a very favorable time for such action . The country has just witnessed the reelection of President Roosevelt by a tremendous majority . I believe President Roosevelt would favor the amendment . " Senator Burke declared that he believed a law providing for six-year presidential terms and making Presidents ineligible for reelection would have " very great advantage . " Step , for Good Government . " It would be , in my opinion , a great step forward in the direction of good government , " he said . " Then there would be no first term during which a President would have devoted a , good share of his time to thoughts of reelection , thus permitting him to ' give fuller time to development of his program ; " He added that he might incorporate a provision . lengthening ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A single six year term resolution was passed by the senate in February , 1913 , on the eve of the inauguration of Mr. Wilson , : The convention that nominated Mr. Wilson had indorsed the single term in the party platform and a single six year term resolution had been reported favorably by a committee of the Democratic house . The house would have passed the resolution in agreement with the senate had not Mr. Wilson intervened with his opposition to the measure . Mr. Wilson wrote a letter to the late // their attention during the last two years of the terra to building up the Influences and , above all , the organization by which they hope and purpose to secure a second nomination and election . " It is their illicit power , not their legitimate influence with the country , that the advocates of a constitutional change profess to be afraid of , and I heartily sympathize with them . It is intolerable that any President should be permitted to determine who should succeed him  --  himself or another  --  by patronage or coercion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machinery by which delegates to the nominating conventions are chosen . Mitchell Palmer setting forth the grounds of his disapproval . Mr. Wilson , , or course , was thinking of a second term at that time , but he promised he would " most cheerfully abide by the judgment of my party and the public as to whether I shall be a candidate 1916 , " and he pledged himself " absolutely to resort to nothing but public opinion to decide that question , " adding that " the President ought to be absolutely deprived of every other means of deciding it . " The argument , wrote Mr. Wilson , is not that it is clearly known just how long each President should remain in office . " Four years , " he went on , " isloo long a term for a President who is not the true spokesman of the people , who is imposed upon and does not lead . It is too short a term for a President who is doing , ' or attempting , a great work of reform and who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term to six years would be to increase likelihood of its being too long , without any assurance that it would in happy cases be long enough . A fixed constitutional limitation to a single term of office is highly arbitrary and unsatisfactory from every point of view . " Effective Half of Term . " " The argument for it rests upon temporary conditions which can easily be removed by law . Presidents , it is said , are effective for one-half of their term only , because they devote Two-Term Limit Urged . " The present fact is that the President is held responsible for what happens in Washington in every large matter , and so long as he is commanded to lead he is surely entitled to a certain amount of power  --  all the power he can get front the support and convictions and opinions of his fellow countrymen ; that he ought to be suffered to use that power against his opponents until his work is done . " It will be very difficult for him to abuse it . He holds it upon suf. france @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his opponents included , have access to opinion as he has . He must keep the confidence of the country by earning it , for he can keep it no other way . " As things stand now the people might more likely be cheated than served by further limitations of the President 's eligibility . His fighting power in their behalf would be immensely weakened . No one will fear a President except those whom he can make fear the elections . " Belie Own Principles . " " We singularly belie our own principles by seeking to determine by fixed constitutional provision what the people shall determine for themselves . We cast a doubt upon the whole theory of popular government . I believe that we should fatally embarrass ourselves if we made the constitutional change proposed . " If we want our Presidents to fight our battles for us we should give them the means , the legitimate means , the means their opponents always have . "                    @
