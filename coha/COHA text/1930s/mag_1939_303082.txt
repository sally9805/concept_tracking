The great Galileo Galilei ( 1564-1642 ) tried to measure the velocity of light by means of lantern signals between mountain tops . Naturally he failed . Light travels about 186,270 miles ( more than seven times the circumference of Earth ) in one second . In modern physics , light is regarded as the fastest thing in the universe , and its velocity in empty space as a fundamental constant of nature . <P> First good figure for light 's speed was obtained in 1676 by a Danish astronomer , Ole Roemer , who measured the variations in eclipse times of Jupiter 's satellites according to Earth 's distance from that planet . His calculation was only about 3% too high . First terrestrial measurement was made in 1849 by Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau of France , who passed a beam of light through the teeth of a spinning cogwheel . The light struck a mirror , bounced back to the wheel . The wheel had been timed to move just enough in the brief interim for the teeth of the wheel to intercept the light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cogwheel and measuring the distance to the mirror , it was easy to calculate the speed of the light . <P> The late great Albert Abraham Michelson , in his final experiments , reflected light back &; forth ten times in a mile-long vacuum tube from the faces of a rapidly spinning , 3 2-sided mirror . Velocity measurements completed by his successors after Michelson 's death yielded an average figure of 186,270.75 miles per second . But in individual runs there were unexplained , periodic variations up to twelve miles a second . At first this caused excitement over possibility that the speed of light might not be constant ( TIME , Dec. 25 , 1933 ) . The clamor was quieted by attributing the variations to " experimental error . " So the velocity of light was re-established as a constant in good standing . <P> Last week Harvard University announced development of a new apparatus for refining measurements of light 's speed still further . It is compact enough to be housed in a small laboratory room and hallway , it eliminates friction as a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human eye is not a factor ( the Michelson crew aimed their beams by eye ) and the clocking is done , in effect , by a photoelectric cell . <P> The principle is that of cutting a light beam up into a certain number of sections per second , then measuring the length of one section . This is like clocking a freight train when you know the length of the cars . If the cars are 30 feet long and you see that two of them pass a given point every second , you know the speed is 60 feet per second . <P> The train of light emitted from a 1,000-watt lamp is " sectioned " by a formidable-looking device called a standard frequency generator ( see cut ) , also developed at Harvard , which alternately brightens and dims the beam 19,200,000 times a second . This is like nicking at regular but very close intervals a cable which is rapidly being paid off a drum . The light beam is split . One part is conducted over a long course ( 185 yd. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . Both are reflected back to a photoelectric cell . On the beam which has been over the long course the brightness peaks ( nicks ) lag somewhat behind those on the other . From the amount of this lag the length of one section is calculated .
