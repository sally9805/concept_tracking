A radio station in Gary , Ind . boomed out one night last week : " Here we are , folks , right on the scene of a gigantic man hunt . The troops are tramping through the field on the trail of the convicts . Listen closely , folks , listen to that deadly patter of lead . " Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! <P> Excited Hoosiers who knew that ten long-term convicts had escaped day before from Indiana Penitentiary and kidnapped a sheriff , congratulated themselves on having tuned in on the capture . Many a policeman 's wife telephoned headquarters to learn if her husband had been wounded . The sheriff of nearby Cook County . III . doubled his highway patrol . Indiana 's Governor McNutt telephoned to learn what was happening . He was told that the whole thing was a fake . <P> But it was not entirely a fake . The managers of Columbia Broadcasting 's Station WIND , knowing that police were searching a wooded section near Chesterton for the escaped desperadoes , had taken a microphone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt Leach of the Indiana State Troopers spoiled the fun .

We wasted several hours ... in determining there was no truth to substantiate the broadcast and in making an inquiry into the hoax . ...

We are satisfied that when Capt.Leach has completed his investigation he will find that our own determination of the facts has been accurate . " Said President Ralph Atlass of Station WIND : " Our men relayed information regularly received from the State police . ... All the shooting had been done by police , who fired into the woods with the purpose of hitting or frightening from cover the escaped felons . " <P> Logan A. ( " Steve " ) Trumbull , the dismissed program manager , declared that the shots were fired by officers in enthusiasm over the broadcast . " We never once announced that a battle was being fought , " he said . " We first had Mrs. Thelma Gustaffson talk into the microphone on how some of the escaped convicts stopped at her home to ask directions . . . . There were police cars going up &; down the highway with sirens sounding all the time . Some of the officers wanted to fire their guns to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
