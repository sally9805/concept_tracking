Promise ( by Henry Bernstein ; Gilbert Miller , producer ) . In 1907 Henry Bernstein 's first Broadway production , The Thief , featured the late Kyrle Bellew , ran for nine months . His Melo , presented in 1931 , gave Basil Rathbone two months ' employment . Never the author of a distinguished play , Henry Bernstein in his native France is nevertheless a distinguished playwright , an able literary psychologist , a sensitive observer , a careful craftsman . It takes a little something more , however , to make a good play , and that , unanimously decided Manhattan reviewers , is what Promise has not got . <P> What this formless interlude in French upper-middle-class family life has got is a characteristic , plush-lined Gilbert Miller production and a fine cast of actors . Chief among them is Sir Cedric Hardwicke , never before seen on a U. S. stage . An exponent of the feather-touch , as the timid , pale grey little Parisian father , his gentle intonations and delicate gestures seem to indicate that he is afraid that grosser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him floating up in the flies . In direct contrast to Sir Cedric 's placidity is Irene Browne 's portrayal of Mme Delbar , his violent , redheaded wife . <P> She hates her husband for his feebleness , his lack of health and spirit . In the end each has full revenge on the other from the ignominy of their mutual pity . <P> Promise is punctuated by no dramatic conflict between the principals more exciting than their opposite attitudes toward a mild young man who switches his betrothal from their handsome , animal-spirited daughter to the mother 's daughter by a former marriage , a finer girl whose beauty is inward . Deep-reading observers may be able to construe these two as symbols of their mother 's condition , and the play as a subtle French study of the menopause . The U. S. translation does not articulate this idea , however , and when the final curtain falls with Miss Browne sobbing in a chair and Sir Cedric wandering vaguely off the set , spectators can not tell for sure if the play or just the act is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
