For statesmen to talk about peace is good , but last week many people in Poland , Czechoslovakia and Rumania were inclined to think , mistakenly perhaps , that their statesmen were doing something better . <P> These three countries form an uninterrupted strip of territory stretching 800 miles clear across Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea-with Communism on their eastern borders . They could be Europe 's " Bastions of Peace , " interposed between the antagonistic realms of Stalin and Hitler , and last week newsorgans in Poland , Czechoslovakia and Rumania were giving great play to this slogan , " Bastions of Peace . " <P> Specifically , the terse , determined Polish officer who has for some months past , been settling himself in a Dictator 's saddle , Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz ( TIME , July 27 ) , was host in Warsaw last week to the Chief of the Rumanian General Staff , swart , secretive General Nicolas Samsonovici . While these two great military figures conferred , Polish and Rumanian diplomats finished up three weeks work , the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutual assistance between their two heavily-armed states , each larger than Italy and nearly as potent . <P> Marshal Smigly-Rydz , on a series of recent trips to France and other countries who have a natural stake in maintaining the " Bastions of Peace , " has now managed indirectly from military quarters to mobilize considerable loans . Last week Polish arms plants were starting work on large orders for Rumania , and recently King Carol paid a state visit to Prague , placed similar munitions orders for Rumania with the great Skoda works . Not only was His Majesty feted discreetly by " Europe 's Smartest Little Statesman , " President Eduard Benes of Czechoslovakia , but the Archbishop of Prague permitted his flock to eat meat that Friday with abandon , and the electric works furnished current at reduced rates to citizens who strung up lights on their houses in honor of Carol II . <P> In Warsaw last week everyone recalled that the Treaty of 1921 , now revived and strengthened , was based on a Clemenceau conception of Russia as a politically infectious area around which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucharest the immensely tall , Mongoloid statesman who in a struggle of many years weakened this conception and secured mutual diplomatic recognition of each other by the Soviet Union and the Rumanian Kingdom ( TIME , June 18 , 1934 ) was M. Nicholas Titulescu . His influence recently waned , he was forced to resign as Foreign Minister . An invalid on the French Riviera , he has claimed that secret agents of an unspecified power poisoned him . <P> Next month Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Josef Beck goes to Bucharest to arrange all details of a state visit by His Majesty King Carol to Warsaw early next year-His Majesty has not made plans to attend the Coronation of George VI. * To Warsaw last week hurried the Governor of the Bank of Rumania , George Constantinescu about munitions loans . All up and down the " Bastions of Peace " in hundreds of factories rumbled and belched Rearmament . <P>
