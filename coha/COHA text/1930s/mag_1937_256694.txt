THE GUGGENHEIMS - Harvey O'Connor - Covici , Friede ( $3 ) . <P> In Germany Thomas Mann traced the rise of a great bourgeois family in Buddenbrooks ; in England conscientious John Galsworthy produced the more comprehensive but less artistic Forsyte Saga ; and the works are representative of innumerable lesser realistic European novels . <P> But although U. S. fortunes in general have risen faster , gone higher , dropped further , created more spectacular characters and lurid scandals than other countries can show , U. S. novelists by &; large have stood by , left the field to angry muckrakers , uncritical official biographers , or to such able left-wing analysts as Matthew Josephson ( The Robber Barons ) or Lewis Corey ( The House of Morgan ) . <P> Last week Harvey O'Connor ( Mellon 's Millions ) offered The Guggenheims , a well-documented unraveling of the complex history of the Guggenheim mining fortune that made U. S. novelists ' omission seem even more remarkable . Like the Buddenbrooks and Forsytes , the Guggenheim family began with sober business men , many of whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family relationships , fierce squabbles . But unlike their counterparts in European fiction , the Guggenheims pictured by Harvey O'Connor have operated on a scale calculated to dazzle the most imaginative novelists . <P> No epic novelist , certainly no apologist for the rich , Harvey O'Connor tells most of the Guggenheim saga in an objective , critically-cool prose . But occasionally readers may detect a slightly flabbergasted note of left-wing awe as he recounts how the seven sons of Jewish immigrant Meyer Guggenheim of Philadelphia made the family the second or third richest in the U. S. , comparable in the scope of its clannish money-making only to the Rothschilds . Starting in 1847 as a pack peddler of household knickknacks along the muddy roads outside Philadelphia , vigorous , good-humored Meyer Guggenheim acquired a peddler 's limp that never left him . When he began peddling stove polish of his own manufacture , he made more money , soon owned a tailor shop , a grocery store , became a wholesaler for household goods , made a small fortune speculating in foodstuffs during the Civil War , a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his sons , assured by their father that they would each make a million dollars , entered the business as soon as they got out of short pants .
