CEREMONY IN WHITE A STORY BY FLETA CAMPBELL SPRINGER W HEN Ruth and Cordy had gone Lexie sat on the edge of her bed thinking of Mal . " I 'm thinking of you , Mal ! " she cried , almost out loud , sending out the strong impulsive greeting as if it could reach all the way to Mal wherever she was , feeling that she was stretching out her arms , though she only leaned forward a little as if that would help , straining outward away from herself , toward Mal . " I 'm thinking of you , Mal ! I 'm the same as I always was ! " Why had she argued with Cordy and Ruth ? They were so sure of everything , so sure she was only pretending not to know . " You 're the only one who does n't know , " they said . " But I grew up with Mal . I 've known her all my life . " " I would n't brag about it , " Cordy said . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " A spot inside Lexie was very still before she said , " Mal 's not bad like old Net Bidwell , is she ? " Cordy looked at Ruth and shrugged , smiling a very superior grown-up smile . " You 've been away the last few months . Nobody speaks to her any more . " It was true , as they said , Lexie had been away staying at Grandmother 's going to school . September to Christ-mas , how long it had seemed , how excited she had been at getting home . Only an hour ago mother and father had met her at the train , and coming up the side street from the station , the short way home , she had been so happy that she had waved to everybody she saw , no matter how far away they were or whether they saw her or not , and had kept calling out foolishly , as if she were ten instead of sixteen , in a kind of delirium of homecoming , " There 's the cotton gin ! . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barton 's Hardware Store ! .. . There 's the Methodist Church ! . . . " as if she had expected to find them all changed about or probably not there at all . And rounding the corner of Schoolhouse block , " There 's the home ! " She had rushed through all the rooms and found them marvelously the same . She could hardly wait to go downtown and see everybody ; she wanted to see them all at once , embrace everybody at once . Father had gone back to the office , and mother had dinner to get . Lexie must unpack and hang up her things in her room so they would n't be crushed . But she had scarcely got her suitcase open when Ruth and Cordy came , dashing up on the porch , clamoring at the door . And now Ruth and Cordy had gone , and Lexie sat on the edge of her bed , thinking of Mal . Mal with her dark bright eyes , her strong black hair , indifferent reckless Mal whom she had always been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been since she had really seen her last . But now , because her present vision was blurred by the things that had just been said , because for the first time the figure of Mal had failed to spring up before her complete at a thought , but wavered in a kind of vacuum of unreality , all the old visions of Mal , the Mal she had known since they were children together , came crowding forward as if to the rescue , as if to keep this vague new figure alive . Mal , coasting down Jayne 's Hill on a bicycle at breakneck speed , her feet on the crossbar , her red knitted " stocking cap " flying out straight in the wind . Mal , one arm in a sling , racing down the street on the chestnut mare Lady , pulling her back on her haunches to a sudden stop in a cloud of dust . Mal , a whirlwind of color tearing past the catcher , sliding to base , in a game of Black Man at recess . Mal poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , fists clenched , ready to jump . These were the pictures , full of action and bright bold color , that Lexie would always have of Mal . And always accompanying them that old sense of herself , a pale shadow ( for she had no definite picture of herself except that she was small and blonde and felt invisible ) , watching a little enviously , but not the same envy you felt for anybody else ; for it was almost as exciting as if it were yourself to see Mal doing so recklessly whatever came into her head to do , bringing it off to a finish , no matter how dangerous . She did n't do things to show off or to get ahead of you , or even to be the best ; she did them because she wanted to , and Lexie 's envy was not for what Mal did , but because she never " stopped to think , " because she was not afraid . It was thinking that made you afraid . Not that Lexie had never done these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycle too , but not when it was icy , not with her feet on the crossbar , not without looking to see if the way was clear . She had raced horseback too , but not just any horse , not a wild horse like Lady , known to be dangerous even for a man to ride . And she had jumped off barns , but not the highest ones . On the highest ones she had remembered father 's favorite admonition to " use her head " and refused to jump . Yet she knew that it was n't father 's admonition that kept her from jumping ; she would n't have done it anyway . It took courage to say , as she forced herself to do quite calmly , " It 's too high , I 'm afraid to jump , " but it would have taken more courage to jump . " A little caution , " father often said , " had saved many a broken leg . " And so it had for Lexie , to her deeply secret shame . Why should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm or a leg , having some accident . But that did n't stop her doing the same things over again . Once she had been unconscious for a day and a half , thrown and dragged by a horse she had been forbidden to ride . " This will surely teach her a lesson , " everybody said . But the first day she was out she caught the horse in the corral , tied it up short to a post , and gave it a good lamming with a rope . " I 'll teach you ! I 'll teach you to throw me ! " she was saying when her father heard the commotion from the house . Something had leaped inside Lexie when she heard that story told . Nothing would ever conquer Mal . Yet when a week later MaI came riding into town  --  for that was after they had moved away and were living on the ranch  --  Lexie could only say , " I 'm glad you 're well again , " and Mal said only , " Yes , I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . She was ready for something else . You could never really talk to Mal or tell her how you felt . She would probably never know how important a place she had in Lexie 's world or how often she thought of her . " Poor in spirit " ? it was a phrase the minister had used one day in church . " Poor in spirit , " that was how Lexie felt when she thought of Mal . From the beginning it had been the same . Even in those earliest years  --  and Mal and Lexie had been among the very first children in the little Oklahoma town  --  when they had walked to school together every morning in wintertime and played together in summertime , Lexie had never thought of Mal as a chum as other girls had been . Mal had never seemed to need a chum . They had never had secrets together or told each other what they thought about , and Lexie 's memories of Mal were never of conversations , but of activities . Not that Mal was silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked enough for Mal . She would tell you how to do things , teach you how to whistle loud through your fingers or shrill through a blade of grass , bow to make a horse breathe in before you tightened your saddle girth . She would tell you the names of things and , if you asked , what she had done yesterday or was going to do to-day . And she would tell you what she liked and what she did n't like . " I like this " or " I do n't like that " ? never any hesitation , never any doubt . Lexie always wondered how it was possible to know so exactly what you liked and disliked , since there were always nearly as many reasons for liking things as there were for disliking them . That is , if you thought about them long enough . Mal did n't like " niggers " ; she always called them that . Lexie could still see Mal 's straight back stiffen , her head go up , and her walk go faster when one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they passed . They soon stopped calling out when Mal was along and only waved timidly and mouthed " hello " when Lexie looked around . Their faces looked so scared and their eyes so merry that Lexie wondered how anybody could help liking them . But Mal disliked them , " bated them , " she said , for no more apparent reason than she disliked cats , spotted ponies , turtles , reading books , persimmons , white dresses , and the blue flower they called " indigo . " And she disliked them forever . She did n't change her mind . Lexie wished she knew how Mal decided things . She seemed to have some secret way of making up her mind . When she was eight she had given up playing with dolls . " I do n't play dolls any more . " Lexie had given up playing with dolls half a dozen times and had gone back to them again . But after that if Mal was coming she put them out of sight . Not that Mal would be superior . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least concerned whether you agreed with her or not . But it seemed a little silly just the same to be playing dolls when Mal was there . For somehow you had the feeling that Mal was right . At least she was right for Mal , as she would always be . She seemed to be going forward while other people went round and round . She was never confused , never in doubt , as Lexie always was . She simply had n't that vacant space inside where you quaked , where things got all confused so that you did n't know really what you thought . In all the years at school Mal had CEREMONY been different from the rest . Lexie had always envied her the calm way she could answer the teacher 's question with simply " I do n't know . " Either she knew or did n't know . if Lexie did n't know she thought she ought to know and made an attempt to answer anyway and often convinced the teacher that she knew or found out she really did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish effort to pretend she did . She had the air in school of being there only because she had to be and of studying only to be through and done with it and free . There were times when she looked as if she might march out in the midst of a class and leave the whole silly business behind and never come back again . And you imagined that if she did , it would be to go to some high adventurous life of her own which she knew awaited her outside . So that when she did stop school at the end of her eighth grade year , Lexie imagined that she had done just that . Yet all that Mal had said to her was , " I 'm not coming to school any more " and , " I like the ranch . " Was it because Mal had been living on the ranch and no longer came to school that Lexie had seen so little of her these last few years ? Was it because she remembered that Mal had " liked the ranch " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had thought of her instead as doing again what she wanted most to do ? Or was it because Lexie herself had been so interested in other people that she had not noticed how she had seen less and less of Mal ? There had been school in winter . And new people had come to town . New friends . Ruth and Cordy had come  --  Cordy and Ruth . So long as a thing was not put into words it was neither true nor untrue . But when it was said , when it was put into words , it became somehow both true and untrue . Ruth and Cordy had said it . And now Lexie knew that she must have known it all along . At least she must have known that there was something about Mal . Why else had people stopped mentioning Mal to her ? And why had she stopped asking who had seen Mal and how she was ? Why had Mal stopped coming to parties ? What had people meant , oh long ago , when they said they were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed just a phrase that grown-ups used , like father saying as he used to do that Mal would grow up to be a handsome woman " if she did n't kill herself with her recklessness . " To be sure she had been away this winter . And Mal had been away the summer before . She had asked then what had become of Mal , and someone had told her she had gone away , to the next town , they had said . Why had she not asked what she was doing there ? Had there been something in the look , the voice , that had warned her from asking that ? Or was she only imagining all this now ? Was it possible that she had been so absorbed in her new friends Cordy and Ruth last summer that she had nearly forgotten Mal ? Suddenly she was filled with anger  --  at herself , at the town , at everybody , but most of all at Cordy and Ruth . A hundred Cordys and Ruths could never equal Mal . What right had they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to speak of her at all ? How dared they smile like that , as if they were superior , as if it were a joke ? " Nobody speaks to her any more " ? Cordy had seemed to triumph over them both  --  over Lexie , over Mal . " Surely you ca n't pretend you did n't know she was being ' talked about . ' " " Talked about " ? lots of people had been " talked about . " Mrs. McCready and Minna Ellis had been " talked about , " but people had n't stopped speaking to them because of it . There was only one person in town that people did n't speak to . . " You 've known old Net Bidwell all your life too , have n't you ? " . . Mal slinking down side streets like old Net Bidwell , avoiding people , looking furtively sidewise out of her eyes as people passed , to see if they were going to speak . . .. Mal with that queer shuffling step .. . Again the vision wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vacuum of unreality .. . . Hardly knowing what she did or why , Lexie went through the little hall and appeared at the kitchen door . " Do n't come in ! " cried mother , " it 's a surprise . " She was shielding something with her apron , smiling , waving Lexie back . " I wo n't , " said Lexie , turning back at the door . " Ali right now , it 's safe . I 've hidden it . Come on . " " I just wanted to ask you  --  could I have a party , do you think ? " " I do n't see why not , " said mother . " When ? " " I was only thinking about it , " Lexie said . " This week maybe . I 'd have everybody  --  all the boys and girls I have n't seen for so long . " She began to name them over , and mother happy and busy at the stove , kept saying " yes " and " of course " or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . And after every name Lexie tried to say , " And Mal , I 'd have Mal . " But she could not , simply could not say the name . Now she had come to the end . She could think of not another one . She waited . . . surely mother must think of Mal . Thethought of Mal was there between them , like a presence , like a ghost . " Have I  --  forgotten anybody ? " It was the best that she could do , as close as she could come . For an instant it seemed too close , and they would have to say it now ; and this she knew she could not bear . Then mother said  --  did she imagine that she looked relieved ? ? " You do n't seem to have left anybody out . " And then quite casually and in another voice : " You 'd better finish hanging up your things , dear , if you want to go downtown before dinner . We can arrange about the party later on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I was only thinking that it might be nice . " She had escaped to her room again . So it was true . Mother knew it and so did everybody else . Mal not even asked to a party . . . . " Nobody speaks to her any more . " A great love for Mal welled up in Lexie 's heart . " I 'm thinking of you , Mal ! I 'm just the same as I always was ! " She must find her , see her , tell her , let her know somehow . She would write her a note : " Dear Mal : I 'm home for Christmas vacation . I meant to write you before . . . " No , it would n't do . If she had n't written her before , writing her now would be too much . Mal would suspect that she had heard and think she pitied her . You could n't pity Mal . Whatever she did , however they met , Mal must not think that . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message for there was no one to send it by . No , she must wait now until she met her on the street . . . and then , just as she would have greeted her if she had n't heard , quite naturally  --  not too warmly , not too gaily , or Mal would know casually , but glad , glad . . glad and surprised and happy to see her again . She had n't known how difficult it was going to be . Perhaps she had n't really expected it to happen at all . At least she had n't expected it so soon . For when on the second day she actually saw Mal coming toward her down the street she felt a shock as if she had believed Mal dead and she had appeared before her suddenly alive . Mal , in a plaid coat , red scarf and tam , the color in her cheeks whipped up by the winter wind , so startlingly alive , so startlingly like herself , her head held high , coming directly toward her along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , Lexie cried out , " Mal ! Why , Mall " , flung out her arms and stopped while Mal came on . Without slowing or quickening her pace , without even taking her eyes from Lexie 's eager astonished gaze , Mal swerved slightly outward to avoid the outstretched arm , and strode straight on , leaving Lexie staring after her . Her eyes had been clear and proud . They had not wavered but looked straight through Lexie as if she were not there . Stunned and bewildered by something that had certainly been like scorn in Mal 's dark eyes , Lexie , still gazing helplessly after her , saw two women , Mrs. Mills , the banker 's wife , and Miss Evans , the teacher , emerge from the post office directly in Mal 's path , saw them waver as if they were about to turn , retreat , saw Mal go past them as if they were made of air . Not speaking to Mal ? ... Mal was not speaking to the town ! Above the confusion of her thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of exultation rose up in Lexie 's heart . Again the old leaping sense of Mal riding fast  --  Mal not caring  --  riding reckless and alone . Mal doing what she wanted to do  --  bringing it off to a finish no matter how dangerous . . . . And beneath this exultation and turbulence , Lexie knew that something had been restored to her , some part of her world that she had nearly lost . She had no other glimpse of Mal before she went back to Grandmother 's and to school . But the one encounter was enough . It had performed the miracle , lifted the weight of sadness and concern from Lexie 's heart , and re-established Mal in her rightful place  --  a little farther removed this time , but sure and strong above all others . . . nothing would ever conquer Mal . Lexie had only to remember that bright flash of scorn in Mal 's dark eyes as she passed her by to feel ashamed and rebuked  --  rebuked for presuming upon old friendship , ashamed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitied Mal , ashamed of her  --  lack of faith . She had only to see again the high rebellious carriage of Mal 's head as she swept by those other two who wavered in her path to feel again that in that instant she had shared with her a kind of triumph she would never know alone -- -a triumph over something she despised but could not name . By the following summer Mal had passed beyond the stage of being openly talked about . The town had ceased its indignant gossip of her " brazen and insulting ways , " her " defiance in the face of decency . " The talk had spent itself . There was nothing left to say . Resigned and eloquent silence greeted any mention of her name . Often she disappeared for weeks at a time , though where she went no one seemed to know or care , relieved only that she was gone . When she reappeared  --  for she always reappeared , wearing each time more dashing clothes and the same highhanded air  --  an uneasiness ran before her down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's back again " ; men moved to the edge of the sidewalk and looked embarrassed as she passed , as if they might be going to speak to her . Only the boldest of the boys did sometimes speak , and sometimes had from her a quick glance and a brief " Hello . " Only once did Lexie , at home again , see Mal speak to anyone she had known before ; only a glimpse as she turned a corner of Mal a block away talking with three town boys . Because she had always known these boys , Lexie found herself thinking quite easily , quite naturally , that she had never thought of Mal as interested in boys as the other girls had been . She had thought the boys liked Mal because she was good at their sports , because she was more like them . And she thought also for the first time and with a sharp sense of surprise , as if it were a discovery , that Mal was almost a beauty . You had n't thought of it before because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't posed , or talked about clothes , or been self-conscious or affected with boys . . . The thoughts passed lightly , clearly through the surface of her mind , as if Mal had been just any girl . It had almost been a bridge across to Mal . It was one of these same boys who came into the drug store one day when Lexie was waiting at the back counter for a prescription to be filled . He stopped at the soda fountain at the front of the store , and Lexie heard him order a " coke " and say to John Labin the clerk , " Did you hear about the preacher calling on Ma ! Baxter ? " " I did ! " said John , and they both laughed . " He wo n't try that again , " said the boy . " Well , be certainly had his nerve , " said John . Lexie had an instantaneous vision of Mr. Foster the minister and of Mal confronting him . Mal with her eyes ablaze , standing up straight and tall before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious , weak , and good . You could n't help being sorry for Mr. Foster even in the pulpit when he preached , where everybody was friendly and wanting him to do his best . It must have taken all his courage and all his sense of duty to drive him to anything so rash . Mal , who had never gone to church or even to Sunday-school ; it had been one of the things she " did n't like . " It was only because he had n't really known her that he had dared to go . Lexie could imagine the scene  --  yet she did n't imagine it except for that first instant 's vision of Mal standing straight and tall in a door , with Mir . Foster , hat in hand , outside on the ground , looking up at her and flushing , his stringy neck with the Adam 's apple working , his weak moist eyes behind his glasses looking as if he were about to cry , stammering , trying to speak , flayed by the blazing scorn in Mars eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " .. . She liked the way he said it ; there was admiration in his tone for Mal  --  in Johnny Lahin 's too . She could almost have laughed with them , feeling suddenly warm and friendly toward them both . But of course they had n't noticed that she was there ; they did n't know that she had overheard . On the rare occasions when Lexie saw Mal on the street afterward , it was at a distance and alone or with some stranger , an inhabitant of a different world . Once through the window of the dry-goods store she saw her pass with a stranger  --  a tall , sunburned young man in khaki , very businesslike and trim . And Mrs. Satterlee at the window matching thread for a customer , sighed and said , " It 's a pity , those young surveyors , with as many nice girls as we have in town . " And once from across the street in the Tate afternoon she saw Mal pause to speak to two men on the hotel porch ? traveling men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' row " at her approach . And at these times it was she , not Mal , who hung her head , avoided people 's eyes , pretended she had not seen . It was odd , the little things that made her think of Mal . Whenever she went to buy so simple a thing as material for a dress or a string of beads , and found herself looking at red , thinking that surely of all the colors in the world red was the most beautiful , and that she had never yet seen any red that was brilliant or deep enough ? if only this were brighter , deeper , redder , she would buy it at once , but this that was merely red  --  and then coming away as usual with one of those dim indefinite colors she always wore , feeling that she had betrayed herself again  --  invariably she thought of Mal . And often when she was reading a phrase or a passage would make her think of Mal . " One wing of the palace of our liver " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mal ? The wing that was Mal 's was vague and shadowy , but somehow magnificent  --  with strong walls , windows that looked upon vast plains , turrets that reached to the sky , and dark gardens with strange flowers . In the spring of the following year something happened which made Lexie realize once for all how definite a boundary stood between her world and Mal 's . It was a magical spring night , and they had been to Cordy 's on the other side of town . Now , walking home with Ruth and Dave and Tom , they came into Main Street , quiet and deserted at ten o'clock . Only from the drug store a bright white light streamed out . " Ice cream or something cold ? " Tom asked , turning round . " Ice cream , " said Ruth . " Come on . " But Lexie , in a dreaming mood under the spell of the night , felt suddenly that she could not bear to go inside . " The light 's too bright , " she said . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding Lexie 's moods , said promptly , " Do n't come in . Stay out here , we 'll bring them out . " The three went in , and Lexie moved languidly to the edge of the high sidewalk and sat down in the shadow beyond the streaming light . She sat upright , her head leaned back against a wooden post , half listening to the voices inside the store , half dreaming of nothing in particular . Her eyes gazed into the darkened street . There was not even the warning of an approaching step . A board behind her creaked , a hot hand was laid on her shoulder , a hoarse male voice behind her said quietly , " Aye there , Mal . " She turned to see looming above her a strange man , thick-set , ruddy faced , black mustache and cigar , who seeing her face turned to the light said , " Excuse me ! " and retreated soft-footed backward into the shadow from which he had appeared . Then he turned , and his uncertain bulk loomed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner and was gone . The spot where the hand had been laid on her shoulder was hot and quivering . . . . A hand had come out of the darkness and touched her . A hand and a voice . She was weighed down , held there motionless by that touch , smothered by the thick male voice  --  two weights , two tones  --  the first heavy and intimate , the second apologetic , retreating , as if to withdraw the first . . . . " Here we are ! " said Dave . They were with her , surrounding her as she got somehow to her feet . Afterward she could not remember whether she had eaten the ice cream or not . She could hardly remember their walking home and nothing that was said . ? A hand had come out of the dark and touched her  --  out of that dark and terrifying world where Mal went freely , unafraid . A world of which you could never know anything more than that it was there , invisible , forbidding , close beside your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you could never be . .. a reckless willful courage . . . courage to walk alone . . with strangers .. . safe because of that courage . . . through the dangerous dark . There would always be those two worlds  --  that one and her own familiar one in which she would always live , where only a little courage was enough , where even the timid , the poor in spirit safely lived . She saw her own safe life , its boundaries intangible but fixed . Even if something unexpected happened and she went far away , lived in cities , New York , Europe  --  she would always be the same . You took your boundaries with you . There would always be the line you could n't cross . Only Mal had crossed it , boldly  --  unafraid . On a Sunday morning in September Lexie woke and looked out her window to find that the day was gray and heavily overcast . " It would rain to-day ! " she said to herself . " It rains on picnics ; of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a river baptizing , and they were going , all of them . The whole town was going , for it was , they said , a show you should n't miss . There had been a week 's open-air revival in the grove , and everybody had gone to the meetings at least once or twice . Father and mother were going with their friends . Cordy and Ruth and the boys were coming for Lexie at ten o'clock . They came at ten-fifteen , late because they had thought it was going to rain . But the low gray skies had lifted , thinned , paled to a lighter gray . As they drove through the streets and left the town behind , the high curtain of cloud that hid the mounting sun grew luminous , opaque still , but evenly suffused with light . " I knew , " said Dave , mock-solemn , " God would n't let it rain to-day . " " Well , I was n't so sure , " said Tom . " The river 's pretty low . I thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins away . " " Mal Baxter ! " Lexie said . " Mal . . . ? " " Oh , she has n't heard ! She has n't heard ! " sang Ruth . " She did n't go . You missed it , Lex ! Mal Baxter was saved last night ! " " Repented . Came to Jesus . " " It was marvelous . " Far away a blow had fallen . All their faces were turned to her , eager , lighted with excitement to find she had n't heard . " I  --  ca n't believe it , " she said weakly . " Nobody could believe it when they saw her coming down the aisle . " " She nearly fell , if the preacher had n't caught her . . . " Not Mal . . . not Mal . . . not Mal ! The words beat themselves over and over in her mind as if to avert , put off , deny , the realization of this catastrophe . Not strong scornful Mal , Mal of the high rebellious head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad because she wanted to be ! She could n't have done it ; what they were saying could not be true , it could n't have happened to Mal . She clung to her disbelief against their voices . Cordy was telling it now . She was sitting in the very back  --  you know how dark it is . Nobody seemed to know she was there , or whether she 'd been there before . We could n't believe our eyes . They 'd already sung two songs with the revivalist and Mr. Foster begging and pleading with them to come up , and both of them mopping their faces and getting more and more excited , and just as it looked as if they were n't going to get anybody at all and they 'd begun the third song , all of a sudden there was a terrible sound in one of the back rows  --  it sounded as if somebody had been hurt , you would n't have recognized the voice it was so unnatural ? and a kind of commotion , and there she was crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they saw who it was , and Mr. Foster  --  it was the funniest thing you ever saw  --  Iooked terrified for a minute until he saw she was crying so she could hardly walk , and then he just dropped on his knees and began to shout ' Praise God ! Praise God ! Praise God ! ' They were all holding out their hands to her , and she would have fallen right into Mr. Foster 's arms if the preacher had n't caught her you know how they act when somebody 's saved , you can imagine what it was when Mal Baxter came . . . . " Oh she had seen them stumbling , broken , convulsively sobbing , go down that aisle to the waiting outstretched hands  --  the weak ones , the timid ones , the ones who were afraid  --  but not Mal , not Mal , not Mal . " Can you imagine Mal Baxter leaning on Mr. Foster , letting him shake hands with her ? " " Can you imagine her letting old Mrs. Burkus kiss her on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as if something had been broken inside her . It was pretty awful to see her cry . " " I ca n't quite believe it yet , " said Toni . " I would n't have been half asastonished if I 'd heard she 'd killed a man . " I wish it had been that . . . . Had she said it aloud or had she only thought it desperately to herself ? That she might have believed , admitted , understood . It had been easy , long ago , to believe that Mal was bad . What she had not been able to believe was the slinking furtive Mal , the Mal who hung her head , avoided your glance for fear she would not be spoken to . And that had not been true , as this would not he true . This broken penitent Mal could not , must not be true . This time she would keep faith with Mal . Their voices were going on . They did not even notice how still she was . They were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest , unless she changes her mind . " She grasped at it , with a great surge of relief . Whatever had happened last night , she would be herself to-day . She would not he there , not be there for them to look at , laugh at , triumph over . They could not conquer Mal . " She wo n't change her mind . " Cordy 's voice , superior , the old note of triumph in it , triumph over Lexie , triumph over Mal . " She 's had enough . You could see how scared she was . " And this was so false that now she knew that Mal would not be there . And all the time they and their voices were being carried swiftly forward through the steadily brightening day . River and earth and the misted curtain of the sky that still obscured the sun were drowned in hard white light . All the air between was filled with brazen reflected light . There was a singing in the air , a high , many-voiced singing that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were audible . On the opposite bank a group of vari-colored figures lined the river 's edge . Against them the tall black-garbed figure of the evangelist , arms outstretched and rigid , stood out starkly like a somber living cross . At his right , a smaller group , white-robed and motionless . The singing wavered on a long high note and ceased . A single voice , the voice of the evangelist , began to speak . It was like a deep-toned droning in the air . Only as it rose now and then to a kind of noble chant did the words become distinguishable : " Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death . . . . Even so we also should walk in newness of life . . planted together in the likeness of his death . . . . We shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection . . . . For in that he died he died unto sin once . , . he live &; unto God . " The voice stopped . As at a signal , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Invisible signal . Inaudible prayer . As at another signal they rose again , the whole group seemed to move and shift uneasily and , with a drifting movement to the right , enclose the smaller white-robed group . In the foreground the evangelist was descending the river bank . Half way down he turned and reached up his hand . A white-robed figure detached itself from the others , came forward and , clasping the outstretched hand , was Ted down the bank to the water 's edge . As they entered the water the singing burst suddenly forth again . And as they waded slowly out into the stream , their figures growing clearer in the white reflected light , the singing seemed to follow them , the words more clear as they advanced . " And sinners plunged beneath that flood Lose all their guilty stains , Lose all their guilty stainer When they reached the middle of the river where the current ran waistdeep they halted and faced about . The singing abruptly ceased . The face of the woman , framed in the gray hair hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sagging lines under the high cheekbones , and stricken with a childish fear . The evangelist dipped up water in his hand , touched her forehead , the back of her neck , clasped her hands upon her breast , held them firmly in one of his , the other supporting her back . The words of the ritual , faintly heard : " Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ your Saviour ? " The inaudible response . " On the profession of your faith and in obedience to the command of my Lord and Master , I baptize you in the name of the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . . . . " Backward upon the water , with one strong expert movement of the supportirdarms . The waters closed above her  --  obliterating her from sight . She came up out of it , changed , but safely held in that powerful embrace from which they both seemed to struggle briefly , upright , to free themselves . Water poured from her robe and hair . Upon her face a look of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelist , and " Amen ! Amen ! " echoed from the shore . " Lord we have done as thou ! last commanded , and still there is room ! " It was over . They turned and , the evangelist leading as before , began to make their way back through the water , drawn by the singing voices that had burst forth triumphantly again . And now once more the evangelist reached up his hand and a white-robed figure detached itself and followed him down . Lexie , watching , felt her heart leap once and stop dead still . No , Mal , no ! For even at that distance and through the blinding light she saw that it was Mal . Impossible that it should be , yet it was . Mal in a straight white robe , who had never before been dressed in white . . . Knew her by the long dark hair black against the terrible whiteness of the robe . . . Saw her take the outstretched hand . . . . Saw her led into the water . Mal who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming slowly nearer , advancing through the water , her dark head , the head she had held so proudly , gently bowed , her eyes upon the water as she walked . The singing voices followed them . The impossible was happening . This could not be Mal . Now in a moment she would waken , come to life , wrench free , and hurl defiance to them all . But steadily , slowly-swiftly they came on , borne by the singing voices like an incantation , like a spell . Straining forward , hardly breathing , Lexie felt a cry rise in her throat  --  but she could neither utter it nor move . It was like a dream from which you could not waken though you knew you dreamed , nor make any movement to avert the dire disaster waiting at the end . They had entered the deep bright current , halted , drifted , turned . She faced him straightly like a somnambulist . The last words of the singing voices reached them , swinging dearly overhead . " and seek a gram With thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Mal , now ! In the stillness that fell upon them through the white reflected light of the strangely brilliant day , her face above the different whiteness of her robe and against the blackness of her flowing hair was pearly pale . It was still and strange and calm . Meekly she let her hands be folded upon her breast and the black-sleeved arm supported her . " Do you believe . . . ? " Something was happening to Lexie 's world . " In the name of the Father , in the name of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . " With no movement of her own , she was borne backward upon the water , her upturned face lay an instant upon the surface  --  and disappeared . The waters closed above her , flowing swiftly where she had been . . . . A strangled cry had burst from Lexic 's throat . A cry of protest and agonized incredulous farewell . Farewell to that strong arrogant Mai , gone down to failure and defeat . Farewell to all high courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn  --  quenched forever , drowned , put out . Farewell to the bold imperious Mal , capitulated , fallen , failed . . . They stood together again , but it was no longer Mal . Even the line firm body was changed . . . the swirled and clinging folds of the heavily dripping robe changed and distorted it . Lexie felt an arm go round her ? " What is it , dear ? " Mother was beside her . Bewildered , almost fainting , falling , for all strength had gone from her , she let herself be turned about . " I think you 'd better come with us . " And upon the singing voices , the terrible exultant voices , and through the desolate light of a betrayed and empty world , Lexie , too , was led away .
