Strangest aspect of the world since it came under the spell of Adolf Hitler is its uncertainty : the whimsical nature of events as they unravel from the Fhrer 's haunted mind . Even heads of governments nowconsult the writings of journalists like Pertinax , Augur , Tabouis , who are reputed to have secret sources of knowledge about things to come . But common men look for guidance where they have always found it : in the stars . <P> Astrology had a boom , in British newspapers last week as fearful readers pored over their paper prophets , hoping to foresee how the war would go . Most of them had heard the rumor that Adolf Hitler himself keeps a staff of five astrologers ( TIME , July 24 ) , who told him months ago that September would bring the climax of his career . If astrology had started Europe 's war , Britons reasoned , surely astrologers could predict its course . <P> Most popular of London 's oracles is Old Moore , who writes for the Sunday Dispatch . Of him , Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look forward to the future with any confidence ? ... I think I should advise you to go and consult Old Moore , because he is quite as likely to be right as I am . " Old Moore 's Almanack has appeared every year since 1697 . Only the author and publishers know who Old Moore is today . <P> Old Moore predicted the exact month in which the British General Strike would begin : May 1926 . He foretold Anschluss between Germany and Austria a year in advance . Nevertheless , last month in the Sunday Dispatch Old Moore said flatly : " During August . . . there is no doubt that Mr. Chamberlain will steer the Ship of <P> Peace through the troubled waters safely into the harbour of tranquillity and better times . " Even more confident of peace was Edward Lyndoe in The People : " Anyone who listens to , and believes , this War-by-the-end-of-August rubbish is beyond hope . " In the Sunday Chronicle Petulengro said : " News from Germany will again cause concern , but the planets ruling this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World War I still living is R. H. Naylor , who predicted the war two years before it happened , said it would last approximately four years . He introduced astrology to London 's press in 1930 , now enjoys what is said to be the biggest private practice in England . This time Naylor , writing for the Sunday Express , was too cautious to foretell war or peace . But last week he gave his opinion of war 's outcome : " It will end suddenly and for reasons no man can know or foresee . The centre of government will shift to Canada eventually . " <P> In the U. S. a Broadway columnist , Danton Walker of the New York Daily News , reported his interview with an unnamed astrologer . Said Walker 's oracle of Adolf Hitler : " His chart clearly shows him to be in the ever-tightening grip of a mental disorder . Neptune , the planet of imprisonment , treachery , insanity , assassination and suicide , is in his house of death . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
