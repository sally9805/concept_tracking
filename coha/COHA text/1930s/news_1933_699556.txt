txt Long Service on Bench . 2'o the Editor of The New York Times : In an editorial relating to the passing of the lamented Chief Justice William S. Gummere of the Supreme Court of New Jersey mention was made that Justice Gummere 's continuous service on the bench for thirty-eight years was without parallel . May I correct that statement and refer to the fact that Justice William A. Johnston , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Kansas , has been continuously on that bench since 1884 , until 1903 as an associate justice , and since 1903 as Chief Justice ? This seems to be the World 's record in point of service . However , Chief Justice T. H. Con-. ner of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Second Supreme Judicial District of Texas has served on the bench since July 3 , 1887 , Justice Conner was district judge until Jan. 1 , 1899 , when he qualified as Chief Justice of the Court of Civil Appeale . THEODORE MACK . Fort Worth , Texas , Feb. 22 , 1933.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
