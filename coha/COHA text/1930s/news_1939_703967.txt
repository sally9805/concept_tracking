txt What has it profited Germany in a military sense to annex Austria , seize Czecho-Slovakia , force commercial concessions from Rumania and bring pressure on Yugoslavia ? Apparently very little . Despite the strenuous effort to achieve self-sufficiency , Germany is still an importing nation . The **25;1026;TOOLONG Rundschau , official organ of the German General Staff , makes no bones of the fact and finds only the national reserves of coal adequate for a war , which is sure to begin with a blockade . Without coal , iron and steel can not be made . But it is precisely the lack of iron ore that alarms . The absorption of Austria was a godsend , but one not rich enough . In 1937 Germany produced only ten million tons of ore and imported more than twice that amount . So with copper , next in importance to iron . Germany needs about 220,000 tons annually , but is able to produce only 30,000 . Yugoslavia has large copper resources , but so inadequately exploited that they supplied Germany in 1937 with ore worth only 9.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued at 174 millions . Much more can not be expected , partly because Germany now takes the greater part of Yugoslavia 's production and partly because Mussolini needs copper too . Lead , mangarlbse , tin , nickel , chromium , tungsten , antimony and mercury must also come from foreign countries . Add to these vegetable oils , cotton and timber , and the situation is precarious . The recent economic arrangement with Rumania is supposed to have alleviated Germany 's desperate need for oil . But Dr. Wagenfuehr expresses a different view in a study entitled " The Aircraft Industry of the Others " published by the Berliner Institut fuer Konjtmkturforschung . If it comes to the worst , Germany , in his opinion , will need between 15 and 20 million tons annually to supply her thousands of airplanes , tanks , trucks , naval vessels and stationary engines . The Four-Year Plan calls for an annual and ordinary consumption  --  ordinary in these days of watchful waiting  --  of 6.3 million tons , of which only 1.2 million can be produced at home , chiefly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported  --  only about a quarter of the amount needed in war . Rumania 's entire yield in 1938 came to only 6.6 million tons . The rest Germany must import , chiefly from the Americas and Iran . In the light of these statistics the difficulty that Germany faces in wag ing a war of long duration is clear There can be little doubt that if enougi gold and foreign credit were available supPlies would be piled mountain high But here Nazi Germany is actuall3 worse off than was the old Reich . Ii 1937 Germany 's gold reserve was placed at 71 million Reichsmarks against somewhat more than 1,000 mil lion before the World War . In fact the Wehrtechnische Monatshefte sees in the lack of gold a handicap as great as the lack of raw material and food and goes so far as to imply that it view of Germany 's inability to make good her economic deficiencies in Um last war , her chance of winning a nevi one is not good .               @ @ @ @ @ @
