For years geologists have wondered what physiographic ( earth-changing ) agency caused wide alluvial plains-like the nine-mile valley floor east of Troy , N. Y.-which are out of all proportion to the deposits attributable to their present small streams . Last week Geologists Rudolf Ruedemann and Walter J. Schoonmaker of the New York State Museum solved the riddle , and at the same time implied that either geologists should get outdoors more or , when they did get out , should be looking at other things besides rocks . The physiographic force which had caused the Troy plain , and others like it , was the beaver . <P> Hordes of beavers have lived in the northern half of North America during the 25,000 years since the glaciers receded . As beavers still do , they built dams . When one pond filled up they went a little farther upstream and built another . When the whole valley was a series of muddy terraces the beavers went off to another stream . Then the stream broke through the dams one by one and carried a huge load of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alluvial plain . <P> For generations New York State farmers have called these plains beaver meadows but geologists failed to take the hint . <P> " Geologists , " mildly observed Geologists Ruedemann and Schoonmaker , when announcing their rediscovery of the beaver , " apparently have overlooked this important geologic agent .
