txt Declaring that the big Federal works-relief program would greatly simplify the administration of relief in this State , the State Temporary Emergency Relief Administration reported today to Governor Lehman that about 2,200,000 men , women and children . or one-sixth of the State 's population , were dependent on relief in March . It has been estimated that about 1,250,000 of those on relief are in New York City . The report showed that $284,829 , 953 was distributed for unemployment relief in a year . The cost of administration was put at 11.1 per cent of the total operation , which , with materials , involved an outlay of $357,069,637 . In detailing administrative costs in the period which began with the demobilization of the CWA April 1 , 1934 , the report struck at " public misunderstanding " of relief operations . It declared that non-political selection of administrative personnel I on a merit basis both in the TERA and in the local relief organizations had resulted in New York State 's relief activities " being outstanding in the Union for infrequency of graft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose announced objective is to provide , as a Federal responsibility , work and wages for all employables on relief , " the report asserted , " is to mark the end of the tripartite administration of relief . With only Federal funds used on work relief , accounting will be made only to the Federal Government , and procedures will , therefore , admit of simplification . " At the same time , the announced Federal intention is to take no further part in home relief , leaving the States and their localities to bear the burden of caring for those on relief who are unemployable . Thus in home relief , too , administration will be simplified , with accounting made to two governments instead of three . " While awaiting detailed plans of the Federal program , the National and State Employment Services , functioning under the Federal and State Departments of Labor , respectively , have reported occupational classifications of more than one-half of the employable members of all families on relief in all up State areas and New York City . This work is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies of the State , the report asserted , have established central occupational indexes and have been drawing up in advance needed workrelief projects to enable the State " to take full and early advantage of the new Federal program when it starts . " One in Four Is a Child . The report showed that of the 2,200,000 on relief in March , 850,000,1 or one in every four of the State 's future citizens , were children under 16 . " In the great ebb and flow from and to relief rolls as some get jobs and others find their resources exhausted , " the report stated , " morel men and women and children were supported by public employment relief in February and March than at any previous time , though the rate of increase had been lessening . giving hope that the end of the increase in need might be in sight . " The hope was strengthened by 1 the fact that for the first time in the four Winters of the TERA 's existence the number of families and non-family persons on relief in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , 1934 , it had increased by 9.3 per cent , and in March , 1933 , by 12 per cent . " In the period from May 1 . 1934 , to March 31 , 1935 , more than 225 , - 000 families and non-family persons , including approximately 900 , - 000 individuals who had never before needed aid in the present emergency , had to be added to the rolls . But in the same period the relief rolls increased actually only by approximately 67,000 families and non-family persons . " This means that there is not a stable population on relief , but that there is a real turnover in the people who are in need . With the tremendous increase in the need , public unemployment relief is today , even more than in 1931 , a necessity and not a choice . " - Table of Comparative Costs .

Schoellkopf , declined an 511,500 salary fixed by legislative enactment . The report proceeded : " As of March 20. 1935 , this administration employed 994 persons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in its transient and other special programs , 90 at salaries of less than $1,000 a year ; 361 at salaries between $1,000 and $1,499 ; 263 at salaries between $1,500 and ' $1,999 ; 131 at salaries between $2,000 and $2,499 ; 84 at salaries between $2,500 and $2,999 ; 18 at salaries between $3,000 and $3,499 ; 13 at salaries between $4,400 and $4,499 ; 4 at salaries between $4,500 and $4,999 ; 4 at salaries between $5,000 and $5,550 ; one at a salary between $6,000 and $6,200 ; 2 at salaries between $7,000 and $7,200 , and one at a salary of $10,415 . All figures are for salaries actually paid at the present reduced scale . Stable Staff Basis Needed . " The administration of relief , In most of its phases , can not be well carried on by work relief labor . Work relief recipients have to leave the job as soon as they become ineligible , and the turnover is large . It would be impossible to run an administrative office efficiently with such a changing staff . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are to get . " Therefore , these staffs for the most part have been placed on a straight non-relief salary basis . The largest part . of those on non-relief administrative salaries came themselves from- relief rolls and would themselves be in need of relief were it not fc these jobs . " The report declared that the tripartite administration of relief , local , State and Federal , " despite the overlapping accounting inherently involved corresponding to the overlapping units of government , is a chief means by which the sense of local responsibility for relief  --  essential to its economy and adequacy ? has been kept alive , despite the necessarily growing proportion of State and Federal relief funds , " adding : " The alternatives , in view of the actual sources of funds , have been the direct Federal Administration of relief , with complete State and local abdication , or direct State administration under Federal supervision , with grave danger of atrophy of local responsibility . " Disadvantages of System . The tripartite system carries with it , however , the disadvantages of necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TERA " has felt the pressure from the Federal Government on the one hand for uniform practice and records and from the localities on the other for autonomy . " " It has felt , " it is added , " the strain of competent individuals meeting day by day one of the most difficult administrative tasks ever attempted and as yet undisciplined to the inherent complications of the way it must be done , and occasionally , the attempted thrusts of local political opportunism . " The report continues : " As custodians of State relief funds the State TERA would without hesitation judge the quality of personnel to be one of the most important problems in the relief administration of the local districts , both from the point of view of humanity and of savings to the taxpayers . The Wicks act required investigation of relief cases , stipulated that the . State TERA ' make 1 and enforce-rules * * which will best promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the relief which this act is intended to furnish , ' and laid upon it the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , while far from perfect , have been evolved on the principle of merit and efficiency and not on the principle of local patronage . " The administrative costs for home relief may be considered basic and may be expected no matter in what form relief is given ; they are the costs of meeting those in need , determining their need and dispensing relief . " In October , 1934 , for which a special analysis was made at the instance of the Federal Government , relief given represented 91.5 per cent of the home relief operation , while local non-relief administrative salaries and costs were $1,043.058 , or 8.5 per cent , divided as follows : social service salaries , $458,609 , or 3.7 per cent ; other administrative salaries , $461,559 , or , 3.8 per cent ; and other operating costs , rent , light , travel , supplies , &c.,; $122,890 , or 1.0 per cent . " Work relief projects , operating on an entirely different principle from that of public works or contract labor , " the report continued , " pay wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately the same subsistence , in the form of home relief allowances . " For this reason labor is used as much as possible in work relief , even where labor-saving devices might do the job , as a job , more quickly and cheaply . The cost of the improvement itself , above the cost of giving needed relief to the ? same number of people if they were kept at home in idleness , - is properly the non-relief cost of the operation . " It was to be assumed-from. the start that improvements made under this plan , with as mtich.rnoney as possible going to labor , could not be completed as economically as under private contract . The program is , however , cheaper than doing the job on the one hand and giving relief on the other , Administrative Costs . " In the month of October , 1934 , $10,899,323 , or 68.6 per cent of the whole cost of the work relief operation , went for work relief wages to support 194,601 families and nonfamily persons . In the same month local administrative salaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding section for home relief , were $872,862 , or 5.5 per cent , divided : Social service salaries , $246,786 , or 1.6 per cent ; office administrative salaries , $492 , - 786 , or 3.1 per cent , and other operating costs , $133,132 , or 0.8 per cent . " The non-relief costs of work relief , approximately 25 per cent of the total spent , included the engineering operation of drawing up plans and specifications for work projects , and the central supervision to see that the jobs were properly done . " In addition , technical and supervisory salaries , providing timekeepers , foremen and engineers necessary to supervise the job on the spot and other services , amounted to $1,030,542 , or 6.5 per cent of the total , while materials  --  cement , steel and other needed materials , tools , and the rental of such equipment as was essential  --  amounted to $3,081,866 , or 19.4 per cent of the total work relief cost . . Jobs Cut Relief Need . " In the way that has been described in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in large part to people originally taken from relief rolls who would themselves have been in need of relief if they had not had these jobs , but who could not be used on a relief basis because their work demanded continuity . " The expenditures for work relief materials , in addition to providing pyblic improvements of value , have ' in themselves been a great factor in keeping thousands employed in the country 's heavy industries and have thus been a factor for recovery . The non-relief costs of work relief , the approximately 25 per cent of the total spent in October for the necessary supervision and materials , were a cheap price for the communities to pay for the public improvements that work relief brought them . " In view of the immense amount of public money required for relief , orderly procedures have been necessary to protect it from misuse . The objective has been to provide the safeguards by flexible procedures , modified according to experience , so that regulations might not thwart the purpose of the Wicks act that relief reach the needy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State TERA has been forced to disappoint many private interests and . public officials who have applied for relief funds for materials needed by them , but not constituting legitimate relief expenditures . These requests have ranged from outright grants , for which little explanation was given , to demands for cutlery for city restaurants . Regulations Simplified . " The regulations of the State TERA and the State Controller have prevented the diversion of millions of dollars to non-relief costs promoted by partial interests . Flexible and temporary in its character , the State TERA has simplified its regulations as far as is consonant with orderly procedure , while complying with the legal requirements inherent in an accounting to three different governments . In the simplified purchasing procedure of the State TERA the overhead of its own purchase department has been 1.3 per cent of its orders . " It was not as a charity to those in need that the State of New York came to the assistance of the localities in 1931 to share the burden of relief , " the report concludes . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her unfortunates , that forced her to take action . It was the peril to the public health and safety from widespread destitution that was recognized by the Legislature as the compelling reason for the Emergency Act . It was the economic need of the State as well , for her strength lies in her human resources , the sum of the skills , capacities , courage and health of all her people . " With the tremendous increase in the need , public unemployment relief is today , even more than in 1931 , a necessity and not a choice . The same considerations of thrift and morale that made work relief the instinctive American choice in 1931 , operate today with magnified force . Must Continue Drive . " There is no question of the necessity for a continuing of the intensive drive for capable , energetic and far-sighted administration of the whole gigantic task . At this time there is no other factor in that continued progress so essential as a public understanding of the nature of that task , complete enough to - insure public support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . " Faced with the necessity of preventing human suffering without being able to know in advance what the need would be , the State of New York took the only possible course in creating an emerency organization ' with sufficient emergency bility to meet changing conditions . " The Temporary Emergency Relief Administration , thus created , recognizing the weaknesses inherent in temporary emergency administration of relief , however necessary in the circumstances , ? last 1 June requested the Governor to undertake an impartial investigation and study of the present emergency relief machinery , so that methods of improving it might be devised . It has offered to the Commission on Unemployment Relief , subsequently appointed by the Governor , all deductions from its own experience pertinent to structural improvements which might be made under new legislation . " In presenting this report of actual administrative conditions , the State Temporary Emergency Relief Administration wishes to emphasize again its belief that the time has now come for more long-time planning than is possible under the present temporary emergency structure . " The members of the State Temporary Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are Robert J. Cuddihy , Solomon Lowenstein , Victor Ridder and Joseph P. Ryan of New York City and Charles D. Osborne of Auburn .
