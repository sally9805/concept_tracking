Year ago Franklin Roosevelt 's plan for reorganizing the U. S. Government was beaten in a bitter legislative battle amid cries of " Dictator ! " from Father Coughlin and Publisher Frank Gannett . Last week another reorganization bill passed-with no national hullabaloo , but after a right smart fight in Congress . <P> The Bill . Husky , leathery Lindsay Carter Warren , Congressman from Washington , N. C. , more than half won the fight by the way he drafted this year 's bill . He listed the points on which last year 's bill was attacked and simply left most of them out this time . He gave the President power to alter the setup of all executive agencies-except certain ones , specifically listed . ( Important exceptions in the bill as passed by the Senate : Civil Service , Communications , Power , Trade , Interstate Commerce , Securities &; Exchange , Employes ' Compensation , Maritime , Tariff Commissions , Army Engineers Corps , Coast Guard , NLRB , Board of Tax Appeals , Federal Reserve Board , FDIC , Veterans ' Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose functions of o.k. - ing expenditures beforehand and auditing them afterward the President last year sought to divide between , respectively , the Budget Director and a new Auditor General . ) The bill also forbade the President to do away with any function of the agencies he might alter or merge . And it gave Congress power by majority vote to invalidate within 60 days ( of a session ) any change made by the President . <P> In short , Lindsay Warren made Reorganization , model 1939 , a good deal less drastic than Reorganization 1938 . He also made it politically possible-just barely possible-to get the bill passed . <P> The Doones . Lindsay Warren won his bill 's crucial battle on the House floor with one brief , effective literary allusion . When Representative Kleberg of Texas tried to require that the President 's reorganization be approved by a positive vote of Congress ( rather than subject to a negative veto ) , Mr. Warren asked his colleagues : " Have you forgotten the story of Lorna Doone ? " <P> In Author Richard Blackmore 's novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute on the surrounding country-they set up cannon on the mountain ridges on both sides of Doone Valley but , falling into discord , fired across the Valley at each other while the Doones sallied out unscathed below . Boomed Lindsay Warren : <P> " Let us heed the lesson , my fellow Democrats ! . . . The Doones Republicans are in the valley . I pray you , gentlemen , train your guns a little lower . " <P> Last week in the Senate , Lindsay Warren 's good friend Jimmy Byrnes of Spartanburg , S. C. took charge of the bill . " I 'd rather have Jimmy Byrnes on my side than any other ten Senators , " said Lindsay Warren , and the tribute was well earned . For two days a parliamentary battle was fought over the bill . At one point Senator Burt Wheeler of Montana succeeded in amending it to require both Houses ' approval of every reorganization move by the President , by vote of 45-to-44 . But after two days ' smart maneuvering , Jimmy Byrnes got the amendment stricken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy Byrnes and Lindsay Warren wanted it , was passed and sent to conference .
