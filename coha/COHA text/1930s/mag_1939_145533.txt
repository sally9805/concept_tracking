Last July VR6AY , Pitcairn Island , informed W21XY , Queens , Long Island , that ships were avoiding Pitcairn because of false rumor of typhoid , and that the islanders needed food and medicines . W21XY ( Radio Amateur Dorothy Hall of Queens ) got in touch with Manhattan ' British Consulate , got help started for Pitcairn ( TIME , Aug. 1 ) . Since then she and W2KSZ ( Victor DeGhett of Brooklyn ) have kept in regular touch with the island . <P> Just before Christmas the U. S. Maritime Commission freighter City of Dalhart hove to off Pitcairn . Out rowed a Pitcairner with two gift parcels , one for Mrs. Hall , the other for DeGhett . On the way home the City of Delhart 's Radio Operator Scruggs kept trying at odd times to raise Mrs. Hall or DeGhett . Last week as the ship lay in Hoboken , Scruggs caught De Ghett 's ear . Pitcairn had told DeGhetl about the gifts . Here they were at last Scruggs advised him to hurry over and get " the stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and you ought to get it tonight . I 'll leave it with the fellow at the head of the pier . . . . Try to get here about 8:30 . " <P> To an alert U. S. Coast Guardsman listening in , this was smuggling talk , pure and simple . At 8:30 three carloads of Customs men and two launches were patrolling the area by land and sea . A batch of Treasury men lounged elaborately around at the pier . Into this ambush walked Amateur DeGhett . At midnight he finally induced the T-men to stop third-degreeing and open the packages . In them they found a walking stick for DeGhett , a hand made basket for Mrs. Hall .
