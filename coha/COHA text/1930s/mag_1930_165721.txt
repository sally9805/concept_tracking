Music lovers who live about San Francisco Bay flocked , one chilly night last week , to the University of California 's Berkeley campus to hear the first symphony concert presented in the Greek Theatre-the gift of Publisher William Randolph Hearst-in seven years . Snug in overcoats , the audience found the renditions of Weber , Rimsky-Korsakov and Wagner workmanlike but uninspired , applauded the occasion rather than the music . For it was a night of records . The conductor was black-haired , bright-eyed Antonia Brico , first woman ever to conduct Berlin 's philharmonic orchestra , first woman to conduct San Francisco 's symphony orchestra , first California graduate to conduct that organization at Berkeley . <P> Previously , Berkeleyans have preferred to hold their concerts in Harmon Gymnasium , in spite of its poor acoustics . But last week 's turnout ( capacity ; 7,500 seats filled ) , although hampered by inclement weather , encouraged symphony officials to plan future concerts for the Greek Theatre .                   @ @
