He came late in the evening , accompanied by three of his sons , James , Franklin Jr . and John , who will start with him today on his cruise up the New England coast in the yawl Myth II .

Walker 's Reply Not Ready . Although friends of Mayor Walker have said that they do not expect the Mayor to have his answer to the charges made against him by Samuel Seabury ready for the Governor until the latter has returned from the trip . which will last about a week , the Governor is prepared for immediate perusal , of the Mayor 's reply in the event that it is completed before he returns .
