If a genuine scrap of Shakespeare 's handwriting were found , it should interest everybody but Baconians . For years scholars have known only seven authentic specimens of his signature , three of them in his will . Last fortnight in Salt Lake City , Professor Benjamin Roland Lewis displayed a small piece of paper cut or torn from an old document , with a common contemporary spelling of the bard 's name-William Shakspere-plainly written across it . For 19 months Professor Lewis pored over his find . Chemical analysis proved to his satisfaction that the ink was Elizabethan . Microscopic study put , the paper in the same period . Photographic enlargements permitted minute comparisons with known Shakespearian signatures . Ultraviolet photographs established the type of pen used ; infra-red photographs showed no tracings beneath the ink . Shakespeare himself , said Professor Lewis , wrote that name . But where the paper came from , who owned it , how it reached Salt Lake City , what happened to the rest of the document , he could not or would not say .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
