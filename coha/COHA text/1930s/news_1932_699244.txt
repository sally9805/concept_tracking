txt Speaking by radio tonight to citizens of his home State of California , President Hoover announced to them and to the nation that he would go to his own precinct , in Palo Alto , to vote on election day . His address , delivered before the California Society of Washington meeting in the Carlton Hotel here , was carried by direct wire to Los Angeles and broadcast there by the Columbia system . California Societies in Oregon and Washington listened in , the occasion being California Day . - In making known that " the improved situation in the country affords me the deep satisfaction of coming home to vote , " Mr. Hoover confirmed reports long circulated , that he- would wind up ' his final whirlwind swing through the Western battleground with the tour to the Coast . He leaves on this arduous trip late tomorrow afternoon , with his itinerary , announced today , including three major speeches at Springfield , Ill. , and St. Louis Friday afternoon and evening , and St. Paul Saturday night . Twenty-eight back platform appearances are set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Madison , Wis. , the seat of anti-Hoover progressivism in the Northwest . Appeals for California Vote . The President 's broadcast to the Pacific Coast was a forthright appeal for the support of his home territory . He said that he had " never gone so far away nor remained so long , except during the great war and the Presidency , that the homing instinct has not carried me back every year to sink more deeply and more firmly the roots of my being in the fertile soil of California 's spiritual and cultural life . " When the time arrived sooner or later that his affairs would permit him to do so , he purposed to return to Palo Alto to live . Since leaving there it had been his task as President " to contend with the greatest peace-time disaster which has ever come to the American people . " That crisis had extended over every hour and every day for two years , and it had not so far permitted him " to be away from the nerve centre of the nation , the headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night 's journey . " Now , however , " the improved situation in the country " afforded him " the deep satisfaction of coming home to vote , not for the purpose of carrying on a political campaign amongst my neighbors , who are my friends , but to satisfy that proper instinct inherent in every American to cast his vote amongst his neighbors at his own home . " Gives Figures on Exports . Quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt as saying that the present tariffs had , on the Pacific Coast , " a destructive effect in our Oriental trade , " Mr. Hoover went on to say that " our exports to China increased from $80 , - 000,000 in the fiscal year 1931 to $93 , - 000,000 in the fiscal year 1932 ; exports to Japan increased from $146,000,000 in the fiscal year 1931 to $240,000,000 in the fiscal year 1932 . " There were no States in the Union where prosperity was so ' dependent upon a protective tariff as those of the Pacific Coast , he contended , and then recited some " proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested to know lemons can be laid down in New York from Europe at $3.50 a box , while through tariff protection California is able to sell her product for $6.50 . " He added : " It ? is not difficult to gauge the shallow hypocrisy of Democratic pretensions of tariff consideration in behalf of the Pacific Coast farmer . " Mr. Hoover now turned aside to " indicate the practical application our measures to protect the Pacific Coast from destrtiction in this crisis , " saying that the National Credit Association and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation " at one time advanced over $150,000,000 to some 409 banks , including branches , in the State of California ; to 62 in Oregon and to 99 in Washington . " The Federal Farm Board had advanced to California farm cooperatives a total of $31,298,009 , and , on top of this , to aid employment , the government during the Hoover administration had expended on and let contracts for public works , buildings , roads and other items totaling $100 , - 000,000 in California , $45,000,000 in Oregon and $50,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands . " " These measures which I have cited are but a partial picture of the reasons why I have not been able , during the whole of these four years , to renew the friendships and those associations in law home Stkte , or even to have the pleasure of attending the Olympic Games , " Mr. Hoover said . He now commented on " two calumnies being circulated by the Democratic agents in my home State . " As to the first , he said , " I have not , since I entered public service fifteen years ago , owned aRy interest directly or indirectly in any kind of business outside of the boundaries of the United States. , including any concern producing , transporting or distributing oil . " As for the second , " to the effect that the ranch at Wasco , My interest in which I disposed of two or three years ago , refused to employ . white workers , " he denounced that also as " a cheap political trick . " Taking all these things togehter , then , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " contribute to the responsibility of interrupting that leadership to the nation which California has itself provided . " Invigorated by reports of a change of sentiment in his favor , the President worked at his campaign plans and speeches today with fresh enthusiasm . He spent most of the day in the Lincoln study . He took a longer luncheon hour than usual to go over the New York ' political situation with George Z. Medalie , Republican nominee for Senator . This conversation was encouraging to the President . Mr. Medalie later told newspaper men that he had given assurances that the Republican ticket would win out in that State . Medalie Cheerful on New York . " I feel very cheerful , " Mr. Medalie said . " I do not think New York is doubtful any more . " My opinion is that the Hoover ticket will carry New York by a substantial majority . And I mean the whole ticket from the Governor on down . " I base that on the change in sentiment which involves two things : One , the deflation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in many instances and the lack of a definite program on his part as well . The people have gotten beyond the stage where they want sympathy ? they want constructive ideas . " Then , there is the very definite realization in a State like New York that you can give jobs to the people only by restoring business to sound business methods  --  that you can not do it by tariff tinkering , and that Hoover 's reconstruction policy affects the whole people and not simply financial institutions as Roosevelt attempted to lead the people to believe in his preconvention campaign . " I find people asking now that if I Roosevelt is really for sound money and a balanced budget why he does not say something about it . " Mr. Hoover 's itinerary as fixed today will carry him through a hardfought battleground . Before the trip to the Coast had been announced , it had already been learned that such a journey was being arranged for . Moreover , tentative plans had been sent to the Navy Department for returning the President to Washington on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Washington late tomorrow afternoon Mr. Hoover will resume his back-platform campaign almost at once , with a stop at Martinsburg , W.
