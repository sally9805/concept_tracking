For the past three years the five-day week ( 40 hours ) has been steadily spreading through U. S. Industry as a voluntary reform . The American Federation of Labor agitated the movement in &; out of season . The American Legion backed it with a nation-wide radio campaign . Progressive employers publicized their adoption of it ( TIME , April 27 , 1931 ; Oct. 24 ) . Both major political parties endorsed it in their campaign platforms . President Hoover put it into practice in the Federal Government as an economy measure . Its whole purpose is to share and spread employment . <P> Suddenly last week the five-day week movement bounded far out in front of the slow-moving industrial procession when the Senate unexpectedly passed ( 53-to-30 ) a bill that would clamp down upon U. S. manufacturers and producers not only the five-day week but also the far more radical six-hour day . As an emergency measure to combat unemployment the proposed law would be effective for only two years . Its author was smart little Hugo Black of Alabama , lawyer , War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bill would supply 6,000,000 men with work , on the theory that the employer who wants to keep his production at current levels must hire 25% more workers to obey the law . President Green of the A. F. of L. jubilated : " It 's the first constructive measure yet passed dealing with unemployment . It strikes at the root of the problem - technological unemployment . " <P> Congress reached for control of the country 's working hours under its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce . The Black Bill provided that no product of " any mine , quarry , mill , cannery , workshop , factory or manufacturing establishment " in which employes worked more than six hours a day or five days a week could move in interstate commerce . Penalty : $200 fine and three months imprisonment . Exempt from the law were newspapers , magazines , farms , railroads , dairies , canneries of perishable foods . Company officers , executives , superintendents and their personal assistants were likewise free to work as they chose . <P> Nothing in the bill prevented employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate was trying to force them to hire . The measure 's critics loudly pointed out this defect , predicted a dire slump in already deflated wages or else a sharp jump in manufacturing sales prices . For the Black Bill to be completely effective nothing less drastic than a minimum wage provision was required and this the Senate did not yet dare to vote. * <P> What the Supreme Court would say about stretching the Constitution to give the Government mastery over private industry was a hotly-debated Senate question . Loudly recalled was the fact that in 1918 the Court had voided ( 5-10-4 ) a law designed to abolish child labor by prohibiting its products from interstate commerce . Because the Black Bill struck at current working hours by the same oblique method , its critics were confident the Court would reject it as unconstitutional . Its friends argued that the Court 's personnel had changed since 1918 and so had the social temper of its decisions . <P> <P> *Last week the New York Legislature passed a law to penalize manufacturers who pay " an oppressive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minimum cost of living necessary to health " to women and children .
