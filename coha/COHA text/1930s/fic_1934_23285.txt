pers in the evening , he might like to smoke a pipe ; but he dared do none of these things , and , if he had , his family would n't have let him . " There were very few things that Pursker was likely to wish for naturally that it was right for Pursker to do by that code ; or for any of them  --  but especially Pursker . Especially Pursker , because there was something back in the past that he was hiding ; one soon came to see that . Pursker was carrying some weight that none of the rest was carrying . You saw that by the way he steered the conversation . If a family has a skeleton in a cupboard , that family would be apt to discourage guests from wandering down one passage . In the same way Pursker would always discourage me if I ever approached the past . I do n't say his wife would n't help him to steer conversation away , but I thought that she did n't know what the skeleton was . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eldest boy , about twenty-two , seemed human , and especially the girl Alice , about nineteen , but the second boy , Sam , was rabid for their etiquette and all that . " I got to know Pursker through talking about my travels , as you may perhaps have heard me do at one time or another . That was another curious thing about him , he loved to hear of my past ( and of places that I had been to ) , though he would never speak of his own . Aden was one place that he would always light up at , and Port Said another ; and he would want to hear more of them ; but if one asked had he been there , the most he would say would be that he had read of them . Why he entertained so much as he did , if he wanted to be so secretive , I could never understand ; but we are going in a circle now , the etiquette was necessary somehow to cover up that old skeleton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to think his family exactly bullied him : they certainly drove him all they could to build up the cupboard and strengthen it , but they lent willing hands of their own , and he was the only one that knew what was in the cupboard . " I often went to his house : I lived not far off in those days . I 'll tell you what happened one autumnal day when they were giving a large dinner party . I was n't dining with them but I 'd been to tea , and I stayed late in the hope that I might be able to help , and at the risk of butting in , because there was something strange in the air . I liked the old fellow and I wanted to help him , and the strangeness gradually took shape till it seemed to amount to this : all the family felt they must give a dinner party except Sam , who felt that the danger of doing so just then was far too menacing , and was reproaching his father for giving one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the others . Of what his fears were I had no idea for an hour , nor at any time , until they were suddenly certainties . After long talk , and allusions utterly veiled from me , mainly about the time of year and all the /eaves turning , Sam went away to the smoking room . Thither I followed him and noticed him looking frequently out of the window , not only at the wide landscape of goldening elms , but far more particularly along the drive , wherever unsheltered parts of it were visible from that room : the drive was pretty thickly lined with yews and not many patches were visible . And so he searched and searched , till his face went suddenly gray , and I saw that his fears , whatever they were , were true . " We had been speaking seldom , and now he would n't say a word at all . I would have got him to drink a whiskey with me only I knew their damned rules too well : the right thing to drink tglif**4**4 Wilf0441044 before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . And when they came made him drink mine as well ; and somehow or other I managed to get a third one into him , and then he talked . And this was what it was all about . " His father knew two men that were not the best people , in fact they were common seamen ; and these two old fellows , grimy and dressed in the ordinary clothes of their calling , with a huge sea-chest that they always carried between them , would come to the house once a year , and always about the day when the leaves were just turning . When they came they stayed to dine and then to sleep , and would not be put off and must have some hold on his father . What it was he dare n't guess . He told me about it now because I was bound to see them . He had repeatedly warned his father and mother that they were likely to come about now , but they had thought they would come later and had gone blindly on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves were actually turning they had said it was too late to cancel it , and that the risk was not so great as Sam made out . There were twenty people coming to dinner , and these two men would sit down amongst them all , and his father dare n't stop them . What could be done ? " And as he said this I saw the two men coming up the drive . They were n't carrying their old sea chest ; one was dragging it by a rope and the other was pushing . For a moment I had had a suggestion hovering upon my lips that they should be put into evening dress . The moment I saw them I knew it was quite impossible . For another fraction of time I wondered if they could possibly be explained as being on their way to a fancy dress ball . But it was quite out of the question ; they were too obviously just what they were . So obviously that I gave up thinking . There are people whom explanations can sweep avi4 ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with a short black fringe of whiskers all round his face was pulling the old chest raking up the gravel , and a man with a stumpy beard of yellowy red was pushing it from behind . Both had their faces so salted with years of spray that the grit and black oil of engines deep in the scams of them looked as though no number of baths would ever move them now . I gave up thinking because I had no help to oiler , and not because I had gone over to the enemy , though I must say that at first sight of the old fellows approaching that custom-ridden house they seemed to be coming like a breeze from the sea into a room whose windows had been shut all through the summer . But to Sam you could see they were more like some fatal draught blowing in on an orchid , And when he saw that I had no help to give him he suddenly came to some sort of a resolution , for his terrified face tautened and , with nothing said that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What he did I heard afterward . How much the three sherries had helped him I do n't know . But he went to his elder brother and put it to him that this blackmail must stop now ; that , whatever their father had done and whatever publicity these two sailors might make if thrown out , nothing they could do would be worse than the impending exposure at a dinner party to twenty people , and pretty well the pick of the neighborhood too ; for he called it an exposure to have these hangers-on of their father sitting down at that table with them in the sight of all those guests . Etiquette and all that had never sunk quite so deeply into John as it had into Sam and he was for protecting his father 's secret , whatever it was , and not angering the two seafarers , and letting them eat with all the rest if they wanted to , and as they certainly would ; but all his arguments were swept away before Sam 's indignation , and perhaps by the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Boleby  --  I have n't told you about him . Young Boleby had with a good deal of difficulty got an invitation to that dinner for twenty , and had come an hour too early . You may guess why lie came so early . Engaged ? No , he was n't engaged : that was the trouble . He was a farmer , and probably well enough off to have given it up , but he loved farming and everything about it : the sounds of it , even the smells of it , and the feel of the weather that blessed it or threatened it , blowing over the fields that he knew , till they turned mysterious at evening . And a farmer was n't quite good enough for Alice , and he would n't work at anything else . So that was the trouble , all made of course by their etiquette , like all their other troubles . He was for letting the seafarers stop to dinner ; but , as he had barely got there himself , you may imagine that his opinion had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of forbearance in letting him express it at all . If they had been allowed to vote it would have been three to one against doing what Sam did , but Sam got his way . I could see that , as I came into the room ; their conference was just at an end and I could see that Sam had won . If those sherries I had administered had had anything to do with it I am sorry . Well , almost on my heels , in walked the two old fellows . They had left their great chest in the hall or outside the house . They were called Bill and Joe . I got that from the few and brief remarks that the family made to them , and gathered then that Sam and the rest did not know what their surnames were , or they would have used them in all formality . " ' Why there be Miss Alice , ' said Bill as he entered the room . ' Grown . Ai n't she ? ' he said to Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' And Master John , ' said Bill . " And Master Sam , ' said Joe quickly , under the frightfully mistaken notion that Sam would be hurt at not being greeted as soon as his brother . " ' And the old un ? ' said Bill turning to Sam . " Something in the frigidity of Sam 's answer showed Bill that Sam did n't like his father being inquired for in that way . Not old to us of course , ' Bill added ; ' but we 're all old to you young folk . ' " ' Like Methuselah , ' put in Joe . " I tried to laugh at Joe 's pleasantry , as nobody else did . You ought to laugh at jokes that are n't funny ; the others can look after themselves . But I could n't do it . The damp chill of the welcome of the old seamen was too much for a laugh to live in , " And then Alice introduced to them young Ned Boleby . Bill turned to Joe and winked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting the two men down to eat at a party that they had made up their minds must be as smart as a reverence for smartness , and plenty of money , could make it . There were certainly difficulties in the situation . " Then in walked Pursker with his old gray mustache . I can see him still , against the background of his family 's disapproval , like a ghost in the damp . He was obviously glad to see Bill and Joe again , as they were to see him , but he clearly could not deal with the situation . " And then Alice and her young man and John closed in on old Pursker and me , while Sam with the kind of ality. said . o wn. an- .

" The earliest guests arriving must have met those men in the drive , but it is one thing to see that class of man in the grounds of a nice house , and quite another to see them sitting beside you at dinner . And those two never came in . I had heard the grunt of their old sea-chest going grumblin g away down the drive , as I prepared to leave myself , but nobody seems to have heard it in the drawing-r oom . Pursker and Mrs. Pursker wore a look on their faces such as you see on the faces of rabbits clown in a burrow when a ferret is loose outside . No , I forgot ; you 've not had the opportu nity of being there ; but you know what I mean . Sam , I suppose , wore a look of quiet satisfac tion , probabl y all through dinner , but nobody knew quite what had happene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the guests began to arrive . " I was n't at the dinner . I gathere d that the uneasin ess weighin g down upon host and hostess affected the whole party , which is odd when you think that they must all have been feeling a fear of which their reason said never a word . But there it was . After the ladies had gone to the draw-ing-roo m , but I think before the men joined them , Sam found some opportunity to get his father out of the room ( I do n't know how he manage d it ) to tell him the news that he could keep to himself no longer , the news that by an extraordin arily clever document that he had drawn up himself and persuade d the two men to sign , all avenues to blackma il were closed and the seamen were gone forever . He seems to have waited for his father to praise him , and he waited a long time , while the old man never spoke . " At last he said , ' Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . ' " And after a while old Pursker began to speak . " Do you know that it takes ten thousand a year to run this place as we run it ? ' " ' Well , you 've got it , have n't you ? ' said Sam . " ' I had it last year . And for many years , ' answere d Pursker . Do you know how it comes ? ' " ' From the Bank , I suppose , ' Sam answered . " ' No , ' said Purske r . " ' Well , tell me , ' said Sam . " ' In that box . ' " ' In that box ? ' " ' Yes , that box that they always bring with them . ' " ' That old sea-che st ? ' said Sam . " ' It 's full of gold pieces , ' said his father , Tull to the brim . As large round , ' and he very nearly sobbed as he said it , ' as large round as oyster-sh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bit , such as that the two seafarers had no known address , but came and went like the swallows . That was the old man 's contribu tion to the discussion , while the young man had to contribute as his share the certaint y that the two old fellows would never come again . He had made about as sure of that as any man can make sure of anythin g , and had been taking credit for the thorough ness of his foresight for about an hour and a half . A little while after that , when the guests were gone , there had been a family conclave , and the skeleton walked out of the cupboar d ; and within a week or so the cupboar d collapse d after it . I mean all the ceremoni ous pomposit y , the fashion and all the rest of it , that had conceale d the skeleton disappear ed when it rattled its bones for the first time before the eyes of Mrs. Pursker and her three children . And the skeleton was simply this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had not only been a friend and contemporary of Bill and Joe , but a colleague and a collaborator . " I do n't think Mrs. Pursker had realized it at first . As far as I can make out , she did not in the least understand until Mr. Pursker uttered one remark that made the whole thing ruthlessly clear , and she saw the situation with one shock all in a moment . ' I used to chew tobacco , ' he said . " In the silence that followed that he had explained how he saved up his money , while others spent theirs on drink , till he had five hundred pounds ; and how Bill and Joe and another man had a talc of buried treasure , and used to whisper and plan about it , and it was the guiding star of their fives . And it was true : it was there . Of course they would n't say where . They could n't ; they were bound by oath . And Pursker had believed in them and backed them with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until Jack Smith had died and then he had a third . Bill and Joe used to bring away as much as two men could manage , without letting any other man into it , on mules once a year . And ten thousand pounds ' worth of these great Spanish gold pieces was Pursker 's share . Now it was gone . " " And had he nothing invested ? " said Malken . " Hardly anything , " Jorkens replied . " The buried treasure was his investment . He knew there was plenty of it , and it was all arranged that when Bill or Joe died he should come into his share too . I forget which . One of them had dependents of his own and the other had n't . Anyhow Pursker felt he was well provided for . " Malken snorted at that sort of financial method , and Jorkens continued , " And they 'd a curious arrangement that I 'll tell you about later , whereby Jack Smith had had one clue as to where the place was , and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third clue , of little value in itself and meaning nothing to anyone that might steal it , only of value to the rightful heir ; that is to say to the man that had the other two clues . As a matter of fact this clue of Bill and Joe was never found by anyone . " " More sense in that , " said Malken . " That 's like three men having each a key to a safe , that will only unlock with all three . " " Exactly , " said Jorkens . " The first clue Pursker remembered , but seemed to have little use for . It was lying about the house somewhere , like one of those keys of old boxes one never uses . The second had to be sought for ; and the third , which there was no finding , had to he hammered out afresh by human wits . But they had no thought of clues for the next two weeks . I often went to see them : it was the least I could do after all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might be some use . But I could n't be . The whole house was like a camp in a dust-storm . Everything upside down and , in addition to that , every one of them in the other 's way and all tumbling over boxes and drifting pieces of furniture . It was a mournful sight . There 's a time to sell and a way of selling nice furniture and good pictures , and there 's a way of selling houses too . They sold at the wrong time and in the wrong way . They got only twenty-five thousand for everything , including their bit of land . Five per cent went to the auctioneer , and Pursker owed a few thousand , as lie well might , expecting his dividend of ten thousand when he did . Then there were taxes . He barely invested eighteen thousand , at four per cent , which was all you could get in those days without speculation . With taxes again , that brought him little more than six hundred a year . He may have had two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that all went in pensions and other commitments to his workmen and various dependents . I think he gave fifty pounds a year each to the boys , a hundred a year to his wife , for herself and Alice , and four hundred a year was all he had left to keep him for the rest of his life . On this they took a house somewhere in Sydenham ; I need n't say it was small . " It was not till they settled into their dingy house that I could get them to listen to any advice from me  --  they were too busy falling with their shattered fortunes . But when they 'd been there a few days I came and advised them . Well , I 'll admit that my theories all turned out to be wrong , so that the advice I gave may not in a way have been valuable . But I often think that when someone 's advising a family it stimulates their own wits , and at any rate they like to think that somebody 's taking trouble about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furskers . Or perhaps I should say Ned Boleby , for the Put skers ' wits seemed still to remain numb after weeks . It was Ned who began to have theories to set against mine . I like to think that his ideas might not have come to him if I had not started him off with mine , even though mine might not have turned out to be of any use in themselves . In fact they were n't . " Ned Boleby was no better off than he was before . They had had their lesson , and given up etiquette and all that stuff , but they wanted to save one thing out of the wreck , and that was to see Alice do well for herself , and they thought the young farmer had not quite enough for her . If they could have given him something , to make it enough , they would have ; but they had n't got it now . So he was just where he was before . It was an odd line for them to take up , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hope that old Pursker had left was to see his daughter free of all the worries that he was beginning to detect hovering over four hundred a year . Boleby probably made a clear five hundred . " Now Boleby from the start of this new life of the Purskers had large and thriving hopes , and it was he who first made Pursker find his clue to the place of the treasure . This Pursker with some difficulty did , and brought it to the new house with him . It was a photograph of a man , apparently an Englishman ( at any rate the cut of his breeches and the leggings he wore looked familiar ) , standing with folded arms , and legs rather wide apart , on the top of a low ridge in what was evidently a desert , and there was a cross marked on the ground in ink at his feet . His face too was familiar enough ; you would have said a minor clerk in an English bank , having his holiday , except for that rather odd attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide legs , the folded arms , and the head sunk forward as though he brooded alone , but for the cheery face that rather suggested cricket than lonely contemplation . Boleby got the thing enlarged and hung up in the drawing-room , and it was there that I first saw it , over the mantelpiece . It was n't much good , for the desert was utterly featureless , a fiat expanse with a man standing in it , and nothing special about the man ; but there could n't be much doubt that the cross marked the place of the treasure , and that seemed some sort of comfort , though there was no possible way of seeing where that was , except that it was in a desert . One could n't even tell which desert . " Well , while Boleby only got them to hang the enlargement up so as to have something to turn their hopes to every day , and to keep their spirits from falling as low as their fortunes , he him-self was constantly studying it ; and if there 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have located the desert , but unfortunately there was nothing , for the bit of a ridge the man stood on could n't be called a feature . So one day he said , ' We must get hold of the other clue . The one Jack Smith had ? " It was very difficult to get anything out of Pursker . ' What was Jack Smith 's address ? ' Boleby asked him . " ' He 's dead , ' said Pursker . " ' Yes , I know , ' said Boleby , ' but where used he to live ? ' " ' I do n't know , ' said Pursker . " And yet it turned out that Pursker had a letter from him . " ' When you had his share , ' said Boleby , ' you should have had his clue . ' " ' I think his landlady kept his papers , ' said Pursker listlessly . " Well , the address on the letter was a lodging house in Swanley . And off went Boleby , leaving a light like hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was that Boleby found it . He came back in about a week with a square of paper exactly the same size as the one with the photograph , and a cross marked on the paper in the same spot as in the photograph , only the paper was otherwise perfectly blank . But on the back was clearly written J.N. 5.11.12.5.23.12.432 ' Treasure at X. Dig 3 ' . That was the second clue . " From the look in the gray eyes of Alice when Ned Boleby came with the clue you would have thought that it was the only clue they needed , the only key to the safe , as you put it , Malken . But it was one of three , and they had only two , and this one was pretty rusty , for unless their wits could polish it up a bit , it had no meaning at all . I was there when he came and I was the first to look at it . It evidently referred tothe photograph : we made quite sure of that by placing one over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went right through the center of the cross on each . I said at first that the N stood for North , and 5 and I I for the latitude and the longitude . The mark after the 12 I took for an inverted comma , meaning that they were quoting somebody ; and I certainly took too many of the numbers as being suggestions for digging . Well , I wo n't trouble you with my theories , because , as I told you , they turned out to be wrong , yet I hope they had their uses . It should not be forgotten how much the loser contributes to almost any game . And I may add that my suggestions were much better than any the Purskers made . It was only Boleby that showed an uncanny knack of getting hold of the sense of it . Even now , when I know what it means , I often wonder how he ever made head or tail of it ; and he would n't have if it had n't been for one mark . It was that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously 3 feet , ' he said . And we all agreed . " ' Then the little mark after the 12 ' ( which was not very clear ) ' must mean feet as well , ' said Boleby . And from that he went on , going backward . Getting the 12 feet , sort of uncovered the next bunch of numbers . ' 23.12.4 is a date , ' he said . ' The 23rd of December , 1904 . ' And from dates , after a little talk , he came to time . ' 12.5 is the hour , ' he said , ' the hour that the photograph was taken . And the 12 feet would be the distance from the camera , which , as one can see , is about what it is . ' " ' But what 's J.N. ? ' said Sam , a bit jealous of the speed with which Boleby was getting on . " ' The initials of the man in the photograph , ' said Boleby at once . ' We do n't know who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't suppose he mattered very much . We 've no record of a fifth man in it , so I doubt very much if they ever let him know that he was standing over the treasure , or that there was any treasure at all . ' " ' Then what 's he there for ? ' said Sam . " ' As a mark , ' said Boleby . " ' But unless he 's standing there still , ' said Sam , ' what 's the use of a mark in a perfectly flat desert ? ' " There was no answering that , and if Sam had been contented with the last word he 'd have scored , as he intended to , but he must needs blurt out , ' And what 's 5.11 ? ' " Boleby had n't thought of that , but now it was obviously J.N. 's height , as he told Sam at once , and that made him surer than ever that J.N. was a mark , though it was long before he guessed what on earth was the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that and turned over for long in my mind what the two clues seemed to be saying , and I could only make it out that they said , If you put a five-foot-eleven man with his feet apart in a desert at 12.5 p.m. ( for there 'd be no sunlight at 12.5 a.m. ) the treasure will be between his feet , three feet down . The Purskers had given up hope again , and there seemed to me nothing to be got out of it , but Boleby kept on . " I went back to see them next day , more to see if they were getting over their hopelessness than from any idea that there was anything more to be done towards getting a sight of their treasure . And I had n't been there long when Ned Boleby came bursting into the room in which all the family were , with me trying to cheer them up ; he 'd been sitting up half the night and was full of ideas , " ' Look here , ' he said as he came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he held out the original photograph , a little thing of five inches byfour . ' What time of year would you say that was ? ' " I glanced at it . ' Why , midsummer , ' I said . " ' And the date ? ' he said . " ' Why , yes , ' I said , ' December . You 've got the date wrong . ' " Without taking any notice of my remark , he spun round and asked for an atlas , and Alice got him one and he opened it and found a map of the world , a Mercator 's projection . Then he made some charcoal for himself by burning the end of a pencil . ' I 've narrowed it down a bit , ' he said . ' It 's not in Russia , ' and he began to blacken Russia out . " But what are you messing the map for ? ' said Sam . " ' And it 's not in China , ' he said , and he blackened out China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . And they seemed to believe him , and a gleam came to the wan faces of the old couple . " ' And it 's not in the United States of America , ' he added , ' or Canada . ' " But why ? Why ? ' asked Mrs. Pursker . " ' Because it 's not in the Northern Hemisphere at all , ' said Boleby . ' Look at that shadow . ' " And we all looked up at the enlargement over the mantelpiece where the shadow of the young man standing with folded arms was as squat as a shadow can be . ' And look at the date , ' he said . ' That must be very nearly under the sun when it 's vertical , and where 's the sun in December ? Why down along the tropic of Capricorn . ' " ' Why , that 's so , ' I said . " And then he began to blacken out the whole south of the world and a bit along the equator , until only a strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand miles wide , with the dotted line of Capricorn running along the middle of it , and most of it was over the sea . ' And we 'll narrow clown that belt a lot , ' he said , ' when we get scientific assistance . ' " Pursker looked merely dazed but , from then on , hope began to come back to that family . It showed itself by a flood of talk . A bright suggestion had brought back hope to them ; and they all poured out a flood of suggestions . Not that any of them were of any use ; but the talk was bright , almost feverish . There was no real use in narrowing it down to a belt across the world when all you had to guide you was a sandy ridge of rock on which the bank clerk was standing , a ridge in no way different from millions of others and with no landmark whatever to locate it . Boleby admitted all this , but they clung to their new hope . ' No , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are large deserts like this in South America . Capricorn passes through a fairly narrow part of South Africa ; we might search that in five years . But the whole width of Australia beats us ; and most of it desert , I fancy , where Capricorn goes . ' " ' Could n't we try ? ' said Alice . " ' Absolutely hopeless , ' said Boleby . ' You would n't notice that ridge at three hundred yards . Have you nothing more of Jack Smith 's except that one letter that said nothing ? ' " ' He gave Father a book once , ' said Sam . " ' What kind of book ? ' Boleby asked him . " ' A hook of poetry , I think , ' said Sam . ' He read poetry . ' " ' Let 's see it , ' said Boleby . " Even now Sam showed a trace of some sort of scorn as he went to get the book , and returned with it smiling and gave it to Boleby . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pursker before he died . With all of them watching him , Boleby had to open the pages , now that he had sent for the book . He turned them over , trying to conceal the futility of it , andfound nothing of any use ; when , turning the pages as the left thumb turns them , he came to the first page of all . And there was an inscription in the hand of Jack Smith : ' I met a traveler from an antique land . ' That was all . At first Boleby read it to himself , then mumbled it partly aloud , and still saw nothing . " And suddenly he shouted , ' I have it ! ' " They all looked up expectant . " ' An antique land , ' he shouted . " ' Egypt , ' I said at once . And , mind you , Egypt for certain 's the setting of Shelley 's sonnet . " ' No , ' he said . " ' It could n't very well have been anywhere else , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? ' he asked me . " ' About a colossus , ' said I. " ' And that 's what we 've got to look for , ' said Boleby . ' It knocks out the whole of Australia . Nobody ever built in that size there until we went there and we do n't build colossi . It 's in Africa , not far from the line of Capricorn , and we ought to be able to find it . ' " ' But why ? Why ? ' urged everyone . " And Sam said , ' A mere quotation from Shelley does n't prove it . ' " ' Prove it ! No , ' said Boleby . ' It is n't proof ; it 's a hint . ' " ' I ca n't see what it hints , ' Sam went on . " ' Look at that attitude , ' said Boleby , pointing toward the photograph . " ' Napoleon , ' said somebody . " ' Well , and look at the face , ' went on Boleby . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , why was that sort of man striking that attitude ? ' Boleby asked us , and went on , To fit in . And against what ? Do n't you see now ? There is a featureless desert with a man in it . And a photograph of it is treasured to mark an incredibly valuable site . As you can see nothing at all to distinguish it from any other arid part of the earth when the man 's there , the identifying feature must be behind him . But I could n't think what . Now it 's as clear as daylight . The treasure is where a man of five-fonteleven exactly conceals the colossus , limb for limb . ' Sam whistled . ' It must be rather Iike the colossus of Rhodes , ' Boleby continued , ' for you see how the man is standing . You see how he has even taken his hat off to get the head right , pretty dangerous in that sun . It 's probably some vast thing . Probably the whole desert is dominated by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where twelve feet away from a five-foot-eleven man on a ridge , and looking towards the colossus , you can see nothing at all , and of course with nothing of the man left over ; for his odd attitude would be meaningless if he was not exactly eclipsing the figure , with nothing to spare . ' " ' And how do you know which side of the colossus he is ? ' said Pursker , beginning to believe in it all , yet hardly daring yet to think it quite true . " ' By the way the shadow goes , such as it is , ' said Boleby . " And we looked up and could just distinguish that the squat shadow was coming toward you , and if anything a little towards the right . " And Boleby went on , ' Well , a thing like that should be easy enough to find . Anyone within thirty miles of it should have heard of it ; so that even if we had to go right across Africa we should leave a strip of sixty miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we could say for certain that the colossus was not , if we met nobody who had heard of it . The journey back would make it a hundred and twenty ; do the double journey again , and we should have about covered the strip along which a shadow could look anything like that at noon in December . ' " They were gazing at him in silence . " ' Cost a bit , ' I said . " ' But we sha n't have to go right across , ' said Boleby . ' Remember that this treasure is a sailor 's yarn , and the odds are that it 's under a hundred miles from the coast . Well , what do you think of it ? ' he said to me . ' Sounds to me like wedding bells , ' I said . " And sure enough it was . Ned Boleby and Alice were married within the year ; and within the year the whole family were back at their old place , giving larger dinner parties than ever , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened . I never knew for certain that it was in Africa at all . You see , it all depends on whether there are any deserts to be found in South America . And then it might be an island ; but precious few besides Madagascar ; the tropic of Capricorn is almost all in the water . " Of course I never dreamed of going to see for myself : too many people there before me . " I asked Alice about it once when I met her , very smart , but , I will say , very happy , at the opening day of the Royal Academy . I chose a fleeting moment while nobody was in ear-shot and said , ' Where was Ozymandias ? ' You remember the big boy of Shelley 's sonnet . " And she said , ' What with this and Ascot and Goodwood , and dining out so much , and then the garden parties , and one thing and another . . " ' Yes , I know , ' I said , for hundreds of yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wanted to hear while we could n't be overheard . But where was the treasure ? ' " ' Papa and the boys , ' she said , ' were really so busy that they never found time to go . ' " I think Alice might have trusted me . " Oh , well . Let 's forget her . Waiter ! " COLLECTIVISM AND HUMAN NATURE BY CARL DREHER T HE classic argument of capitalist apologists against socialism is that it conflicts with human nature . Such venerable platitudes ( the progenitor of this one is Horace 's observation that human nature can not be thrown out with a pitchfork ) usually contain a certain amount of truth . What the conservatives ignore when they allege the incapacity of human nature for adjustment to any form of economic organization other than private capitalism is that human beings are unchangeable in one fundamental characteristic : whatever else they desire , they want to eat three times a day , and preferably to eat well . No way is likely to be found to persuade men to adjust themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the attempt . If machine technology , plus the profit system , spells progressively increasing privation for the masses  --  and it seems all too likely that at best it can provide bare subsistence for large numbers  --  then human nature will somehow adapt itself to another economic scheme , in spite of the ululations of anxious bankers , university presidents , and editorial writers . The capitalist-Calvinist view of human character has this pertinency , however : whether we shall ultimately have to resort to collectivism to keep ourselves alive and , if so , the imminence of the change , the length and nature of the transition , and the end attained will all depend to some extent on the nature of the human beings in-volved . " Collectivism " as here used does not necessarily mean socialism or communism . Fascism is a fraudulent simulation of collectivism applied to the minds and bodies of men , exempting only the large property owners from its tyranny . Although financed and organized in the interest of this group , it requires support from the much larger middle class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Germany , for example , are of great interest to radicals and reactionaries alike . Without a remarkable instinct for mob orientation , the Nazis could not have achieved such feats as elevating Horst Wessel to the pedestal of a national hero ; perverting the word " socialism " into a shield for capitalist repression , and making arson a device of statecraft . And what has been accomplished in one place may be brought about in others . Other countries too have their potential storm-troopers who , for three meals a day , a uniform , and a seat in the circus tent , will bayonet their own brothers before being themselves driven to the shambles . The capitalist connoisseurs of human nature are not unacquainted with this phase of the subject . In the United States , as in Europe , they may soon turn their knowledge to practical account . The following from an editorial in the Los Angeles Times is an indication of what we may expect : This strike one of pea-pickers in the Imperial Valley , like its predecessor disturb-    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
