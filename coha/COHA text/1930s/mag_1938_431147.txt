 | Assignment in Utopia IF ANYONE ever went to Russia with an earnest determination to dig down to the hard , enduring core of a great event in human history , it was I. And in accepting a job from the capitalistic United Press I was not deserting Communism . I was taking rather a post of strategic importance in the further service of the cause . The farewell party given by my friends included the cream of New York 's Communists . They were sending off one of their own to spread the gospel . Thus on December 31 , 1927 , I sailed with my wife and our small daughter for the land of our dreams . Although we were thrilled to be where the hammer and sickle - symbols of the brotherhood of man - were installed in authority , our first few weeks there were filled with disturbing incidents . Soon after we arrived , my Russian secretary steered me to the Foreign Office building . I was known to the authorities as a " friendly " correspondent , but I had to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit - a propusk : the word that looms gigantic on Russia 's horizon . It allowed me to enter the musty old building and meet the censors , who were to be a focal point of my existence during the next six years . On the way back to our hotel I stopped to lace my shoe . Instantly two soldiers with fixed bayonets rushed at me . My secretary 's hurried explanations saved me from serious trouble . It appeared that I had paused in front of GPU headquarters , a procedure fraught with danger . Later I learned that many Muscovites made a detour to avoid passing that segment of innocent-looking sidewalk . Thus , among my first impressions of Moscow were : a special permit to enter a public building ; alarmed soldiers if you paused at the wrong spot on the sidewalk . That sense of being in a city closely guarded was to recur time and again during my long residence in Russia . Our chief personal problem was to find a permanent place to live . Moscow , with accommodations for i , ooo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands more seeking work and opportunity poured in every day .  | Flats intended for one family now contained half a dozen . People married and divorced , lied and denounced their neighbors for a little space . For a down payment of Psoo plus rental thereafter we were allowed to move into half of a former stable . The other half was occupied by a Soviet bookkeeper , his slovenly wife and a brood of snot-nosed children . We shared a kitchen , an improvised bath and hordes of vermin . Our neighbors refused to use the toilet bowl as modern science intended , preferring to squat on it in traditional Asiatic fashion . The bathtub we finally found and installed seemed to them the most natural place for the disposal of garbage . But we could overlook these disturbing conditions . A communist sympathizer arriving in Russia is in a curiously hectic state of mind . Lowly facts are disregarded ; his head is in the soaring clouds of a new world in the making . Through such an emotional haze I viewed the new Bolshevik scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be misunderstood by infidels abroad was carefully turned into one more proof of revolutionary courage . Murmurs from Beknd the Scenes HAT FIRST winter was exceptionally bitter . Waiting on queues for bread and other necessities was agonizing , and everywhere the ragged lines stretched from shop doors . Private trade was being shut off before the government could replace it . Manufactured articles were scarce ; food was getting scarcer . The peasants regarded as outright confiscation the official plans for purchasing grain at government prices , and refused to grow food for the cities . From all sections of the country came reports of grain agents being assaulted and murdered . In retaliation , Red troops summarily executed batches of " kulaks . " A gigantic struggle between an organized state and some hundred million of its citizens was in the making . And in the cities the bread lines grew longer and more sullen . Spring brought flocks of sympathetic American tourists and labor delegations , twittering excitedly of creches , museums and model factories . They looked at everything with the hypnotized eyes of lovers and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle going on behind the scenes of the greatest show on earth . At the May Day parade they thrilled to the mass display of military strength . Newsreels have made this drama familiar to the world : battalions of tanks and airplanes , immense quadrangles of Red soldiers taking the oath of fealty , hours-long floods of work-  | ers under banners . These gigantic Soviet parades have been mistakenly described as exhibitions of popular enthusiasm . Nothing can be further from the truth . They are merely demonstrations of the government 's disciplined strength . I saw New York go wild with fervor in welcoming the Armistice and later in greeting Lindbergh . Those were great tides of spontaneous emotion . But in a Moscow demonstration the tides are on leash and the leash is in the grip of a small group . A million men and women in battalions , meekly waiting their turn for hours for the duty of passing before one leader , holding aloft slogans dictated by the ruling group - that is not a spontaneous expression of public opinion but a review of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i did not raise any such quibbles . As far as I was concerned the demonstration came from the hearts of the masses and mv heart rcsponded. @# My First Demonstration Trial ON THE MORNING Of May 18 , 19,28 , a crowd in festival spirit milled around the House of Trade Unions - a crowd come to see a righteous hanging . Fifty-three technicians from the coal industry were to be tried publicly on charges of counter-revolutionary sabotage ; the first of the melodramatic " dem- onstration trials " so puzzling to the outside world . The tightening pinch of goods and food shortage was making the people grumble with pain , . and now the government was giving them a tangible object for their hatred . For months propaganda had been building up a dark picture of enemies within conniving with enemies abroad , cutting production and taking food from the hungering masses . Week after week the press , radio , newsreels , billboards , had waved the promise of traitors ' deaths aloft like crimson flags . The charges would not be proved - that had presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases confessions had been obtained behind closed doors by the GPU . At the trial the guilt would merely be " demonstrated " as theatrically as a powerful government could manage . A new audience attended every session : deserving factory workers , school children , visiting peasant groups . Thus more than Ioo , - 00o had a peep at the spectacle . Big thrills were provided by the few prisoners who , panic-stricken , blundering , tangling themselves deeper like insects in fly-paper , insisted upon their innocence or tried to withdraw their confessions . " Last night , " protested one , " I signed a confession of my guilt as well as the guilt of others . . . . " The courtroom was electrified by  | an unearthly shriek , like the cry of a wounded animal : " Kolya , " the prisoner 's wife cried , " Kolya , darling , do n't lie . You know you are innocent ! " The prisoner collapsed into a chair as though the cry had been a hammer-blow on his head , weeping aloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A shudder passed like a wind through the tight-packed auditorium . Hurriedly the prisoner was led away , wailing his despair , protesting his innocence . To witness scenes like that was , indeed , keen sport : lucky proletarians who drew such a session ! One day a prisoner was missing . His counsel explained that he , unfortunately , was suffering from hallucinations and had been placed in a padded cell , where he screamed about rifles pointed at his heart . The vision of this prisoner howling in his padded cell was a sinister element that deepened with every passing day . Every so often some casual incident would thus light up the depths . Sometimes these flashes left us limp with the impact of horrors half-glimpsed . What had transpired in GPU dungeons and interrogation chambers in the months since these men were rounded up ? The citations of specific acts were trifling in relation to the grandiose international plot alleged . A turbine that went wrong . A mechanized mine which in some- J11 Russia was brutally trans- one 's opinion should not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of important and unimpeachable testimony - an intercepted letter perhaps , a statement that did not carry the suspicion of GPU extortion . I was convinced that the trial was a hoax on the Russian people , offered as a lightning rod to divert their resentments . I was even able to justify it to myself for what it was : a court-martial in the midst of a strenuous social war , where ordinary notions of justice must be suspended . What were the lives and the liberty of a few dozen men against the interests of the revolution ? The larger justice of Historical Necessity was being served . My belief that the whole Soviet population was accepting the official version of the trial was quickly shattered . In a guarded phrase , a politically off-color joke , people betrayed their doubts . And the trial 's ultimate effect upon leadership in all industries was disastrous . Executives began to avoid responsibility as if it were the plague . Why undertake anything if failure might be construed , by the small , ruthless group in power , as sabotage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five Year Plan formed into a crucible in which  | men and metals were melted down and reshaped in a cruel heat , with small regard for the human slag . Economic difficulties were piling up dangerously ; the peasants were rebelling more boldly against feeding the urban population and the armies , in return for rubles which could buy nothing . Millions of grumbling mouths had to be either filled with food or shut by force . The Plan began unobtrusively . There had been the usual meeting of the I zik , or Central Executive Committee of the nation . Most of the members were simple workers , peasants and provincial officials . Many of them had only learned to read in the last year or two . Their function was to listen , applaud and return home , conveying the wishes , threats and promises of the dictatorship to the masses . Their legislative powers , except on paper , were limited to raising hands for unanimous approval of whatever was submitted by the government . I watched a peasant woman , dull-eyed and rather scared , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her country . She represented perhaps a quarter of a million peasants like herself . The effort of listening at last became too much : her strained expression relaxed ; she took out a penknife and pared her nails , smiling at her own thoughts , as the Premier unrolled a few more billions ' worth of plans . Two young legislators , a boy and girl , thinking themselves unobserved , held hands and looked into one another 's eyes as the intricacies of the agrarian program were expounded to them . Under such conditions a fiveyear plan of agrarian socialization was voted and a five-year plan of industrialization . The details were left to the Moscow authorities to work out . Life Is Regimented First there had to be a cleansing of Party ranks , for the Plan 's operation depended upon the driving of inert , sullen millions by an exalted minority of a few thousand . This chistka , the expulsion of Party members for heretical thoughts , was retroactive , punishing people for views they had expressed in former years when open controversy was permitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper classes , merchants , priests , had adjusted themselves to the new system . Now , 1,2 years after the revolution , they were pried out of their crevices and stepped on without pity . They became lisbentsi , disfranchised people , without rights . They could not work in government enterprises , except in the lowest categories of unskilled labor . When food rationing was shortly introduced they were denied cards ;  | when dwelling space again became scarce they were ejected from their homes . The number of these pariahs came to millions . Suicide and undernourishment decifnated their ranks . Only Hitler 's treatment of the Jews has given tile world a similar systematic persecution of a large class of the population . During the Plan the outside world was made to see Russia as a beehive of enthusiastic activity , where men labored and sacrificed in a spirit of fanatical self-abnegation . Yet the ordinary Russian was less interested in the fine promises of the plans than in his hope for finding another herring , another pound of potatoes . I saw men and women risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their infants . The enthusiasm , the ruthless will to succeed , was at the top . Below was naked want and desperation . The bitter clandestine political jokes of the day reflected this.You asked someone , " How are you getting on ? " and he replied , " Better than tomorrow " ; or " Like Lenin in his mausoleum - they neither feed us nor bury us . " The food shortage was seriously aggravated by the Kremlin 's decision to meet foreign trade obligations with food exports . As conditions became steadily worse , the knowledge that their government *its exporting food became perhaps the deepest of the silent grievances of the Soviet people . In its first years the revolution had been warmly personal , aware of suffering , even in its most brutal moments . Now it had become as empty of real human content as a flood ; it was something decreed from above , unrelated to the wishes of those upon whom it operated , and the population as a whole accepted it helplessly as a natural calamity . The trade unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - became mere bureaus for regimenting the workers . I watched the tightening control from above with growing misgivings . Whatever the formal justification , it removed the workers further from the dictatorship exercised in their name and stripped them more thoroughly of their personal rights . The last pretense that the workers owned the state was dropped - the state frankly owned the workers . Even though a new world was in the making , questions pounded ever more insistently on my conscience . I saw a handful of men in the Kremlin dooming , without hesitation , millions to extinction and tens of millions to inhuman wretchedness in the mystical delusion of their divine mission . Anyone who decided to torture one person for the good of the victim 's unborn great-grandchildren would be judged insane . Is he any less insane when he tortures and ex-  | terminates millions for the good of their unborn posterity ? Surely , the misery of existing millions is more important than the hypothetical bliss of future generations . The sheer scale of Russian events staggered the imagination . Death sentences were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand . In estimating the immediate effects of new policies the normal Kremlin unit of calculation was I , ooo , ooo families . I came to visualize the Russian population as a huge anthill , with Stalin poking a stick into its center . Every casual prodding destroyed the contours of life for a few more million of the insects . And I was coming to see the process from the ant 's lowly point of view , rather than from Stalin 's . The first ' two years of my assignment in Utopia had taken the starch out of my Soviet enthusiasms . I still retained most of them but they were wilted . Despite my zeal for the building of a new world , fundamental doubts were rising to the surface of my consciousness . The Peasants Are Conquered In 12 years of revolution less than two percent of the peasants had been collectivized . Now , it was ordained that one half must be quickly herded into collectives . Additional soldiers and bloodhounds were placed at the frontiers to stop the wild scramble of frightened peasants out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cities . My dispatches during these months spoke of the remarkable " success " of the collectivization policies . It was an open secret that these " successes " were based upon force . On December 27 , 1929 , Stalin called for the " liquidation of the kulaks as a class " - an imperious command to smash and disperse between five and ten million peasant men , women and children as quickly and rapaciously as possible . Hell broke loose in 70,000 Russian villages . The pent-up jealousies of a generation , the sadistic instincts of self-important little officials were unleashed and whipped into fury . Before the revolution a kulak was a wealthy peasant who possessed economic power over his poorer neighbors . Now the term covered any peasant who failed to apply for membership in a collective . A population as large as all Switzerland or Denmark was stripped clean of all belongings , herded with bayonets into cattle cars and dumped weeks later in the lumber regions of the frozen North , the deserts of Central Asia - wherever labor was needed . Tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while being transported . Locomotives dragged their loads of agony  | from every part of the nation and when the human debris had been emptied into forest or desert , jogged hack for more . I saw batches of the victims at provincial railroad points , under GPL ' guards , like bewildered animals , staring vacantly into space . These meek , bedraggled , workworn creatures were scarcely the fat , plutocratic kulaks of the propaganda posters . It was distinctly " unfriendly " for a correspondent to describe these events , so the world at large was scarcely aware of what was occurring in Russia . My devotion to Historical Necessity could no longer stomach this piled-up cruelty . I was aware that this destruction and suffer .. ing had been artificially whipped up , could be stopped by a word of command from one man . It was as if , in the midst of some terrible volcanic eruption , one were to catch sight of someone turning the crank that kept the hot lava pouring over men and towns . By March 2 , 6o percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called off the terror , just as a few months earlier he had turned it on : a faucet opened . and closed at will . This however could not restore the dead and patch together millions of shattered homes . t every important construction job , hordes of liquidated kulaks were put to work on breadand-water rations to cut logs and dig canals and build roads . An employer with a big job to do - the state - now had a vast supply of cheap and frightened workers . The concentrated terror of those 65 days marked a frontier in my thinking and feeling . For two years I had been building an intricate structure of justifications for the Soviet regime . Now the color and strength had run out of the symbols of the faith for me ; the socialist songs and slogans , the brave revolutionary promises of a better world now seemed touched with mockery . The Government " Re-Taxes " Its Citizens OF ALL the enormities contrived in the haloed name of socialism , the most singular , perhaps , was a decree offering generous rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained anything of value . For the government desperately needed the kind of capital it could exchange abroad for machinery , raw materials and the services of experienced engineers . The pretext for seizure was " retaxation " on past earnings . The GPU swooped down on the victims at night and made a thorough inventory of what they owned , tearing up floor boards , ripping mattresses in search of concealed money or jewels . Then the assessors had something to go by ; the  | " tax " was usually well above roo percent of the inventoried property . Informing on one 's neighbors has ever been a source of human pleasure ; now it was also a wellpaying business . Another device for raising valuta ( " real values " ) was soon developed which to this day is netting the Soviet government a handsome profit . The Kremlin announced that Russians could buy their way out of the country by paying a passport fee of soo gold rubles if they were proletarians and iooo if non-proletarians . Russians who had so much valuta hidden away did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issuance of a passport would be employed to extract it . But relatives abroad could arrange passports for Russians by paying the specified ransom . The government travel bureau , Intourist , used its offices abroad to advertise this bargain sale on ransomed Soviet citizens ; in America , particularly , they did a brisk business , thousands of Russian-Americans having tried in vain for years to bring aged or persecuted relatives out of their native land . Since the Soviet authorities determined whether an applicant was proletarian or not the number of emigrants who qualified as lowprice proletarians was very small . Moreover the deposit of the ransom was no guarantee that the hostage would be released . Anyone whose economic value was larger than rooo rubles , anyone articulate enough to prove a possible influence for anti-Soviet propaganda , was kept at home . " Gold Mining " in Torture Chambers THESE WERE open means for slaking the government 's thirst for valuta . Beyond them , talked of in whispers , was the organized extortion by the special " gold mining " department of the GPU . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is still fresh and raw on my mind , and because I realize that the reader will find it hard to believe , for no other episode in the entire history of the revolution has been so successfully hidden from the world . The human ore for GPU smelting was gathered from all classes - from servant girls with a single gold piece to former millionaires with caches of jewels - and , above all , Russians who had been receiving remittances from relatives abroad . The extortions went under the euphemism of " mobilization of hidden valuta resources " and were an unwritten adjunct of the Five Year Plan . Like any other branch of the economic apparatus , the GPU had its " control figures " : a rigid commitment to extract specific sums from the population . If a few people died of suffocation or pain , if most of the unfortunates  | were broken physically for life , if he minds of men and women snapped-well , slag and dross were to be expected from any mining operation . Those who were made to disgorge signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Five Year Plan . " All victims were warned never to mention anyone what they had seen and suffered on pain of being returned the torture chambers . When I write of tortures I use r word in its literal sense . The tire system was nicely calculated reduce the strongest men and omen , whether janitors or celebrated professors , to the common level of slobbering fear . " You just forget that you 're human , that there are still people who are not wild beasts , that somewhere once you heard of music and poetry and civilization , " one woman tried to plain it to me . Hours of actual torture were followed by periods in ugly cells where uncertainty and fear for one 's loved ones outside demoralized the prisoner . Weeks of this hi lc the " hidden valuta resources " were being " mobilized . " If physiwere torture failed to break someone , members of his family were brought in and tortured under his eyes . A routine practice was to force Soviet citizens to write to relatives aboad begging for large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually made frantic appeals for specified amounts , explaining vaguely that it was " a matter of life and death . " When the money arrived it was , of course , instantly " contributed " to the Five Year Plan . The GPU , shrewdly assuming that anyone having valuta would probably know others similarly cursed , sought to make every victim a spy . An acquaintance in Kharkov had been on the valuta rack three times at intervals of a month or two . He seemed to have grown 2o years older ; his cheeks were sunken and his hands trembled , " The first two times , " he said , " I gave them money . But the third time I had no more to give . And God knows when I will be called again . I can no longer sleep or eat or work " - he held a fairly responsible job in the food trust - " just waiting for the horror to begin again . They have offered to let me alone , but at a terrible price : to become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the Jewish community . The GPU agents in charge of this work are deeply anti-Semitic , and do their dirty work with great enjoyment . They think I can smell out who has valuta and who has rich relatives in America to be exploited . If I do that they wo n't touch me ; otherwise - back to the torture chamber . But I wo n't do it . I 'll die first . I think of nothing but suicide . If it were n't for the children . . . " I could not bring myself to be-  | lieve that the heads of the Communist Party countenanced such things . Only after the evidence piled up , year after year , was I driven to accept as horrible fact the " gold mining " of the GPU in all the ripeness of its corruption . The cruelty of the valuta tortures was without a shadow of " revolutionary necessity " : a dictatorial state merely captured its subjects secretly and bled them white . And the victims , with few exceptions , had come by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to it ! Socialist thinking had always placed human life above property . Now the Kremlin was placing property far above human life . Most of the money collected would have come into the coffers of the state anyhow sooner or later , as the owners gradually spent it in government stores . Fog of Skepticism Over Russia By THE TIME the Five Year Plan entered its final year all enthusiasm had withered in the hearts of the Russian people . When it began , the Plan had been enthusiastically pictured as a short-term investment : " We shall work hard and sacrifice for five years - then everything will be better , freer , ampler . " But now the Kremlin was calling upon its citizens to celebrate the mechanization of coal mining while a drastic reduction in fuel rations was being en- forced ; to glory in the fulfillment of the oil industry 's achievements while freezing on kerosene queues . Judiciously selected statistics might do for political window-dressing , but for the people the proof of the planned pudding was in the eating - and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet fog over Russia , soaking into the flesh and spirits of men and women . The bittersweet humor of political cynicism was filled with ribaldries about milking the tractors and mating them to provide milk and meat . The most widely repeated anecdote was the one about a naked man on a train ; when amazed passengers remonstrated , he seemed astonished . " But , comrades , " he said , " I come from Minsk where we have already completed our Five Year Plan ! " In the face of growing resentment , Draconic decrees were minted almost weekly to discipline the common workers . One of them made a single day 's absence from work punishable by loss of job , bread book and living space : tantamount to a sentence of slow death . An internal passport system far more stringent than the Czar 's was announced and is still in force . Under it a citizen is told where he must live and he can not leave that community without government sanction . When this system was installed , " undesirables " were ex-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no funds to cover the traveling expenses of their exile the code of Bolshevik firmness made it " counter-revolutionary " to mention such " private " problems . " We ca n't stop to worry about such sentimental nonsense , " communist acquaintances told me . " They 'll get there , one way or another , or they 'll blow but their brains . " Thus by the end of the Five Year Plan the proletarian had been reduced to silent obedience , with starvation as the only alternative . Ever more frequently , I heard even young Russians say , Our generation is doomed . Our children . . . perhaps . , . " Was The Five Year Plan a Success ? Mountains of statistics have YJ1 been piled up to ascertain whether the Five Year Plan " succeeded . " I have always felt the ghoulish cynicism of reducing these years of travail to arithmetic . Fine mathematical successes in agriculture had no place for the famine cadavers , liquidations , death edicts , the conquest of 100,000,000 peasants . I could not be thrilled by furnaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings who built them and worked in them . If industrialization were an end in itself ; the U.S.S.R. had an as- tonishing amount of physical property to show for its sacrifices . But the fantastic striving for bigger statistics , at whatever cost in human degradation and disjointed economy , led to such facts as these : more tractors spoiled and gathering rust than tractors in operation ; automobiles leaving the belt as " finished " products without headlights , brakes or some other vital part ; mountains of goods rotting and rusting in factory yards for lack of transportation . And all this was paid for by the masses in loss of human rights , suffering and death . The socialist dream had been emptied of human meaning , reduced to a mechanical formula of the state as a supertrust and the population as its helpless serfs . The human spirit had been mired and outraged by sadistic cruelties on a scale new in modern history- I can not forget one scene which I witnessed at a country railroad station , which was to prove more significant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in burlap coat and patched trousers , was weeping unashamedly , and pleading with the stationmaster through his sobs . The peasant was holding a large heavy sack . " You can go on the next train , yes , " the stationmaster said , not unkindly , " but not your bundle . Law is law - no bread can be transported without a license . " " But , citizen stationmaster ,  | dear one , " the old man repeated , " how can I return to the village with empty hands ? We threw our money into one pot , and they chose me to go north , where money could buy bread . I paid a fortune for what I have in this sack . Now they await my return and their bellies are empty . Citizen stationmaster , whom will it harm if I take this bag on the train ? I shall creep into a corner on the topmost shelf . " " It will do you no good , " the stationmaster said . " You would only be chucked off at the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decree forbidding the transportation of food without a license . The purpose , the papers explained dishonestly , was to prevent the overcrowding of trams . Later , as accounts of the famine in the south began to come in , I often thought of that old man in his burlap coat . A Famine Is Concealed THE SOVIET land presented a tragic picture at the beginning of the Second Five Year Plan early in 1933 . Discontent was deepening , half the country was starving , actual famine threatened the 40 , - ooo , ooo inhabitants of the Ukraine and Northern Caucasus . But admission of this fact would have seriously jeopardized the inauguration of the Second Plan . The markets of the world at the time were glutted with grain . A few million dollars spent from Russia 's gold reserves would have bought bread enough to head off the famine . A very minor diversion of money from machines to food would have saved millions of lives . But the Kremlin neither imported food nor permitted an appeal to the world 's charitable instincts . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save face for the fabled Plan . The decision made by Stalin and his underlings was as directly responsible for every bloated baby stomach , every wagonload of corpses in the following months as if they had strangled the victims with their own hands . Together with all other foreign correspondents in Russia , I had to conceal this supreme cruelty from the outside world . The government forbade us to leave Moscow . But people coming in from the famine region told of roads lined with corpses like stiff logs . Almost every peasant home in the worst districts paid a toll in life ; in hundreds of villages half the population died or fled to seek food . To insure the next harvest , Red troops guarded the seed and prevented hungry peasants from devouring the green shoots of the coming crop . As the Soviet government stopped the publication of vital statistics for the period in question , how many millions died will never be known ; but estimates made by foreigners and Russians range from three to seven millions .  | The most rigorous censorship in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was over . By then the dead had been buried and an excellent crop was being harvested . The Soviet press was exultant : socialized agriculture ad been made to yield a bumper harvest . The Kremlin had foreseen the famine and permitted it to run its course for political reasons . I as sickened by the philosophy which made such a decision possible , the mad arrogance of rulers condemning millions to death and rejoicing because the survivors could be fed . Disillusionment F NECESSITY , I remained cautious and diplomatic in my dispatches , but I stored up forbidden knowledge . From heartsore communists I learned of underground currents directed against he government , of secret antiStalin documents passed from hand hand among important officials . n America in the following years , was not surprised to find that hose told off by the Kremlin for destruction were almost all Old arty members whose sympathies ere with the early aims of the evolution , not with the ruling clique in the Kremlin .

The peasants-still the great majority in the nation - had won their land only to lose it again ; then felt themselves indentured laborers slaving for absentee landlords in the Kremlin . At the top of this misery new privileged classes had emerged , a parvenu aristocracv based on the power of life and death over their fellows . Above all , I had the sense of leaving behind me a nation trapped . Trapped physically , with bloodhounds and machine guns guarding the frontiers , with a passport system to prevent them from moving freely- inside the country .

Farewell to Utopia My LAST DAY in Moscow remains in memory with sharp-edged vividness . A day of gray light filtering through wet snow , of farewells as final as death , of pathetic farce . In the morning unexpected orders had come from above for a " spontaneous " mass parade . Few people seemed to know what triumph was to be celebrated although many thought it was in honor of the brave airmen who had gone up in a stratosphere balloon the previous day . The morning papers headlined the fact that they had set a new world 's altitude record . It was not , alas , the stratosphere flight . We foreign correspondents knew that the record-breaking flight had ended with a crash which killed all the flyers .

But this , my last parade in Russia , was a funereal and leaden-footed thing : weary men and women by the hundred thousand dragging along under soggy banners for hours through a gloomy dusk . Thus , my farewell to Utopia . The End of an Adventure in Idealism DEVELOPMENTS in the Soviet Union since my departure have confirmed the conclusions forced upon me by my six years of personal observation .

The Russian " socialism " that offers to II the bellies of its people but retains the privilege of slitting those bellies at will is retrogressive ; it cancels out ages of struggle and costly victory in the domain of the human spirit . I left Russia convinced that man 's greatest task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life . Precisely today , when such concepts are being spat upon , they must be defended from Bolshevik onslaughts no less than from fascist or capitalistic onslaughts . No plan for economic salvation can be accepted if it is diseased with disdain for life . Ultimately , the Russian experiment will be judged not by the goal of a full ' belly , but by how much freedom , self-respect , justice , truth , and human kindness it has brought into the world .
