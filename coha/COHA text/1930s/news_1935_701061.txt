txt The pound sterling took an astonishing drop of 1 franc 7 centimes today , closing at 71.77 , against a par value of 124.21 . To say that sterling 's precipitate fall has dismayed the French is putting it mildly . Nothing else is talked of in the corridors of the Chamber of Deputies , where for the first time one hears the possibility of devaluation of the franc seriously discussed . High financial circles that previously had ridiculed any idea of tampering with the franc 's parity now admit that continued fall of the pound , particularly if the dollar follows suit , will make the position of the gold bloc hopeless . It is important to note that these quarters are not taking the fall of sterling with equanimity . More than one authority with whom this correspondent talked today spoke with satisfaction of an opinion expressed in the United States that Washington would not watch the pound go down without retaliating , and it was added that if it came to a struggle for depreciation there was very little that Britain could teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion in well-informed financial circles here that if the gold bloc goes , there is not going to be any mere 16 per cent devaluation , like Czechoslovakia 's , or even 40 per cent like that of the United States , but that it will more likely start with 50 per cent and go lower if necessary . Concern Over Quick Drop . It is the suddenness of the drop in the pound that has upset the Continent . The gold bloc could adjust itself to a very gradual decline in sterling , as , in fact , it has done moderately well during the last few years , but a precipitate collapse such as seems now to have started , would call for a correspondingly swift deflation , which is economically impossible . That does not mean that the gold currencies will quickly choose devaluation . The franc certainly will not , and it is doubtful that any of the others will . But if , within a few months the pound shall have dropped to about 60 francs , Belgium and Holland , and perhaps Switzerland , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in serious straits . Under these circumstances the accusation that French attacks on the pound are causing its weakness is ridiculed here . In any case , speculative sales of pounds and withdrawals of capital through such sales could not reach important amounts , as any one who is familiar with the French market knows . Speculators who can borrow even 100,000 francs with which to gamble these days are not numerous . No French bank would lend money to play the pound short any more than would British banks . Attack Idea Minimized . Moreover , what speculative attack there is on sterling is not the cause but is the result of the pound 's weakness , it is claimed . Speculators follow such moverunts ; they do not create them . As far as is yet ascertainable , there is no heavy flow of capital from London to Paris , despite reports to the contrary . The capital all seems to be going to New York . However , informed sources here have been quick to call attention to one serious aspect of that question . It is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of Central Europe , private banks , Companies and individuals have been keeping the major part of their reserves in British securities . Should they become alarmed , as they perhaps are commencing to be , and start liquidating , the consequences could be dangerous . Today again the dollar could not keep pace with the pound . It closed at 15 francs , against 15.05 yesterday . It is now only 4 centimes above the lower gold point beyond which it can not go without further devaluation . At the pres- ent rate of decline that point would be reached on Monday and Would be an extremely anxious moment for the French . The question that has been on every tongue all this week is : " Will the dollar follow the pound no matter how far it falls ? " The French hope not , but fear the worst . The Italian lira also broke its low record today , closing at 1.277 against 1.2795 yesterday . Its theoretical lower gold point is 1.3434.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
