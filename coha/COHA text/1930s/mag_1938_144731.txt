In the number and quality of great composers , the present is probably as rich as any period in history . In quantity of untutored , incompetent , fourth-rate composers , it is even richer . Because the public needs time to appreciate first-rate music and because even competent listeners can not always , at first hearing , tell a crackpot musician from a genius , the work of contemporary highbrow composers is unpopular . The public prefers familiar music of guaranteed workmanship . <P> Because of this public deafness , contemporary composers have been in danger of turning into mutes . To combat this deafness and muteness , societies of intrepid and hard-eared listeners have been formed , who sit through concerts of contemporary music almost without flinching . Chief among these devoted bands is the International Society for Contemporary Music , which last week opened its 16th annual festival in London . <P> Since 1923 , when it made its debut in Salzburg , the society has held its annual egg rolling in nearly every important country in Europe , and composers from more than 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most recent of them have taken place in Prague <P> ( 1935 ) , Barcelona ( 1936 ) , Paris ( 1937 ) . In each cooperating nation a committee appoints a jury of well-known native musicians to judge works submitted by their countrymen . Selections of these national juries are then submitted to a special international jury elected each year by the society 's Council of Delegates . This year 's jury : Modernist Composers Darius Milhaud ( France ) and Alois Haba ( Czechoslovakia ) , Conductors Sir Adrian Cedric Boult ( England ) , Ernest Ansermet ( Switzerland ) , Thomas Jensen ( Denmark ) . <P> Results of such careful picking and choosing should be a gilt-edged list of entries for each festival . But musical compositions , unlike dogs , horses and tennis games , can not be judged on points . Not even the modernist composers and well-known conductors of the society 's international jury know for sure whether they are picking a sunrise or a dodo . Ultimate decision rests with the musical public . And very few of the musical public attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The audiences ( made up of composers , executant musicians , esthetes , theorists , critics , future-boosters ) do not go primarily to enjoy the music , but to keep from missing something . Cheers are as scarce as hen 's teeth , but hisses are as common as chickweed.
