4ik HEROES A STORY BY BEN NORRIS I KNEW we must be almost there be-cause Oscar had been climbing for the last ten or fifteen minutes . The altimeter showed about ten thousand feet , but I could n't tell what was below because 1 was too busy watching Oscar . He had waved us to close in , and when your wings are almost locked you do n't have time for anything except to watch the leader . Oscar leveled the formation out and I saw his ailerons wiggle . That meant we were going to dive the town . Down , down we went , picking up speed all the time . Headed straight down now , I could see the town out of the corner of my eye , between Oscar 's wings . How low would he go ? On occasions like this you did n't have to bother about the twelve-hundred-foot law . The town fathers would love it . So should I. Skimming house tops in formation is real sport . Curious why that should be more fun than low flying alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propeller snarl . Boy ! what a racket on the ground . When the props start snarling you 've caught up to your motor and ca n't go any faster . That 's when you hear that long crescendo of moan from the ground . You do n't hear anything in the air . It 's all noise , so you do n't distinguish , except in a dive every so often you hear the other wing man . I do n't know why . It would be too bad if we broke all the windows . Oscar got in pretty bad dutch the time we broke all the windows in the schoolhouse at Fredericksburg . You would n't think just vibrations would do it . The little schoolteacher told Ted afterward she did n't know whether she was more excited or scared . Oscar was certainly a swell guy about it . Said we 'd just been practicing and he had n't noticed we were over the schoolhouse . It was bumpy down low . Took all you had to stay in close . That was because of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right over the tree tops . You could just make out a jumble of things rushing by under you , like a movie when they run it too fast . We did a wing-over around a big building and flew back along the river . We had to pull up a little for the bridge and then circled back over town again . We were doing pretty well , I thought , considering the choppy air . But that was what we were there for ? to give the cash customers their money 's worth . Or was it the taxpayers ? Well , someone . It did n't much matter . If you did n't fly close they would n't want formations for conventions and things . And trips like this were good fun . Sort of broke the monotony of routine at the base . We landed in formation at the airport and taxied up to the line . I cut my motor and stretched in the cock-pit . Three hours at a time with some show stuff thrown in makes you pretty stiff . I took the cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe my eyes . It was the first time anything like this had happened to us . " Is that supposed to be for us ? " I yelled over to Ted , indicating the band drawn up in front of a crowd of people . " Sure . We 're heroes . Had n't you heard ? " " Nuts , " I said . " Where 's the bar ? Oscar says they have good beer in this town . " Oscar came back from talking to a guy dressed like a Grand Kleag/e  --  or what I imagined a Grand Kleagle would dress like . Oscar was running round after us like a mother hen . They wanted a picture . " Who 's the Grand Kleagle ? " I asked him . " He 's the entertainment committee . He 's going to take care of us while we 're here . We 're the guests of honor . " " Oh , yeah ? " I saicL " Oh , yeah " was just getting popular at the time . " I 'm not kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we were the hired help , " Ted said , " until I saw the band . " Oscar finally collected the bunch from the other two sections and they took a picture of us . Reporters asked us all our names for the captions in the local papers . Halpert , that was the Grand Kleagle 's name , made a speech to welcome us , all about brothers in arms who were carrying on the traditions of the A.E.F. where they had left off . Funny , I thought , none of us had been in the War . Even Oscar was too young at the time . And here we were being made a fuss over at a Legion convention , or Veterans of something or other , I was n't sure which . The ride into town was a nightmare . The springs were down almost on theaxles with about eight of us piled in the car . The top was down and I Ialpert did his duty as he saw it . " I guess it 's pretty tame on the ground , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all pulling . " " Watch out ? " Oscar shouted . Halpert stepped on the siren and swerved to miss a trolley car . It made me feel a little weak . " That 's no thrill for you fellows , " he said , turning round again . " Anyhow we 've got the right of way , " We were doing between sixty and sixty-five and there was a lot of traffic . In and out of lines of cars , over on the left of the road , and all the time the siren going and Halpert looking round talking drivel . " This bird 's nuts , " I whispered to Ted . " He 's going to kill us before we 've even sampled the local brew . " " Maybe he 's the town undertaker drumming up trade . " " I always thought I 'd like to fly , " Halpert was saying . " I get a kick out of narrow shaves . " He turned just in time to squeeze between a trolley and a truck coming the other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brakes behind us , but when I opened my eyes again we were still going . " You got to be able to take chances to fly , " Halpert went on . I thought of the Golden Rule they drilled into us at Pensacola : Observe all safety precautions at all times . " Not like driving a car . You do n't have any air brakes . Not yet . And , boy , when you land , you land hard I guess . They 'll be getting air brakes though the way things change these days . " " Not for a while , I guess , " Oscar said , trying to be polite . " Say , I was thinking when I saw you guys coming into town that way , maybe here 's some business . I 'll put my card in your dashboards just so you 'll remember me . Speaking of inventions , take my business . It 's not like it was in the old days with all this cremation stuff . I used to make a hundred dollars or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cremated . And I ca n't afford to put in a plant . You 'd be surprised at the business I 've lost on account of cremating . " " Cheerful bugger , " I whispered to Ted . " Oh , he means all right , " Ted said . " It 's terrible these days , " Halpert kept on , " you never know where you 're at . You look up and get something in your eye and you do n't know whether it 's an arm or a leg . Or maybe it 's just a cinder . " " Hey , Ted , suppose they 'll have any whisky for us ? I need a drink . " " I thought you wanted beer . " " I did . " " Well , there 'll be plenty of both . He 's not really a bad egg though . " " And he 's the crude sort of bastard they 're paying a bonus to . I wish they had n't sent us . " " What do you care ? You 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wo n't have to pay a thing . He 's all right . " " I suppose so . " Halpert parked us in the hotel and said he 'd be back later . " The later the better , " I said . " He 's all right , " Oscar said . " Did you hear what he said about the cinder ? That 's a hot one . " " Do we have to be entertained or can we just mosey round and drink beer ? " I asked . " They wo n't all be that way . We 'll have to stick round and be good guys . This is part of your education you missed at Harvard . " After a while Halpert came hack with a couple of quarts of liquor and two or three other guys dressed up in fancy uniforms . Before that I had n't thought much of our own khaki uniforms , but when I put on a clean blouseand changed the insignia and buttons I made a point of leaving off my Pistol Expert 's badge . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had showers and got cleaned up , Halpert marshalled us down to another room in the hotel . I was pretty fried by that time and did n't have much trouble with my post graduate course , as Oscar called it . He was quite well along , and it did n't seem to make much difference to us what anyone said . There were about fifty men in the room and more whisky than you could shake a stick at . Nat got hold of a swagger stick somewhere and went round shaking it at every case he could find . But some man collared him and Nat forgot about shaking the stick . We were brothers in arms for all we were worth by this time . Everybody was talking about what division they were with in the War . But it never got any farther than just what division they were in . Some one else would always come along and interrupt with a drink or the same question . And nobody ever found anyone from his division so there was n't anything else to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during dinner , and afterward Halpert had to parade , so we had a breathing spell . It seemed as though the whole town were drunk . But we just wandered about and watched things . Parades all over town , torchlight processions , bands , " Hi , Buddy , what division were you in ? " parades , and more bands . I never saw so many bands . " You do n't have to be much of a hero to get a band , " Ted said . " I thought they were really doing right by us this afternoon . " We finally landed up in a bar off on a side street without a single veteran . " This place must be quarantined , " Ted said . " Fine . Suits me . " The beer was really good . Even better than the legal stuff you get now . It was more like Canadian Ale . We found that out after a few glasses . It had body , and you liked to roll it round as you swallowed it . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not Like this , " Oscar said . " Ever had German beer ? " " Sure , but this is just as good . " " You got to have good beer to mine coal , " Ted said . " I do n't see the connection . " " You never mined coal . " " That 's true too . " The beer on top of all that whisky began to have an effect and Ted started using big words . " I 'm no confirmed militarist , " he said , " but the spirit that sends men to war is a fine thing . " " So 's this beer . " " No , really , it is . It 's like what a darn good Sousa march does to you . Makes you feel eager and alive . And war spirit brings to these people 's lives their one big ecstasy . " Ted was drunk , but I could see he meant what he was saying . Oscar listened , too , and so did Nat . " Well , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war spirit . It made them feel they were somebody , made them feel alive . And then they came back and took up undertaking . . . " " You 're drunk , " I broke in . " I want another beer . " The waiter brought us alI another round and Ted went on . " And went into real estate and things . But they all remember the way they felt inside when they marched off to war . So they gather together and all get drunk and dress up and try to feel that way again . And I say it 's all a darn travesty . A travesty on a fine thing . " " What 's a travesty ? " I said . " Know what a caricature is ? " " Sure , it 's a picture . " " Well , a certain kind of a picture . And a travesty is doing something a second time that comes out like a caricature , only more so . " " I see . Only what 's it all about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How about alumni reunions ? " Oscar asked . " They are too , " Ted said , " only not so bad . Why the devil do n't people learn that you ca n't do things over again ? Hell 's bells , have your fun while the going 's good , and then look round for something else . We 'd have more heroes per square inch if we had fewer travesties . " " Nuts , " I said . " Let 's go to bed . " The next morning we went out to the airport to put on a show . Ted and I made sure not to be in Halpert 's car , but poor Oscar , having all the rank , could n't get out of it . " Halpert 's going to give us a case of rye to take back with us , " Oscar told us while we were putting on our flying suits . " I still do n't like him , " I said . " You 've got to learn to take ' em as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad guy , making a few allowances . You ca n't find Harvard men everywhere , and he 's probably good to his family . " We flew round most of the morning , doing formation loops and squirrel cages , and all the stuff that looks good from the ground . We had lunch at the airport as guests of the citizens rather than of the veterans and met some pretty nice people . Oscar made a speech and we all talked about flying . In the afternoon a lot of people gathered at the airport and we did some more fancy flying and staged a couple of phony races . It was swell fun passing one another in front of the grandstand and doing exaggerated turns around the pylons of the triangular course . Of course it was no race because we did n't want to beat our motors when we had to fly over the mountains the next day . Ted and I staged a close-shave crack-up at the end of the lace . I zoomed up to the left as I crossed the finish line right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn inside mine to avoid hitting me . The mechanics said it looked all right . That night we could n't shake Hal-pert and a couple of other guys who all rambled on about ayviaters in loud voices and made us embarrassed . They told stale dirty jokes and then laughed at them . We all went to some kind of a show the convention was holding . A lot of burlesque women , who looked as though burlesque had been a step-up for them , did hoochey dances and we drank a lot of flat beer . Not nearly so good as the stuff at the bar . Ted and I left . He wanted to write to the little school-teacher and I wanted to go to bed . " You 'll see her before she gets the letter , " I told Ted . " What 's that got to do with it ? " " Well , you 'll see her , that 's all . " " Sure , but I feel like writing to her . I do n't know whether I 'll mail it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the rest of the gang told me about the show after we left , I was just as glad we had . Some doctor had given a lecture with illustrations about the birds and bees , only Oscar said skunks and snakes were more appropriate . We went out to the field early the next morning in a bus they sent for us . No one showed up with the case of rye , so we called up from the field . Halpert said he 'd send it out . " He 'll send it sure , " Ted said . " I 'll give odds we get no rye , " I offered , but no one would bet . After about an hour Oscar said we 'd have to go without it . From Oscar that was quite a surprise . " Damn it , " Ted said , " I 've done my duty by my country , I 've been as good a buddy for three days as any of you , and I want my share of the rye . " We waited another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swell guy , " I said to Ted just before we left . " I hope they cremate him , " he said , but I noticed him stuffing a couple of bottles in his map case . " You got to take ' em as they come . " In the plane I looked at my instrument panel . I had really expected to find Halpert 's card stuck there . We all turned out for a mass drill one day . The whole base was taking part , because , you see , in the Marines you have to be a little of everything . Flyers are foot soldiers as well . It 's not a bad idea when you think of the sort of jobs the Marines get . There 's nothing more tiring than waiting for an inspection . And we waited . We were all lined up by one o'clock . It was a hot , sunny day and we all had boots and swords . It was after three when the inspecting party finally arrived , and by the time it was all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I 'm tired , " I said , loosening my boots as soon as I got to the car . Nat and two or three others were grousing about the inspection too . Ted came up , all smiles and rubbing his hands . " Cigarette , cigarette , " he said , " who 's got a cigarette ? " I dug for the pack in my pants pocket . " Reach for a ' Lucky ' instead of your feet , " he said , which at the moment just about panicked the crowd . When 1 came from the Engine Shop , where I 'd been working most of the next afternoon , I ran into Oscar . " Ted went in the river , " he said . I knew damn well from the way he said it that there was no use . But even when you know a thing and hope for something else , you keep asking questions until you 're convinced . " In the river " did n't necessarily mean anything bad except the way Oscar said it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take-off and had to sit down in the river and how we got the plane out with only the magnetos on the fritz . And I thought of the time Pat Moran stubbed his toe in the Corsair skimming along the water chasing ducks . He and the mec got out with just a few bruises . I did n't really think about all this . Just the pictures went through my mind and I felt it was no use , but I asked Oscar just the same . And tried to be casual about it too , as if that might help it to be different . " What did he do , stub his toe ? " " No , he went straight in . " " Spin in ? " " No , flew right in . He was practicing combat with Hank Murray and the river was glassy . He was watching Hank when he went in . " I suppose in a war you get pretty used to that sort of thing , seeing your friends bumped off all the time , but when there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's run , it really hits you hard . " Stop in for a julep on your way home , " I told Oscar . Then I shoved off . I did n't want to know any more about it . They would be dredging the river and studying the breaks for technical information about stresses . But I was n't interested in that and least of all did I want to see them taking Ted out . We drove up to Ted 's home for the funeral . It was a couple of hundred miles , so we left about four in the morning . It was a beautiful day and most of the drive was through rich Maryland and Pennsylvania farmingcountry . It rolled all the way and the swaying wheat fields and great still trees beside the road all gave you a feeling of the abundance and fertility of things . It was about the middle of June and you felt the beginning of the heavy lushness of summer . In a way I was sorry it was such a fine day because it was the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral was in the house . There were quite a few people ; the dining room was full and there were others in the hall . The family and ourselves were in the living room . There were flowers all over the place . The preacher seemed like a decent sort and read some prayers . And then he sort of shook himself out for his big moment . My heart sank . He talked on and on . Not about Ted . His family , I think , might have liked that . But it was his chance and he was n't going to miss it . He talked about the temple at Jerusalem and about the glory that was Rome . And about what St. Augustine had said . I hoped he would stop , but he kept right on going . I did n't think Ted 's family cared about all that , but I did n't think bad thoughts about the preacher because I figured maybe it helped them some . But it was darned hot in there , and we had dress uniforms on which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow . When we came back from the cemetery the family had a big meal for us . I liked that because I thought of what Ted was always saying about taking things as they come . His family were great people too . I guess they were n't as educated as Ted . He was the youngest and his older brothers had all chipped in to send him to college . But they had a lot that you ca n't get out of education . " I heard about an accident over the radio down at the store , " his father said . " I knew right away it was Ted . When I came home after work , the evening papers were out and told all about it . " The old gentleman had mustachios and wore braces . He talked in a soft voice and had the kindliest face I 've ever seen . He talked about crops in the vicinity and told us about the judge who had been at the services . Ted 's mother busied herself with the meal and I guess it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she stopped to tell us about how the first she heard of it was the reporters asking for a picture . That must have been an awful shock , but she and his father both were the kind of people who have seen a lot of life , and living in the country , or near it , seems to give a rhythm to living that you do n't get in the city . Anyway I began to see where Ted got his idea about taking things as they come . Other people say the same thing , but they grab nervously as though every moment were their last chance . " Ted was so full of life , it just does n't seem right , " his mother said . " His letters were so full of all the things he was doing and they always made us laugh the way he said things . " It was n't a gloomy meal though . It went along like any other meal except we mentioned Ted every now and then , but in a matter-of-fact way . I liked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to think up the right thing to say in a mournfulvoice . It was all very natural , and when you talked about Ted you did n't have to hush your voice . " I 'm glad the last thing 1 remember Ted saying , " I told them , " was ' reach for a " Lucky " instead of your feet . ' " And I told them the story . They laughed and said , " That was like Ted . " That made me feel better about the preacher , because I knew now they must have felt the same way I did . We left pretty soon after dinner and driving back Nat said , " Gee , they 're fine people , are n't they ? " " Yeah , " I said . " I liked the way they took it . Almost as though they had expected it . " " You 'd think they would be more . . . well , more sort of mournful . " " Maybe . But you remember what Ted said at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About war spirit being a fine thing , sure . " " No , about a caricature . Remember he said a caricature was a picture , but whipping up your emotions was a travesty ? " " I guess it hit them , all right . " " Well , " I said , " I think Ted 's family 's that way . They 're sorry , all right . Inside , I mean , but they do n't whip up a bunch of tears , too , just for show . " " Yeah , I had n't thought of that . " As we drove on I had a sense of the four seasons of the year .
