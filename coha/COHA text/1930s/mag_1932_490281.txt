WE stepped into a newsreel theatre the other afternoon , stretched our silly face forward with the other faces , and watched closely the flutter of the planet 's doings . This was what was happening in the world ; Three men jumped out of an airplane at three thousand feet to demonstrate that a parachute in the shape of a triangle drops straighter than a parachute in the shape of a circle . A young man received twenty-five thousand dollars for driving an outboard motorboat faster than the others in the race . An Englishman , by driving an automobile two hundred and fifty-three miles an hour , drove it eight miles an hour faster than one had ever been driven before , which the Voice said was a " gr-r-eite achievement , " but did not- say why . United States battleships landed guns on the beach in Hawaii , practicing for wars yet undeclared . The wind damaged the tail of the largest airship in the world , making it , for the moment , wholly , instead of nearly , useless . Japanese soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a street in China , carrying the stars and stripes ( forever ) . An animated mouse played on a xylophone . Monkeys , dressed as people , performed a play . Herbert Hoover laid a wreath on the grave of George Washington . Twenty-two men demonstrated how a change in the football rules might lessen the chances of one of the men getting killed by the other twenty-one . An inventor ( and this was the one thing that seemed to make sense ) was hard at work on a rocket by which he expected to leave this planet for , he hoped , another one . NE of our contributors in Los ON Angeles received a note from the New Yorker recently , returning a manuscript . It was a polite note , it seemed to him  --  a fine , cordial little missive , thanking him for his kindness in sending the contribution and asking him to visit the New Yorker when he came to town . It was that last crack that made him suspicious  --  that part about visiting us . A careful reexamination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from us at all , but from the New Yorker Hotel . Apparently they 're always glad to have visitors , even writers . We 're much more standoffish , ourself . ANYONE who has ever attended a party held to introduce a debutante to society knows what a chore it is for her family . It requires a vast amount of organization and preliminary spadework and a large number of " assistants . " The debutante is assisted by certain of her friends , and the mother of the debutante is assisted by hers . All these people are credited in the newspaper reports with an assist . It seems to us there ought to be some simpler way of introducing a debutante , specially this year when there is no real reason for a girl 's coming out anyway , on account of there being no young men of any means to come out to . There ought to be , we feel , some way that would be more in keeping with the general spirit of the times . Why not just invite a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment arrives for introducing the debutante , get the drummer to roll an alarum . Then , as the drum suddenly ceases , the mother of the dthutante jumps to a chair , points to her daughter , and cries : " Hello , everybody , this is her ! " WE came on a great sight in East Twenty-first Street : a stained-glass window in the Rex Cole store ? a heavenly refrigerator in stained glass , its door standin a open , the religious light of Monday morning filtering through its shelves laden with broccoli , grapefruit , Grade A , and alligator pears . After all , why not ? Refrigeration is our patron saint ; the little cubelets of ice are our holy water grown cold . Jaywalker TT was , you may remember , Grover J. Whalen who issued the pronunciamento that pedestrians must obey the traffic lights , waiting for the green as if they were taxicabs , or even more so . That was when he was police commissioner . We saw him the other day , just Private Citizen INT1 , alen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanamaker 's . When he reached University Place , the lights were against him . Without even a blush , he plunged off the curb and began dodging taxicabs like anybody . He did n't even take the most direct route . Went diagonally . He had to run the last few steps . Book-Lover ROSENBACH , the rare-book dealer and collector , was showing a friend some of his most valuable possessions one day this week . He paused with particularly loving care over one volume . It was a Shakespeare First Folio in the original binding . Dr. Rosenbach expatiated on it at some length , explaining how unthinkably rare and inexpressibly valuable it was . The general idea was that a collector who acquired a First Folio might as well fold his hands in peace and spend the rest of his days regarding the wonder . " There are only four perfect copies in the world , " Dr. Rosenbach explained , a little breathlessly . His friend asked the natural question : Who owned the other three ? To his astonishment , Dr. Rosenbach looked blank for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't , for the life of him , remember where the other three were . Not even where one of them was . The rest of the inspection was a little vague , because the famous collector was obviously worrying about the other three Folios . His friend went away , not bothering much about it . The next day , however , Dr. Rosenbach called him on the telephone in excitement . " You know those First Folios ? " he said . " Well , I 've found out where one of the others is . I 've got it myself . " Coolidge Purple ONE of our Boston corre-ON was in the R. H. Stearns store in that city when Mrs. Coolidge came in , smiling pleasantly . To the first salesgirl she met , she said : " Something in a black hat , please . " The salesgirl seated her before a mirror and Mrs. Coolidge tried on some black hats . Nothing in the first batch suited and the salesgirl went after more . The former First Lady looked around while the girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a nearby table . She was still gazing at it when the salesgirl returned . She tried on some more black hats . None of these suited , either . When the girl departed a second time , Mrs. Coolidge 's gaze veered back to that purple hat . She looked around and then went over and got it . She sat down and tried it on . It was quite fetching . Mrs. Coolidge looked at herself in the purple hat for almost a minute , then put it down and shook her head . The girl came up with several more black hats . With a final wistful glance at the purple straw , Mrs. Coolidge decided upon one of these . Our correspondent imagined he could see her thinking of the purple hat and Calvin and realizing it would never do . Steam MWENTY thousand radiators in 1 the Radio City buildings will be filled with steam from the New York Steam Corporation , which will pipe it to them under subways , electric conduits , and the very sidewalks we tread so thoughtlessly . This simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we return , staggering . The Steam Corporation , which was chartered in 1880 , now serves twenty-five hundred buildings in Manhattan below Ninety-second Street with nice , lively steam , supplying about a quarter of all the steam used on the island . Four generating plants are along the East River and help to warm up that body of water so much that it never freezes over any more . The steam is made of pure Crown water ; river water too dirty . The company also buys steam from the New York Edison Company at times and sells it at other times , both to the Edison Company and the Consolidated Gas Company . But that way lies madness . Steam sells , on the average , for ninety-five cents a thousand pounds . Details of the rate schedules are too complicated to go into . Only a few big buildings ? old ones downtown ? make their own steam nowadays . Few new buildings have boilers . They rent out the basement space that boilers would occupy . The buildings over the New York Central railroad yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buildings are on meter . Small ones  --  apartment houses and the like  --  take heat for , say , fifteen minutes of each hour . That is why it sometimes takes the radiator so long to heat up after you turn it on and why it getscold unexpectedly if it 's before an open window . The steam pipes themselves are two feet in diameter but are so swathed in insulation that they take up five feet of space underground . They rarely blow up , although the pressure is one hundred and sixty-five pounds , enough to run an engine . They do n't leak much . The steam you see coming out of manholes is n't Corporation steam . It 's water that has seeped around the pipes and got overheated . A real break would be something big . In winter the company suffers a wastage of fourteen per cent , however ; " lost or unaccounted for , ? they call it . It slips away , or condenses . It is , though you would n't think it , an all-the-year business . Barbershops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . The central-heating-plant idea tends to concentrate the smoke nuisance . One point of concentration happens to be Sutton Place , which protests . The Corporation is trying to put down the smoke . Meanwhile , as it points out , the hauling of dirty coal through the streets is avoided . The Corporation hauls on the East River . The steam people have sixty-five miles of pipe and their own way of looking at things . We happened to say something about steam " pounding " in radiators . The Corporation man looked at us severely . " Steam , " he said , in measured tones , " sings ! " Dimes OUR Ormond Beach correspon-OU notifies us that he was standing before the entrance to the golf club there last Friday when the elder John D. Rockefeller drove up . The old gentleman leaned forward in his seat , saw nobody in sight but our correspondent , and waved to his chauffeur to drive on . News of the call spread rapidly and soon a crowd of gapers collected . Presently Mr. Rockefeller came back and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimes , and began to play golf . Those Lights HE new Fifth Avenue lights have n't been working together any too well , as a few thousand people have pointed out to us at one time or another . They change colors irregularly instead of all together , which makes many automobile drivers swear , and every now and then one of them goes off on a bat , sticking to red when the rest go green and then going over to green at the wrong moment . We are pleased to report that the situation is but temporary ; a matter of weeks . At the present moment each lamp-post has its own little motor , turning the lights on and off , and motors are inclined to go their independent ways , like clocks . A new cable is being installed and the old solidarity will return . Then the whole bunch , from the Square to Fifty-ninth , will be operated by remote control , one switch in the Thirtieth Street Police Station working the lot . At present one workman spends his whole time dashing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of step While looking into the Fifth Avenue traffic matter , we learned that sweep-. ing changes in the signal system are planned for the whole city . The yellow light was found a failure . Taxi-drivers and other demons paid no attention to it except to regard it as a signal to lunge at pedestrians . The period of darkness which was used instead of the yellow light will be abandoned in favor of the all-red period ( considered as having been a success in Fifth Avenue ) and it is hoped this will give pedestrians a sporting chance to make the curb . Soon the no-light period will be discontinued on all the main traffic arteries in upper Manhattan : Lexington , Madison , Park , Broadway , all of them . It will not mean scrapping the lanterns , merely drastic alterations in the cable system and the control apparatus . Eventually the whole city will be put on the same basis and then all the traffic in town will he regulated from the Thirtieth Street Police Station , by a machine . Mr. Bedford LI VEN fox-hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up in Fairfield County the cross borne by the huntsmen and huntswotnen is Mr. Frederick Bedford , who goes quietly out and shoots ( we said " shoots " ) the fox just when the chase is at its height . How the hunting set hates that ! But it is the way Mr. Bedford is made ; and there is nothing much that can be done about it unless they should sick the hounds on Mr. Bedford , which is unthinkable . Mr. Bedford is in his middle fifties , does n't ride to hounds , has his own ideas , and sticks to them . It was really a pretty ticklish situation . His daughter Helen is a member of the Hunt , and after a few foxes had been done in , Helen was elected Master of the Hurst . People thought things would take a turn for the better . Not a bit of it . We get the rest of the story from a gentleman who was following the hunt in a car not so long afterward . The pack was on a fox between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered a thicket . The hounds lost the scent and there was a check . Then suddenly in the thicket , Bang ! " Hope that is n't Papa Bedford , " said somebody brightly . It really did n't seem possible that the Master 's father could be in there whanging away . He was , though . That 's not all . He got three that day  --  three foxes . Popped ' em off onetwo-three neat as you please . Shamrocks OUT of our great confusion we make a little article on shamrocks , which on the seventeenth will deck a million buttonholes . Our confusion , which is the same confusion that must rise in the minds of all neutral observers , is about the precise nature of shamrocks . We can trace for you the bulk of the metropolitan supply . It comes from two greenhouses , those of Charles Hunt 's Sdns on Staten Island and those of the John Scott company of Rutland Road , Brooklyn . We can tell you that one of Charles Hunt 's Sons , who is sixty-seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale florists in Twenty-eighth Street , using a little black-and-red wagon hitched to Bill , a middle-aged horse . The Hunts  --  the only other son is William , aged sixty  --  have grown twenty-eight thousand pots of shamrocks for this year 's trade . The Scotts have twenty thousand ready . The shamrocks are in their own tiny pots , one , one and a half , or two inches in diameter , the smallest size being the most popular . Each matured from a seed planted early in January . The only question we can not answer is one we never dreamed would come up : What shamrocks are . The legend is , of course , that St. Patrick demonstrated the doctrine of the Trinity to the people of Ireland with a shamrock , pointing out that its three leaves made but one whole . Almost immediately thereafter , it would seem , the people of Ireland fell to arguing as to the kind of plant St. Patrick actually employed . It was a " shamrock , " but a shamrock can be a white clover , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medic , a purple clover , a suckling clover , nr something else , according to how you look at it . The argument still goes on , bitterly . The men of Connaught sniff when shown a lesser yellow trefoil . White clover is shamrock in Connaught . Suckling clover is , forlornly , shamrock in the French Pyrenees . Since all the plants look pretty mach alike  --  they have three leaves and are all green , anyway ? it is hard to understand the bitterness in the controversy . But it is there , all right . People bleed and die , verbally . They also snort . William Hunt has been in the thick of the shamrock debate for years . " White clover is what it really is , " he says . " That 's the same as shamrock . Still , I du n no . " A man protested a few years ago that the Hunt product was n't right and brought some seeds which he said were of real shamrock . The plants looked the same as Hunts ' , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , however , feeling they may have been wrong for fifty years . They have been reassured firmly by their seed dealers , who import the seeds from Ireland and catalogue them as " True Shamrock . " " There 's nothing but true shamrock , and this is it , " say the seed people . The Scotts buy their seed from Ireland direct . Theirs is " small-leaf shamrock . " They say theirs is the real article . Shamrocks are also made out of green silk , which is perhaps simpler . Private Lives THE private life of anyone is his own , so far as we are concerned , just as his home is his castle , but we ought to tell about a Mr. Zyswikszk ( which is n't his real name ) . In his palmy days he used to take Mrs. Zyswikszk to the theatre quite often . He used on other occasions to take a lady Mrs. Z. does n't know or know about . Times are n't what they were , though , and when recently both of them expressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way : He bought three seats , together , sent one of them to the lady and escorted his wife . He arranged it so he sat between . He talked to his wife and did n't notice the other lady until the curtain went up . Then he held the other lady 's hand . During the entr'acte he talked to his wife . So it went . You could hardly call it a private life at that . Sweet 's NOBODY who enjoys old restaurants should miss Sweet 's , at the corner of Fulton and South Streets . It is eighty-six years old and enjoys a number of interesting distinctions . For one thing , it was the first restaurant in town to put in electric lights , and it was the first to serve swordfish . Sweet 's is also a hotel . The rooms , small and coopy  --  for the building is a hundred and twenty-five years old  --  are occupied mainly by seafaring men . The restaurant , on the second floor , attracts , and always has , a more varied trade : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beecher used to sit there with his friends . Arthur Brisbane and Frank Vanderlip and Senator Wagner are seen there occasionally now . A Quaker named A. M. Sweet opened up the place in 1845 and his sons ran it after he died , until 1919 , when they sold out to Jimmie Lake and Axel Anderson . Lake started in the place as a busboy thirty years ago ; Anderson had been an employee for ten years . It 's one of those places where few new persons are hired , and almost nobody is ever fired . Not a new waiter has been taken on in more than ten years . The waiters are all colored and some of them have grown white-haired in the service : Hardy , who has been there forty-five years ; Pitts , just one year less ; Joe and Bob , forty years ; Moses and Lola , thirty . The fishmen begin to come in as early as four A.M. , when the place opens . They sometimes bring their own fish to be cooked . They are a gusty crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ribs . Now and then one of the venerable colored men , cuffed too hard for his dignity , challenges a fishman to a fight . It all blows over . At noon hankers and brokers and clerks pour in . At night it 's a varied crowd of formally dressed people from uptown and skippers and sailors from the waterfront . The skippers congregate at a big round table , spin yarns , argue , move dishes around the tablecloth to illustrate some big hour in the life of an old clipper ship . Models of old clippers are scattered here and there , together with whaling guns and harpoons . The hotel rooms are almost always filled up . Captain Stoneman , who was mate of Morgan 's old yacht , laid a course for Sweet 's hotel as soon as the Corsair was turned over to the government . Captain Horton , who has a home in Maine and another in Florida , would rather stay at Sweet 's and is usually to be found there , and so are Captains McIntyre , Bowers , Westaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny sitting-room upstairs . Many a skipper arriving at Sweet 's late at night and finding all the rooms occupied will sleep on the sitting-room table or on a couple of big chairs rather than go to another hotel . There 's one who comes all the way from his home in California every year or so to stay a month or two at Sweet 's , playing cards , spinning yarns , moving dishes about on the tablecloth . Partisan ALADY who happened to be the only passenger on an eastbound Eighty-sixth Street crosstown car early one Sunday morning recently was flabbergasted to see the motorman stop his car soon after leaving Central Park West , hop out , and go dashing off up one of the Park walks . He came back in a moment carrying a rather chewed-looking chunk of crumb cake . He explained . " There 's some guy comes in every Sunday morning and leaves a lot of cake around for the birds over here , " he said . " So what do I do ? I just grab off a piece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East River . There 's birds over there too , y'know. "
