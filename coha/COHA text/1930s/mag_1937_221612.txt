When Assistant Principal Samuel S. Jaffe of Brooklyn 's Public School No. 150 wanted to say singer , hanger , longing , banging , clingingly , his tongue betrayed him . So New York 's Board of Examiners in 1934 unanimously rejected his application for a principal 's license . Last week Teacher Jaffe , still awaiting the result of an appeal to the city 's Board of Superintendents , filed another appeal with State Commissioner of Education Frank Pierrepont Graves . Although statistically Teacher Jaffe has one chance in 30 of persuading Commissioner Graves to interfere , his action moved the Board to consider how many and what kind of words . if any , a New York school principal might mispronounce without prejudicing his chances of advancement . <P> Said Chairman William A. Hannig of the Examiners ' legal committee : " Mispronunciation of common words is bad . Mispronunciation of uncommon words is not so bad . Mispronunciation of words commonly mispronounced by cultured people is also not so bad . " <P> Snorted scrappy old Associate Superintendent John Lee Tildsley : " A person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good teacher . "
