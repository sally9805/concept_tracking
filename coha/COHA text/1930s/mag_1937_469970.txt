ryl HE social historian practices the most 1 precarious kind of history , and his job is at its most precarious when he tries to say something usable about literary culture , reading habits , and the conditions of literary taste . He ends by falling back on individual experience , hoping that many minute dots may sometime be brought together in a half-tone of the whole . One such dot is what I offer here . This is how one reader of books was formed , what one literary person read when he was young , the outline of a literary experience in the Far West shortly after the turn of the century . It can not accurately tell much more than the individual experience ; neither the section nor the era can be generalized on the basis of it ; but people who lived through those years anywhere in America must find in it something familiar , and if anything in it is unfamiliar , that too must be taken into account before the period can be judged . Ogden , Utah , between 1900 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontier and twentiethcentury industrial organization . In 1900 it was a town of about eight thousand inhabitants ; in 1920 , a small city of about thirty thousand . The figures show a rapid growth in population ; social changes moved more rapidly still . Frontier culture had broken down and , by 1920 , was altogether gone , but habits of thought left over from it affected the whole period . Wealth grew enormously , and with it brought both interest in books and leisure to read them in . Almost bythe clock too , the schools and other social institutions of the East marched in to displace the indigenous ones . The historian encounters such a stage at every step he takes westward from the seaboard ; the Rocky Mountain phase was almost , but not quite , the latest in time . Political radicalism and social conservatism usually mark such a stage , and did mark it in Ogden . My political inheritance was the Populism of Middlewestern farmers and Western silver miners ; the back alcoves of my memory hold the shouting , dust clouds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling anarchy , the organ voice of Bryan , the names of many of his allies that have vanished from history . ' ' Coin " Harvey had lived in Ogden for a time , and I believe had edited one of his papers there ; housewives still talked about Kelley 's Army , the most robust of Coxey 's reinforcements ; Senator Cannon , who led the silver secession from the Republican convention of 1896 and was still fighting the same fight , lived a block from my house . The air had always carried the spores of rebellion and economic heresy . The town was heavily unionized and oldfashioned Fabians had me read dialectical pamphlets early in my boyhood , and treatises on Marx and Engels , and the endless literature of the Socialist Party . There were many of the more revolutionary type too , so that the ferment attending the rise of the Western Federation of Miners and the I.W.W. was commonplace to me . Facts , legends , and folklore about strikes in the mines and on the railroads , about Bill Haywood and Mother Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other violence were an integral part of our everyday life . There was a strong Utopian strain too : embers of the United Order , a Mormon communism , and of similar experiments still showed red when the wind rose , and one of the first novels I ever read was a little blue-bound Looking Backward . With an appropriateness which I am sure was unintentional , it stood in my father 's shelves next to The Great Pyramid , a once celebrated work which unraveled the prophecy hidden in the measurements of Cheops and predicted the future course of society so minutely and with such unanswerable logic that it may well reappear any day now in The New Republic . There were also several volumes of Henry George ; they were simplified for me before I read them by advertisements of a cigar named after him which showed him looking sternly at the spectator above the legend , " I am for men . " In the town as it was in my early childhood there was little interest in books , no general literary taste , only such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might develop by itself . Such interests are usually imported into frontier communities by those who practice the professions there , and apart from lawyers , doctors , and ministers , these are likely to be eccentrics . There is an American conventional figure , the schoolmaster who opens an academy before the last fight with the Indians and has spread a love of poetry , oratory , and Spencerian-shaded capitals through the community before it has had time to close the fourth side of its cabins . To this type may have belonged the legendary " professor " who maintained the school to which my mother had walked four miles barefoot every morning ; but he died long before I was born . More eccentric was the Heidelberg geologist who lived across the street from our house , a solitary who had probably come West to study the Wasatch mountains and who remained there in an alientrade . He would leave the house in the morning roaring Heine 's songs , his pockets were always full of German books , and the mail brought him learned periodicals ; but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were . There was also an Italian who conducted the unlikeliest of businesses , an " art store . " History can not conceive what art he sold , except that as the small plutocracy began to emerge there was some demand for the materials of china painting and pyrography ; but he read much . His arguments with my father over a bottle of the native wine which his sister had sent from Italy were the first literary discussions I ever heard . There was a barber who had read his way through nineteenth-century physics and biology and had formulated a gigantic theory about the climate and civilization of the Great Basin . There was a physician , a gloomy and possessed man , who read the Latin classics and wrote an epic poem ; as a child I saw him correcting the proof sheets and years later I found a copy of it in the Harvard Library . It was dreadfully bad . There was a mining promoter who had had incredible adventures among the peaks and who wove them into scores of fantastic Poelike tales which never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's literati during my childhood , when an educated class had hardly begun to emerge . My father , settling in Ogden at about 1880 , brought the first college degree to town , so I have always understood , and only isolated ones followed it for a good many years . Boys less then ten years older than I were the first who went to college as a matter of course . It followed that , as on all frontiers , the lawyers were the intellectual aristocracy . It was they who had libraries . Most other people had books ? a set of Dickens perhaps , a few volumes of Scott , less commonly , some of the New England classics , odd items of mid-nineteenth century sentiment , or a sprinkling of novels like Under Two Flags and To Have and To Hold . The lawyers ' libraries I remember were amplified collections of the same sort of thing . There were volumes of orations ( the tradition passes from American life with that generation ) , the nineteenth-century popular science that was so much better done than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic poetry . There was likely to be only Tennyson later than 1850 , of Americans only Mark Twain and James Whitcomb Riley later than the New Englanders. and no European literature at all . Here and there you would find Ingersoll or Brann the Iconoclast , a volume of Ambrose Bierce or Frank Stockton , and a leather-bound classic as the Roycrofters began to crusade for deckle edges . But apart from popular fiction , those who read books in Ogden read the books of a generation or more before them . They had little curiosity about the literature of their own time . II The generalization held true in an extreme for my father . A gifted mathematician , he had taught for some years at his college , Notre Dame , before moving West , and he held no less than five degrees , whose sum represented as good a classical and scientific education as the era afforded . But long before I was of college age I saw that it had made him indifferent to anything later than the texts he had studied , and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked out for me . Up to his death he was rejecting modern physics with postulates he had learned in the ' Seventies , and he assumed that there was no modern literature . An exact date could be set : literature stopped short with Lord Byron . He could quote Byron by the page , he had a more intimate knowledge of the earlier romantic poets than I ever needed as a college teacher of literature , and he liked Milton , Shakespeare , and especially Dryden . But his admiration was reserved for the Italian renaissance and the Greek and Latin classics . His tastes were thus those of a schoolmaster in the Connecticut Valley in 1825 before the Newness had moved out from Boston . There must have been many like him scattered over the frontier , steeped in a culture which had been closed for almost a hundred years , sincerely disregarding everything else . The classics , the founding Fathers , Erasmus Darwin rather than Charles , Adam Smith , and the physics of Faraday ? the ultimate history of frontier culture will steer its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Pope 's " Iliad . " It was not Chicken Little but Achilles and Athena whose adventures I first traced in print , and I could spout the battle passages hundreds of lines at a stretch . A tetrameter translation of the " . /Eneid " followed . Literature was largely epics for my father , and before I was ten I had got through Dante , Tasso , Ariosto , Pulci , Boiardo , and Camoens . I read them again when I took Barrett Wendell 's course at Harvard , where the assistant was surprised by my acquaintance with what I assumed everybody knew who read books at all ; but since then I have gone back only to Dante . Dante has survived that violence , but the others mean nothing to me now and I think they meant little more than jingles and forced labor to me then . My father could delight me by reading " Jerusalem Delivered " aloud , but when I read it the knights seemed strangely silly . Yet the converse did not follow , for he put me through Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CabelI 's opinion that it is the world 's dullest book . I should rank somewhere near it Gil Blas , which my father gave me when I was about twelve ; but I can thank Le Sage for some of the information I was denied in the volumes of Rabelais , Boccaccio , and Margaret of Navarre which were kept in a locked drawer . He read these in translation ; for though he had been sufficient of a linguist to learn Chinese , he lost his reading knowledge of the modern languages , and read only Greek and Latin in the original . If I failed him with the medieval writers , I betrayed him with the classics . For years he forced Plutarch on me , and for years I could read just so much and no more , and till he died he considered me an ignoramus in consequence . But my failure may have been a belated repetition of a historical shift . The children of John Adams called Plutarch master , but the issue of Rutherford B. Hayes began to depart from him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . I had to labor with the other classical histories and with the epics , and after I was in high school and had begun to study Latin he forced Lucretius and Catullus and Horace on me . And from the beginning I frankly loathed them . How much of my rebellion was due to his making me read them , how much a mistake it was to expose me to them prematurely , I do not know . I studied just enough Latin to get into college and no Greek at all , and in my mature life no classical literature has meant anything to me except the Greek dramas which , significantly , he talked about but did not make me read . Conceivably , I might have been a more willing classicist if I had not had to read " The Battle of the Frogs and Mice " when I should have been reading The Rover Boys , if instead of Herodotus I had been allowed to read Frank Merriwell . But the important thing was that he loved books and that from my earliest consciousness it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , he was , nevertheless , always buying books , ordering them from Eastern catalogues , bringing hack a suitcase full of them from second-hand stores when business took him to Denver or San Francisco . He had the disease of printed matter , for which there is no medicine . And I read the books he bought , especially those he did not urge me to . A pleasant reputation for pedantry which I have in certain academic circles rests on reading done before I was out of high school . I have not since then read Madame de Stael , for instance , or Gaboriau , or James Hogg , or Father Prout , or The Mirror of Perfection , or Gesta Romanorum . Scores of oddities and curiosa are still lively in my mind because my father had them on his shelves . My strongest interest was produced in me so far back that I can not date it . My father 's reading in classical literature was supported by history , and though little in his library was later than Buckle , I came naturally by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work hard for and many never get . And besides Rowlandson , Gibbon , Voltaire , Lecky , and Hume , there was a history of the United States in eight or ten volumes , probably a subscription set that represented a book agent 's single victory over my father 's Jesuit degrees . It was a thoroughly bad one , for when I came to study American history I found all my preconceptions wrong ; but it was written with vigor and illustrated at the highest bent of the chromo-lithograph school . It was jingoistic and preposterous but it was fascinating , and it did the job . Its sentiments were corrected by some enormous hooks from which I got a basic lesson in history . These were bound volumes of Puck and Judge covering the ' Nineties and , what is more , covering the same ground from violently antagonistic points of view . I spent more hours with them than with any other books . They printed the light graceful poetry of the time , but mainly they filled my mind with cartoons of Cleveland , Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the slogans and dich6s of politics , with the oratory and passion of debate ? and all shifting as I shifted books , so that a personal devil in Judge was an angel of light when I turned to Puck . Long before I knew any history I understood the relativity of historical judgment , and the humorous magazines that covered Bryan 's first campaign provided a pediment for everything I have since found out about history and criticism . My father cared nothing for fiction ; I remember only Defoe among his books . His imagination was not dramatic . My mother 's was : she could not complain about the milkman 's awkwardness without composing a one-act play . My father denounced her tastes , but bought the books she liked , Michael Strogoff , Scottish Chiefs , Bulwer Lytton , F. Marion Crawford , Anthony Hope , and many like them . I must have read them but I can not remember what they were . I have written a good many stories that she told me of her frontier past but her literary taste has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the presence of books and association with people who read them . Ours was far from the largest collection in Ogden , for as the emergent millionaires began to build mansions they bought libraries in bulk ? I remember one that should have been mentioned in The Spenders . But it was incomparably the most intelligent and the most read . Much of it was anachronistic and I was to repudiate the basic assumptions on which it rested . But it did the essential thing for me ? it made reading as natural as baseball , and the problems and values of literature as fundamental a part of life as food or sleep . In all such towns as Ogden there must have been at least one like it , for it was the chronological successor of the handful of classics that went into the schoolmaster 's saddlebag when he headed westward over the ridge . III Most children will read naturally and pleasurably if given access to books ; at least eight out of ten college freshmen will not . Not all of this acquired distaste is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind changes as it matures ; but by far the greater part of it results from the mayhem committed by teachers . The first task of the college teacher of literature is to repair the damage done by his predecessors ? so far as he can . The teachers in private preparatory schools are the worst , for a deadly technic has been standardized for them ; but the high school and primary school teachers have an infinitely wider field towork in . If the grade schools taught hygiene as badly as they teach literature they would soon destroy the American race . The Ogden schools , both parochial and public , were very bad . They improved rapidly after my time , but during it they were in a soggy transition between the little red schoolhouse and the fairly competent instrument of mass instructions of the more Eastern States . They gave us neither discipline nor interest , they neither taught us nor permitted us to learn ; no intelligence or imagination went into their administration ; they were wretchedly equipped and miserably staffed . From the nuns I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Latin grammar , and I learned nothing else . Of literature , I remember only Adelaide Procter 's poems and " The King of the Golden River " that I had not learned years before . When I reached high school I promptly became an insufferable prig , for I had much more knowledge and understanding of literature than all but one of my teachers . I suppose that the literary are foredestined prigs , but the schools might labor to restrain destiny with tolerable limits In the last quarter of the century the schools had regained much of the guardianship of literature , but they had lost it over wide areas of the country . It passed to the public libraries . Our intellectuals have a clich ? which finds something essentially noble in the small public library which was formed by vote of town meeting in a period of hard times or endowed by a small-town boy who went to the big city and made his fortune ? and finds something comic and absurd in the Carnegie library . This typical literary snobbery doubtless expresses a sentiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have performed incomparably the greatest service to our culture ever made by private benefaction . What social guilt Andrew Carnegie may have had on his soul I do not know , but it has educated more Americans than anyone else who ever lived . William MeGulley may have taught his millions to read without moving their lips , and Noah Webster taught them to spell acceptably , but it was Carnegie who put books into the hands of millions ? and good books into the hands of hundreds of thousands . The Carnegie library was a place where books were to be had , and it slaked the thirst for them of my generation all over America . One might almost say that in its shelves and reading rooms the tastes of this literary generation were formed . What were they reading in the Carnegie libraries during their adolescence just before the War ? If my experience is typical , they were reading things which they could get neither at school nor at home . Darwin , Haeckel , Eucken , Henri Bergson , De Leon , Veblen , John Spargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarkington , Harry Leon Wilson , Thomas Janvier , Joel Chandler Harris , Thomas Nelson Page , George Washington Cable , Jack London , Winston Churchill , 0 . Henry . Paul Laurence Dunbar , Ridgcley Torrence , Richard LeGallienne , Richard Hovey , Percy Mackaye , William Vaughan Moody . And especially the five who were our great preceptors , Shaw , Bennett , Wells , Chesterton , Galsworthy . Such lists suggest that the library was the bridge from the early nineteenth century to the twentieth . It shows too that contemporary literature , as the town broadened its reading , was what the East said it was ? English literature . Contemporary literature was the five great Englishmen , and I am grateful enough that the town had grown up that far ; but the insurgent Americans . then making their first appearance , did not exist for the library . It had LeGallienne , it did not have A. E. Robinson ; I heard of him from Wilbert Snow , the year after I left high school . My father bad subscribed to Reedy 's Mirror for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Spoon River Anthology , but it was not in the library and I did not we Harriet Monroe 's Poetry till I got to Harvard . Also informative is the fact that there was no local history except an Apostle 's pious account of the Mormon Church . A. A. Kerr , the anthropologist , told me about the Spanish priests and the fur traders who were the first explorers of the Rocky Mountains . I could not find out about them at the library and I doubt whether , even as late as 1914 , there were any Western Americana in Ogden except such disregarded ones as survived in attics . When I last visited Ogden the library had an excellent collection and numerous private collectors had appeared , but that development is wholly post-war . The Mormons annually celebrated July 24th , Pioneer Day , and in Salt Lake City they had an excellent historical museum . But the Historical Society was still in the folklore stage , and even in that stage had few supporters . This is the period of indifference to origins that maddens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage all over the country . Grandfather 's journal is used to pack dishes with , and when you finally catch up with the first-hand eyewitness account of the Indian massacre it has been left in a gunny sack in the barn , where mice and mildew have attended to it . The town was not to produce its first local antiquarian till some years later ? the possessed physician wrote his classical epic , the literary mining promoter wrote tales like Poe 's . That fact implies a great tragedy . Even in my adolescence there were many pioneers left , and many more had died during my childhood . There they were ; their stories were a part of the tradition to which the West gave its liveliest lip-service ; my own grandfather was a flowing spring of reminiscence . But mostly they were disregarded . No one took down what they had to say , sifted it , studied it , checked it , put it in its frame . They made speeches on Old Folks ' Day , a few of them wrote fumbling letters to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write his memoirs ? very badly and with no sense of values , as I found out when , later on , some of the manuscripts came into my hands . The best of what they had to tell us is lost : the residuum , collected or set down when the town at last took thought of its heritage , is the less dependable and more superficial half . Veterans of the Oregon and Mormon emigrations , of the Indian wars , the handcart companies ; miners , railroad builders , desert rats , prospectors , buffalo hunters , scouts , drovers , bullwhackers , cowmen ? they were allowed to die without recording themselves ; for no one was interested in what they had to say . It is a strange thing that my interest in Western history , which has been my most sustained study , was not thrust on me by the Western commonwealth . I got it in the United States Army and at Harvard College . IV The widening facilities of the library show how the town 's reading had grown since my childhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youths ? adolescents , I mean , who were bookworms and had the genuine passion . There were a good many more girls , but we avoided them ; we held that they were at best conventional and at worst " phoney . " They read T. Tembarom because Mrs. F. told them to , we believed , and they also played the piano horribly from the same urge that made their mothers burn designs on leather . Whereas , we felt sure , our own reading of , well , say Ernest Dowson , marked us as the elect . I wonder , as this generation of literary men begin to write their memoirs , that they can take this universal ? and universally pompous ? phase so solemnly . The basic illusion of the literary is that there is something at once virtuous and exquisite in having read a book ? that to read a book , and still more to write one , marks you as more intelligent and far more sensitive and informed than the philistines who play cards instead . We had it in a virulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must have belonged to the elect by the narrowest margin , for I have become a writer and so corrupted the amateur spirit with professionalism . Still there was no prophecy of that at the time . I expected to be a mineralogist till laboratory work proved that idea optimistic , and Harvard turned me toward psychiatry till the War made graduate study impossible . Eddie and Fitz and I supplemented the library in a way that must have been characteristic of our type everywhere . An era of the national culture ended when Everyman 's Library went to ninety cents . It was thirty-five cents in our day ( with a leather edition at eighty cents , in which I sadly remember I owned Sesame and Lilies and Travels with a Donkey ) , and we ordered them singly through Spargo 's Book Store ; for there was no demand to justify their being stocked . One day the manager offered to buy any list we might select and let us have them piecemeal as we might afford them . We ordered something over fifty apiece and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deduce something about the local culture from the titles but can not , and of my own list remember chiefly that it was preposterously ambitious . It leaned heavily toward folklore and medieval chronicles , but it also soared toward the unreadable . I had the Koran so that I might appear learned in arguments about the Mormon metaphysics , and The Seven Lamps of Architecture for some reasons I can not recover ; but I never managed to get through either of them . At seventeen or short of it I proposed to read not only the Kalevala and the Afabinogion but the Indian epics as well , and several times charged into the Ramayana and Mahabharata , but never got very far . The defeat troubled me and for years I took the book abort the country with me , then finally decided that I need no longer try to live up to my adolescence . There were works like The Social Contract , Butler 's Analogy of Religion . Galton 's Inquiry . and Aristotle 's Politics ; there were Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less obstinately but eventually contented myself with the righteousness of owning them . There is another vice of the literary , who suppose that there is also something rare and fine in owning a book and that to know the name of one is equivalent to mastering it . But there were other items on my list which I read without affectation and to my permanent satisfaction : Emerson 's essays , which did not exist for the high school ; Herman Melville 's three best books , which I thus discovered years before his centenary informed the literary that here was one of those martyrs to American materialism in whom the ' Twenties were oddly to specialize ; Pepys ' diary , which I read with a greater fascination than any book before it had produced . My list ? and those of my friend ? differed in detail rather than in kind , reflected a sentiment from the nation at large and especially from the West , which at that exact moment was beginning to be self-conscious about its culture . Dr. Eliot had carelessly remarked that a fivefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal education , and publishers had immediately required him to name the books . The notion may certainly be called American , for such a list insures one against wasting time on what does not go directly to the point , and so appeals to the practical middle class . But that you can get education , culture , or virtue in a lump by observing a prescribed ritual is even more a literary notion . The literary always believe that there are certain authors , certain ideas , certain attitudes which lead to salvation , that toward any end there is one right path , that a certain sum of reading makes you a priest and lawgiver , that a certain book is the philosopher 's stone and a certain pattern of beliefs the sum of knowledge and truth . I was never more a literary person than at seventeen when I believed that the Koran and the Ramayana would advance me beyond the vulgar and admit me to salvation . My soul must have been saved many times during thoseyears , for I have seen a good many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high to conduct the literary over into camp ground . At the moment it is Marx and Engels , whom we used to debate on the banks of a swimming hole in the Weber River at the foot of Twenty-Fifth Street when we were sophomores in 1912 . We must not forget one typical figure who was indigenous to the small town in that stage of culture all over the United States . She was either a high school teacher or a librarian and she was the pure amateur of books , a woman who lived for literature and waged a bitter warfare against the horny-minded who scorned it . Floyd Dell , Edgar Lee Masters , Burton Rascoe have described her , and most literary men of this generation must remember her . In fact , she must have made many of them into literary men ; for when she found a youth who shared her passion , brought his ideas to her , and at last brought his sonnets too , it would be inevitable for her to serve literature by nurturing this strange blossom in the wasteland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of literary adolescents . It was at her house , or her boarding house , that they found encouragement , a defensive alliance , the talk that they could find nowhere else . For the youth himself she was a fortress of strength and confirmation ; she renewed his identity , armed him against scorn , coddled and mothered him , fiercely led him on to more discriminating taste . For the culture as a whole she was a focus of effective propaganda . Resented , derided , laughed at , she preached the gospel to the Philistines , and if the nation has a wider toleration of literature than it had fifty years ago , if there is a higher percentage of readers , then some thousands of her scattered from the Alleghenies to Puget Sound are one of the primary causes . That deflected psychological energies were responsible for Mrs. F. , and I have no doubt for many of the others , does not matter . Her mission to the Ogdenites had lasted ten years when it reached me in my last year at high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary people were pure phantasy or were taken direct from a reading wider than my own , nevertheless , they were the first ones I ever heard . It was not she but an English hostess who sat with Kipling in a tree , not she but a Chicago clubwoman who heard that tragic autobiography from James Whitcomb Riley 's lips , not she but the daughter of a novelist to whom Paul Laurence Dunbar offered a gloved hand . But I and the bemused handful of my kind heard the anecdotes and for the first time writers were human beings in our minds . Mrs. F. had never learned how all too human they were , and I had to derive that from Bill Snow 's stories the next year . But the human level was enough , and I walked with Mrs. F. in the foothills , sat late at her house , argued , declaimed , recited with her , and in her company literature was a natural way of life . I owe her little guidance for I had come a long way on my own by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , and the Irish revival , and a number of preciosities which served me also when I came to teach . Yeats , Fiona MacLeod , Ossian ? that strain in particular . And the emancipated Wells , the stirrings of feminism , the decorous intrusion of sex into contemporary writing . And during my first year at college she wrote commanding me to read Ernest Poole 's The Harbor . The literature of this age began for me with that novel . It must have begun there for many of my contemporaries . But with Mrs. F. we have reached the last stage of the transition in Ogden . The other agencies of the new culture were beginning to work by this time . The town had grown larger and vulgarer , but it had also acquired a feeling that books were essential to the well-ordered life . The first collector appeared , a man who bought by price alone and filled his shelves with a miscellany from advertised remainder sales . The frontier housewife had been metamorphosed into a charter member of the Ladies ' Culture Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorosis , and the Drama League . A couple of hundred of them talked books now , several score bought them for the living room , a couple of dozen read them . The clubs too were to change and become a rather better implement of the intelligence ? and in fact , to scorn them at all is a literary snobbery . For if they did not much understand books at least they tried to , and if they were unsophisticated at least they boosted royalty statements , and if in short they were not in the know , as the literary must be , at least they sent the literary to college on scholarships and supported them after they were out . So the literary turned to writing novels which showed how crude and uninformed these patient womcn were , and presently were telling them so to their faces at from fifty to two hundred dollars an afternoon . The Newness was here and , as with all Newnesses , the literary were whooping it up . The Drama League was an unmistakable portent of the new age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogden , to return only for visits thereafter . My literary inheritance from the place was jumbled and crisscrossed and none of its colors matched ? but all literary inheritances arc chaotic . Doubtless the progressive schools do better by our children , when they permit them to read at all ; but the most thoroughly Deweyized child in all America will get no greater enthusiasm from his project in Einstein and Max Weber than was freely available in the Wasatch peaks before projects and the Drama League were born of the same egg .
