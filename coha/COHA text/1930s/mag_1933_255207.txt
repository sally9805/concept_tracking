Land , Breweries , Perfumeries <P> Sirs : <P> You will doubtless be amused to learn of some of the business deals which have been offered to me since the story of my Russian business adventures appeared in TIME ( Aug. 21 ) . I have been offered land and tracts of timber in almost every state in the Union . Innumerable propositions have been made to me to participate in a great variety of businesses , ranging from breweries to perfumeries . <P> I have had many offers to augment my collection of Czarist Treasures by acquiring jewels and works of art which once belonged to bygone crowned heads of Europe . <P> These propositions have not been confined to the mail ( which would fill a few good-sized mail bags ) , but sheaves of telegrams and even long distance phone calls have resulted . <P> What interested me specially was the fact that there were no letters from cranks as far as I could judge which is a compliment to the TIME-type of readers . <P> <P> ARMAND HAMMER <P> New York City <P> Outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all Assyrians living in Chicago and vicinity , our Council avails itself of this opportunity to thank you for the very fair and intelligent comment in your magazine of Aug. 28 on the recent Assyrian massacres in Irak . To our knowledge , thus far , your magazine has shown a far more thorough understanding of the underlying evils that produce such outrages than any other newspaper or periodical . <P> We sincerely believe the best way to prevent such atrocities in future is through continued exposure by such influential periodicals as TIME . May we hope , in the interests of justice and humanity , that your great magazine will continue to inform its readers of future developments in Irak ? <P> <P> JONATHAN S. COLIA <P> Secretary <P> Council of Assyrian Societies Chicago , Ill . <P> <P> Sincere Irak <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of Aug. 28 , p. 13 , col. 1 , I read under the title Irak certain views on the Assyrian incident on which I wish to make some comments . <P> I find in the article such expressions as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to the massacre of Assyrians or other Christians ; " " . . . started a slaughter of all Assyrians he could lay hands on ; " " . . . few days of fanatical Mohammedan slaughter . " <P> In referring to a Mohammedan government or people some Western writers seem to find it difficult to discard a view associated with the old Ottoman regime to which they give such sensational expression as is conveyed by the statements " massacre of Christians " and " fanatical Mohammedan slaughter . " Such reference is a misrepresentation of the actual prevailing intentions on the part of Mohammedans , people and government , in Irak and other Arab countries . <P> Irak , of which I am a citizen , is ruled in accordance with Western political principles and practices , and its responsible people believe in , and live up to , the modern idealism of the West . <P> The Assyrian incident , which was composed in London into a world-redounding episode of horror , is in reality one in which the Iraki government was placed on the defensive by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
