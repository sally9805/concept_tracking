THE SEVEN WHO FLED-Frederic Prokosch-Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> Listen . There is only one victory possible for a man-that of having lost with a certain dignity of heart , at least , and nobility of spirit . That is all , that is all , and it will always be all ! <P> When a huge , innocent-eyed , pockmarked Russian exile named Serafimov came out alive after his flight across China , those words expressed all that he had distilled out of his experience . Expelled with six other Europeans by the Bolsheviks from " the very middle of Asia , " later held in custody in Aqsu . Serafimov had spent a winter in a particularly colorful environment of Asiatic depravity , had fallen in love with a haggard Russian prostitute and , having finally touched the lowest depth of despair and loneliness , had attained a lasting state of grace by strangling a companion fugitive . <P> This week Serafimov 's violent adventures and mystical strivings , together with the equally searing experiences of his six companions , formed the substance of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novel competition ( $7,500 ) , seemed likely to impress readers as the most unusual selection thus far. * The work of Frederic Prokosch , 28-year-old author of The Asiatics ( 1935 ) and The Assassins ( 1936 ) , The Seven Who Fled is distinguished by its sensuous imagery , queer plot and elusive symbolism , as well as by a tantalizing , ambiguous philosophical message which will leave most readers wondering if they have got Author Prokosch 's meaning straight . <P> Like the characters in Thornton Wilder 's The Bridge of San Luis Rey , who were united through the device of having them tumble to their death together when an Andean bridge collapsed , the characters in The Seven Who Fled are strung together only through the accident of their common expulsion , the similarity of their final nihilistic verdict on human affairs . <P> When Soviet machinations in revolution-torn Sinkiang province brought an order to get rid of all " questionable " foreigners , the roundup produced seven individuals as mysterious as Serafimov , who traveled together until further machinations caused a further splitting up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratlike Belgian named Goupillire . A murderer himself , Goupillire 's face was " as subtle as a woman 's , as ambiguous as a thief 's , " since it was divided by an ugly scar left when a mistress had tried to kill him with a pair of scissors . Through the months of their captivity in Aqsu , he subtly goaded Serafimov to madness , yet achieved his own spiritual tranquillity at the moment Serafimov 's fingers closed around his throat .
