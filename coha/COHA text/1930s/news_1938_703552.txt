txt Appealing for a closer bond between the producers of the South and the consumers of the North , Mayor La Guardia in an address here tonight called for better understanding between the two sections of the country . In contrast to President Roosevelt 's statement that the South was the No. 1 economic problem of the nation , the Mayor put stress on the economic problems of the North . He told his audience of 1,000 in the Texas League ball park that there was little , if any , difference between the economic troubles of the two sections of the country . " The South produces cotton , the North uses cotton , " the Mayor said . " The South produces oil , the North uses oil . The South produces tobacco , the North smokes tobacco . The South produces sugar , the North consumes sugar . " On the other hand , the North produces clothing . The South needs clothing . The North produces shoes , the South requires shoes . The North produces steel which the South needs , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asks " Inventory " of Problems " We have many centers of art and-music , and the South loves art and music . We in the North have the financial center of the world , not to exploit other sections of the country , but to handle your money in safe fashion . " We in the North as well as you in the South should take inventory of our problems . If we do , we will soon see that it will not be difficult to rearrange our affairs to our mutual advantage . " This country needs unity now as it never did before . It needs unity in parties as well as unity between parties . Sabotage of the government today is as bad as sabotage in wartime . We need unity in government . " In welcoming Mayor LaGuardia and his party , Governor Richard W. Leche of Louisiana said that his visitors came " from a little town in the northeast corner of the country . " He added that he called New York a little town because " it is so much smaller than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mayor La Guardia , speaking over ' a Statewide radio hook-up , said : " I want to extend to all of you an invitation to attend our World 's Fair  --  the greatest , grandest , most magnificent fair that has ever been held . Though the climate of New York may be somewhat cooler than that of Louisiana , you will find a warm and sincere welcome there . " The Mayor said that he had received suggestions on what he should say in Shreveport , but that he had decided to follow his custom of telling his audience exactly what he thought . Recalling that during the World War emergency he had seen politics laid aside , he added : " If we could stand together for a great war which involved the destruction of life and property , why ca n't we stand together now when the preservation of our own country is concerned " Comparing the nation in a time of economic emergency with a small town swept by a disastrous flood , he said that there was no essential difference between the two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they had left , apportion food and fuel to the needy and distribute their other resources in accordance with the greatest need . For fourteen years as a member of Congress the Mayor said he had tried to drive home the community of interest between agricultural and industrial sections of the country . Wage Bill al Recovery Step Turning to the application of the Wages and Hours Bill the Mayor said that the stabilization of labor conditions throughout the country would be a tremendous benefit . He declared that an impoverished working class was a detriment not only to its local community , but to the nation as well . - " Under this bill , " he ' said , " hundreds of thousands of Americans will for the first time get their first taste of a proper standard of living . " Asserting that this standard was one which " every American should be able to have if he is willing to work , " he continued : " I want to ask complete cooperation in the administration of this law , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . We do n't want any industry that depends on exploiting labor and paying starvation wages . " No one pretends that this bill will perform miracles , but it starts off with a minimum wage and sets a maximum . Once it is in full effect , you will find that your purchasing power will go up . " Business will improve because of the increased circulation of money ; some industries will find that when they must- pay a man 's wage they must employ a man , and. , not a little child . The place for the American child is in school , and not in the factory . " Pointing out that New York had 1,300,000 school children with 36,000 teachers , he declared that he wanted every child throughout the country to have an equal chance for schooling . Farm Surplus Disposal The Mayor then discussed the reported surplus of farm production in the country , and asserted : " We can not say that there is a surplus until all the ordinary and necessary wants of the people are fulfilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got* proper bed sheets . What we need in bed sheets is more cotton and less starch . " If the farm children of this country had the proper nourishment  --  the proper amount of milk and eggs in their diet  --  there would be no agricultural surplus . And these are the children of the very people who produce these things . " Heritage of Americans Stressing his progressive principles , he insisted that the writers of the Constitution could not have foreseen present day advances in science and machinery . For example , he said that they could not envisage a country so closely connected by modern transportation that he could be home for breakfast tomorrow morning if he chose . The Mayor closed with a reiteration of his conviction that there must be a uniform system of unemployment insurance administered by the National Government . With this country 's wealth of tre- , mendous natural resources , he said , the American people should not spair , but should work out their problems through cooperation .

On his arrival here this afternoon , the Mayor was met by Governor Leche of Louisiana and local ( ) Metals . Sam Caldwell , Mayor of Shreveport , met his train three hours before it arrived and accompanied him into the city . From the station the Mayor and his party drove in an open car through the streets of Shreveport in a heavy shower , with the city 's residents lining the sidewalks to give him an enthusiastic welcome . The party drove to Barksdale Field , largest airport in the world , and were received there by Brig . Gen. F. L. Martin , field commandant . Because of the bad weather , the Mayor asked that the scheduled air maneouvres in his honor be abandoned . With the airport visit curtailed , the Mayor went to his hotel in Shreveport , where he rested . At 6 o'clock he attended a banquet of 300 prominent Louisianans before driving out to the ball park for hiss night speech .
