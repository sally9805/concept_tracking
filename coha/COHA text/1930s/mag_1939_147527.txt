As a theatre town Milwaukee is underweight ; its two barnlike theatres just mosey along . No light chore was it , therefore , when Off-and-On-Broadway Myron C. Pagan tackled Milwaukee 's carriage trade last June to back a repertory company . But Fagan got his money , and last month started producing . <P> Last week came a play of Pagan 's own and with it the clue to how he wangled his cash . Pagan 's To the End of Time proved to be a lashing attack on John L. Lewis . Called John Steele in the play and portrayed as a scoundrel , he dies in Act II , goes to Heaven only long enough to be lambasted , then is booted out . <P> In turn Milwaukee 's critics booted the play , joked that the town 's anti-labor overlords had backed a walleyed nag . Milwaukee 's C. I. O. leaders merely sat tight . For them it was enough that To the End of Time was playing to half-empty houses .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
