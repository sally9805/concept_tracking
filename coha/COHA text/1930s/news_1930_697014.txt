txt Bolivia takes the stand that she is " bound to take military measures " to defend her sovereignty , it is stated in a cablegram to the secretariat received tonight from Foreign ' Minister Fabian Vaca Chavez at La Paz . The message , which was immediately forwarded to August Zaleski , Foreign Minister of Poland and acting president of the League Council , is causing serious concern in the limited circles aware of its arrival : The Bolivian statement , which is understood to be a reply to M. Zaleski 's recent warning to Bolivia and Paraguay to remember their covenant engagements , Is considered to ' increase the possibility of the Colin1 cil having to be summoned in extraordinary session . although there still remain other measures the League can take before going to that extreme . Much depends now on Paraguay 's reply , which is anxiously awaited . The Bolivian Foreign Minister , it is learned from a reliable source , begins by affirming that Bolivia never , provoked Paraguay by its attitude I and asserts that Bolivia from the be , ginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States , Cuba , Mexico , Colombia and Uruguay in 1929 . He adds that Bolivia also accepted the Uruguayan proposal on behalf of the above committee of five to put into execution the terms , of the protocol settling definitely the Chaco frontier . incidents of 1928 . Attitude Now Changed . But , adds the Bolivian Foreign Minister , this was the attitude up to the " regrettable " incidents of Jan. 16 . Faced by a new situation , his message concludes , Bolivia is " bound to take military measures " in order to safeguard her sovereignty . The incidents referred to are those of which Paraguay complained a few days ago to the League , causing M. Zaleski to issue the League 's warning and for which Bolivia , in turn , already had blamed Paraguay . The Bolivian message tonight was considered especially serious because it tends to confirm recent charges Paraguay made to the League that Bolivia is preparing for war and because it does not contain any promise to keep the peace . The Bolivian Foreign Minister , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and released today , stated that the Bolivian Government would " never be guilty of disturbing the peace of America . " This earlier message , dated at La Paz yesterday , was in reply to the original complaint that Paraguay filed at Geneva on Jan. 21 . TI : . Secretariat 's delay in releasing it is explained as due to the obscurity of the wording , making translation difficult . Protest Is Reiterated . In this first message received from Bolivia the Foreign Minister also reaffirmed , his protest against the Paraguayan version of the frontier incident , which Ramon Cdtadella , her League delegate , already had made . Tonight 's Bolivian message has not been released yet . It was received after all officials had left the Secretariat save a lone " peace sentinel " ? the League always keeps one official on duty at the Secretariat at nights and on Sundays and holidays precisely for such emergencies . This official immediately informed Sir Eric Drummond , the Secretary General , who conferred at once ' with other high officials of the Secretariat . One high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " clear appeal to the right of legitimate defense " on the part of Bolivia . There is a possibility that , as a result of this wire , M. Zaleski may ask Sir Eric not only to circulate it among Council members , but intimate to them to be prepared for anl eventual convocation of an extraordinary session of the Council . Such a. procedure was followed in December . 1928 , when , after the Lugano session of the Council , the BolivianParaguay dispute seemed to be developing seriously . Other steps , however , might be taken before the Council actually was convened . Thus , Council members may first exchange views quickly on the eventual necessity of intervening by establishingt for instance , a commission of inquiry of South American League members . The impression in Geneva is ? that M. Zaleski and some others influential iii League circles are favorable to ' the idea of the League pushing its intervention even to the extent of summoning the Council in the midst of tile London naval conference .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
