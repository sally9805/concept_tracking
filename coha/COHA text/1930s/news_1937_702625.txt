txt Fulfillment by the Valencia Government of Spain 's obligations in connection with certain credits has elicited favorable comment among financial circles in the City of London . It is especially gratifying to the Spanish Government to observe that in the same breath the financial stability of the Fianco Government is questioned . London has apparently taken up a definite stand in the matter of the gold of the Bank of Spain and the rights of the Valencia Government to use it for its own purposes . Again and again in the foreign press the statemont. made by the Burgos Government , that the gold had been stolen from the shareholders of the Bank of Spain , has been published and taken for granted . Gold Is Usable It is now pointed out in neutral circles that the Valencia Govern- I ment is fully entitled to utilize the j gold of the Bank of Spain for its financial requirements and that especially in England . whose Government considers that of Valencia the rightfid ** of Spain , no other view is possible .

This has forced the Valencia authorities to take action in one sense or the other and after some delay the " Madlon " bills , as they are called , have been met . These payments were connected with credits granted prior to the adoption of the AngloSpanish clearing center . for which the Madrid Exchange Control Office gave a'n undertaking to provide sterling cover on maturity .

Finally , the Valencia Government has decided to pay the bills pending the outcome of the dispute about the blocked balances . Lombard Street draws a comparison of the attitude of Valencia with that of General Franco 's Government . This is severely criticized for adopting " Germanic " principles and compelling British companies working in Spain to surrender the proceeds of their exports at 45 pesetas to the pound sterling . The semi-official quotation in the City stood at the time at round about 70 pesetas to the pound but it was known that " inside " purchases of pesetas were being made at DO .                    @
