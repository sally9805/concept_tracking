It was suddenly Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek 's party when 40 members of the Nationalist Central Executive Committee arrived in Nanking last week for their fourth congress . A month ago , with six revolts crackling under him , Chiang looked like a heavy loser . Picking the key revolt , he cracked down hard on the Fukien rebels headed by smart Trinidad-born Eugene Chen and General Tsai Ting-kai 's famed 19th Route Army . His marines marched into Foochow , the rebel capital , almost unopposed because the veterans of the 19th Route Army who stood off Japan in the Battle of Shanghai have been largely replaced by stumbling recruits . Reeling southward last week the rebels paused briefly at a new capital , Chang-chow . From the coast and from the north , more Chiang troops came to hound General Tsai and his army into the back country . <P> Like jackals , Canton troops raced north to snap up abandoned towns before Nanking did . A batch of rebel politicians led by Eugene Chen moped off on a Hong-kong-bound steamer . <P> Some Chinese said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver dollars to retreat . But nobody claimed that the Nationalist executive session could do much but listen to Victor Chiang 's " plans for the coming year . "
