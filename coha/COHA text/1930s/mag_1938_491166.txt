B ENEATH a flat slab of concrete , in the shadow of the towering skyscraper capitol he built at Baton Rouge , the body of Huey Pierce Long ' ' lies a-mouldering in the grave , but his soul goes marching on , " in the legislative halls , the oil and rice fields and over the bayous and the canebrakes of his native Louisiana . In his lifetime the august and stately capitol was known derisively as " Huey 's Silo . " Since his death it is spoken of in awe , by pilgrims from far and near , as one of many monuments to his greatness . Whatever may have been true of earlier tyrants , in the case of this first . American dictator , it was the evil that he did which was interred with his hones . The good appears to have lived on in the minds and memories of his people . Onee regarded as a menace to American institutions , Huey has passed quite naturally from political martyrdom to a sort of secular sainthood which imbues his name with magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaders , Occasionally it appears linked with that of a duly canonized saint in the newspapers of rural parishes when some simple soul wishes to render public thanksgiving for a material or spiritual blessing . The people of Louisiana have made August thirtieth , the date of his humble birth at Winnfield , a public holiday . The first Wednesday in May is now Huey P. Long Educational Memorial Day , when the children of the state lay aside their studies and , with appropriate ceremonies , chant the praises of the man who socked the Standard Oil Company to pay for the free schoolbooks which they now enjoy . The legislature , which Long once bossed as Hitler rules the Reichstag , has decreed that no other mortal shall share the hallowed ground where he rests in final slumber , and it has provided that , in due time , an imposing monument shall rise above his grave . It may well be that Huey Long , in addition to founding an evangelical economic cult plucked from the Pentateuch , established a dynasty as well . His widow already has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant governor , seems destined to be the next chief executive of Louisiana . His son , Russell , is studying law and his father 's plans for sharing the nation 's wealth . Having achieved something of a reputation as a campus politician at Louisiana State University , he is biding his time , with both ears cocked for the people 's call . While they join loudly in singing his praises , the politicians who came after Huey have been busily engaged in undoing much of his handiwork , and there are some who accuse them of " eating up the cake the Kinglish made . " Little by little , the dictatorship he created within constitutional limits has been whittled away ; " Share Our Wealth , " the economic hocus-pocus which Huey used as a political weapon , has been allowed to fall into innocuous desuetude , and his old war with the Roosevelt Administration has ended in an inglorious peace which has been described , mockingly , as the " second Louisiana purchase . " Although the followers whom he trained in the art of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward manifestations of Long 's rule have passed into unhappy memory . The secret police , once the terror of anti-Long politicians , have been absorbed into a stale-police department , set up under civil-service rules . The bodyguards with whom Long surrounded himself to ward off the death which finally overtook him are seen no more in their old roles . Joe Messina , the chief gun toter for the Kingfish , has a job watching the watchmen on the New Orleans docks , and Murphy Roden. who killed Long 's assassin , is second in command of the new state police , having completed a course of study at J. Edgar Hoover 's school for G men , in Washington , D. C.

Nor does the citizen of New Orleans or Baton Rouge go to sleep at night , not knowing whether he will had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that has passed , and with it , the fear of self-expression which was characteristic of Long 's opposition while he lived . Once the lid was off , the gossips and the rumor mongers had a field day , and , even now , in Louisiana , there is more slander and libel to the square inch of political conversation than anywhere else in these United States . Three men now run the political bone-crusher which Long 's ingenuity manufactured . Together they make an effective composite substitute for him , especially since , with the Kingfish dead , the opposition , held together chiefly by common hatred of him , has broken up or been converted to the kind of " progress " which his machine represents . They are Richard W. Leche , now governor of Louisiana , Robert Maestri , the mayor of New Orleans , and Seymour Weiss , managing director of The Roosevelt Hotel , in New Orleans . Maestii , a wealthy real-estate operator , won Huey Long 's friendship and appreciation in the days when the Kingfish was threatened with impeachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to fight the move to evict him from the executive mansion . Conservation commissioner of the stale when Long was killed , Maestri has a great deal of the late senator 's horse sense about the details of politics . Weiss , who climbed the ladder to success in the hotel business from the bottom , has all of Huey 's shrewd business sense with a great deal more suaveness and diplomacy . He was unoffieial treasurer of the party in Huey 's time and risked a citation for contempt by keeping his mouth shut when investigators sought enlightenment about party finances . Governor Leche was secretary to Governor Oscar Kelley Allen , known , appropriately , during the reign of the Kingfish , as " O.K. " Allen . Huey used to say that he needed someone like Leehe in the governor 's office to make sure that his orders were executed and that no independent skulduggery was undertaken . Mr. Leche filled this assignment so well that Long elevated him , before his death , to the Court of Appeals . Young Mr. Leehe , athletic-looking , genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the organization . These three , Leche , Weiss and Maestri , combine enough of the characteristics of Huey Long to enable them to dominate a state in which he had pretty successfully crushed all opposition . None of them has a trace of his genius for incurring love and hatred , and none has the dynamic quality of leadership which made him a national figure . Not one of the three has any political ambition which extends beyond the borders of Louisiana , but they have succeeded in bringing to Louisiana an era of good feeling and prosperity , not in the least diminished by the flood of Federal money that has flowed into the state sinceHuey 's Homeric bellowings were silenced. 1-low this happy state of affairs came to pass forms an interesting chapter of contemporary history . On the day when Long was buried . 150,000 to 200,000 persons turned out to witness the burial , many of them believing , in their hearts , that they were attending the funeral of the first American President to be assassinated before his election . Not all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of rejoicing . The flowers , though , were proof that he had friends as well as enemies . Among them were American Beauties and orchids bearing the names of great and powerful figures here and abroad , and humble bouquets of daisies and wild flowers plucked from the fields by men , women and children too poor to buy more imposing floral offerings . Banarta  --  Republic Politics T HE flowers , spread out on the 1,440,000 square feet of ground in the esplanade before the capitol , hid the grass almost completely . It was an impressive token of the love and affection in which Huey 's memory was held by thousands in Louisiana . But at night the guard posted over the grave served as a reminder that there was bitter hatred , too , for then it became known that secret agents of the Long machine had heard that there was a plot afoot to dynamite the grave and " blow his stinking carcass to smithereens . " Huey left a state on the verge of civil war .

Organizations of minute men met secretly in the rural parishes , and , in the cities , men gathered in hotels and private homes to plot the overthrow of the dictator . Talk of assassination was a common thing wherever the enemies of . the King-fish got together . The atmosphere was like that of a banana republic on the brink of revolution . When , at length , he was shot and killed by Dr. Carl A. Weiss , Jr. , an obscure throat specialist of Baton Rouge , whose father-in-law was about to ? be gerrymandered out of a job by Huey 's legislature , then in special session  --  the seventh in 1935 ? it was freely predicted that his political juggernaut would fall to pieces , like the " wonderful one-boss shay . " Fora time it seemed that the predictions might prove correct , for , in the days immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in a devil-take-the-hindmost scramble for power and glory . The Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith , now engaged in a mighty crusade to save the nation from Communism , struck first . While the politicos who had let the Kingfish do their thinking for them for seven years sat stunned in their tents , the former preacher , a paid Long organizer for the Share Our Wealth Society , developed his own slate of candidates for governor , lieutenant governor and United States senator . It looked for a time as though Brother Smith , who had studied diligently at the feet of the master , was going to put it over , but at the cost of unity among the political heirs of Huey Long . Unfortunately for the preacher politician , however , whispers reached Seymour Weiss that Brother Smith had formed a personal dislike for him , although the preacher hastened to disavow this loudly . Mr. Weiss , incidentally , was under indictment by a Federal grand jury at the time , for income-tax fraud , and it is fair to assume that he was somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Hon. James A. Farley and other New Dealers , whom Mr. Smith came very close to accusing of sharing the responsibility for the leader 's death . At any rate , a caucus of the more practical-minded men of the Long organization was held and it was recalled that , just before he was shot , Huey had named Mr. Leche as his candidate for governor . The former secretary to the governor thus was nominated , as it were , posthumously by the Kingfish . Even the Reverend Mr. Smith could not hold out against this decisive stroke , and he surrendered with such grace as he could , leaving Lieutenant Governor James A. Noe , one of the state 's richest oil men and his own candidate for governor , way out on a limb , but exacting for himself the promise that he would he secretary to Governor Allen when that worthy statesman inherited the toga which fell from Huey 's shoulders .

Alas , Governor Allen dropped dead in his office in the capitol and was succeeded , fora brief time , by none other than the very Mr. Noe who , rightly or wrongly , believed himself to have been sold out by the minister . Mr. Noe was the de judo , but not the de jure lieutenant governor . Ile had been elected president pro tem. of the senate to fill a vacancy . He had not been elected lieutenant governor . But Mr. Noe reasoned that since he was performing duties assigned to the lieutenant governor the senate had intended to give him that title too . From the time of Mr. Noe 's accession to the throne Brother Gerald was a gone goose in Louisiana . He made frantic efforts to tie up with Eugene Talmadge , of Georgia , and , as a steppingstone to greater things , served as a director of Dr. Francis E. Townsend 's Old Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay roll until after the election in the January following Huey 's assassination , but his days were numbered . He performed useful service to the organization in the campaign , waving a Bible and fulminating against Long 's enemies at Share Our Wealth rallies of optimistic rustics . As soon as Mr. Leche and his running mates were elected , however , they threw Brother Gerald to the wolves . He says it was because they wanted to scuttle Share Our Wealth and make peace with the Administration . Lech ? says it was because the minister wanted to collect dues from the Share Our Wealth Society members . There never was much doubt about the outcome of that campaign , which was fought on the dual issue of Huey 's martyrdom and repudiation of the New Deal . Representative Cleveland Dear , an anti-Long Now Deal congressman , was the opposition candidate for governor , but despite ( Continued on Page 591 HUZY90 HEIRS fCentraued team Page 7 , T all the patronage and Federal cash thrown into Louisiana to defeat the Long machine , Mr. Dear was snowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his running mates except two or three who won seats in the state house of representatives and senate . To make doubly sure of the outcome , however , the followers of Long deemed it advisable from time to time to have the martyred Huey address his followers " from the grave , " and so , at several rallies , phonograph records of speeches be had made just before his assassination were played to supplement the campaign oratory of the living . With Governor Leche there was elected as lieutenant governor , Earl Long , Huey 's brother , who had held no public office in the latter years of the dictator 's life , he holding that Earl , after having testified against him at a senate hearing , must first demonstrate his renewed loyalty . Governor Allen was elected to serve out Huey 's unexpired term , but his death occurred before he could take his seat , and Governor Noe made the gallant gesture of appointing the widowed Mrs. Long to that office , thus insuring her of a change of scene and a **25;1433;TOOLONG salary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as different in disposition and outlook from Huey Long as two men could possibly be . He is pacific where Huey was bellicose . Politics was Huey 's life . He thrived on it and loved it . To Leche the hurly-burly of office-seeking and office-holding is a nuisance to be tolerated . Huey thirsted for power , while Leche finds the exercise of it distasteful . Hunting and fishing are his major interests and he detests anything that interferes with his hobbies . He says that he wo n't run for senator because he would have to live in Washington . He ca n't conceive a worse fate . Born of a Roman Catholic father and a Protestant mother , formal religion has little interest for him . Ile once told Huey Long that religion , as he understood it , was merely preparation for an after life . The only kind of immortality that interested him , he said , was that enjoyed by the American Indian who went to the Happy Hunting Ground . Years later , at a party caucus , held just before Long was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his choice for the gubernatorial nomination . , Amid the gnashing of teeth among the disappointed hopefuls at the statement , someone remarked that not even Huey Long could elect a Catholic governor of Louisiana . " He ai n't a Catholic , " said Huey . " He 's an Indian . " The Washington Retreat The Democratic National Convention was a scant six months away when Huey 's followers demonstrated conclusively at the January election that , with or without a Kingfish for a leader , they could win , hands down , in any contest with the National Administration and its Louisiana stooges . A great light began to dawn in Washington , and overtures toward peace were made . The Government 's case against Abe Shuahan , one of Long 's henchmen , for income-tax fraud had failed to result in a conviction , although it had been touted as the strongest case the Government had been able to prepare against any of the Long lieutenants . What was more natural then , than that later the pending indictments against Seymour Weiss and others of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 12 , 1936 , and the regular legislative session began at once . Representative Ben Simpson , of Caddo Parish , introduced a resolution providing for an investigation of the Long assassination by a joint committee of the ho use and senate , and for an appropriation of $100,000 to defray the costs . Such an investigation , however , was not in harmony with the ideas of the bosses of Louisiana , and the resolution was withdrawn before the senate had a chance to vote upon it . By a coincidence , it was about this time that the Federal Government decided it really did n't care to press the income-tax cases which had been prepared so laboriously for years . The Repeal of Longism It was an inspiring sight in June , at Philadelphia , to see the completeness of Mr. Weiss ' conversion to the New Deal cause when he carried his state 's banner aloft in the demonstration marking President Roosevelt 's renomination . Senator-elect Allen El-lender , now one of the New Deal wheel-horses in the Senate , let his new-found enthusiasm for the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewer that Louisiana was probably better off , now that its leaders and representatives were all men without national ambitions . This supposed slur on the memory of the ambitious and newly sainted Long caused a furor in Louisiana , and the whole legislative program of the state was stalled while Mr. Mender undertook fuller explanations over the telephone from Louisiana headquarters , in Philadelphia , to the capitol at Baton Rouge . Installed as governor , Leche found the task before him anything but an easy one . lie had to placate the National Administration without alienating his own following , all steamed up against the President and the New Deal by the hymns of hate , chanted almost nightly over the radio by Huey and , after his death , by the Reverend Mr. Smith . Everything that was done was done in the oame of the sainted Huey , though it must . have been a little puzzling to some of the citizens of Louisiana to learn that he , who had fought the sales tax as an invention of the devil , had suddenly seen the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , in the form of a luxury tux , was sold to them as a practical means of achieving the redistribution of wealth which Huey sought . Today , with some grumbling , to be sure , everyone in Louisiana pays 2 per cent on every purchase , only hand tools and clothing which costs less than three dollars enjoying an exemption . It is named , somewhat euphemistically , a. luxury tux to differentiate it from the sales tax which Huey fought so valiantly . However , it will become a frank and honest sales tax , probably , at the next session of the legislature , when it is planned to amend it , cutting out all exemptions . Governor Leche says the sales tax could not he avoided because every other revenue-producing source had been tapped by Long . ( Continued on Page 81 ) ( Contings  --  d from Pas . 5 ? 0 As a matter of fact the luxury tax is , in a sense , a means for sharing the wealth , for its proceeds are used to finance the state social-security program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the needy blind and to dependent children . Not only were laws enacted to permit the state to share in the Federal social-security benefits but other laws were adopted repealing the laws which Long put through to curb efforts by the New Deal Administration , at Washington , to use patronage to undermine his hold . These laws of Huey 's forbade Federal officials from undertaking projects in Louisiana without the consent of the state , and served the purpose of allowing him to block Federal relief projects until a fair share of his own deserving followers were assured a place on the pay roll . ' With Huey Long 's personal domination ended , the state supreme court , which he controlled , declared unconstitutional the law by which the dictator had seized control of the machinery for primary elections . The legislature removed the sword of Damocles which Long had left dangling over the head of Standard Oil by fixing the tax on oil refined in the state at one cent a barrel . Huey had never levied more than a one-cent tax himself , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five cents a barrel , if the spirit moved him . The United States Supreme Court outlawed Huey 's 2-percent tax on newspaper advertising revenue and , as no one then cared about rewriting the law to make it fit the Constitution , this attempt of the Kingfish to control the press came to naught . Long had tried to whip the schoolteachers of Louisiana into line by arrogating to a state board , which he controlled , the power of hiring and firing them . Under Governor Leche , the legislature restored this power to the local parish school boards and provided for retirement pensions and security of tenure . Whole reams of other laws enacted under Huey 's dictatorship solely to punish individuals and communities that defied him were repealed or allowed to lie dormant on the statute books . Mayor Who Made Good Home rule , withdrawn from New Orleans during the prolonged feud be ' tween Long and the former mayor , T. Semmes WaLmsley , now in political retirement , was restored and broadened , once Mr. Maestri had been elected safely as the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics , the legislature submitted to the people a constitutional amendment , which was ratified overwhelmingly , obviating the legal necessity for any more municipal elections M New Orleans until 1940 . Thus Mr. Maestri , elected for a four-year term , was assured of six years of uninterrupted service . Mayor Maestri , because of his extensive real-estate holdings in what was the old " licensed district " of New Orleans before the war , was referred to as " Red Light . Bob " by his opponents in the mayoralty campaign . The nickname stung him deeply , as much for its injustice as for its unpleasant connotations . Once in office , apparently ho sot out to rehabilitate his name and make it a synonym for good government . His has been a model administration , comparable , in some respects , to Mayor F. II . La Guardia 's , in New York . He has preached and practiced economy , reduced the municipal debt , driven the slot machines from the residential and school districts , and given his personal supervision to the many WPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Harry Hopkins publicly commended him . As an example of how he operates , a story is told in New Orleans of how he obtained tractors for road work without any appreciable cost to the city . The JImbassador From Louisiana Maestri discovered that one of the big contracting companies had several idle tractors and asked an officer of the corporation to lend them to him . The executive said regretfully that this could not be done , because the company 's name was painted on the tractors and it would never do to set the precedent of lending them to the city free . That night a crew of police-department painters appeared at the corporation 's garage and painted out the firm 's name , replacing it with the letters and numbers of city tractors . " That will make O.K. , " said Maestri , ently it did . Meanwhile the legislature extended the Long debt moratorium for another two years . With administration support , the free-schoolbook law and the exemption on homesteads costing less than $2000 were written into the constitution so that no future legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthright of Louisianans , whether enrolled in public or parochial schools , was broadened to include pencils , paper and erasers . It was a small thing , but it helped to take the curse off the so-called luxury tax , and showed that the hearts of those who followed in the footsteps of Huey Long still beat . for the common people . By legislative enactment the governor was empowered to appoint a board of commerce and industry to lure new enterprises to Louisiana . Tax exemption fora period of ten years was the bait . It worked to the extent of bringing in an investment of $47,000,000 in less than a year . These new enterprises , including oil refineries , packing plants , sawmills and canneries , are expected to provide permanent employment . to more than 15,000 persons . Leche attributes this influx of new capital not only to the tax-exemption program and the low labor costs in Louisiana but to the fact that under him , and Huey Long , the state 's services and plant capacity have been built up to the point where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years to come . To make sure that no available Federal funds or appointments go to less deserving commonwealths , Louisiana has established an embassy in Washington with the suave Earle Christen-berry , Huey 's former secretary , as ambassador . As Huey 's former secretary , Mr. Chrislenberry knows his way around . As a further means of getting more wealth to share in Louisiana , the state has retained a firm of publicity experts , at $60,000 a year , to advertise the attractions Louisiana has for tourists and industry . In the process of ushering in the post-Long era of good feeling , former enemies of Long were welcomed into the fold and those who could not bring themselves to active partisanship were allowed to retire into peaceful seclusion . One of Long 's bitterest and most outspoken foes was recommended by the political heirs of the dictator for a Federal appointment in Washington . Leche held that since this man had rendered valuable service to the Roosevelt Administration in its feud with Long , it was only fair that those he had served should provide him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out to some who questioned the expedience of the recommendation , it was a good way to get him out of the state at no cost to the organization . Ensconced in power , the heirs ef Huey Long avoided the mistake of attempting reprisals against the family of the man who assassinated him , lest they create two martyrs in a state big enough for only one . The assassin sleeps in an obscure grave in a Baton Rouge cemetery . Doctor Weiss , his fa ther , goes h is accustomed way , healing thesore throats , ailing ears and impaired eyes of his neighbors in Baton Rouge . The assassin 's father-in-law , former Judge B. H. Pavy , eased from the bench and the judieial ermine by Huey 's trained-seal lawmakers , is practicing law in Opelousas and politicarl retirement . Doctor Weiss ' widow , the former Yvonne Pavy , lived quietly in Louisiana until last fall , when , with her two-and-a-half-year-old child , horn just three months before her husband 's rash act , threw her whole family into national prominence , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia University . Last year she supported herself and her child by teaching French at St. Joseph 's Academy in Baton Rouge , without suffering from social ostracism or political persecution . The conciliatory attitude of Governor Leche is reflected in his newspaper , the Louisiana Progress , a weekly published at Hammond , Louisiana , as a sort of journalistic descendant of Long 's old American Progress , a paper issued at such intervals as Huey chose to deliver a message to his followers or scream vituperation at his enemies . Huey 's paper was filled with invective and bombast , its pages covered with venomous cartoons and editorials disguised not too cleverly as news . The new Louisiana Progress is truly a fireside companion or farmer 's almanac , with columns of information on jelly making , care of the hog , the fertilization of barren fields , together with advice to the lovelorn and comparatively recent gossip from Broadway . This publishing venture of the governor 's has enjoyed a phenomenal success . Less than one year old , it boasts a circulation of more than 100,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at $500 a page  --  is the envy of the business managers of the other dailies and weeklies which , in a sense , are its competitors . Some critics of the governor insist that no publisher without his title and authority could do what he has done with his paper . It got off to a flying start last April . when President Roosevelt wrote a letter endorsing the principle of freedom of the press and wishing the new publishing ven ture the best of luck . This letter was reproduced on the first page and photostats were given to advertising salesmen , who also were armed with a letter of solicitation from Governor Leche . Few merchants could resist this sales appeal . It has been whispered , unkindly perhaps , that the paper 's circulation was made to order . Stories are told to the effect that every state employee is required to buy from two to thirty subscriptions , at two dollars apiece , per year , depending on the size of his salary . Governor Leche says that , quite naturally , a paper printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to party workers and state officeholders . He himself contributes a weekly column , printed on the first page and usually dealing with such nonpartisan subjects as duck shooting , conservation of game , and the state 's future as a livestock-raising center . Newspapers and farms are about the only profit-making institutions left in Louisiana that are not taxed heavily , and no sooner had Mr. Leche established himself as a publisher than Earl Long , the tax on livestock having been removed , set himself up as a cattle raiser . Recently , in an effort to stimulate interest in cattle breeding , the state held a rodeo in the Agricultural Center at Louisiana State University . To advertise it , a carload of ten-gallon hats was imported to give away . In the end it was decided to sell them , and , to guarantee a good gate at every performance , state and city employees were herded to Baton Rouge to buy hats and to whoop it up for the eowbnys . Wealth , Sharars in Action One disgruntled employee of the city of New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars  --  one dollar for a round-trip railroad ticket , $1.65 for his hat , two dollars plus tax for rodeo tickets , and a little more than one dollar for pink lemonade , peanuts and hot dogs , a cane and a toy lariat for his little boy . Governor Leche , practicing rope throwing in the main hall of the executive mansion a short time after the rodeo left town , marveled at the interest people from all over the state had shown in the little entertainment he and his confreres had helped to arrange . The baseball park and the race track in New Orleans are owned secretly , it is said , by members of the political inner circle and , what with one thing and another , city employees find it expedient to buy tickets for the ball game in the season . When the race track opens , the handbooks , which operate openly in New Orleans all the rest of the year , Mrs. Nixon quickened her steps toward town . ' ' Because they say he is influenced by women very easily ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ! " The young woman gave her husband business details , " " Oh , business ? " " Yes . " Sarah considered for a split second , then asked , " How much is it , hon ? " " How much is what ? " " How much do you owe him ? " " Why , twenty dollars , What made you think I owed him anything ? " Commenting on his business successes , which are being singled out as the focal point for attack by his handful of enemies , consisting chiefly of Senator Noe and the strawberry growers of the Sixth Congressional District , who feel that they have received less than their share of wealth , Mr. Leche said : " I swore to uphold the Constitutions of Louisiana and the United States , but I did n't take any vows of poverty . " He is fond also of telling critics that he is a good Democrat , like Thomas Jefferson , Andrew Jackson and Franklin D. Roosevelt . Then he adds that Jefferson had his Monticello , Jackson his Hermitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should not he , too , have a fine home , he asks , asserting humorously that the day of the log-cabin birthplace in politics is passing with this generation . In keeping with this philosophy , Leche has built a handsome brick-andshingle home for himself , his wife and their five-year-old son . It is situated in a setting of pine trees , in St. Tammany Parish , some fifty-odd miles from New Orleans and only an hour 's drive , thanks to the line highways and bridges that Huey built . On the 106 acres of cutover pine lands , the governor has drilled artesian wells and flooded between fourteen and eighteen acres , making a lovely lake , part of which is set aside as a breeding ground for wild duck and geese , so that he will not have to go far from home to indulge in his favorite sport . Some tall tales are told about this estate . First , it is alleged to have cost $250,000 , although it probably did not cost more than $60,000 . Another story is that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was torn down to make room for the new $12,000,000 structure being built with state and Federal funds .

Somewhat later the two entered Mr. Cal Jippers ' law office , and Fatty expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accorded them by the Linters Gas and Electric Company . Instead of that , however , the pretty Mrs. Nixon rather shocked her husband by saying , " Mr. Jippers , Leonard and I have come around to see about what we owe you , if you do n't mind looking it up . " The little lawyer was quite as shocked as the husband , and far more pleased . He stepped briskly to a file of bills on his table and begun with a Southerner 's deprecation , when he thinks he is really about to be paid , " Now , Miss Sarah , I do n't want you and Mr. Nixon to put yourso'ves out . I 'm in no hurry governor insists that these are merely malicious lies . As it happens , he says , the land he bought on what is sometimes called the Louisiana Gold Coast is the site of an old brick kiln which ceased operations after the Civil War and the product or which lies buried beneath a few inches of topsoil and pine needles all over the estate .

Such stories frequently are manufactured by the " outs " against the " ins " in politics . At . any rate , the Long machine is more firmly entrenched in Louisiana today than it was in the palmiest days of the Kingfish , although , if he were to return to earth , he doubtless would he shocked at some of the things that have been done in his name , and immediately call a special session of the legislature to put things to rights again .
