When Franklin Roosevelt journeys from Washington to Hyde Park , he generally takes the Baltimore &; Ohio R. R. It is his favorite passenger line and its 78-year-old president , Daniel Willard , is his good friend . Genial Dan Willard is also the good friend of RFC Chairman Jesse Jones and has many a warm admirer in Congress , where he is regarded as a liberal with a good railroad labor record . In the last year and a half this widespread affection for President Willard is about all that has saved the sore-pressed B. &; 0 . from reorganization . <P> In January 1938 , unable to borrow anywhere else , it got $8,233,000 from RFC to pay its wages ( it already owed RFC $80,000,000 ) . In June , without collateral for another loan , it met a $1,700,000 debt only because Jesse Jones arranged for PWA to buy the road 's run-down Chesapeake &; Ohio Canal , unused for 15 years , for $2,000,000 . Last November the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed Dan Willard to cut his fixed charges $11,000,000 a year by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments . Last week Dan Willard personally appeared before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee to ask that Congress spare him the " personal disgrace " of a B. &; O. bankruptcy by passing the Chandler Bill . <P> This measure , already passed by the House , is precisely the sort of legislation Chairman Burton K. Wheeler of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee and the New Deal 's braintrusters disapprove . Instead of putting such roads as the B. &; O. " through the wringer " by wiping out junior securities and cutting down capitalization , it provides for voluntary adjustment of fixed charges between the road and its bondholders and for postponement of interest payments . Nonetheless , Chairman Wheeler , who could stop the Chandler Bill if he wishes , is letting it by with but one change-he intends to amend its technicalities so that in practice only the little Lehigh Valley and Dan Willard 's B. &; O. will be able to take advantage of it . <P> For the other U. S. roads facing similar crises , Burt Wheeler has more drastic medicine in mind . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special railroad reorganization court which would permit recapitalizations of bankrupt roads only upon a basis of " expectable future earnings " - the average for the twelve years prior to the year in which the railroad went bankrupt . That day at the White House Franklin Roosevelt seconded the measure . <P> The earnings expectations of U. S. railroads are anything but rosy . Class I roads had a net operating income of $85,808,000 in the first quarter this year ( against $19,963,000 in the first quarter of 1938 ) but after paying their fixed charges they were $41,880,000 in the hole. * This loss is likely to increase in the second quarter as receding industrial production drags carloadings down with it . Lately many roads ( particularly the B. &; O. ) have suffered acutely from the coal strike , for carrying coal is a big and profitable traffic .
