A North Greenland Eskimo would undoubtedly cry " Taku ! " in loud surprise were he to see a canary come falling from the sky . No less startled were New Yorkers one day last week to find lying exhausted in their streets some black &; white , thick-beaked birds they had never seen before . Not since 1908 had such a bird appeared in the city , and it had arrived on shipboard . Most finders promptly called or hurried to the Bronx Zoo , learned the fallen strangers were little auks , cousins of the least auklet and the extinct great auk . Winging southward from their Arctic loomeries , they had been blown inland by a 65-m. p. h. gale . <P> The last storm-tossed shower was at Boston in 1871 . Only 20 recorded times in the past 40 years has the bird been found inland . Looking somewhat like a dove-sized penguin , the little auk is helpless on land . It feeds chiefly on a type of water bug found only at sea , needs the impetus of a wave to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's metropolitan area last week , only four survived . <P> The same storms that blew little auks into New York killed thousands elsewhere along the Atlantic Coast . The Eskimos of Greenland . Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land may well miss them , for the little auk is a staple of their food supply , " Eskimo lollipops " as Curator Robert Cushman Murphy of the American Museum of Natural History calls them . In Greenland the Eskimos will beg the Goddess Nivikkaa , sitting at the bottom of the sea , to lift her lamp and let the little auks come up again .
