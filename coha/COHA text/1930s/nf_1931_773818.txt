txt 6o THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK eralization it placed the law of gravitation in the most unexpected company . To everybody 's surprise , it was found to be a law of geometry rather than of physics in the old sense . The proposition with which it has most affinity is the theorem of Pythagoras , to the effect that the squares on the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle are together equal to the square on the longest side . Every schoolboy learns the proof of this proposition , but only those who read Einstein learn the disproof . To the Greeks ? and to the moderns until a hundred years ago ? geometry was an a priori study like formal logic , not an empirical science based upon observation . Lobachevsky , in the year 1829 , demonstrated the falsehood of this opinion , and showed that the truth of Euclidean geometry could only be established by observation , not by reasoning . Although this view gave rise to important new branches of pure mathematics , it did not bear fruit in physics until the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relativity . It now appears that the theorem of Pythagoras is not quite true , and that the exact truth which it adumbrates contains within itself the law of gravitation as an ingredient or consequence . Again , it is not quite Newton 's law of gravitation , but a law whose observable consequences are slightly different . Where Einstein differs from Newton in an observable manner it is found that Einstein is right as against Newton . Einstein 's law of gravitation is more general than Newton 's , since it applies not only to matter , but also to light and to every form of energy . Einstein 's general theory of gravitation CHARACTERISTICS OF THE METHOD 6i demanded as a preliminary not only Newton 's theory , but also the theory of electro-magnetism , the science of spectroscopy , observation of light pressure , and the power of minute astronomical observation , which we owe to large telescopes and the perfecting of the technique of photography . Without all these preliminaries , Einstein 's theory could not have been both discovered and demonstrated . But when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generalized law of gravitation , and arrive at the end of our argument at those verifiable consequences upon which , in the inductive order , the law was based . In the deductive order , the difficulties of discovery are obscured , and it becomes hard to be aware of the immense extent of preliminary knowledge required for the induction which led to our major premise . The same sort of development has happened with a rapidity which is truly astonishing in regard to quantum theory . The first discovery that there were facts necessitating such a theory was made in 1900 , yet already the subject can be treated in an utterly abstract way which scarcely reminds the reader that a universe exists . Throughout the history of physics , from the time of Galileo onward , the importance of the significant fact has been very evident . The facts that are significant at any one stage in the development of a theory are quite different from those that are significant at another stage . When Galileo was establishing the law of falling bodies , the fact that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally fast , was more important than the fact that , in air , a feather // falls more slowly , since the first step in understanding fall-ing bodies consisted in realizing that , so far as the earth 's at-traction alone is concerned , all falling bodies have the same acceleration . The effect of the resistance of the air must be treated as something superadded to the earth 's attraction . The essential thing is always to look for such facts as illustrate one law in isolation , or at any rate , only in combination with laws whose effects are well known . This is why experiment plays such an important part in scientific discovery . In an experiment the circumstances are artificially simplified , so that some one law in isolation may become observable . In most concrete situations , what actually happens requires for its explanation a number of laws of nature , but in order to discover these one by one it is usually necessary to invent circumstances such that only one of them is relevant . Moreover , the most in-structive phenomena may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much our knowledge of matter has been enhanced by the discovery of X-rays and of radio-activity ; yet both of these would have remained unknown but for the most elaborate experimental tech-nique . The discovery of radio-activity was an accident due to the perfecting of photography . Becquerel had some very sensitive photographic plates , which he was meaning to employ ; but as the weather was bad , he put them away in a dark cupboard in which there happened to be some uranium . When they were taken out again they were found to have photographed the uranium , in spite of the complete darkness . It was this accident which led to the // discovery that uranium is radio-active . This accidental photograph affords another illustration of the significant fact . Outside physics , the part played by deduction is much less , while the part played by observation , and by laws immediately based upon observation , is much greater . Physics , owing to the simplicity of its subject matter , has reached a higher stage of development than any other science . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same for all sciences ; but it can be doubted whether human capacity will ever be able to make physiology , for example , as perfect a deductive edifice as theoretical physics is now . Even in pure physics the difficulties of calculation swiftly become insuperable . In the Newtonian gravitation theory it was impossible to calculate how three bodies would move under their mutual attractions , except approximately when one of them was much larger than the other two . In the theory of Einstein , which is much more complicated than Newton 's , it is impossible to work out with theoretical exactness even how two bodies will move under their mutual attraction , though it is possible to obtain a sufficiently good approximation for all practical purposes . Fortunately for physics there are methods of averaging , by which the behaviour of large bodies can be calculated with a quite sufficient approximation to the truth , although a wholly exact theory is utterly beyond human powers . Although this may seem a paradox , all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything , you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man . Every careful measurement in science is always given with the probable error , which is a technical term , conveying a precise meaning . It means : that amount of error which is just as likely to be greater than the actual error as to be less . It is characteristic of those matters in which some-thing is known with exceptional accuracy that , in them , every observer admits that he is likely to be wrong , and knows about how much wrong he is likely to be . ' In mat-ters where the truth is not ascertainable , no one admits that there is the slightest possibility of even the minutest error in his opinions . Who ever heard of a theologian pref-acing his creed , or a politician concluding his speeches , with a statement as to the probable error in his opinions ? It is an odd fact that subjective certainty is inversely pro-portional to objective certainty . The less reason a man has to suppose himself in the right , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever that he is exactly right . It is a practice of theologians to laugh at science because it changes . " Look at us , " they say . " What we asserted at the Council of Nicea we still assert ; whereas what the scientists asserted only two or three years ago is already forgotten and antiquated . " Men who speak in this way have not grasped the great idea of successive approximations . No man who has the scientific temper asserts that what is now believed in science is exactly right ; he asserts that it is a stage on the road towards the exact truth . When a change occurs in science , as , for example , from Newton 's law of gravitation to Einstein 's , what had been done is not overthrown , but is replaced by something slightly more accurate . Suppose you measured yourself with a rough apparatus , and came to the conclusion that you were 6 ft. tail : you would not suppose , if you were wise , that your height was exactly 6 ft. , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 in. and 6 ft. r in. ; and if a very careful measurement showed that your height was ( within a tenth of an inch ) $ ft. r 1%o in. you would not consider that that had overthrown the previous result . The previous result was that your height was about six ft. , and this remains true . The case with the changes in science is precisely analagous . The part played by measurement and quantity in science is very great , but is , I think , sometimes overestimated . Mathematical technique is powerful , and men of science are naturally anxious to be able to apply it whenever possible ; but a law may be quite scientific without // being quantitative . Pavlov 's laws concerning conditioned reflexes may serve as an illustration . It would probably be impossible to give quantitative precision to these laws ; the number of repetitions required to establish conditioned reflexes depends upon many conditions , and varies not only with different animals , but with the same animal at different times . In the pursuit of quantitative precision we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical nature of nerve-currents , and we should find ourselves unable to stop short of the physics of electrons and protons . There , it is true , quantitative precision may be possible , but to pass back by calculation from pure physics to the phenomena of animal behaviour is beyond human power , at any rate at present , and probably for many ages to come . We must , therefore , in dealing with such a matter as animal behaviour , be content in the meantime with qualitative laws which are none the less scientific for not being quantitative . One advantage of quantitative precision , where it is possible , is that it gives much greater strength to inductive arguments . Suppose , for example , that you invent a hypothesis , according to which a certain observable quantity should have a magnitude which you work out to five significant figures ; and suppose you then find by observation that the quantity in question has this magnitude . You will feel that such a coincidence between theory and observation can hardly be an accident , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Experience shows , however , that it is easy to attach too much // importance to such coincidences . Bohr 's theory of the atom was originally commended by a remarkable power of calculating theoretically certain quantities which had until then been known only by observation . Nevertheless , Bohr 's theory , though a necessary stage in progress , has already been virtually abandoned . The truth is , that men can not frame sufficiently abstract hypotheses ; imagination is always intruding upon logic , and causing men to make pictures of occurrences which are essentially incapable of being visualized . In Bohr 's theory of the atom , for example , there was a highly abstract constituent , which was in all likelihood true , but this abstract element was embedded in imaginative details which had no inductive justification . The world that we can picture is the world that we see ; but the world of physics is an abstract world that can not be seen . For this reason , even a hypothesis which accounts with a minute exactitude for all known relevant facts must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably only some highly abstract aspect of the hypothesis that is logically necessary in the deductions which we make from it to observable phenomena . All scientific laws rest upon induction , which , considered as a logical process , is open to doubt , and not capable of giving certainty . Speaking crudely , an inductive argument is of the following kind . If a certain hypothesis is true , then such and such facts will be observable ; now these facts are observable ; therefore the hypothesis is probably true . An argument of this sort will have varying degrees of validity according to circumstances . If we could // prove that no other hypothesis was compatible with the observed facts we could arrive at certainty , but this is hardly ever possible . In general , there will be no method of thinking of all the possible hypotheses , or , if there is , it will be found that more than one of them is compatible with the facts . When this is the case , the scientist adopts the simplest as a working hypothesis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the simplest hypothesis is inadequate . If you had never seen a cat without a tail , the simplest hypothesis to account for this fact would be : " all cats have tails " ; but the first time that you saw a Manx cat , you would be compelled to adopt a more complicated hypothesis . The man who argues that because all cats he has seen have tails , therefore all cats have tails , is employing what is called " induction by simple enumeration . " This is a very dangerous form of argument . In its better forms , induction is based upon the fact that our hypothesis leads to consequences which are found to be true , but which , if they had not been observed , would seem extremely improbable . If you meet a man who has a pair of dice that always throw double sixes , it is possible that he is lucky ; but there is another hypothesis which would make the observed facts less astonishing . You will therefore be well advised to adopt this other hypothesis . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such as would be antecedently improbable , and the more improbable they would be , the greater becomes the probability of the hypothesis which accounts for them . This , as we remarked // a moment ago , is one of the advantages of measurement . I f something which might have any size , is found to have just the size that your hypothesis had led you to expect , you feel that your hypothesis must at least have something in it . As common sense this seems evident , but as logic it has certain difficulties . This , however , we will not consider until the next chapter . There is one remaining characteristic of scientific method about which something must be said , namely , analysis . It is generally assumed by men of science , at any rate as a working hypothesis , that any concrete occurrence is the resultant of a number of causes , each of which , acting separately , might produce some different result from that which actually occurs ; and that the resultant can be calculated when the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occur in mechanics . The moon is attracted both by the earth and by the sun . If the earth acted alone , the moon would describe one orbit ; if the sun acted alone , it would describe another ; but its actual orbit is calculable when we know the effects which the earth and the sun separately would produce . When we know how bodies fall in a vacuum , and also the law of the resistance of the air , we can calculate how bodies will fall in air . The principle that causal laws can , in this way , be separated , and then recombined , is in some degree essential to the procedure of science , for it is impossible to take account of everything at once , or to arrive at causal laws unless we can isolate them one at a time . It must be said , however , that there is no reason a priori // to suppose that the effect of two causes , acting simultane-ously , will be calculable from the effects which they have severally ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have less truth than was formerly supposed.l It remains a practical and approximate principle in suit-able circumstances , but it can not be laid down as a general property of the universe . Undoubtedly , where it fails , sci-ence becomes very difficult ; but , so far as can be seen at present , it retains sufficient truth to be employed as a hy-pothesis , except in the most advanced and delicate calcu-lations . CHAPTER III Limitations of Scientific Method W hATEVER knowledge we possess is either knowledge of particular facts , or scientific knowledge . The details of history and geography lie outside science in a sense ; that is to say , they are presupposed by science , and form the basis upon which it is a superstructure . The sort of things that are demanded on a passport , such as name , date of birth , colour of grandfather 's eyes , etc. , are brute facts ; the past existence of Cxsar and Napoleon , the present existence of the earth and the sun and the other heavenly bodies , may also be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us accept them as such , but strictly speaking , they involve inferences which may , or may not , be correct . If a boy learning history were to refuse to believe in the existence of Napoleon , he would probably be punished , which might , for a pragmatist , constitute sufficient proof that there was such a man ; but if the boy were not a pragmatist , he might reflect that if his teacher had had any reason to believe in Napoleon , the reason might have been disclosed . Very few teachers of history , I believe , would be able to produce any good argument to show that Napoleon was not a myth . I am not 71 // saying that such arguments do not exist ; I am only saying that most people do not know what they are . Clearly , if you are going to believe anything outside your own experience , you should have some reason for believing it . Usually the reason is authority . When it was first proposed to establish laboratories at Cambridge , Todhunter , the mathematician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments performed , since the results could be vouched for by their teachers , all of them men of the highest character , and many of them clergymen of the Church of England . Todhunter considered that the argument from authority should suffice , but we all know how often authority has been proved mistaken . It is true that most of us must inevitably depend upon it for most of our knowledge . I accept on authority the existence of Cape Horn , and it is clearly impossible that each of us should verify all the facts of geography ; but it is important that the opportunity for verification should exist , and that its occasional necessity should be recognized . To revert to history : as we proceed into the past there is a gradually increasing doubt . Did Pythagoras exist ? Probably . Did Romulus exist ? Probably not . Did Remus exist ? Almost certainly not . But the difference between the evidence for Napoleon and the evidence for Romulus is only one of degree . Strictly speaking , neither the one nor the other can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within our direct experience . Does the sun exist ? Most people would say that the sun does come within our direct experience in a sense in which // Napoleon does not , but in thinking this , they would be mistaken . The sun is removed from us in space as Napoleon is removed from us in time . The sun , like Napoleon , is known to us only through its effects . People say they see the sun ; but that only means that something has travelled through the intervening ninety-three million miles , and produced an effect upon the retina , the optic nerve , and the brain . This effect , which happens where we are , is certainly not identical with the sun as understood by astronomers . Indeed , the same effect might be produced by other means : in theory , a hot globe of molten metal could be hung up in such a position that , to a given observer , it would seem just like the sun . The effect upon the observer might be made indistinguishable from the effect which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inference from what we see , and is not the actual patch of brightness of which we are immediately aware . It is characteristic of the advance of science that less and less is found to be datum , and more and more is found to be inference . The inference is , of course , quite unconscious , except in those who have trained themselves to philosophical scepticism ; but it must not be supposed that an unconscious inference is necessarily valid . Babies think that there is another baby on the other side of the lookingglass , and although they have not arrived at this conclusion by a logical process , it is nevertheless mistaken . Many of our unconscious inferences , which are , in fact , conditioned reflexes acquired in early infancy , are highly dubious as soon as they are subjected to logical scrutiny . // Physics has been compelled by its own necessities to take account of some of these unwarrantable prejudices . The plain man thinks that matter is solid , but the physicist thinks that it is a wave of probability undulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a place is defined as the likelihood of your seeing a ghost there . For the moment , however , I am not yet concerned with these metaphysical speculations , but with the features of scientific method which have given rise to them . The limitations of scientific method have become much more evident in recent years than they ever were before . They have become most evident in physics , which is the most advanced of the sciences , and so far these limitations have had little effect upon the other sciences . Nevertheless , since it is the theoretical goal of every science to be absorbed in physics , we are not likely to go astray if we apply to science in general the doubts and difficulties which have become obvious in the sphere of physics . The limitations of scientific method may be collected under three heads : ( r ) the doubt as to the validity of induction ; ( 2 ) the difficulty of drawing inferences from what is experienced to what is not experienced ; and ( 3 ) even allowing that there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such inference must be of an extremely abstract character , and gives , therefore , less information than it appears to do when ordinary language is employed . ( r ) Induction. ? All inductive arguments in the last resort reduce themselves to the following form : " If this is true , that is true : now that is true , therefore this is // true . " This argument is , of course , formally fallacious . Suppose I were to say : " If bread is a stone and stones are nourishing , then this bread will nourish me ; now this bread does nourish me ; therefore it is a stone , and stones are nourishing . " If I were to advance such an argument , I should certainly be thought foolish , yet it would not be fundamentally different from the arguments upon which all scientific laws are based . In science , we always argue that since the observed facts obey certain laws , therefore others facts in the same region will obey the same laws . We may verify this subsequently over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always in regard to those regions where it has not yet been verified . We have verified the laws of statics , for example , in countless cases , and we employ them in building a bridge ; in regard to the bridge , they are not verified until we find that the bridge stays up , but their importance lies in enabling us to predict beforehand that the bridge will stay up . It is easy to see why we think it will ; this is merely an example of Pavlov 's conditioned reflexes , which cause us to expect whatever combinations we have frequently experienced in the past . But if you have to cross a bridge in a train , it is no comfort to you to know why the engineer thought it was a good bridge : the important thing is that it should be a good bridge , and this requires that his induction from the laws of statics in observed cases to the same laws in unobserved cases should be a valid one . Now , unfortunately , no one has hitherto shown any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // sound . Hume , nearly two hundred years ago , threw doubt upon induction , as , indeed , upon most other things . The philosophers were indignant , and invented refutations of Hume which passed muster on account of their extreme obscurity . Indeed , for a long time philosophers took care to be unintelligible , since otherwise everybody would have perceived that they had been unsuccessful in answering Flume . It is easy to invent a metaphysic which will have as a consequence that induction is valid , and many men have done so ; but they have not shown any reason to believe in their metaphysic except that it was pleasant . The metaphysic of Bergson , for example , is undoubtedly pleasant : like cocktails , it enables us to see the world as a unity without sharp distinctions , and all of it vaguely agreeable , but it has no better claim than cocktails have to be included in the technique for the pursuit of knowledge . There may be valid grounds for believing in induction , and , in fact , none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that , in theory , induction remains an unsolved problem of logic . As this doubt , however , affects practically the whole of our knowledge , we may pass it by , and assume pragmatically that inductive procedure , with proper safeguards , is admissible. ( 2 ) Inferences to what is not Experienced. ? As we observed above , what is actually experienced is much less than one would naturally suppose . You may say , for example , that you see your friend , Mr. Jones , walking along the street ; but this is to go far beyond what you have any right to say . You see a succession of coloured patches , traLIMITATIONS // versing a stationary background . These patches , by means of a Pavlov conditioned reflex , bring into your mind the word " Jones , " and so you say you see Jones ; but other people , looking out of their windows from different angles , will see something different , owing to the laws of perspective : therefore , if they are all seeing Jones , there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if there is only one true Jones , the sight of him is not vouchsafed to anybody . If we assume for a moment the truth of the account which physics gives , we shall explain what you call " seeing Jones " in some such terms as the following . Little packets of light , called " light quanta , " shoot out from the sun , and some of these reach a region where there are atoms of a certain kind , composing Jones 's face , and hands , and clothes . These atoms do not themselves exist , but are merely a compendious way of alluding to possible occurrences . Some of the light quanta , when they reach Jones 's atoms , upset their internal economy . This causes him to become sunburnt , and to manufacture vitamin D. Others are reflected , and of those that are reflected , some enter your eye . They there cause a complicated disturbance of the rods and cones , which , in turn , sends a current along the optic nerve . When this current reaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it produces is that which you call " seeing Jones . " As is evident from this account , the connexion of " seeing Jones " with Jones is a remote , roundabout causal connexion . Jones himself , meanwhile , remains wrapped in mystery . He may be thinking about his dinner , or about how // his investments have gone to pieces , or about that umbrella he lost ; these thoughts are Jones , but these are not what you see . To say that you see Jones is no more correct than it would be , if a ball bounced off a wall in your garden and hit you , to say that the wall had hit you . Indeed , the two cases are closely analogous . We do not , therefore , ever see what we think we see . Is there any reason to think that what we think we see exists , although we do not see it ? Science has always ' prided itself on being empirical , and believing only what could be verified . Now you can verify the occurrences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you can not verify Jones himself . You may hear sounds which you call Jones speaking to you ; you may feel sensations of touch which you call Jones bumping into you . If he has not lately had a bath , you may also have olfactory sensations of which you suppose him to be the source . If you have been impressed by this argument , you may address him as if he were at the other end of the telephone , and say , " Are you there ? " And you may subsequently hear the words : " Yes , you idiot , ca n't you see me ? " But if you regard these as affording evidence that he is there , you have missed the point of the argument . The point is that Jones is a convenient hypothesis by means of which certain of your own sensations can be collected into a bundle ; but what really makes them belong together is not their common hypothetical origin , but certain resemblances and causal affinities which they have to each other . These remain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see a man in the cinema , you know that he does not exist when he is off the stage , though you suppose that there was an original who did exist continuously . But why should you make this supposition ? Why should not Jones be like the man you see at the cinema ? He may get annoyed with you if you suggest such an idea , but he will be powerless to disprove it , since he can not give you any experience of what he is doing when you do not experience him . Is there any way of proving that there are occurrences other than those that you yourself experience ? This is a question of some emotional interest , but the theoretical physicist of the present day would consider it unimportant . " My formulae , " he would say , " are concerned to provide causal laws connecting my sensations . In the statement of these causal laws I may employ hypothetical entities ; but the question whether these entities are more than hypothetical is otiose , since it lies outside the sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may admit that other physicists exist , since he wishes to use their results ; and , having admitted physicists , he may be led by politeness to admit students of other sciences . He may , in fact , form an argument by analogy to prove that , just as his body is connected with his thoughts , so bodies closely resembling his own are probably also connected with thoughts . It may be questioned how much strength there is in this argument ; but , even if it be admitted , it does not allow us to conclude that the sun and stars exist , or , indeed , any lifeless matter . We are , in fact , led to the posi8o THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK tion of Berkeley , according to which only thoughts exist . Berkeley saved the universe and the permanence of bodies by regarding them as God 's thoughts , but this was only a wish-fulfilment , not logical thinking . However , as he was at once it bishop and an Irishman , we ought not to be too hard on him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Santayana calls " animal faith , " which is , in fact , thought dominated by the principle of the conditioned reflex . It was this animal faith that enabled physicists to believe in a world of matter . Gradually they have turned traitor , like men who , from studying the history of kings , have become republicans . The physicists of our day no longer believe in matter . That in itself , however , would be no great loss , provided we could still have a large and varied external world , but unfortunately they have not supplied us with any reason for believing in a non-material external world . The problem is not essentially one for the physicist , but for the logician . It is , in essence , a simple one , namely : are circumstances ever such as to enable us , from a set of known events , to infer that some other event has occurred , is occurring , or will occur ? Or , if we can not make such an inference with certainty , can we ever make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate with a probability greater than a half ? If the answer to this question is in the affirmative , we may be justified in believing , as we all do in fact believe , in the occurrence of events which we have not personally experienced . If the answer is in the negative , we can never be justified in our belief . Logicians // have hardly ever considered this question in its naked simplicity , and I do not know of any clear answer to it . Until an answer is forthcoming , one way or another , the question must remain an open one , and our faith in the external world must be merely animal faith . ( 3 ) The Abstractness of Physics. ? Even allowing that the sun , the stars , and the material world generally , are not a figment of our imagination , or a set of convenient coefficients in our equations , what can be said about them is extraordinarily abstract , much more so than appears from the language employed by physicists when they attempt to be intelligible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and time of our experience . The orbits of the planets do not resemble the pictorial ellipses which we see drawn in charts of the solar system , except in certain quite abstract properties . It is possible that the relation of contiguity which occurs in our experience may he extended to the bodies of the physical world , but other relations known in experience are not themselves known to exist in the physical world . The most that can be known , and that only on the most hopeful view , is that there are certain relations in the physical world which share certain abstract logical characteristics with the relations that we know . The characteristics which they share are those that can be expressed mathematically , not those that distinguish them imaginatively from other relations . Take , for example , what there is in common between a gramophone record and the music that it plays ; the two share certain structural properties which can be expressed in abstract // terms , but they do not share any properties that are obvious to the senses . In virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Similarly , a physical world sharing the structure of our sensible world can cause it , even though it may resemble it in nothing except structure . At best , therefore , we can only know concerning the physical world such properties as the gramophone record and the music have in common , not such as distinguish them one from the other . Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts , since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract . Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say . As soon as he translates his symbols into words , he inevitably says something much too concrete , and gives his readers a cheerful impression of something imaginable and intelligible , which is much more pleasant and everyday than what he is trying to convey . Many people have a passionate hatred of abstraction , chiefly , I think , because of its intellectual difficulty ; but as they do not wish to give this reason , they invent all sorts of others that sound grand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making abstractions we are leaving out the essential . They say that all abstraction is falsification , and that as soon as you have left out any aspect of something actual you have exposed yourself to the risk of fallacy in arguing from its remaining aspects alone . Those who argue in this way are , in fact , concerned with matters quite other than those that concern science . From the // : esthetic point of view , for example , abstraction is likely to be wholly misleading . The music may be beautiful , while the gramophone record is aesthetically null ; from the point of view of imaginative vision , such as an epic poet may desire in writing of the creation , the abstract knowledge offered by physics is not satisfying . He wants to know what God saw when He looked upon the world and saw that it was good ; he can not be satisfied with formulae giving the abstract logical properties of the relations among the different parts of what God saw . But scientific thought is different from this . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , whose purpose , conscious or unconscious , is to give power to its possessor . Now power is a causal concept , and to obtain power over any given material , one need only understand the causal laws to which it is subject . This is an essentially abstract matter , and the more irrelevant details we can omit from our purview , the more powerful our thoughts will become . The same sort of thing can be illustrated in the economic sphere . The cultivator , who knows every corner of his farm , has a concrete knowledge of wheat , and makes very little money ; . the railway which carries his wheat views it in a slightly more abstract way , and makes rather more money ; the Stock Exchange manipulator , who knows it only in its purely abstract aspect of something which may go up or down , is , in his way , as remote from concrete reality as the physicist , and he , of all those concerned in the economic sphere , makes the most money and has the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power which the man of science seeks is more remote and impersonal than that which is sought on the Stock Exchange . The extreme abstractness of modern physics makes it difficult to understand , but gives to those who can understand it a grasp of the world as a whole , a sense of its structure and mechanism , which no less abstract apparatus could possibly supply . The power of using abstractions is the essence of intellect , and with every increase in abstraction the intellectual triumphs of science are enhanced . CHAPTER IV Scientific Metaphysics 1 I z is a curious fact that , just when the man in street has begun to believe thoroughly in science , the man in the laboratory has begun to lose his faith . When I was young , most physicists entertained not the slightest doubt that the laws of physics give us real information about the motions of bodies , and that the physical world does really consist of the sort of entities that appear in the physicists ' equations . The philosophers , it is true , threw doubt upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berkeley , but since their criticism never attached itself to any point in the detailed procedure of science , it could be ignored by scientists , and was in fact ignored . Now-adays , matters are quite different ; the revolutionary ideas of the philosophy of physics have come from the physicists themselves , and are the outcome of careful experiments . The new philosophy of physics is humble and stammer-ing , where the old philosophy was proud and dictatorial . It is , I suppose , natural that every man should fill the vacuum left by the disappearance of belief in physical laws as best he may , and that he should use for this pur86 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK pose any odds and ends of unfounded belief which had previously no room to expand . When the robustness of the Catholic faith decayed at the time of the Renaissance , it tended to be replaced by astrology and necromancy , and in like manner we must expect the decay of the scientific faith to lead to a recrudescence of pre-scientific superstitions . So long as we do not inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be presenting us with a more and more imposing edifice of knowledge . This is especially the case in astronomy . The Milky Way , as everyone knows , consists of all the stars in our neighbourhood . Light travels 186,000 miles in a second ; the distance that it travels in a year is known as a light year ; the distance of the nearest star is about four light years ; the distance of the furthest stars in the Milky Way is about 220,000 light years . Telescopes reveal about two million systems of stars each analogous to the Milky Way , some at distances of over a hundred million light years . The universe is thus of a considerable size , but it is not supposed to be infinite . It is supposed that if you travelled long enough in a straight line you would ultimately return to your starting-point , like a ship going round the world . There is , however , some reason to think that the universe is continually growing bigger , like a soap-bubble while it is being blown . An eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some not infinitely remote epoch had a radius of 1,200 million light years , but that its radius is doubled every 1,400 million // years , that is within a time shorter even than the age of many minerals , not to speak of astronomical estimates of the age of the sun ( Nature , February 7 , 1931 ) . This sounds quite impressive , but the scientists themselves are by no means persuaded that there is any objective reality about the large numbers in which they deal . I do not mean by this that they think the laws they are enunciating untrue ; I mean rather that these laws are capable of an interpretation which turns the abysses of astronomical space into mere auxiliary concepts , which are useful in the calculations by means of which we connect one real oc-currence with another . Sometimes it would seem as if astronomers considered that the only real occurrences with which they are concerned are the observations of astronomers . Whoever wishes to know how and why scientific faith is decaying can not do better than read Eddington 's Gifford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will learn there that physics is divided into three departments . The first contains all the laws of classi-cal physics , such as the conservation of energy and mo-mentum and the law of gravitation . All these , according to Professor Eddington , boil down to nothing but conventions as to measurement ; true , the laws they state are universal , but so is the law that there are three feet in a yard , which , according to him , is just as informative con-cerning the course of nature . The second department of physics is concerned with large aggregates and the laws of chance . Here we do not attempt to prove that such and // such an event is impossible , but only that it is wildly im-probable.The third department of physics , which is the most modern , is the quantum theory , and this is the most disturbing of all , since it seems to show that perhaps the law of causality , in which science has hitherto implicitly believed , can not be applied to the doings of individual , electrons . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn . To begin with classical physics . Newton 's law of gravi-tation , as everyone knows , was somewhat modified by Einstein , and the modification was experimentally con-firmed . But if Eddington 's view is right , this experimental confirmation does not have the significance that one would naturally attribute to it . After considering three possible views as to what the law of gravitation asserts about the motion of the earth round the sun , Eddington plumps for a fourth , to the effect that " the earth goes anyhow it likes " ; that is to say , the law of gravitation tells us abso-lutely nothing about the way the earth moves . He admits that this view is paradoxical , but he says : " The key to the paradox is that we ourselves , our conventions , the kind of thing that attracts our interest , are much more concerned than we realize in any account we give of how the objects of the physical world are behav-ing . And so an object which , viewed through our frame of conventions , may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viewed according to another set of conventions , may be doing nothing to excite particular comment . " // I must confess that I find this view a very difficult one ; respect for Eddington prevents me from saying that it is untrue , but there are various points in his argument which I have difficulty in following . Of course , all the practical consequences which we deduce from the abstract theory , as , for example , that we shall perceive daylight at certain times and not at certain other times , lie outside the scheme of official physics , which never reaches our sensations at all . I can not but suspect , however , that official physics is just a little bit too official in Eddington 's hands , and that it will not be impossible to allow it a little more significance than it has in his interpretation . However that may be , it is an important sign of the times that one of the leading exponents of scientific theory should advance so modest an opinion . I come now to the statistical part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large aggregates . Large aggregates behave almost exactly as they were supposed to do before the quantum theory was invented , so that in regard to them the older physics is very nearly right . There is , however , one supremely important law which is only statistical ; this is the second law of thermodynamics . It states , roughly speaking , that the world is growing continuously more disorderly . Eddington illustrates it by what happens when you shuffle a pack of cards . The pack of cards comes from the makers with the cards arranged in their proper order ; after you have shuffled them , this order is lost , and it is in the highest degree improbable that it will ever be restored by subsequent // shuffling . It is this sort of thing that makes the difference between past and future . In the rest of theoretical physics we are dealing with processes that are reversible ; that is to say , where the laws of physics show that it is possible for a material system to pass from state A at one time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally possible according to these same laws . But where the second law of thermodynamics comes in , this is not the case . Eddington enunciates the law as follows : " Whenever anything happens that can not be undone , it is always reducible to the introduction of a random element analogous to that introduced by shuffling . " This law , unlike most of the laws of physics , is concerned only with probabilities . To take our previous illustration : it is of course possible that if you shuffle a pack of cards long enough , the cards may happen to get into the right order by chance . This is very unlikely , but it is far less unlikely than the orderly arrangement of many millions of molecules by chance . Eddington gives the following illustration : suppose a vessel divided into two equal parts by a partition , and suppose that in one part there is air , while in the other there is a vacuum ; then a door in the partition is opened and the air spreads itself evenly through the whole vessel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecules of the air in the course of their random movements would all find themselves again in the partition in which they originally were . This is not impossible ; it is only improbable , but it is very improbable . " If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might // happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence . If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum . The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel . " There are an immense number of illustrations of the same kind of thing . For example , if you drop one drop of ink into a glass of clear water it will gradually diffuse itself throughout the glass . It might happen by chance that it would afterwards collect itself again into a drop , but we should certainly regard it as a miracle if this happened . When a hot body and a cold body are put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cools and the cold body gets warm until the two reach the same temperature , but this also is only a law of probability . It might happen that a kettle filled with water put on the fire would freeze instead of boiling ; this also is not shown to be impossible by any of the laws of physics , it is only shown to be highly improbable by the second law of thermodynamics . This law states , speaking generally , that the universe tends towards democracy , and that when it has achieved that state , it will be incapable of doing anything more . It seems that the world was created at some not infinitely remote date , and was then far more full of inequalities than it is now , but from the moment of creation it has been continually running down , and will ultimately stop for all practical purposes unless it is again wound up . Eddington for some reason does not like the idea that it can be wound SCIENTIFIC METAPHYSICS q. ; and it only emits light when it jumps , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go elsewhere . This is inter-preted by some writers as a breakdown of physical de-terminism , and is utilized by Eddington in his concluding chapters to rehabilitate free will . Eddington proceeds to base optimistic and pleasant conclusions upon the scientific nescience which he has ex-pounded in previous pages . This optimism is based upon the time-honoured principle that anything which can not be proved untrue may be assumed to be true , a principle whose falsehood is proved by the fortunes of bookmakers . If we discard this principle , it is difficult to see what ground for cheerfulness modern physics provides . It tells us that the universe is running down , and if Eddington is right , it tells us practically nothing else , since all the rest is merely rules of the game . As Eddington himself has pointed out , in spite of evo-lution , which is introducing increasing organization into one little corner of the universe , there is , on the whole , a general loss of organization which will finally swallow up the organization due to evolution . In the end , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete disorganiza-tion which will be the end of the world . At this stage the universe will consist of a uniform mass at a uniform temperature . Nothing further will happen except that t he universe will gradually swell . It speaks well for his temperamental cheerfulness that he should find in this view a basis for optimism . From a pragmatic or political point of view probably // up again , but prefers to think that the world drama is only to be performed once , in spite of the fact that it must end in irons of boredom , in the course of which the whole audience will gradually go to sleep . Quantum theory , which is concerned with individual atoms and electrons , is still in a state of rapid develop-ment , and is probably far from its final form . In the hands of 1 Icisenbcrg , Schrudinger and Co. , it has become more disturbing and more revolutionary than the theory of relativity ever was . Eddington expounds its recent de-vclopment in a manner which conveys more of it to the non-mathematical reader than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prejudices which have governed physics since the time of Newton . The most painful thing about it from this point of view is that , as mentioned above , it throws doubt upon the uni-versality of causality ; the view at present is that perhaps atoms have a certain amount of free will , so that their behaviour , even in theory , is not wholly subject to law . Moreover , some things which we thought definite , at least in theory , have quite ceased to be so . There is what is called the " principle of indeterminacy " : this states that " a particle may have position or it may have velocity , but it can not in any exact sense have both " ; that is to say , if you know where you are , you can not tell how fast you are moving , and if you know how fast you are moving , you can not tell where you are . This cuts at the root of tradi-tional physics , in which position and velocity were funda-mental . You can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing about such a theory of physics is that it will destroy , if it becomes widespread , that faith in science which has been the only constructive creed of modern times , and the source of practically all change both for good and for evil . The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had a philosophy of natural law based upon Newton . The law was supposed to imply a Lawgiver , though as time went on this inference was less emphasized , but in any case the universe was orderly and predictable . By learning nature 's laws we could hope to manipulate nature , and thus science became the source of power . This is still the outlook of most energetic practical men , but it is no longer the outlook of some among the men of science . The world , according to them , is a more higgledypiggledy and haphazard affair than it was thought to be . And they know much less about it than was thought to be known by their predecessors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Perhaps the scientific scepticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the collapse of the scientific era , just as the theological scepticism of the Renaissance has led gradually to the collapse of the theological era . I suppose that machines will survive the collapse of science , just as parsons have survived the collapse of theology , but in the one case as in the other they will cease to be viewed with reverence and awe . What , in these circumstances , has science to contribute to metaphysics ? Academic philosophers , ever since the time of Parmenides , have believed that the world is a // unity . This view has been taken over from them by clergymen and journalists , . and its acceptance has been considered the touchstone of wisdom . The most fundamental of my intellectual beliefs is that this is rubbish . I think the universe is all spots and jumps , without unity , without continuity , without coherence or orderliness or any of the other properties that governesses love . Indeed , there is little but prejudice and habit to be said for the view that there is a world at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to agree with the foregoing remarks ; but they have been so pained by the conclusions to which logic would have led them that they have been abandoning logic for theology in shoals . Every day some new physicist publishes a new pious volume to conceal from himself and others the fact that in his scientific capacity he has plunged the world into unreason and unreality . To take an illustration : What are we to think of the sun ? He used to be the glorious lamp of Heaven , a golden-haired god , a being to be worshipped by Zoroastrians and Aztecs and Incas . There is some reason to think that the doctrines of Zoroaster inspired Kepler 's heliocentric cosmogony . But now the sun is nothing but waves of probability . If you ask what it is that is probable , or in what ocean the waves travel , the physicist , like the Mad Hatter , replies : " I have had enough of this ; supppose we change the subject . " If , however , you press him , he will say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in his head , from which , however , you must not infer that the waves are in his head . To speak // seriously : such orderliness as we appear to find in the external world is held by many to be due to our own passion for pigeon-holes , and they maintain that it is quite doubtful whether there are such things as laws of nature . It is a curious sign of the times that religious apologists welcome this view . In the eighteenth century they welcomed the reign of law , since they thought that laws implied a Lawgiver , but religious apologists in the pres-ent day seem to be of opinion that a world created by a Deity must he irrational , on the ground , apparently , that they themselves have been made in God 's image . ' The reconciliation of religion and science which professors pro-claim and Bishops acclaim rests , in fact , though subcon-sciously , on grounds of quite another sort , and might be set forth in the following practical syllogism : science de-pends upon endowments , and endowments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolshe-vism ; but religion is also threatened by Bolshevism ; therefore religion and science are allies . It follows , of course , that science , if pursued with sufficient profundity , reveals the existence of a God . Nothing so logical as this penetrates , however , to the consciousness of the pious professors . The odd thing is that , at the very moment when // physics , which is the fundamental science , is undermining the whole structure of applied reason and presenting us with a world of unreal and fantastic dreams in place of the Newtonian order and solidity , applied science is becoming peculiarly useful and more able than ever to give results of value to human life . There is here a paradox , of which possibly the intellectual solution may be found hereafter , or , equally possibly , no solution may exist . The fact is that science plays two quite distinct roles : on the one hand as a metaphysic , and on the other hand as educated common sense . As a metaphysic it has been undermined by its own success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a formula for even the most erratic world . Plato and Sir James jeans think that because geometry applies to the world , God must have made the world on a geometrical pattern , but the mathematical logician suspects that God could not have made a world containing many things without exposing it to the skill of the geometer . In fact , the applicability of geometry to the physical world has ceased to be a fact about that world , and has become only a tribute to the geometer 's cleverness . The only thing that the geometer needs is multiplicity , whereas the only thing the theologian needs is unity . Of unity , however vague , however tenuous , I see no evidence in modern science considered as a metaphysic . But modern science considered as common sense remains triumphant , indeed , more triumphant than ever before . In view of this state of affairs , it is necessary to make // a sharp distinction between metaphysical beliefs and practical beliefs in regard to the conduct of life . In metaphysics my creed is short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illusion , but if it exists , it consists of events , short , small and haphazard . Order , unity , and continuity are human inventions just as truly as are catalogues and encyclopaedias . But human inventions can , within limits , be made to prevail in our human world , and in the conduct of our daily life we may with advantage forget the realm of chaos and old night by which we are perhaps surrounded . The ultimate metaphysical doubts which we have been considering have no bearing whatever upon the practical uses of science . If a Mendelian develops a variety of wheat which is immune from diseases that are destructive to the older varieties ; if a physiologist makes a discovery about vitamins ; if a chemist makes a discovery about the synthetic production of nitrates , the importance and usefulness of their work is quite independent of the question whether an atom consists of a miniature solar system , or a wave of probability , or an infinite rectangle of integers . When I speak of the importance of scientific method in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific method in its mundane forms . Not that I would undervalue science as a metaphysic , but the value of science as metaphysic belongs in another sphere . It belongs with religion and art and love , with the pursuit of the beatific vision , with the Promethean madness that leads the greatest men to strive to become gods . Perhaps the // only ultimate value of human life is to be found in this Promethean madness . But it is a value that is religious , not political , or even moral . It is this quasi religious aspect of the value of science which appears to be succumbing to the assaults of scepticism . Until quite recently men of science have felt themselves the high-priests of a noble cult , namely , the cult of truth ; not truth as the religious sects understand it , i. e. , as the battleground of a collection of dogmatists , but truth as a quest , a vision faintly appearing and again vanishing , a hoped-for sun to meet the Heraclitean fire in the soul . It is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to suffer privations and persecutions , and to be execrated as enemies of established creeds . All this is fading into the past ; the modern man of science knows that he is respected , and feels that he does not deserve respect . He approaches the established order apologetically . " My predecessors , " he says in effect , " may have said harsh things about you because they were arrogant , and imagined that they possessed some knowledge . I am more humble , and do not claim to know anything that can controvert your dogmas . " In return , the established order showers knighthoods and fortunes upon the men of science , who become more and more determined supporters of the injustice and obscurantism upon which our social system is based . In the newer sciences , such as psychology , this has not yet happened ; there the old ardour still persists , and the old persecutions continue . Homer Lane , for example , who was at once a sage and a saint , was deported too THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer sciences have not yet been touched by the cold breath of scepticism , which has destroyed the life of physics and astronomy . The trouble is an intellectual one ; indeed , its solution , if there is one , is to be sought in logic . For my part , I have no solution to offer ; our age is one which increasingly substitutes power for the older ideals , and this is happening in science as elsewhere . While science as the pursuit of power becomes increasingly triumphant , science as the pursuit of truth is being killed by a scepticism which the skill of the men of science has generated . That this is a misfortune is undeniable , but I can not admit that the substitution of superstition for scepticism advocated by many of our leading men of science would be an improvement . Scepticism may be painful , and may be barren , but at least it is honest and an outcome of the quest for truth . Perhaps it is a temporary phase , but no real escape is possible by returning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Religion T N recent times , the bulk of eminent physicists and a number of eminent biologists have made pronouncements stating that recent advances in science have disproved the older materialism , and have tended to reestablish the truths of religion . The statements of the scientists have as a rule been somewhat tentative and indefinite , but the theologians have seized upon them and extended them , while the newspapers in turn have reported the more sensational accounts of the theologians , so that the general public has derived the impression that physics confirms practically the whole of the Book of Genesis . I do not myself think that the moral to be drawn from modern science is at all what the general public has thus been led to suppose . In the first place , the men of science have not said nearly as much as they are thought to have said , and in the second place what they have said in the way of support for traditional religious beliefs has been said by them not in their cautious , scientific capacity , but rather in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . The War , and the Russian Revolution , have made all timid men conservative , and IOI // professors are usually temperamentally timid . Such considerations , however , are beside the point . Let us examine what science really has to say . ( I ) Free Will. ? Until very recent times theology , while in its Catholic form it admitted free will in human beings , showed an affection for natural law in the universe , tempered only by belief in occasional miracles . In the eighteenth century , under the influence of Newton , the alliance between theology and natural law became very close . It was held that God had created the world in accordance with a Plan , and that natural laws were the embodiment of this Plan . Until the nineteenth century theology remained hard and intellectual and definite . In order to meet the assaults of atheistic reason , however , it has , during the last hundred years , aimed more and more at appealing to sentiment . It has tried to catch men in their intellectually relaxed moods ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing-gown . In our day , only the fundamentalists and a few of the more learned Catholic theologians maintain the old respectable intellectual tradition . All the other religious apologists are engaged in blunting the edge of logic , appealing to the heart instead of the head , maintaining that our feelings can demonstrate the falsity of a conclusion to which our reason has been driven . As Lord Tennyson nobly says : And like a man in wrath the heart Stood up and answered " I have felt . " // In our day the heart has feelings about atoms , about the respiratory system , about the growth of sea-urchins and other such topics , concerning which , but for science , it would remain indifferent . One of the most remarkable developments in religious apologetics in recent times is the attempt to rescue free will in man by means of ignorance as to the behaviour of atoms . The older laws of mechanics which governed the movements of bodies large enough to be seen remain true to a very close approximation as regards such bodies , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to single electrons and protons . It is not yet known with any certainty whether there are laws governing the behaviour of single atoms in all respects , or whether the behaviour of such atoms is in part random . It is thought possible that the laws governing the behaviour of large bodies may be merely statistical laws , expressing the average result of a large number of random motions . Some , such as the second law of thermodynamics , are known to be statistical laws , and it is possible that others may be . In the atom there are various possible states which do not merge continuously into each other , but are separated by small finite gaps . An atom may hop from one of these states to another , and there are various different hops that it may make . At present no laws are known to decide which of the possible hops will take place on any given occasion , and it is suggested that the atom is not subject to laws at all in this respect , but has what might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ii his book on the Nature // of the Physical World , has made great play with this possibility ( p. 311 ff . ) . He thinks , apparently , that the mind can decide the atoms in the brain to make one or another of the possible transitions at a given moment , and thus , by means of some kind of trigger action , produce large-scale results in accordance with its volition . The volition itself , he thinks , is uncaused . If he is right , the course of the physical world , even where fairly large masses are concerned , is not completely predetermined by physical laws , hut is liable to be altered by the uncaused volitions of human beings . Before examining this position I should like to say a few words about what is called " the Principle of Indeterminacy . " This principle was introduced into physics in 1927 by Heisenberg , and has been seized on by clergymen ? chiefly , I think , on account of its name ? as something capable of giving them an escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , somewhat surprising that Eddingto.n should countenance this use of the principle ( see page 306 ) . The Principle of Indeterminacy states that it is impossible to determine with precision both the position and the momentum of a particle ; there will be a margin of error in each , and the product of the two errors is constant . That is to say , the more accurately we determine the one , the less accurately we shall be determining the other , and vice versa . The margin of error involved is , of course , very small . I am surprised , I repeat , that Eddington should have appealed to this principle in connexion with the question of free will , for the // principle does nothing whatever to show that the course of nature is not determined . It shows merely that the old space-time apparatus is not quite adequate to the needs of modern physics , which , in any case , is known on other grounds . Space and time were invented by the Greeks , and served their purpose admirably until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centaur which he called " space-time , " and this did well enough for a couple of decades , but modern quantum mechanics has made it evident that a more fundamental reconstruction is necessary . The Principle of Indeterminacy is merely an illustration of this necessity , not of the failure of physical laws to determine the course of nature . As J. E. Turner has pointed out ( Nature , December 27 , 1930 ) , " The use to which the Principle of Indeterminacy has been put is largely due to an ambiguity in the word determined . ' " In one sense a quantity is determined when it is measured , in the other sense an event is determined when it is caused . The Principle of Indeterminacy has to do with measurement , not with causation . The velocity and position of a particle are declared by the Principle to be undetermined in the sense that they can not be accurately measured . This is a physical fact causally connected with the fact that the measuring is a physical process which has a physical effect upon what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indeterminacy to show that any physical event is uncaused . As Turner says : " Every argument that , since some change can not be determined ' in the sense of ascerio6 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK tanned , ' it is therefore not determined ' in the absolutely different sense of caused , ' is a fallacy of equivocation . " Returning now to the atom and its supposed free will , it should be observed that it is not known that the behaviour of the atom is capricious . It is false to say the behaviour of the atom is known to be capricious , and it is also false to say the behaviour is known to be not capricious . Science has quite recently discovered that the atom is not subject to the laws of the older physics , and some physicists have somewhat rashly jumped to the conclusion that the atom is not subject to laws at all . Eddington 's argument about the effect of the mind on the brain inevitably reminds one of Descartes 's argument on the same subject . Descartes knew of the conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum . He therefore thought that the mind could alter the direction of the motion of the animal spirits , though not its amount . When , shortly after the publication of his theory , the conservation of momentum was discovered , Descartes 's view had to be abandoned . Eddington 's view , similarly , is at the mercy of the experimental physicists , who may at any moment discover laws regulating the behaviour of individual atoms . It is very rash to erect a theological superstructure upon a piece of ignorance which may be only momentary . And the effects of this procedure , so far as it has any , are necessarily bad , since they make men hope that new discoveries will not be made . There is , moreover , a purely empirical . objection to the belief in free will . Wherever it has been possible to subSCIENCE // j ect the behaviour of animals or of human beings to careful scientific observation , it has been found , as in Pavlov 's experiments , that scientific laws are just as discoverable as in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict human actions with any completeness , but this is quite sufficiently accounted for by the complication of the mechanism , and by no means demands the hypothesis of complete lawlessness , which is found to be false wherever it can be carefully tested . Those who desire caprice in the physical world seem to me to have failed to realize what this would involve . All inference in regard to the course of nature is causal , and if nature is not subject to causal laws all such inference must fail . We can not , in that case , know anything outside of our personal experience ; indeed , strictly speaking , we can only know our experience in the present moment , since all memory depends upon causal laws . If we can not infer the existence of other people , or even of our own past , how much less can we infer God , or anything else that the theologians desire . The principle of causality may be true or may be false , but the person who finds the hypothesis of its falsity cheering is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He usually retains unchallenged all those causal laws which he finds convenient , as , for example , that his food will nourish him and that his bank will honour his cheques so long as his account is in funds , while rejecting all those that he finds inconvenient . This , however , is altogether too naive a procedure . There is , in fact , no good reason whatever for supposioS THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK ing that the behaviour of atoms is not subject to law . It is only quite recently that experimental methods have been able to throw any light on the behaviour of individual atoms , and it is no wonder if the laws of this behaviour have not yet been discovered . To prove that a given set of phenomena is not subject to laws is essentially and theoretically impossible . All that can be affirmed is that the laws , if any , have not yet been discovered . We may say , if we choose , that the men who have been investigatiti the atom are so clever that they must have discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that this is a sufficiently solid premise upon which to base a theory of the universe . ( 2 ) God as Mathei atician. ? Eddington deduces religion from the fact that atoms do not obey the laws of mathematics . Jeans deduces it from the fact that they do . Both these arguments have been accepted with equal enthusiasm by the theologians , who hold , apparently , that the demand for consistency belongs to the cold reason and must not interfere with our deeper religious feelings . We have examined Eddington 's argument from the way that atoms jump . Let us now examine Jeans 's argument from the way that stars cool . Jeans 's God is Platonic . He is not , we are told , a biologist or an engineer , but a pure mathematician ( The Mysterious Universe , p. 134. ) - 1 confess to a preference for this type of God rather than the one that is conceived after the analogy of big business ; but that , no doubt , is because I prefer thinking to doing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RELIGI ? N log muscular tone upon theology . The man whose muscles are taut believes in a God of action , while the magi whose . muscles are relaxed believes in a God of thought and contemplation . Jeans , confident no doubt in his own theistic arguments , is not very complimentary to these of the evolutionists . His book on the Mysterious Universe begins with a biography of the sun , one might almost say an epitaph . It seems that not more than one star in about one hundred thousand has planets , but that some two thousand million years ago the sun had the good fortune to have a fruitful meeting with another star , which led to the existing planetary offspring . The stars that do not have planets can not give rise to life , so that life must be a very rare phenomenon in the universe . " It seems incredible , " says jeans , " that the universe can have been designed primarily to produce life like our own : had it been so , surely we might have expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the amount of the product . " And even in this rare corner of the universe the possibility of life exists only during an interlude between weather that is too hot and weather that is too cold . " It is a tragedy of our race that it is probably destined to die of cold , while the greater part of the substance of the universe still remains too hot for life to obtain a footing . " Theologians who argue as if human life were the purpose of creation seem to be as faulty in their astronomy as they are excessive in their estimation of themselves and their fellow-creatures . I shall not attempt to summarize Jeans 's admirable chapters on modern I10 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK physics , matter and radiation , and relativity and the ether ; they are already as brief as possible , and no summary can do them justice . I will , however , quote jeans 's own summary in order to whet the reader 's appetite . " To sum up , a soap-bubble with irregularities and corrugations on its surface is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , of the new universe revealed to us by the theory of relativity . The universe is not the interior of the soap-bubble but its surface , and we must always remember that , while the surface of the soap-bubble has only two dimensions , the universe-bubble has four ? three dimensions of space and one of time . And the substance out of which this bubble is blown , the soap-film , is empty space welded on to empty time . " The last chapter of the book is concerned to argue that this soap-bubble has been blown by a mathematical Deity because of His interest in its mathematical properties . This part has pleased the theologians . Theologians have grown grateful for small mercies , and they do not much care what sort of God the man of science gives them so long as he gives them one at all . Jeans 's God , like Plato 's , is one who has a passion for doing sums , but being a pure mathematician , is quite indifferent as to what the sums are about . By prefacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eminent author manages to give it an air of profundity which it would not otherwise possess . In essence the argument is as follows : since two apples and two apples together make four apples , it follows that the SCIENCE AND RELIGION III Creator- must have known that two and two are four . It aright be objected that , since one man and one woman together sometimes make three , the Creator was not yet quite as well versed in sums as one could wish . To speak seriously : Jeans reverts explicitly to the theory of Bishop Berkeley , according to which the only things that exist are thoughts , and the quasi-permanence which we observe in the external world is due to the fact that God keeps on thinking about things for quite a long time . Material objects , for example , do not cease to exist when no human being is looking at them , because God is looking at them all the time , or rather because they are thoughts in His mind at all tunes . The universe , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfectly and inadequately , as consisting of pure thought , the thought of what , for want of a wider word , we must describe as a mathematical thinker . " A little later we are told that the laws governing God 's thoughts are those which govern the phenomena of our waking hours , but not apparently of our dreams . The argument is , of course , not set out with the formal precision which jeans would demand in a subject not involving his emotions . Apart from all detail , he has been guilty of a fundamental fallacy in confusing the realms of pure and applied mathematics . Pure mathematics at no point depends upon observation ; it is concerned with symbols , and with proving that different collections of symbols have the same meaning . It is because of this symbolic character that it can be studied without the help of II2 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK experiment . Physics , on the contrary , however mathematical it may become , depends throughout on observation and experiment , that is to say , ultimately upon sense perception . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he provides is useful to the physicist . And what the physicist asserts when he uses mathematics is something totally different from what the pure mathematician asserts . The physicist asserts that the mathematical symbols which he is employing can be used for the interpretation , colligation , and prediction of sense impressions . However abstract his work may become , it never loses its relat , on to experience . It is found that mathematical formulae can express certain laws governing the world that we observe . Jeans argues that the world must have been created by a mathematician for the pleasure of seeing these laws in operation . If he had ever attempted to set out this argument formally , I can not doubt that he would have seen how fallacious it is . To begin with. , it seems probable that any world , no matter what , could be brought by a mathematician of sufficient skill within the scope of general laws . If this be so , the mathematical . character of modern physics is not a fact about the world , but merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second place , if God were as pure a pure mathematician as His knightly champion supposes , He would have no wish to give a gross external existence to His thoughts . The desire to trace curves and make geometrical models belongs to the schoolboy stage , and would be considered infra dig by a professor . Nevertheless it is // this desire that jeans imputes to his Maker . The world , he tells us , consists of thoughts ; of these there are , it would seem , three grades : the thoughts of God , the thoughts of men when they are awake , and the thoughts of men when they are asleep and have bad dreams . One does not quite see what the two latter kinds of thought add to the perfection of the universe , since clearly God 's thoughts are the best , and one does not quite see what can have been gained by creating so much muddle-headedness . I once knew an extremely learned and orthodox theologian who told me that as the result of long study he had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commend this puzzle to the attention of Jeans , and I hope that he will comfort the theologians by dealing with it at no distant date . ( 3 ) God as Creator. ? One of the most serious difficulties confronting science at the present time is the difficulty derived from the fact that the universe appears to be running down . There are , for example , radio-active elements in the world . These are perpetually disintegrating into less complex elements , and no process by which they can be built up is known . This , however , is not the most important or difficult respect in which the world is running down . Although we do not know of any natural process by which complex elements are built up out of simpler ones , we can imagine such processes , and it is possible that they are taking place somewhere . But when we come to the second law of thermodynamics we encounter a more fundamental difficulty . // The second law of thermodynamics states , roughly speaking , that things left to themselves tend to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that once upon a time the universe was all tidy , with everything in its proper place , and that ever since then it has been growing more and more disorderly , until nothing but a drastic spring-cleaning can restore it to its pristine order . In its original form the second law of thermodynarics asserted something much less general : namely , that when there was a difference of temperature between two neighbouring bodies , the hotter one would cool and the colder one would get warmer until they reached an equal temperature . In this form the law states a fact familiar to everyone : if you hold up a red  --  hot poker , it will get cool while the surrounding air gets warm . But the law was soon seen to have a much more general meaning . The particles of very hot bodies are in very rapid motion , while those of cold bodies move more slowly . In the long run , when a number of swiftly moving particles and a number of slowly moving particles find themselves in the same region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sets acquire on the average equal velocities . A similar truth applies to all forms of energy . Whenever there is a great deal of energy in one region and very little in a neighbouring region , energy tends to travel from the one region to the other , until . equality is established . This whole process may be described as a tendency towards democracy . It will be seen that this is an irreversible process , and that in the past // energy must have been more unevenly distributed than it is now . In view of the fact that the material universe is now considered to be finite , and to consist of some definite though unknown number of electrons and protons , there is a theoretical limit to the possible heaping-up of energy in some places as opposed to others . As we trace the course of the world backwards in time , we arrive after some finite number of years ( rather more than four thousand and four , however ) , at a state of the world which could not have been preceded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then valid . This initial state of the world would be that in which energy was distributed as unevenly as possible . As Eddington says : The difficulty of an infinite past is appalling . It is incon-ceivable that we are the heirs of an infinite time of prepa-ration , it is not less inconceivable that there was once a moment with no moment preceding it . This dilemma of the beginning of time would worry us more were it not shut out by another overwhelming difficulty lying between us and the infinite past . We have been studying the running-down of the universe ; if our views are right , somewhere between the beginning of time and the present day we must place the winding up of the universe . Travelling backwards into the past we find a world with more and more organization . If there is no barrier to stop us earlier we must reach a moment when the THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK energy of the world was wholly organized with none of the random element in it . It is impossible to go back any further under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phrase " wholly organized " begs the question . The organization we are concerned with is exactly definable , and there is a limit at which it becomes perfect . There is not an infinite series of states of higher and still higher organization ; ner , I think , is the limit one which is ultimately approached more and more slowly . Complete organization does not tend to be more immune from loss than incomplete organization . There is no doubt that the scheme of physics as it has stood for the last three-quarters of a century postulates a date at which either the entities of the universe were created in a state of high organization , or pre-existing entities were endowed with that organization which they have been squandering ever since . Moreover , this organization is admittedly the antithesis of chance . It is something which could not occur fortuitously . This has long been used as an argument against a too aggressive materialism . It has been quoted as scientific proof of the intervention of the Creator at a time not infinitely remote from to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions from it . Scientists and theologians alike must regard as somewhat crude the naive theological doctrine which ( suitably disguised ) is at present to be found in every textbook of thermodynamics , namely , that some billions of years ago God wound up the material universe and has left it to chance ever since . // ' Phis should be regarded as the working-hypothesis of thermodynamics rather than its declaration of faith . It is one of those conclusions from which we can see no logical escape ? only it suffers from the drawback that it is incredible . As a scientist I simply do not believe that the present order of things started off with a bang ; unscientifically I feel equally unwilling to accept the implied discontinuity in the Divine nature . But I can make no suggestion to evade the deadlock . It will be seen that Eddington , in this passage , does not infer a definite act of creation by a Creator . His only reason for not doing so is that he does not like the idea . The scientific argument leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument in favour of free will , since that is based upon ignorance , whereas the one we are now considering is based upon knowledge . This illustrates the fact that the theological conclusions drawn by scientists from their science are only such as please them , and not such as their appetite for orthodoxy is insufficient to swallow , although the argument would warrant them . We must , I think , admit that there is far more to be said for the view that the universe had a beginning in time at some not infinitely remote period , than there is for any of the other theological conclusions which scientists have recently been urging us to admit . The argument does not have demonstrative certainty . The second law of thermodynamics may not hold in all times and places , or we may be mistaken in thinking the uni118 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK verse spatially finite ; but as arguments of this nature go , it is a good one , and I think we ought provisionally to accept the hypothesis that the world had a beginning at some definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this that the world was made by a Creator ? Certainly not , if we are to adhere to the canons of valid scientific inference . There is no reason whatever why the universe should not have begun spontaneously , except that it seems odd that it should do so ; but there is no law of nature to the effect that things which seem odd to us must not happen . To infer a Creator is to infer a cause , and causal inferences are only admissible in science when they proceed from observed causal laws . Creation out of nothing is an occurrence which has not been observed . There is , therefore , no better reason to suppose that the world was caused by a Creator than to suppose that it was uncaused ; either equally contradicts the causal laws that we can observe . Nor is there , so far as I can see , any particular comfort to be derived from the hypothesis that the world was made by a Creator . Whether it was , or whether it was not , it is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of very nasty wine , you would not like it any better for being told that it had been made in a laboratory and not from the juice of the grape . In like manner , I see no comfort to be derived from the supposition that this very u.npleasing universe was manufactured of set purpose . Some people ? among whom , however , Eddington is not included ? derive comfort from the thought that if // ( ; od made the world , He may wind it up again when it has completely run down . For my part , I do not see how an unpleasant process can be made less so by the reflection that it is to be indefinitely repeated . No doubt , however , that is because I am lacking in religious feeling . The purely intellectual argument on this point may be put in a nutshell : is the Creator amenable to the laws of physics or is He not ? If He is not , He can not be inferred from physical phenomena , since no physical causal law can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply the second law of thermodynamics to Him and suppose that He also had to be created at some remote period . But in that case He has lost His raison d'etre . It is curious that not only the physicists , but even the theologians , seem to find something new in the arguments from modern physics . Physicists , perhaps , can scarcely be expected to know the history of theology , but the theologians ought to be aware that the modern arguments have all had their counterparts at earlier times . Eddington 's argument about free will and the brain is , as we saw , closely parallel to I ) escartes's. jeans 's argument is a compound of Plato and Berkeley , and has no more warrant in physics than it had at the time of either of these philosophers . The argument that the world must have had a beginning in time is set forth with great clearness by Kant , who , howe-kr , supplements it by an equally powerful argument to prove that the world had no beginning in time . Our age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inventions , but in the realm of philosophy it is Ito THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK much less in advance of the past than it imagines itself to be . We hear a great deal nowadays about the oldfashioned materialism , and its refutation by modern physics . As a matter of fact , there has been a change in the technique of physics . In old days , whatever philosophers might say , physics proceeded technically on the assumption that matter consisted of hard little lumps . Now it no longer does so . But few philosophers ever believed in the hard little lumps at any date later than that of Democritus . Berkeley and l fume certainly did not ; no more did I.eibniz , Kant and Hegel . Mach , himself a physicist , taught a completely different doctrine , and every scientist with even a tincture of philosophy was ready to admit that the hard little lumps were no more than a technical device . In that sense materialism is dead , but in another and more important sense it is more alive than it ever was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little lumps or of something else , but whether the course of nature is determined by the laws of physics . The progress of biology , physiology , and psychology has made it more probable than it ever was before that all natural phenomena are governed by the laws of physics ; and this is the really important point . To prove this point , however , we must consider some of the dicta of those who deal with the sciences of life . ( ? ) Evolutionary Theology. ? Evolution , when it was new , was regarded as hostile to religion , and is still so considered by fundamentalists . But a whole school of SCIENCE AND RELIGION I2I apologists has grown up who see in evolution evidence of a Divine Plan slowly unfolding through the ages . Some place this Plan in the mind of a Creator , while others regard it as immanent in the obscure strivings of living organisms . In the one view we fulfil God 's purposes ; in the other we fulfil our own , though these are better than we know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution has become entangled in a mass of detail . When , long ago , Huxley and Mr. Gladstone debated the truth of the Christian religion in the pages of the Nineteenth Century , this great issue was found to turn upon the question whether the Gadarene swine had belonged to a Jew or a Gentile , since in the latter case , but not in ' the former , their destruction involved an unwarrantable interference with private property . Similarly the question of purpose in evolution becomes entangled in the habits of the amophila , the behaviour of sea-urchins when turned upside-down , and the aquatic or terrestrial habits of the axolotl . But such questions , grave as they are , we may leave to specialists . In passing from physics to biology one is conscious of a transition from the cosmic to the parochial . In physics and astronomy we are dealing with the universe at large , and not only with that corner of it in which we happen to live , nor with those aspects of it which we happen to exemplify . From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon : very few stars have planets ; very few planets can support life . Life , even on the earth , belongs to only a very small proportion of the matter close to the // earth 's surface . During the greater part of the past existence of the earth , it was too hot to support life ; during the greater part of its future existence , it will be too cold . It is by no means impossible that there is , at this moment , no life anywhere in the universe except on the earth ; but even if , taking a very liberal estimate , we suppose that there are scattered through space some hundred thousand other planets on which life exists , it must still be admitted that living matter makes rather a poor show if considered as the purpose of the whole creation . There are some old gentlemen who are fond of prosy anecdotes leading at last to a " point " ; imagine an anecdote longer than any you , have ever heard , and the " point " shorter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Creator according to the biologists . Moreover , the " point " of the anecdote , even when it is reached , appears hardly worthy of so long a preface . I am willing to admit that there is merit in the tail of the fox , the song of the thrush , or the horns of the ibex . But it is not to these things that the evolutionary theologian points with pride : it is to the soul of man . Unfortunately , there is no impartial arbiter to decide on the merits of the human race ; but for my part , when I consider their poison gases , their researches into bacteriologica.l warfare , their meannesses , cruelties and oppressions , I find them , considered as the crowning gem of the creation , somewhat lacking in lustre . But let that pass . Is there anything in the process of evolution that demands the hypothesis of a purpose , whether immanent or transcendent ? This is the crucial question . For one who is // not a biologist it is difficult to speak otherwise than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entirely unconvinced by the arguments in favour of purpose that I have seen . The behaviour of animals and plants is on the whole such as to lead to certain results , which the observing biologist interprets as the purpose of the behaviour . In the case of plants , at any rate , he is generally willing to concede that this purpose is not consciously entertained by the organism ; but that is all the better if he wishes to prove that it is the purpose of a Creator . I am , however , quite unable to see why an intelligent Creator should have the purposes which we must attribute to Him if He has really designed all that happens in the world of organic life . Nor does the progress of scientific investigation afford any evidence that the behaviour of living matter is governed by anything other than laws of physics and chemistry . Take , for example , the process of digestion . The first step in this process is the seizing of food . This has been carefully studied in many animals , more particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to peck at any object having more or less the shape and size of edible grains . After some experience this unconditioned reflex becomes transformed into a conditioned reflex , exactly after the manner studied by Pavlov . The same thing may be observed in babies : they suck not only their mothers ' breasts , but everything physically capable of being sucked ; they endeavour to extract food out of shoulders and hands and arms . It is // only after months of experience that they learn to confine their efforts after nourishment to the breast . Sucking in infants is at first an unconditioned reflex , and by no means an intelligent one . It depends for its success upon the in-telligence of the mother . Chewing and swallowing are at first unconditioned reflexes , though through experience they become conditioned . The chemical processes which the food undergoes at various stages of digestion have been minutely studied , and none of them require the in-vocation of any peculiar vital principle . Or take again reproduction , which , though not uni-versal throughout the animal kingdom , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now noth-ing in this process that can rightly be called mysterious . I do not mean to say that it is all fully understood , but that mechanistic principles have explained enough of it to make it probable that , given time , they will explain the whole . Jacques Loeb , over twenty years ago , discov-ered means of fertilizing an ovum without the interven-tion of a spermatozoon . He sums up the results of his experiments and those of other investigators in the sen-tence : " We may , therefore , state that the complete imita-tion of the developmental effect of the spermatozoon by certain physico-chemical agencies has been accom-plished . " ' Take again the question of heredity , which is closely associated with that of reproduction . The present state of scientific knowledge in regard to this matter is set forth // very ably by Professor Hogben in his book on The Nature of Living Matter , more particularly in the chapter on the atomistic view of parenthood . In this chapter the reader can learn all that a layman needs to know about the Mendelian theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how anybody can , in view of what is now known on these subjects , maintain that there is anything in the theory of heredity requiring us to bow down before a mystery . The experimental stage of embryology is still recent , yet it has achieved remarkable results : it has shown that the conception of an organism which had dominated biology is not nearly so rigid as had been supposed . To graft the eye of one salamander tadpole on to the head of another individual is now a commonplace of experi-mental embryology . Five-legged and two-headed newts are now manufactured in the laboratory . But all this , the reader may say , is concerned only with the body ; what are we to say concerning the mind ? As to this , the question is not quite so simple . We may ob-serve , to begin with , that the mental processes of animals are purely hypothetical , and that the scientific treatment of animals must confine itself to their behaviour and to their physical processes , since these alone are observable . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean merely that in so far as we are scientific we should say nothing about their minds one way or the // other . As a matter of fact , the behaviour of their bodies appears to be causally self-contaitied , in the sense that its explanation does not , at any point , demand the intervention of some unobservable entity which we could call a mind . The theory of the conditioned reflex deals satisfactorily with all those cases in which it was formerly thought that a mental causation is essential for explaining the behaviour of the animal . When we come to human beings , we seem still able to explain the behaviour of human bodies on the assumption that there is no extraneous agent called mind acting upon them . But in the case of human beings this statement is much more questionable than in the case of other animals , both because the behaviour of human beings is more complex , and because we know , or think we know , through introspection , that we have minds . There is no doubt that we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have minds ; but , as often happens , although we know something it is very difficult to say what we know . More particularly it is difficult to show that the causes of our bodily behaviour are not purely physical . It seems to introspection as though there were something called the will which causes those movements that we call voluntary . It is , however , quite possible that such movements have a complete chain of physical causes to which the will ( whatever it may be ) is a mere concomitant . Or perhaps , since the subject matter of physics is no longer matter in the old sense , it may be that what we call our thoughts are ingredients of the complexes with which // physics has replaced the old conception of matter . The dualism of mind and matter is out-of-date : matter has become more like mind , and mind has become more like matter , than seemed possible at an earlier stage of science . One is led to suppose that what really exists is something intermediate between the billiard-balls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here , however , an important distinction to be made . There is , on the one hand , the question as to the sort of stuff the world is made of , and on the other hand , the question as to its causal skeleton . Science has been from its inception , though at first not exclusively , a form of what may be called power-thought : that is to say , it has been concerned to understand what causes the processes we observe rather than to analyse the ingredients of which they are composed . The highly abstract scheme of physics gives , it would seem , the causal skeleton of the world , while leaving out all the colour and variety and individuality of the things that compose the world . In sug p gesting that the causal skeleton supplied by physics is , in theory , adequate to give the causal laws governing the behaviour of human bodies , we are not suggesting that this bare abstraction tells us anything about the contents of human minds , or for that matter about the actual constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned materialism were far too concrete and sensible to be admitted into the framework of modern physics , but the same is true of our thoughts . The concrete variety of the actual world seems to be largely ir128 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK relevant when we are investigating these causal processes . Let us take an illustration . The principle of the lever is simple and easily understood . It depends only upon the relative positions of the fulcrum , force , and resistance . It may happen that the actual lever employed is covered with exquisite pictures by a painter of genius ; although these may be of more importance from the emotional point of view than the mechanistic properties of the lever , they do not in any way affect those properties , and may be wholly omitted in an account of what the lever can do . So it is with the world . The world as we perceive it is full of a rich variety : some of it is beautiful , some of it is ugly ; parts seem to us good , parts bad . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties of things , and it is these properties with which science is concerned . I am not suggesting that if we knew these properties com-pletely we should have a complete knowledge of the world , for its concrete variety is an equally legitimate object of knowledge . What I am saying is that science is that sort of knowledge which gives causal understanding , and that this sort of knowledge can in all likelihood be completed , even where living bodies are concerned , with-out taking account of anything but their physical and chemical properties . In saying this we are , of course , going beyond what can at present be said with any certainty , but the work that has been done in recent times in physiology , biochemistry , embryology , the mechanism of sensation , ' // and so on , irresistibly suggests the truth of our conclusion . One of the best statements of the point of view of a religiously-minded biologist is to be found in Lloyd Mor-gan 's Emergent Evolution ( 1923 ) and Life , Mind and Spirit ( 1926 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of evolution , more particularly of what he calls " emergent evolution . " The definition of emergent evolution , if I understand it rightly , is as follows : it sometimes happens that a collec-tion of objects arranged in a suitable pattern will have a new property which does not belong to the objects singly , and which can not , so far as we can see , be deduced from their several properties together with the way in which they are arranged . He considers that there are examples of the same kind of thing even in the inorganic realm . The atom , the molecule , and the crystal will all have properties which , if I understand Lloyd Morgan aright , he regards as not deducible from the properties of their constituents . The same holds in a higher degree of living organisms , and most of all with those higher organisms which possess what are called minds . Our minds , he would say , are , it is true , associated with the physical or-ganism , but are not deducible from the properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . " Emergent evolution , " he says , " is from first to last a revelation and manifestation of that which . I speak of as Divine Purpose . " Again he says : " Some of us , and I for one , end with a concept of activity , under acknowledgment , // as part and parcel of Divine Purpose . " Sin , however , is not contributory to the manifestation of the Divine Purpose ( p. 288 ) . It would be easier to deal with this view if any reasons were advanced in its favour , but so far as I have been able to discover from Professor Lloyd Morgan 's pages , he considers that the doctrine is its own recommendation and does not need to be demonstrated by appeals to the mere understanding . I do not pretend to know whether Professor Lloyd Morgan 's opinion is false . For aught I know to the contrary , there may be a Being of infinite power who chooses that children should die of meningitis , and older people of cancer ; these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , therefore , evolution embodies a Divine Plan , these occurrences must also have been planned . I have been informed that suffering is sent as a purification for sin , but I find it difficult to think that a child of four or five years old can be sunk in such black depths of iniquity as to deserve the punishment that befalls not a few of the children whom our optimistic divines might see any day , if they chose , suffering torments in children 's hospitals . Again , I am told that though the child himself may not have sinned very deeply , he deserves to suffer on account of his parents ' wickedness . I can only repeat that if this is the Divine sense of justice it differs from mine , and that I think mine superior . If indeed the world in which we live has been produced in accordance with a Plan , we shall have to // reckon Nero a saint in comparison with the Author of that Plan . Fortunately , however , the evidence of Divine Pur-pose is non-existent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence is adduced by those who believe ill it . We are , therefore , spared the necessity for that atti-tude of impotent hatred which every brave and humane man would otherwise be called upon to adopt towards the Almighty Tyrant . We have reviewed in this chapter a number of different apologies for religion on the part of eminent men of sci-ence . We have seen that Eddington and Jeans contradict each other , and that both contradict the biological theo-logians , but all agree that in the last resort science should abdicate before what is called the religious consciousness . This attitude is regarded by themselves and by their ad-mirers as more optimistic than that of the uncompromising rationalist . It is , in fact , quite the opposite : it is the out-come of discouragement and loss of faith . Time was when religion was believed with whole-hearted fervour , when men went on crusades and burned each other at the stake because of the intensity of their convictions . After the wars of religion theology gradually lost this intense hold on men 's minds . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taken by science . In the name of science we revolutionize industry , undermine family morals , enslave coloured races , and skilfully exterminate each other with poison gases . Some men of science do not altogether like these uses to which science is being put . In terror and dis132 THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK may they shrink from the uncompromising pursuit of knowledge and try to find refuge in the superstitions of an earlier day . As Professor Hogben says : The apologetic attitude so prevalent in science to-day is not a logical outcome of the introduction of new concepts . It is based upon the hope of reinstating traditional beliefs with which science was at one time in open conflict . This hope is not a by-product of scientific discovery . It has its roots in the social temper of the period . For half a decade the nations of Europe abandoned the exercise of reason in their relations with one another . Intellectual detachment was disloyalty . Criticism of traditional belief was treason . Philosophers and men of science bowed to the inexorable decree of herd suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship . Contempo-rary philosophy has yet to find a way out of the intellec-tual discouragement which is the heritage of a World War . ' It is not by going backward that we shall find an issue from our troubles . No slothful relapses into infantile fantasies will direct the new power which men have de-rived from science into the right channels ; nor will philo-sophic scepticism as to the foundations arrest the course of scientific technique in the world of affairs . Men need a faith which is robust and real , not timid and half-hearted . Science is in its essence nothing but the systematic pursuit // of knowledge , and knowledge , whatever ill-uses bad men may make of it , is in its essence good . To lose . faith in knowledge is to lose faith in the best of man 's capacities ; and therefore I repeat unhesitatingly that the unyielding rationalist has a better faith and a more unbending op-timism than any of the timid seekers after the childish comforts of a less adult age . CHAPTER VI Beginnings of Scientific Technique No sharp line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafts . The essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed . A certain apparatus of desires is presupposed : men want food , offspring , clothing , housing , amusement , and glory . Uninstructed man can realize these things only very partially ; man scientifically equipped can obtain much more of them . Compare , say , King Cyrus and a modern American billionaire . King Cyrus was , perhaps , the superior of the modern magnate in two respects ; his clothes were grander , and his wives more numerous . At the same time , it is probable that his wives ' clothes were not so grand as the clothes of the modern magnate 's wife . It is part of the superiority of the modern magnate that he is not obliged to dress in glittering raiment in order to be known to be great ; the newspapers see to this . I suppose not one hundredth as many people knew of Cyrus in his lifetime as know of a Hollywood star . This increased possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other objects of human de-137 // sire which we enumerated just now , it is quite clear that modern technique has immensely increased the number of those who can enjoy a certain measure of satisfaction . The number of people who now own cars is greatly in excess of the number who had enough to eat one hundred and fifty years ago . By sanitation and hygiene the scientific nations have put an end to typhus and plague and a host of other diseases which still flourish in the East and formerly afllictcd Western l ? urope . If one may judge by behaviour , one of the most ardent desires of the human race , or at any rate of its more energetic portions , has been until recently a mere increase of numbers . In this respect science has proved extraordinarily successful . Compare the number of people in Europe in the year 1700 with the number of European descent at the present day . The population of England in 1700 was about 5 million , and is now about 40 million . The population of other European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased in about the same proportion . The population of European descent at the present day is about 725 millions . Other races , meanwhile , have increased very much less . It is true that in this respect a change is coming over the world . The most scientific races no longer increase much , and really rapid increases are now confined to countries in which the government is scientific while the population is unscientific . This , however , arises from quite recent causes which we shall not consider at present . The earliest beginnings of scientific technique belong P // to prehistoric times ; nothing is known , for example , as to the origin of the use of fire , though the difficulty of procuring fire in early times is shown by the care with which sacred fires were tended in Rome and other early civilized communities . Agriculture also is prehistoric in origin , though perhaps it did not precede the dawn of history by any very long period . The domestication of animals is mainly prehistoric , but not wholly : according to some authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sumerians , and gave military victory to those who employed it in preference to the ass . In countries with a dry climate the beginning of writing practically coincides with the beginning of history , since early records survive in Egypt and Babylonia much longer than they would do in a less parched soil . The next great stage in scientific technique was the working of metals , which falls entirely within the historical epoch . It is no doubt because iron was a recent invention that in certain passages of the Bible its use is forbidden in the construction of altars . Roads , from the earliest period down to the fall of Napoleon , have been constructed chiefly for military reasons . They were essential to the coherence of large empires ; they first became important for this purpose under the Persians , and were developed to their fullest extent by the Romans . The Middle Ages added gunpowder and the mariner 's compass , and , at their very end , the invention of printing .
