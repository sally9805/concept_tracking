Levine , Trotsky &; Stalin <P> Sirs : <P> What in the world possessed you to describe me in your issue of Feb. 1 as " an avowed , outspoken partisan of Trotsky ? " Did the Moscow trial upset you so much ? Your account shows that you handled the Moscow end of it much more authoritatively than the Manhattan end . <P> My article in the New York American , on the basis of which you characterized me as a violent Trotskyite , said : <P> " The frame-up system has been the cornerstone of Soviet ' justice ' since the middle of 1918 . Trotsky and Radek , Zinoviev and Bukharin helped build it . " <P> My Stalin published in 1931 and republished in a new edition in England in 1936 , says : <P> " The Bolshevist guillotine was built by Lenin . Trotsky as well as Stalin , Kamenev as well as Zinoviev , helped in its erection . " <P> Does that sound like the statement of a Trotskyite ? <P> Since you coupled me with Eugene Lyons , whom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against my being an unprofessional partisan , the following correction is in order : <P> ... I never belonged to any political party or clique . For more than 20 years I have consistently and deliberately pursued the course of an independent journalist and author . In fact , there is nothing in my record which does not entitle me to be called " a thoroughly professional journalist . " ( See story by George Seldes in current Esquire . ) <P> And now for the last correction . " The first quoting interview ever given by J. Stalin to a foreign journalist was obtained by Eugene Lyons , " you pontifically announce . Wrong once more ! <P> The first personal quoting interview ever given by J. Stalin was granted to Mr. Hearst 's New York American . The interviewer was none other than the eminent Jerome Davis , lately of Yale . It was published in all the Hearst papers on Oct. 3 , 1926 . The then shy Stalin presented to the Hearst readers his first autographed picture ever given for publication . <P> But that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained by yours truly in 1924 for the New York American . It was in the form of a series of questions submitted in writing and answered in writing by the mysterious Georgian in the Kremlin . I had the honor of seeing it published in full in the Soviet press simultaneously with its publication in America . . . . <P> ISAAC DON LEVINE <P> New York City
