On the high bank of the Hudson River near the braced , tremendous span of the George Washington Bridge , the City of New York owns 56 acres of rock ledge and greenery called Fort Tryon Park . There last week the mayor , the park commissioner , the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the world 's greatest philanthropist dedicated a magnificent museum of medieval art . Named " The Cloisters , " this finely-proportioned granite building with red tiled roofs lacks nothing but a chapter of Benedictines to be one of the most beautiful monasteries in the world . <P> The Cloisters would never have been built but for the acquisitive energy of the late Sculptor George Grey Barnard ( TIME , May 2 ) . In France before the War , Sculptor Barnard kept his eye peeled for fine examples of Gothic stone work . He brought back to the U. S. large sections of the cloisters of four great , abandoned monasteries , installed them with other medievaluables in a gallery next to his studio . In 1925 John D. Rockefeller Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan Museum , added gifts of his own . When he gave Fort Tryon Park to the City in 1930 , he reserved a site for the new $2,500,000 museum . <P> At the opening last week , President George Blumenthal of the Metropolitan solemnly thanked Mr. Rockefeller , and Park Commissioner Robert Moses pointed out his princeliness in buying eleven miles of Palisades across the river to keep the " backdrop " forever virginal . The good , grey donor , however , insisted that his contribution , " being largely financial , " was " relatively unimportant . " <P> Designed with notable-sanity by Boston Architect Charles Collens , The Cloisters escapes the clutter of ornate neoGothic , spaciously integrates a whole 12th-Century chapter house , three open cloisters , Romanesque and Gothic chapels , a refectory and several long galleries of superb sculpture and tapestries . First visitors last week could trace , in an hour 's attentive ramble , the progress of medieval art from the devout symbolism of the 11th Century to the tender realism of the 15th . Biggest &; best show piece : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller bought in 1923 for a reported $1,100,000.
