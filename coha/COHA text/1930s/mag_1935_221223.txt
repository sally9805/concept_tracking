Last week the directors of Hudson Bay Mining &; Smelting Co. declared their initial dividend , a 50 payment that marked the first return on a classic promotion . Just 20 years ago a Canadian prospector stumbled on a rusty streak of sulphide ore in the ancient rocks of northern Manitoba . Having grub-staked the prospector and his five partners , John E. ( " Jack " ) Hammell made them a proposition : $100,000 for each prospector , $1,000,000 for himself if he could get it . Laughing uproariously , the prospectors agreed . <P> As a practical mine the Flin Flon claims looked hopeless . They were 87 miles from the nearest railroad in the depth of Manitoba 's bush . Nevertheless Jack Hammell sold the idea to a Manhattan financier without benefit of facts , figures or engineering reports . An investment of $150,000 cash did not even pay the costs of a thorough survey . Another man sank $400,000 in the Flin Flon , then he too gave up . But Jack Hammell still had the Flin Flon options . <P> Early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his playboy son , Cornelius Vanderbilt ( " Sonny " ) Whitney , who knew something about mining as well as water travel ( see cut ) , canoed through Manitoba lakes and rivers to inspect the claims in person . Upshot was organization of Hudson Bay Mining &; Smelting in 1927 with the Flin Flon claims and $17,500,000 in cash . Jack Hammell and his hungry prospectors had already been paid off on substantially their own terms . <P> Hudson Bay 's claims were not on Hudson Bay but they were not far from it . Temperatures ranged from 87 to - 51 . Major hurdle was a railroad , which the Government-owned Canadian National eventually built . A 44,550 h.p. power plant was installed on the Churchill River 59 miles farther on in the wilds . Turbines , generators and thousands of tons of supplies were dragged in by horse , barge , tractor and sledge . But by 1930 Flin Flon was nearing its present population of 5,000 , and the mine was ready for operation . In that year another $5,000,000 was raised by a bond issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a preliminary to the payment of dividends , the last of that bond issue was paid off 100 on the dollar . No sooner had ore shipments started in 1930 than the prices of copper and zinc , Hudson Bay 's principal products , began to crash to historic lows . In 1932 Hudson Bay Mining stock could have been bought for 75 per share . Last week it was selling at $15 per share . Profits before depletion in 1934 were $1,500,000 . Including a small amount of ore handled for other nearby mines , Hudson Bay 's production last year was 99,000 oz. of gold , 1,300,000 oz. of silver , 37,000,000 Ib. of copper , 49,000,000 Ib. of zinc . Today with copper in world markets about 7 per Ib. and hard to sell at that , the great Whitney promotion market-wise has a somewhat golden appeal . With gold at $35 per oz. nearly one half of its revenues last year were in the yellow metal .                    @
