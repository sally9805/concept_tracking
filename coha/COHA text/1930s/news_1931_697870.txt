txt Letters to the Editor Gas Fumes in Buses . To the Editor of The New York Times : Today 's issue of THE TIMES tells of the awarding of franchises to the Fifth Avenue Coach Company . Riding in one of their Fifth Avenue buses today , I was taken ill from the gas fumes and obliged to leave the coach . The guard told me the fumes affected him and that many of the men suffered in this way . Many persons have told me that they can not ride on these buses for the same reason . Why does not the Board of Health take this matter up ? CECIL COWDREY . New York . May 31. 1931 . Funds for Children Needed . To the Editor of The New York Times : Last year Camp Moodna of Grand Street Settlement gave vacations to 550 children . The hard Winter has made vacations more necessary and less possible to all these children . Will not some readers of THE TIMES enjoy their vacations more if they also make a vacation possible to an undernourished child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including fare . Contributions may be sent to Grand Street Settlement , 311 East Broadway . ROSE GRUENING . New York , May 26 , 1931 . A Violin Is Wanted . To the Editor of The New York Times : We have at Inwood House , 228 West Fifteenth Street , New York , a young talented girl who plays the violin exceptionally well . Would one of your readers have a violin which they would be willing to contribute for the use of this girl so that she may keep up her interest in music ? FRANK L. CLAWSON , Director . New York , May 27 , 1931 . MR . SHAW MISTAKEN . Contemporary Testimony Shows Joan of Arc Was Attractive . To the Editor of The New York Times : I am wondering what Bernard Shaw gains by insisting that Joan of Arc was unattractive , when all the evidence we have is to the contrary . In the preface to his play " St. Joan " he says : " Not one of Joan 's comrades , in village , court or camp * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his broadcast address of yesterday he added : " It is an established fact that Joan was n't beautiful . " The positiveness of these assertions make them sound true  --  as If there were something behind them in the way of evidence . As a matter of fact , there is not , in any of the testimony taken at Joan 's two trials , or in any chronicle of the time , or letter , or record , a single word of the sort . On the other hand , there is sworn testimony ? much better than Mr. Shaw 's unsupported statement  --  that she was not only attractive but beautiful , physically as well as spiritually . At Joan 's second trial , the " Rehabilitation " as it was called , Jean d'Aulon , Joan 's master of horse , who rode with her , fought by her side during her brief year of glory , and was captured with her at Compiegne , testified that she was a " young girl , beautiful and well formed " ( " jeune fille , belle et bein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcript , which may be seen in printed form at the New York Library , " Proces de Jeanne d'Arc " ( Quicherat collection ) , Vol . III , page 219 , or in my own set . Also in the Quicherat collection of old Joan documents , Vol . V , pages 106 to 111 , Is the transcript of a letter , written in old French , by two young men , the brothers Gui and Andre de Laval , who rode to Sellessur-Cher to offer their swords and their fortune to Joan in the cause of France . The letter was written to their lady mother , and to their grandmother , Jeanne de Laval , who in her youth had been the wife of the great du Guesclin , and brings us closer to Joan 's personality than any other document . To any one familiar with the old French it is worth looking up . It is the best picture that has been left to us . The writer tells of meeting Joan , and of her warm welcome . Then he adds : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her and to hear her . " Happily , he does not say that she was pretty . She was more than that ? she was divine . A young man of 20 does not write of an unprepossessing girl , however exalted her mission , as " something wholly divine " to see and to hear . We can only draw one of two or three conclusions from Mr. Shaw 's insistence on Joan 's unprepossessing appearance : Either he can not read the old French and Latin documents or he has neglected to do so . Unless it may be that he wishes to invite notoriety by differing from the world 's customary attitude of belief regarding Joan , just as a mountebank may stand on his head and kick his heels to get the attention of the crowd . Mr. Shaw makes as many as ten other mistakes in his play and " introduction " about Joan . ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE . New York , May 31 , 1931 . Dodging the Left Turn . To the Eaftor of The New York Times : I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street " not at a crossing . " In the First place , for most of 1930 the left turn by motorists against the signal was not permitted . In a period of ten years I have been knocked down by motor vehicles turning left at crossings once in Paris , once in Buffalo and once In New York . Only one of these is a matter of record , as I did not dare to report in Paris for fear of a fine , and in New York I did not have time to identify the car . You may conclude from even these fragmentary statistics that I have developed some agility in avoiding the metorist making the left turn , but the New York variety is too fast . Only last week I saw a chauffeur come to the crossing when the signal was red , turn right , make a left turn in twenty-five feet on the street he turned into and . turn right into the street where the signal was red . I have decided that the safest course for the pedestrian is to pass behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that he may cross safely and jaywalk in the safety zone between two red lights . F. E. BROOKE . New York , May 30 , 1931 . Fourth of July Noises and Others . To the Editor of The New York Times : - Quite aside frc:n the effect the noises of toy pistols , torpedoes and other noise-producing devices used by children before and on the Fourth of July have on those who hear them , should be considered the effect upon the children themselves . They are breaking the laws of the city , knowing that the police , their parents and other adults countenance this lawbreaking . And when this breaking of the law can cause physical injrrias , maiming , and at times death , Is there not reason enough for every one to see to it that New York should have a quiet Fourth ? More than that  --  toy pistols lead sometimes to the real thing  --  and homicide . The toy automobile drivers who ? get a kick out of tooting their horns and otherwise disturbing the quiet of the day  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to be a major problem in this crowded city , and that they are disturbers of the peace every day in the year . Let us human beings give the fool side of ourselves a rest . BLANCHE WATSON . New York , June 1 , 1931 . NOT ALL MEMORIES FAILING . Those in the Peace Parade Rememe bered Horrors of War . To the Editor of The New York Times : The good-will and peace parade , in protest against the airplane demonstration on May 23 , was doubtless not outwardly impressive either in size or cost . But those of us who took part in it believe that it helped stiffen the backbones of many who still waver between horror of war and timidity at expressing it openly before a still dangerously militaristic public opinion . That there were not thousands instead of hundreds in the peace procession argues however , not so much weakness of the opposition to war in general as insufficiently vivid memories of past conflicts and too easily slumbering imaginations of what another yet more destructive " Armageddon " would mean to humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare , for example , shall we allow ourselves to forget the following well-authenticated report by a newspaper correspondent of a certain boat-ride that he had to take in performance of his duty as an eyewitness ? " Twelve thousand corpses were encumbering this river , among which were thousands of women and children . Navigation was all but impossible . Every moment the boat had to plow her way through a tangled , mangled mass of corpses strung and lashed together by their long hair . The river 's banks were literally covered with them , and in the curves of the winding stream were to be seen dark putrid masses of human flesh and bone surging and swaying in the steamer 's wake and wash . " Or this record of an achievement by an air-raid over London , from Irvin S. Cobb 's war notebook : " In a hospital I saw a little girl who had been most terribly maimed by a 200-pound bomb of high explosives from 8,000 feet above . I am not going to dwell on the state of this child . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings that I have . But one of her hands was gone at the wrist , and the other hand was badly shattered ; so she was just a wan little brutally abbreviated fragment of humanity , a living fraction , most grievously afflicted . * * * She was lying , when . I saw her , with her head propped up on a pillow that was no whiter than her face , and there was the pitiable wraith of a smile on her poor little pinched commonplace face . To her breast , with the bandaged stump of one arm and with her remaining hand , that was swathed in a clump of wrappings , she cuddled up a painted china doll which somebody had brought her , and she was singing to it . " Those who marched in the peace procession on the day of the recent sham raid and battle of aircraft over and about this city simply refuse to forget those things in their naked horror , or to let the imagination evade them and go to sleep , as it so much likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequivocal and , no matter what the penalties , going on record as opposing all war demonstrations and preparations which sooner or later inevitably bring about just such results as those instanced above . No more rivers like that river , and no more maimed children like that child on our consciences ! What were a few jeers from the curbstone crowd ( and there was applause also , that did not get into the reports ) compared to that ? Surely for many others also besides those who marched in the parade to renounce the carnage of war the vibrant thrumming of those nearly six hundred airplanes could not drown out a penetrant voice far-borne from a Galilean mountainside , declaring to this generation also : " Blessed are the peacemakers . " ELIOT WHITE . New York , May 31. 1931 . FOR A NATIONAL PANTHEON . Need Is Seen In Widely Scattered Burial Places of Presidents .
