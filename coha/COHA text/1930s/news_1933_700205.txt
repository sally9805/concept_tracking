txt All the party forecasts Our for today 's poll implicitly Local credit New York City Loyalties . with a virtue it is commonly accused of lacking . It is the spirit of neighborliness . All the headquarters assume that borough loyalty will count . Mr. expects to be elected by rolling up a big Bronx vote and breaking even in the other counties , Mr. LAGUARDIA expects his biggest proportional pluralities in Manhattan and has only modest expectations in the Bronx . Mayor O'BRIEN also counts heavily on Manhattan , his home borough . It remains for the actual figures to show how far the ancient home and neighborhood loyaltic s of an agricultural civilization actually do survive in this industrial Babylon of more tlian seven million souls . They are stronger than is generally supposed . People in New York will go for years without speaking to the family across the hall , but an appeal to keep the Sheriff 's office " home " in Manhattan ( or the Bronx , or Queens ) will not always leave them cold . It is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Life more than once  --  that TEXAS Era . GuiNAx 's famous war-cry , " Hello , sucker ! " summed up the entire civilization of our late New Era . Candor compels one to point out that other nations after the war succumbed to the passion for paying $1.50 for a bottle of ginger ale in a cellar night club . London claimed to possess the greatest female virtuoso in this line of endeavor in the person of a " Night Club Queen " who amassed a fortune , married her daughters into the peerage and went to jail several times a year for violating the license laws . Perhaps SPENGLER , CHESTERTON Or ANDRE MAUROIS will some day tell us why the nations , emerging from the agony of a world war , went in so furiously for " night life . " One can understand the mad pursuit of pleasure after untold privations and sacrifices . But why pursue pleasure in subsurface , badly ventilated night clubs ? After four years of trenches , dugouts , mines and pill-boxes one would imagine a cellar would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western farmers want to New climb back to 1926 condiYork 's tions . Well , traffic on New Riders . York City 's transit lines has succeeded in getting back to the year 1926 , moving the other way . On all the lines , subway , surface and elevated , and including the Hudson Tube , passengers for the year ending June 30 were fewer by nearly a quarter of a billion than for the preceding year . They were fewer by more than half a billion for the year ending June 30 , 1930 ? that is to say , before the depression . Still , the transit lines last year carried very nearly two and three-quarter billion passengers . It was a decline of 16 per cent from prosperity days , but it meant about 7,500,000 rides every day of the year , or one daily ride for every man , woman and child in the city . Times Square stations shared in the decline , but even then they received and discharged about 160,000,000 persons in the course of a year . This is about 450,000 persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss when 1933 finds itself back where we were in 1926 . But it might be worse . You hear so many people saying that America In 1933 is worse off than it was in 1492 . JUAN MARCH has es Spain caped from his Spanish Lets Them prison and fled the Escape . counE try . He has been much written about as Spain 's richest man and the most formidable opponent of the republican regime , which he fought from his prison cell over a period of two years . He was said to exercise control over some of the most important newspapers in the country , and the Government was supposed to tremble at his power . But apparently this latest of Europe 's mystery men was not quite the awesome figure he has been made out to be . The Spanish millionaire 's jailbreak came about in the simplest fashion imaginable . The commander of the prison says he let Senor MARCH ride away in an automobile because he felt sorry for him . At first this sounds like straight from the " Pirates of Penzance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a prison technique of its own in dealing with its opponents . Not very long ago it allowed a whole penal colony full of aristocrats in North Africa to run away in a ship . So far the results have been satisfactory . Ex-Chancellor Ercusxisc is denounced in Nazi quarters as hostile to the State . Yet the election next Sunday is designed to prove that nobody in Germany is opposed to the Nazi State . So many foreign observers find this country completely changed that as soon as we have finished recognizing Russia we ought to try and see if we ca n't recognize ourselves . There is still time for one of the candidates to sweep the city by pledging himself to suppress mechanical outdoor shouters in future elections . What a lot of money New York could save if all the candidates for Mayor were elected and they all carried out their economy programs !
