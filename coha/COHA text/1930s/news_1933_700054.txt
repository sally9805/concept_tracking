txt CALVIN W. RICE , secretary of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers , in a letter to THE TIMES a few days ago expressed " a profound feeling of respect and admiration " for the generosity of private citizens of Chicago in making possible an array of museums rivaled only by government-supported institutions in the largest European capitals . Men of wealth have given perhaps more generously here in New York to educational institutions than in any other city . But there is one notable lack . New York has not as yet such a museum of science and industry as Chicago has in partial operation and more fully in prospect . We have made a beginning , however . " The Museum of the Peaceful Arts , " reorganized as The Museum of Science and Industry , under the presidency of FREDERIC B. PRATT and the directorship of CHARLES R. RICHARDS , is housed in a building at 220 East Forty-second Street ( where it occupies a whole floor ) and suggests what such a museum might bring in practical and cultural values to millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate endowment . Dr. VON MuLLER , till lately head of the Deutsches Museum in Munich , has made the best demonstration of the possibility of building up such a museum , even with modest expenditure , for many of the exhibits illustrating the evolution of the present-day machines and processes are available without expense . Austria began a museum of this character in the midst of the war , which is a " marvel for beauty and inspiration " as well as a great incentive to progressive invention , and accompanied it with almost no actual expenditure of money . There , as in Munich , workingmen gave of their skill and time , manufacturers gave of their machines , processes and fabrics . An institution of this type is not " a hodge-podge of mechanical . wonders " but an illustrated history of the stages of the evolution through which natural laws have come to minister to man 's needs and aspirations . Even children are able to read the story of many of the machines by performing themselves the operations which the race has taken centuries to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments of war and peace , of livelihood and defense , become transformed into the powerful locomotive , the giant press , the swift plane . It has been suggested that an ideal site for such a museum would be the block in the Chrystie-Forsyth area nearest the bridge exit . This would be a place convenient of access from Brooklyn and Long Island as well as Manhattan and the Bronx . But whatever site is eventually found , it should be centrally located and preferably on the east side , which has now no public museum . With the beginning of what seems to be a new chapter in our industrial history , naw is an especially good time to plan . Here is an outstanding opportunity for one person or for many persons to build and endow an institution that will have a permanent place in the life of the city along with the other great museums ? of the fine arts and of natural history . Once the building were provided from private sources , with workingmen 's aid in free time in its erection and adornment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
