txt Not a Dead Thing . In regard to the President 's speech to the correspondents , may not these points in all justice be made ? First , that our democracy is not a dead , formalistic thing , but the sum of 130,000,000 perceptions and beliefs ; that the instruction of the people is of prime importance ; that it is the duty of the President to share in that instruction . Second , that the existence of a " shadow zone " in the United States had been notorious long before the Supreme Court emphasized the fact . This is the zone where the Federal authority may not , and the State authority in practice does not , extend . It has been a haven of outlaws , a refuge of chiselers , a limbo of good causes . Third , when we consider the urgency of this and other problems today , we would do well to remember the neglect accorded them during the three preceding national administrations , which has greatly intensified them . It was not good complacently to give over for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Woodrow Wilson . It is only just to consider the government 's labors of today in the light of the omissions of yesteryear . A. C. NIELSEN . Brooklyn , June 1 , 1935.
