During the War $3,404,000,000 worth of munitions and supplies was bought in the U. S. for France by one of gruff Premier Georges ( " Tiger " ) Clemenceau 's hard young men , M. Andr Tardieu , who returned from Washington with thick-rimmed spectacles and a breezy pugnacity which made Frenchmen start calling him " Tardieu I'Amricain " - no compliment intended . Last week at Lyon , in a witness box , M. Tardieu testified with what seemed to most Frenchmen like the brutality of an American gangster . <P> He said that between 1926 and 1932 , during which years he was Premier of France and held various Cabinet portfolios , he on at least 20 occasions gave Government money in banknote form to Colonel Count Francois de La Rocque , leader of the Fascist War veterans ' organization , Croix de Feu , which has now been reorganized as the Social Party ( TIME , March 29 ) . <P> Referring to 1929 , the year in which he first became Premier , Tardieu I'Amricain testified : " At that time I had to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to oppose them with forces of order . I had to meet action by some 400,000 or 500,000 Communists , and I thought the Croix de Feu was an interesting attempt to link the War generation with the generations of the future . I got very good service from the Croix de Feu . They kept order when and where I asked it . " <P> The French and most other European Governments have " secret funds " which it is perfectly legal for the Premier to expend in absolutely any manner he thinks fit-indeed , no Frenchman would be surprised to learn that plug-uglies of the Left were receiving wads of banknotes from the Popular Front Cabinet today to " keep order " - but that any onetime Premier should so utterly lack discretion as to blurt out brutal facts of this kind and give the politicians ' show away , last week astonished Europe . But there was no outcry that French Democracy should no longer employ " secret funds " since these are considered a necessary weapon always in reserve for quick action against the quick-acting dictators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the aristocratic original founders of the Croix de Feu , Duke Joseph Pozzo di Borgo , called M. Tardieu to bear witness that the Duke had spoken truly in making public accusations against Colonel de La Rocque which the colonel described in a speech as " maliciously false . " The Duke took this charge as occasion to sue for slander , and the Lyon court was expected to give judgment next week . <P> Meanwhile France remembered that after the last Tardieu Cabinet fell ( TIME , May 16 , 1932 ) , Colonel de La Rocque , who had never liked Tardieu I'Americain although willing to take banknotes where he could find them , referred publicly to the fallen Premier as a " political corpse . " For this M. Tardieu in the witness box took ample revenge last week , although Colonel de La Rocque was there to shout in court : " This is not true ! Tardieu lies ! "
