txt Aldermanic President took the initiative yesterday in pressing for rate reductions on electricity , gas and telephone service in this city and thus manoeuvred Tammany out of the initial credit for launching a drive that seems likely to become one of the chief issues in the Fall Mayoralty campaign . Mr. 's surprise move came in the form of a resolution at the 1 weekly meeting of the committee of the whole of the Board of Estimate . The resolution carried an appropriation of $50,000 and directed Corporation Counsel Hilly to begin immediate action aimed at the reduction of utility rates . Mr. estimated the resultant saving at $25,000,000 a year . ! The resolution caught Mayor O'Brien and other Tammany members of the board completely unI awares . As it was read the Mayor 's face flushed and he gave every indication of discomfiture . " There is no question as to the necessity for a reduction of these rates , " the Mayor said . " Fifty thousand dollars , however , will only scratch the surface . " Sees $25,000,000 Saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. shot back . " I will make it $100,000 if necessary . We spent $100,000 just to verify the Controller 's books . We can save the people $25,000,000 by spending $50,000 now . We should not hesitate . " " We do n't have to say anything on our side about fair rates , " the iMayor responded . " Our stand in the matter is generally known . Whatever sum is necessary for the cost of the proceedings will be appropriated . Call the roll for approval of the resolution . " The resolution was approved , without dissenting vote , and will Ibe formally adopted at a forth ! coming meeting of the Board of Estimate . Asked later what he meant by " our side , " the Mayor said that expression was somewhat editorial and referred to his own stand in the matter . He recalled that as Corporation Counsel he had di1 rected many utility rate cases . From experience he said he knew that $50,000 was no great amount to spend on such litigation , adding that one rate case in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fault with the principle of the resolution . " I 'm for that 1,000 per cent , " was the way he put it . Mr. addressed a letter to the Board of Estimate reviewing the utility rates in relation to the general drop in commodity prices . While there had been a drop of 20 to 50 per cent in labor costs , material costs and commodities since 11929 , he said , the gas , electric and telephone companies had not low ' ered their rates . Mr. 's Letter . " The present economic crisis . " he wrote , " has been marked by a steady decline in the cost of labor , materials and commodities . During the past two years so drastic has been the drop that today prices are from 20 to 50 per cent lower than they were in 1929 . As a consequence , production , maintenance and operation costs are at lower levels than at any other period since the war . " In spite of these wide and general reductions , which should have their reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric and telephone companies have not lowered their rates in any particular whatever . Despite a lowered wage scale for labor and a substantial- drop in the cost of materials , the rates these companies charge are as high or higher than they were when both prices of labor and materials were at their peak . " Every other industry has recognized these economic change ; and lowered its charges to meet present-day conditions . Where , however , monopoly rather than competition controls , the companies thus protected have taken advantage of the fall in prices and , in spite ' of the consumers ' restricted income , have continued to charge rates that were extremely profitable to the companies when costs of producHon , operation and maintenance were at their highest . ? ew York City is the largest user of gas , electricity and tele ' phones . It pays out millions annually to these companies for these services . While it has been ' compelled to use drastic means to curtail its expenditures , it has been paying these companies prices that are excessive and unwarranted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-owners in the city who have no other recourse except to pay monthly bills for gas , electricity and telephone services that are unecessarily and inequitably burdensome . " I feel sure that even a prima facie case would show that at least $25,000,000 could be saved annually in these charges for gas , electricity and telephone service , and still give the companies the return they are entitled to under the law . A cursory study of the facts points to this ; a proper presentation of the facts would make it a certainty and justify the Public Service Commission in ordering a general and far-reaching reduction in charges. ? Queens Inquiry Ordered . An immediate effect of the resolution developed last night when District Attorney Charles S. Golden of Queens announced he would begin an immediate grand jury investigation of the rates charged by " every public utility cort:ry in Queens operating under a city franchise . " Mr. Colden did r o t name the companies involve ' . but his inquiry will extend beyond the utilities mentioned by Mr. to transportation companies and others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of Borough President George U. Harvey for Mr. . The Queens prosecutor said that any action he took , would be criminal rrosecutions and would not conflict with any action brought by the Corporation Counsel . No extra cost to the taxpayers is involved , he said . Mr. Colden has accumulated a large store of complaints and information about the Queens rates , largely through the scores of civic organizations in his borough . He has been waiting to act until the Board of Estimate declared the city 's policy . Milo R. Maitbie , chairman of the Public Service Commission , said last night that the commission had not sufficient funds to prosecute all the complaints it received . On April 1 the commission had 120 cases in various stages of prosecution , but because of lack of funds , he said , it was obviously impossible to do all the work on the cases that is required by law . " It is probable that those cases will be taken up first where the municipalities are willing and prepared to submit material supporting their complaints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cases where the municipalities or complainants assist or bear part of the burden of progressing the case . This applies to New York City as well as to any other city , and a number of up-State cities have already been advised of this position of the commission . " Mr. 's resolution hit directly upon the campaign issue that Tammany expects to foster in the ' forthcoming Mayoralty campaign : The five-cent fare issue is considered relatively minor by organization leaders , since an increased subway fare is in prospect because of the change in subway financing last year . The utility rate issue has large appeal for the taxpayers and is expected to draw their support to the Democratic organization . Should Mr. run as an opposition candidate for Mayor , he is now in position ' to claim the first credit for launching the campaign for lower rates , while , Tammany has no ' alternative to supporting the drive .
