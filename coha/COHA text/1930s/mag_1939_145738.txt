For proposing to shake Army airmen loose from Army groundlings , Brigadier General Billy Mitchell was harried out of the service in 1926 . For all but setting up an independent air service last week , Major General Henry H. Arnold was handsomely rewarded . He became the first Chief of Air Corps vested with control over every phase of the corps 's operations . Without any fanfare and with very little notice , a momentous change was thus made : the Army 's flying force was turned over to flying men . <P> Naturally this shift was not accomplished without strife in the Army . No secret in Washington is the fact that ever since able little Oscar Westover crashed to his death last year ( TIME , Oct. 3 ) , his successor has had to wage a friendly struggle with Chief of Staff Malin Craig . <P> Smart , aggressive General Arnold foresees that with the Air Corps about to be trebled in size and importance , the Army , to get full value from its airmen in the next war , may in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoughtful General Craig gravely doubts that the U. S. Army needs an Air Corps of Roosevelt dimensions . Furthermore , he believes that whatever its size the Air Corps should continue to be a subordinate arm , supplementing the all-important Infantry . <P> Aware that he must retire next August at 64 , resigned to the airward trend now that Franklin Roosevelt has taken off with the airmen , Malin Craig silently acceded to last week 's changes . <P> One change deprived him of control of the General Headquarters Air Force . When that unit was established in 1935 as the Army 's combat air force , it was placed outside the Air Corps proper . For a further check rein , its first commanding officer ( Major General Frank Maxwell Andrews ) was made directly responsible to the Chief of Staff . The GHQ Air Force now takes its place in the Air Corps and its new C. O. ( Major General Delos CArleton Emmons ) will be responsible to Henry Arnold alone . <P> By another change " in response to the recommendations of high Air Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Corps personnel and training ( a responsibility previously divided between him and the Chief of Staff ) thereby taking direct control of training the new Air Corps which is to increase from 1,638 to 3,203 Regular officers ( plus 3,000 Reservists ) , 21,500 to 45,000 enlisted men within ten years .
