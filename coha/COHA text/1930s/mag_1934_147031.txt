For many a year the U. S. churches have deplored what they call the brazen indecency of U. S. cinema . Their annual conferences have passed resolutions . Their clergy have lobbied for censorship bills . Their journals have crusaded . But for all their zeal the churches have accomplished very little . Last week , led by members of the Roman Catholic Church , they were embarked on a new crusade , brandishing a new weapon-the boycott . That they were in earnest impressed even hardboiled Variety , which for once put aside its racy style to tell about the " Legion of Decency " in a straightforward article headlined : " CATHOLICS WOULD ENLIST ALL FAITHS-Need for Prompt Action to Avert Drastic Penalties Upon Picture Industry Urged in East-Real Danger- " <P> Organized under the leadership of Most Rev. John Timothy McNicholas , Archbishop of Cincinnati , the Legion of Decency binds pledge-signers to " remain away from all motion pictures except those which do not offend decency and Christian morality . " The Legion of Decency charges no dues , hence differs from Mrs. August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full sympathy . Aiming at enlisting at least half the U. S. Catholic population of 20,000,000 as well as all Protestants and Jews who care to sign , the Legion last week claimed 2,000,000 members . In Saratoga Springs , N. Y. , Bishop Gibbons of Albany urged a Knights of Columbus convention to join . In Louisville , the League of Catholic Parent-Teacher Associations favored it . The Living Church ( Episcopal ) printed the pledge for its readers to sign . The Detroit Council of Churches ( 250,000 Protestants ) has urged ministers to promote it . Besides Catholic action in such cities as Mobile , Rochester , Little Rock . St. Louis , Omaha , New Orleans and Spokane , interdenominational action has been taken in Denver , Galveston and San Francisco . <P> The Legion of Decency provides no official guide to good and bad films . But individual priests and bishops may blacklist as they please . Fortnight ago in thousands of Catholic churches , schools and colleges appeared a poster written by Rev. Daniel Aloysius Lord , Jesuit editor of The Queen 's Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only lately revealed as the author of the famed Code which Presbyterian Will Hays and his producers adopted in 1930 . The poster : <P> These Pictures Violate Code <P> " The Trumpet Blows-produced by Paramount . . . .
