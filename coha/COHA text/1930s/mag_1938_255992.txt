Scandalous to U. S. moralists has been the increase , during the past three years , of petty gambling-bingo games and the like-under church auspices ( TIME . Dec. 27 , et ante ) . Whether or not they consider gaming sinful in itself , high-minded churchmen hold that the church bemeans herself by acting as croupier . Yet out of more than 200 U. S. Episcopal and Roman Catholic bishops-the most articulate shepherds of their flocks-not more than half-a-dozen in each church have spoken out against bingo games . Joining this minority last week . New York 's austere Episcopal Bishop William Thomas Manning threw the weight of his office not only against bingo but against legalized lotteries , currently being considered by a convention elected to rewrite the New York State Constitution . <P> Said Bishop Manning : " I am wholly opposed to the raising of funds for the Church or its work by means of gambling games or gambling devices , and I trust that no parish or mission in this diocese will permit or countenance such action . " The Bishop declared he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " even for charity . The annual convention of his diocese applauded , voted unanimously to notify the State constitutional convention of their disapproval of gambling . <P> Meanwhile in Albany , Protestant ministers had attended a hearing on a proposal to strike from the State Constitution its article against gambling . Though they were voluble concerning the moral aspects of gambling , the ministers were unable to explain why gambling , any more than prostitution , should be specifically unconstitutional . Roman Catholics kept mum . Their tidy attitude on this question is that gambling is licit if : 1 ) the gamer owns and can afford to lose what he wagers ; 2 ) he acts of his own free will ; 3 ) there is no fraud ; 4 ) there is equality among the parties to the game . By no means all bingo games or lotteries fulfill these conditions .
