Last week news from Europe took on its greatest change . Correspondents who step by step and hour by hour had reported the inevitably developing crisis , now found their stories crazily whirling and blurring . If the last weeks of peace had the solemnity of tragedy , the first days of World War II were like one of those old-fashioned movies in which people jerked their arms , exaggerated motions , and in which automobile wheels turned backwards while automobiles raced ahead . <P> In ten days the War had almost everything that in older and slower wars was more painfully and with more suffering acquired . It had a victory-the march of the German Army to the gates of Warsaw ( see p. 18 ) . It had a daring raid-the attack of British airmen on Germany 's naval base ( see p. 20 ) . It had a cautious advance as French troops fought on German soil for the first time in 70 years ( see p. 16 ) . It had its casualties , refugees , wrecks , ruins . It had its propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first peace offer when Field Marshal Goring spoke to German munition workers ( see col. 3 ) . <P> Audience . What gave World War II its hectic , high-speed air ? Unlike any war in history , its outcome , scope , character , depended less on the antagonists than on those who watched the fighting . Not maneuvers on the plains of Poland , but Moscow 's opinions about them , about the German army , about German plans , were historically decisive ; not the sinking of British freighters , but Mussolini 's opinion as to the strength of the British fleet , forecast the future of war . Only 206,000,000 of Europe 's 462,000,000 were officially at war last week. * But never had contestants played to a bigger gallery ; never had gallery opinion meant so much . <P> Russia . Biggest neutral , Russia , already indicating her preference by the German-Russian pact , headlined the news of German victories . Field Marshal Goring boasted vaguely of Russia 's raw materials . As German troops reached Warsaw , the streets of Moscow suddenly became full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Defense Commissariat . Conscription decrees called nearly 1,000,000 men into service . Russia had 3,000,000 under arms . <P> Nobody knew whether Russia was going to grab a piece of Poland , once she cracked , or join up with Germany against the Allies-or neither . <P> Italy . Most strategic neutral , Italy was profoundly impressed by Germany 's advance ; as the Army reached Warsaw , jeers at Britain filled the Italian press . Although Germany announced that after the Polish victory the Fhrer would return to Berchtesgaden to have a chat with Italian Ambassador Bernardo Attolico , although the German radio ridiculed attempts to " lure away the Italians from their Teutonic allies , " Mussolini lay low .
