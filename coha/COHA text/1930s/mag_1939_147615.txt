Said Eugene Gifford Grace , president of Bethlehem Steel , as he announced to his stockholders a $1 common dividend ( their first since 1937 ) : <P> " We are in a position to be War Baby No. 1 , as in the last war , but I can tell you that our directors and our associates do n't want that kind of business . I 'd like to see the war stop today . Bethlehem would be better off if it did . <P> " I 'd like to see a situation where we 'd never sell another gun , another battleship or another projectile . I 'd like to see the world stop destroying values and start creating values , and that would spell better business profits . "
