ARMY &; NAVY Last week a great olive-green snake with a hiss-like thunder hovered in the skies over the eastern half of the U. S. Sometimes it strung out in a disjointed line 20 mi. long . Sometimes it coiled in angles and echelons over cities . In the evenings it disintegrated , scattered down to rest for the night . For the first time , the Army had mustered its entire air strength for maneuvers . The 672 green-bodied , yellow-winged planes-205 pursuit , 335 observation , 51 attack , 36 bombardment , 45 transport-composed the greatest peacetime concentration of aircraft in U. S. history . <P> Segments of the green snake came from Mitchel Field , N. Y. , from Kelly Field and Fort Crockett in Texas , from Crissy and Rockwell Fields in California , from all over the country . When the armada assembled at Wright and Fairfield Fields in Dayton , it became a dire aerial weapon capable of firing 2,000,000 shots a minute or loosing 100,000 Ib. of bombs . Its title : The First Provisional Air Division . <P> First problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious mishap , in spite of dirty flying weather . Some bombers from the West were held up , and at Boiling Field ( Washington , D. C. ) the pilots watched a grey sky , chafed at delay . Finally three planes started off . An hour later two of them were forced back by the weather . The other plane was the only one to get through to Dayton from Boiling Field that day . It was piloted by baldheaded , pipe-smoking Brigadier General Benjamin Delahauf ( " Benny " ) Foulois , * 51-year-old Assistant Chief of Air Corps , senior airman in point of service , commander of this year 's maneuvers . <P> In 1898 Benny Foulois rode his bicycle into New York from Washington , Conn . He wanted to join the Navy . Finding no Navy recruiting station , unable to get into the merchant marine , he enlisted in the Engineer Corps . He rose from the ranks , was a Signal Corps lieutenant in 1908 . The first Army man to be taught to fly by Orville Wright , he was assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew after 90 minutes of instruction . During the War he was chief of the A. E. F. air service . <P> Over Dayton , birthplace of heavier-than-air craft , General Foulois and his staff of 150 watched the first demonstration of the three-week maneuvers . Flight after flight took the air , darkening the sky , drowning the city 's traffic roar . For the first time since the War militia planes , 99 of them from 18 States , and cadets from Kelly Field , took part in regular Army formations . Main event of the first day was a contest for honor position during the maneuvers between the 95th squadron , 20th Pursuit Group ( Rockwell Field ) , and the 36th squadron , First Pursuit Group ( Selfridge Field ) . The California squadron , led by Captain Frank O. Hunter ( War ace credited with nine planes ) , beat its rival under Captain Victor Strahm ( War ace credited with five planes ) in a smooth tactical and acrobatic operation .               @ @ @ @ @ @
