After an around-the-world tour that covered 75,000 miles , took him to 13 countries and 73 cities , Violinist Yehudi Menuhin , 19 , returned to Manhattan last week , gave a performance that was to mark a milestone in his amazing career . <P> Crowds had thronged to hear him in Europe , Australia , South Africa , New Zealand . Another record crowd pushed its way into Carnegie Hall last week where the boy appeared unaffected by the siege of adulation . For the Manhattan concert the Menuhin family made a special concession . Yehudi 's sister Hephzibah was permitted to play with her celebrated brother . <P> Yehudi held Hephzibah 's hand as they walked onto the stage . But there was no hesitation once the girl had seated herself at the piano and made sure that her brother was ready to begin . At 15 , the second Menuhin prodigy has a talent that could take her far as a solo performer . Like Yehudi she plays with complete concentration , an obvious respect for the music at hand . Together the pair achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sonatas by Brahms , Enesco , Franck , so impressed Arturo Toscanini that he sent word backstage asking for some Mozart as an encore . <P> Occasionally Yehudi 's playing showed faint signs of fatigue , of a transitional stage in his musical development . But the Menuhin parents still hold first place as the wisest of prodigy guides . On tour they kept the family together for all of the 17 months , refused invitations lest the children should be influenced by hearing too much praise . Next week they will move to their ranch in California , remain in retirement for two years while Yehudi has time to rest , study , develop into manhood . If Mother Menuhin has her way , Hephzibah will never have an intensive public career .
