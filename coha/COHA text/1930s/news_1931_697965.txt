txt The monthly computations of average prices show general agreement that the prolonged decline was replaced in June by a slight recovery . It may or may not be repeated in subsequent months . The change will no doubt be widely ascribed to the influence of the debt-remission proposal , but the fact of an arrest to the decline remains ; it naturally brings up the question when an actual reversal , even if temporary , will occur in the downward trend . This is of much importance , since virtually uninterrupted continuance of the fall has admittedly been the most difficult complication in the economic depression . The private experts , and with them the Labor Department 's statisticians , have reported only one other month in which the average has risen since the middle of 1929 . During that interv , the general average has fallen , according to the Labor Bureau 's figures , 27 per cent . Large as this reduction is , it is smaller than that which occurred in about the same space of time ten years ago . Compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ensuing decline , reached in the first month of 1922 , had fallen 45% per cent . Even as compared with the month in which the war ended , the fall had been 33 per cent . Once checked in the the early months of 1922 , an irregular recovery ensued ; by the end of that year the average was higher by 10 per cent . It had risen 143/4 per cent by March , 1923 , after which the trend was at most times slowly downward , the average having at one time in 1927 fallen almost to the low point of 1922 . In all this movement one important fact was that , although only part of the decline had been canceled , the halt in the continuous drop and reappearance of something like stability in prices changed the business situation from continuous reaction to reasonably sustained recovery , which in due course passed into great activity even without any further rise of prices . But another consideration worth remembering is that recovery began without a marked change in the underlying situation . Prices on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clogged with " frozen credits , " while our railways were often barely earning charges , and while Europe was in a state of profound depression . The explanation of the day was that , in most of our own industries , production had been cut to the bone and that consumption was increasing out of absolute necessity , from the previous low level of excessive economies . Once prices were visibly recovering and consumption even slowly increasing , the general attitude of the business community was quickly changed . Analogies in economic history can never be exact , especially when the course of all markets is so largely dominated by imagination and apprehension . Yet the one unquestionable ifact is that at some point the fall n prices will be checked and that , ? when this happens- , the deterrent influence on consumers ' purchases exerted by the mere sight of uninterruptedly declining values will consequently disappear . Until that occurs , we shall not know how much of a part such expectation of continuous decline had played in making possible the conditions that have existed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
