On the 14th floor of Manhattan 's Wurlitzer Building one evening last week 15 men and women stepped out of a night school , started down in an elevator . As the car passed the twelfth floor , it picked up abnormal speed . The operator tried to check it with the control lever , failed . Instants later the car smashed into the spring buffers at the bottom of the pit , bounced up again , settled for good with its floor split , its walls and mechanism utterly demolished . Jounced into a screaming jumble on the floor were the passengers , all alive , but two with broken legs , others with sprained ankles , bruises . These injuries , which in train , ship , automobile or airplane wrecks would not be considered unusual , last week caused headlines because they occurred on the world 's greatest , safest , most reliable means of transport . <P> In New York City alone there are 41,470 elevators-more than the total on any continent except North America . Every day they travel 100,000 miles , lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York transport systems combined . Very rarely there is a brief delay through mechanical error . Much more rarely is there an accident . In 1934 , last year for which figures are available , there were 96 elevator accidents in Manhattan . The ratio : one death for every 196,000,000 passengers : one injury for every 40,000,000 . For the U. S. as a whole , in 1934 there were 231 deaths from elevator accidents . Some were caused by fretful passengers jumping in or out too soon or late , or otherwise misbehaving . The rest were caused by carelessness on the part of operators .
