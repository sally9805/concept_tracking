Last week , as Congress discussed changes in the old-age provisions of the Social Security Act ( TIME , June 5 ) , U. S. doctors also turned their attention to old folks . Attention-turner was Problems of Ageing , * technical tome on what is technically called geriatrics , which contains the scholarly opinions of 25 experts on the medical and psychological problems of old age . First bang-up work on geriatrics ever published , the book contains an introduction by 79-year-old John Dewey , lengthy articles by such famous scientists as Physiologists Anton Julius Carlson of University of Chicago , Walter Bradford Cannon of Harvard , Nutritionist Clive Maine McCay of Cornell , Anthropologist Clark Wissler of Yale . <P> Interesting facts : <P> &gt; One-third of the nation will soon pass the half-century mark . Average life expectancy in the U. S. is now 60 years , and physicians believe it can never be raised above 75 . Reason : although cancer and bacterial diseases may eventually be controlled , bones will eventually buckle and warp , arteries will eventually harden . &gt; About half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circulatory system ( hardening of the arteries , heart trouble ) , 12.5% from diseases of the respiratory system ( pneumonia , influenza ) , 12.5% from cancer , 8.5% from kidney disease , the rest from diseases of the digestive system , or accidents . Prime affliction of old age is hardening of the arteries , which throws healthy , durable hearts and kidneys out of kilter , often brings about insanity and may contribute to diabetes . <P> &gt; Greatest problem of old age : resignation . Contrary to popular belief , old people are far from sexless . The flow of sex hormones does not ebb when men reach their 60s and 70s . Says Columbia 's Anatomist Earl Theron Engle , spermatozoa are formed in at least 50% of old men . Bending a Freudian ear to their querulous complaints , Psychiatrist Gilbert Van Tassel Hamilton of Santa Barbara , Calif , offers the opinion that old men &; women are no less troubled by sex problems than are the young . Says he : " Many persons . . . who have passed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with sex as a personal issue . " This makes them feel isolated , unattractive , frustrated . Despite Freud 's admission that psychoanalysis is applicable only to young , elastic personalities , Dr. Hamilton claims that patient analysis brings peace and equanimity to many an old heart . <P> <P> * Williams and Wilkins ( $10 ) .
