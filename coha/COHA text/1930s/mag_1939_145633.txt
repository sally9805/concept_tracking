For every 100 U. S. citizens who have heard of Thomas Alva Edison , it would be hard to find one who has heard of Josiah Willard Gibbs ( 1839-1903 ) . Some years ago , however , a gathering of British scientists spouting learned chitchat in a cafe voted Gibbs no less than the greatest U. S. scientist ever . <P> A lifelong bachelor , Gibbs was a quiet , modest man . At Yale , where he did his major work , most of the students not only did not know he was a great man ; they did not even know he existed . His colleagues admired him but found his recondite researches hard to understand . Like Albert Einstein , Josiah Willard Gibbs was not an experimenter but a thinker . <P> If energy is unevenly distributed in a closed system , it will be passed around until no further energy exchange is possible-that is , the system will reach " thermodynamic equilibrium . " Mathematically working out the conditions for equilibrium in mixed substances , Gibbs arrived at certain abstruse but beautifully logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the efficient handling of mixed substances in industry . Gibbs had no interest in technology , and technologists took quite a while to uncover , understand and apply his work to their own problems . Now that this has been done , however , the Gibbs rules have enormously facilitated and cheapened a great variety of industrial processes-for example , in metallurgy , refrigeration , fuel and power engineering ; in the manufacture of synthetic chemicals , ceramics , glass , fertilizers . <P> Yale itself was a long time recognizing the greatness of Gibbs . But this year the university is making handsome amends by commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth , and this week in New Haven a Gibbs dinner is being held to sing his praises . The celebrants at Yale reminded the world that although obstreperous strong men are making a lot of current news , it is for ' ' quiet people " that " history reserves some of its best places . Such a one was Josiah Willard Gibbs . . . . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
