Basic doctrines of European Socialism up until a few years ago were internationalism , disarmament , pacifism . Last week a vote at the Socialist Party Congress of France at Montrouge , suburb of Paris , showed dramatically how the rise of European dictatorships has changed those doctrines . <P> Former Premier Leon Blum , the party 's leader , presented resolutions endorsing French rearmament against the Fascist " menace . " He wanted the U. S. , Great Britain , France , Poland and Soviet Russia to form a democratic front against the dictatorships so that they would have to concede no more to threats of war . M. Blum also wanted France to revive the now moribund French-Soviet alliance . <P> Opposed to M. Blum was his old friend Paul Faure , the party 's secretary general , an old-line Socialist . M. Faure said he believed peace should be kept at all costs , no " entangling alliances " with either democracies or dictatorships should be made . Bad as the peace of Munich might have been , M. Faure believed it was better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialism won : Leon Blum 's resolution was endorsed , 4,322-to-2,837 , with 1,004 abstaining.
