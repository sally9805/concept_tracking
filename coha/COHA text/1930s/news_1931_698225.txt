txt About 15,000,000 acres of the Southwest 's winter wheat territory are off to the poorest start with the smallest moisture reserves ever known since this country has been a factor in wheat production . October days are passing with little relief from the long dry period in the wheat belt . While a few scattered showers fell 60 miles northeast of Dodge City and southwest into Texas over the past week-end , precipitation was not enough to change the situation . Rains in northwest Kansas , however , probably helped some . Moisture in September . only .69 of an inch in Dodge City , was only one-third average . This followed half average rainfall in July and August . Moisture reserves to get the soil in shape and carry the crop through the winter , must come in these months . Not only was September dry , it was the hottest and windiest September on record . so that what little moisture had been stored was exhausted by the untoward weather . The hot weather is also favorable to the activity of the wire worm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the weather is hot and dry its depredations are very effective . Possibly 30 , , of the wheat in the Dodge City district was seeded seasonably Certainly possibly 70 , : of this is lost through the dry weather and the wire worm . The areas where there is a stand of wheat and prospect for a stand are where local showers occurred . Condition .. Prevail Over 15,000,000 Acres Identical conditions prevail in a strip 130 miles wide over western Kansas . This territory harvested 7,000,000 acres of wheat this year . Similarly are 1.000.000 acres in Colorado . 3,000,000 in northwest Texas , 2,000,000 in western Oklahoma and 2,000,000 in western Nebraska . Only in 1918 has this aforementioned district failed to produce a substantial wheat yield . Every other year sonic portion of it has produced abundantly and this year , except for the Nebraska area , was its banner yield . The fall of 1917 preceding the total failure in 1918 had 70,4 , more precipitation than , the 1931. period .

Now this seed is being eaten up by the worms and probably will not show up at any time , even to form a soil cover . Farmers hesitate to put the seed in hot dry ground with the wire worm menace still prevailing . Time for successful seeding is rapidly passing . Consumption at High Rate Live stock consumption of wheat is proceeding at a high rate . Farmers near Dodge City have taken truck loads of wheat to Arkansas to bring back loads of fruit . In August they could sell their wheat there for live stock feed for 50 cents a bushel against a local trade price of about 28 cents . They have also taken truck loads north across into Nebraska and sold it for as high as SO cent , and brought back truck loads of pigs to feed their local wheat . Carloads of sheep and hogs have been shipped in .
