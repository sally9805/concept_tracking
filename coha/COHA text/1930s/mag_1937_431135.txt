TO THE housewife , cobwebs are just one more source of annoyance , but to the amateur microscopist they point the way to new and fascinating studies . For where one finds the lacy webs , one also finds spiders , whose activities as net builders are only less enthralling than the intricate structure of the creatures themselves . We usually think of spiders as insects , but if we look at one closely , we find that it has eight walking legs , whereas true insects invariably are six-legged . Therefore , to call an eight-legged spider an insect is not strictly correct . Technically , a spider is not an insect at all ; it is an arachnid . Along with the spiders , the class of arachnids includes the mites , ticks , king ( horseshoe ) crabs , and scorpions . Being the most common arachnids , however , spiders usually are taken as examples of the entire class . Among the characteristic features are the lack of antennae and of true jaws , the presence of a pair of peculiar tools and weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segments , the abdomen or rear part , and the cephalothorax or anterior portion . You should have no trouble capturing a spider or two for specimen material . The hunt is not a dangerous one , provided you avoid the shiny , dark-brown Black Widow and the hairy tarantula , which are just about the most poisonous spiders known . Other spiders may bite , if you are careless , but their bites , although poisonous to insects and small animals , will not be dangerous to you . A convenient way of capturing a spider after you have found it is to clap the open end of a test tube or bottle over it . and then carefully slide a puttyknife blade , flat steel rule , or other suitable instrument under the spider . After the spider is in the tube , it is easy to cork the mouth with a wad of cotton and then place a few drops of ether or chloroform on the cotton . Turn the tube upside down , and soon the spider will be in dreamland . Then you can pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . Of course , you can drown the spider directly in alcohol ( about seventy percent ethyl alcohol of the common " rubbing " or denatured kind will do ) . without first anesthetizing it with ether . but it will be easier to handle when it is asleep . If you want to make a photograph of a spider so that it will appear lifelike . the ether treatment is recommended . If the subject shows signs of waking up before you are through . a drop of ether on its body will quiet it for a few more minutes . Examine your captive under a hand lens or the lowest power of your microscope . You will find that the body is divided roughly into two halves . The cephalothorax , or fore part , serves as the point of attachment for the numerous appendages ? no less than a round dozen of them , while the soft , often much larger , abdomen has an important set of appendages that can not be seen without the aid of a lens . Clip a leg from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a magnification of 100 to 300 diameters you can see its con- drogen sulphide gas converts the chemical on the paper into lead sulphide , and when the paper is dried it will be black or very dark gray . To write upon it , use an ordinary solution of hydrogen peroxide . The black lead sulphide on the paper is oxidized to white lead sulphate by the peroxide . Scorched spots often can be removed from white fabrics by a similar reaction . If you apply hydrogen peroxide to the pot , the charred fibers will be oxidized or bleached colorless . You can manufacture hydrogen peroxide in your own laboratory by adding about seventy-five cubic centimeters of barium dioxide to an ice-packed flask holding 200 ubic centimeters of cold water . ( An ordinary drinking glass holds about 240 cubic entimeters . ) After several hours you will have a preparation known as hydrated barium dioxide . Now add enough strong ( sirupy ) phosphoric acid to the solution to give a red color to a piece of litmus paper immersed in it . As more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add more acid , shaking the flask each time , until you have used , in all , about twenty cubic centimeters of phosphoric acid . During this entire operation the liquid in the flask must be kept cold ? that is , at a temperature of about ten degrees centigrade , or fifty degrees Fahrenheit . Allow the whole mixture to settle and pour off the clear upper liquid , which contains hydrogen peroxide and some barium compound in solution . Filter the clear liquid , and then add dilute sulphuric acid to it , to precipitate the soluble barium compound . Let the precipitate settle . Add a little more of the weak sulphuric acid . If more white precipitate forms , not all of the barium compound has been removed . Let the precipitate settle again , and add more acid , repeating the process until no further precipitate occurs . Then add five or ten grams of starch to the liquid , shake it , and filter it . The filtrate will be a strong solution of hydrogen peroxide . It can be substituted for drug-store peroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it , however ; peroxide of this strength , even with a preservative like acetanilide , might blow apart a tightly stoppered bottle . A good chemical test for the presence of hydrogen peroxide can be made by dipping a strip of filter paper or ordinary white paper into a solution of potassium dichromate , which has been made acid with a drop or two of strong sulphuric acid to every ten cubic centimeters of solution . If the yellowed paper , while still wet , is touched with a solution containing hydrogen peroxide , it will turn blue . Hydrogen peroxide is not the only substance that yields oxygen when it decomposes . Another is the peculiar gas called ozone . Two oxygen atoms make a molecule of ordinary oxygen gas ; three oxygen atoms , a molecule of ozone . Thus you might consider them simply as two varieties of the same substance . But ozone exhibits interesting properties that ordinary oxygen , into which it readily turns , does not share . Many people mistakenly believe that the air at the seashore owes its bracing , tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tang from the decomposition of marine life . If you want to find out what ozone really smells like , you can do so right at home . All you need is some electrical appliance that uses a brush-type motor , such as a vacuum cleaner , electric fan , or electric mixer . Loosen one of the brushes so that the motor sparks brilliantly while it is running , and you can easily detect the odor of ozone , sometimes as far as several  | feet away . It suggests the scent of garlic , or of much-diluted chlorine gas . The electric discharge , in this case , rearranged molecules of the oxygen in the air to form ozone . The heat of a flame similarly produces traces of ozone . Ozone is formed around your Bunsen burner as you can prove by a simple chemical test . M AKE a paste of ordinary cornstarch with a small amount of warm water , in which you have dissolved a crystal of potassium iodide . White paper dampened with this thin paste will turn blue or brownish-black when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iodide , to form iodine , which in turn reacts with the starch to produce the familiar telltale discoloration . Place a strip of paper moistened with the starch-iodide paste in an evaporating dish or beaker . Hold the dish near the blue flame of your Bunsen burner , and blow the flame repeatedly toward the paper with a rubber bulb , stopping between each succession of puffs to let the dish cool . Soon the paper will become discolored , thus showing that the hot vapors directed against it contain ozone gas . For experiments with ozone , the best way to produce the gas is to pass a " silent discharge " of electricity through oxygen ? or through the air , which contains about twenty percent of oxygen . A spark coil of the vibrator type , now almost obsolete , but obtainable at low cost in a junk yard , will serve nicely as the source of high-tension electricity when it is connected to three series-connected dry cells or a storage battery . If you prefer , you may use a neon-sign transformer , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be connected to any household outlet supplying 110-volt alternating current . A simple set-up for making ozone consists of a glass tube , ten to twelve inches long and up to half an inch in diameter , sheathed inside and out with metal foil of the kind that comes on chocolate bars or camera films . The inner piece of foil does not have to line the tube snugly . Attach rubber tubing and a rubber bulb at one end of the tube , to force air through it . Connect one of the sections of metal foil to one of the two high-voltage terminals of the spark coil or transformer and the other to the second terminal and turn on the current . NOW , when you blow air through the tube by pressing the rubber bulb , ozone issues from the other end . You will notice the peculiar odor within a few seconds after turning on the electricity . A piece of the starch-iodide test paper also will show the presence of the gas . Hold a test tube or a small flask containing a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or " ozonizer , " and swirl the mercury about while you blow ozone over it by squeezing the rubber bulb . Soon the drop becomes sluggish and leaves a trail of dross behind it . This is an oxide of mercury . Ordinary oxygen does not attack mercury , but ozone readily oxidizes the liquid metal . Ozone also will tarnish silver , as you can demonstrate by directing the gas upon a bright silver coin . The experiment works best when the metal is warm , but not hot . Peroxide of silver is formed . Rubber tubing should not be used anywhere on the delivery side of your ozoneproducing apparatus , since rubber is attacked by ozone and the ozone itself is destroyed in the process . Other substances also will destroy ozone , turning it  | back into ordinary oxygen gas . One of these is turpentine , as you can show . Connect your ozonizer with a side-neck test tube or a flask containing turpentine by means of a glass L tube and a pair of corks . The L tube should dip into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The side neck of the test tube ( or a second L tube , if a flask is used ) leads the escaping gas to a horizontal section of glass tubing containing a strip of starch-iodide paper and a bright globule of mercury . Making the mercury stay put is a problem that is easily solved by blowing a small bulb into the side of the glass tubing . To do this , simply hold the side of the tubing in a Bunsen flame until it is red-hot , and then blow into one end , the other end being corked temporarily . WHEN this apparatus is set working , the ozone bubbles through the turpentine and is decomposed . The starch-iodide paper remains free from discoloration , and the mercury is unaffected , because it is oxygen and not ozone that reaches the exit tube . A slightly more elaborate apparatus for making ozone can be built around a glass condenser of the ordinary water-cooled type used in making laboratory distillations . Cork the exit end of the inner tube of the condenser and fill this tube with salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that conducts electricity . Connect a wire dipping into the liquid with one of the terminals of your spark coil or transformer , and the solution itself becomes one of the electrodes of your ozonizer . The remaining electrode consists of a strip of metal foil wrapped around the outer jacket of the condenser , and is connected to the other side of the high-voltage supply . Pass dry air ? or better , oxygen ? through one of the side arms and into part of the condenser that ordinarily serves as a water jacket . When the current is turned on , ozone will issue from the other side arm . You can obtain a steady flow of air with a siphon pump improvised from two gallon jugs set at different levels . As water siphons from the upper jug to the lower one , the rising water level in the bottom jug ejects the air , which is led through rubber tubing to the condenser . A pinch clamp in the siphon tube will enable you to regulate the stream of air to any desired velocity .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
