" Many Moscow residents listened in on the radio this morning expecting every moment to hear an announcement that Soviet troops had crossed the Finnish frontier , " cabled the New York Times 's Moscow Bureau last week . " In some respects Finland 's situation closely resembles that of Czecho-Slovakia in September 1938 . " <P> Instead of Adolf Hitler it was Soviet Premier Viacheslav Molotov who alternately cajoled and threatened , and instead of the Vlkischer Beobachter it was the Communist Party official newsorgan Pravda ( " Truth " ) that was out to whip up public indignation against the tiny " aggressor . " <P> Russians were told that Finnish Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko had made a speech at Helsinki in which he denounced " Russian imperialism " and cried , " There is a limit to everything . Finland can not accept the proposals of the Soviet Union and will defend her territory and her inviolability and independence by all means ! " Pravda headlined its story ERKKO INCITES TO WAR ! , editorialized that this speech " can not be understood except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republics . " In Moscow only the diplomatic-journalistic colony was aware that Mr. Erkko never uttered the words quoted by Pravda but in fact made a conciliatory speech designed to string out further the protracted Finnish-Soviet negotiations ( TIME , Nov. 6 , et ante ) . <P> Meanwhile in Moscow restaurants and on streetcars Soviet citizens could be heard remarking to each other with guffaws , " This Finn has gone mad . He is threatening to hurl a nation of 3,000,000 people against our 180,000,000 ! " <P> In Helsinki diplomatic Mr. Erkko remarked easily that the Russians " must have got hold of a wrong translation , " but Pravda stuck grimly to contending that Finland 's Foreign Minister had shown " exactly the same attitude as that of former Foreign Minister Beck of Poland . He Beck too made provocative speeches before the war between Poland and Germany and-as a result of this-provoked the war with Germany . " <P> Big Bolshevik No. 2 did the big talking in Moscow last week . He is broad-shouldered , bushy-mustached , pince-nezed Premier Viacheslav Molotov who looks something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Supreme Soviet or Russian Congress met in extraordinary session to admit new delegates from the slice of Poland taken by Dictator Stalin , curiosity was rife as to whether Orator Molotov would again , as in 1937 , have to make three great efforts before his speech impediment would permit him to utter the most important cry in Russia : " Long live Comrade Sssssss . . . . Long live Comrade Stttttt . . . . Long live Comrade Stalin ! " The long-suffering Premier last week had no trouble and in his secondary capacity as Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs made an extremely long and rambling state-of-the-world speech in which he ticked off Turkey , Germany , Great Britain and France , Japan , Finland and Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
