A month ago the New York Stock Exchange discovered that of the $92,000,000 , " U. S. Government and other marketable securities , " which Allied Chemical &; Dye put down in a lump sum among " current " assets on its balance sheet , the largest part consisted of the company 's own stock . Forthwith the Exchange ordered Allied stock be stricken from trading on Aug. 23 , if in the meantime Allied did not give its stockholders more &; better information . A grave defeat was this for Orlando Franklin Weber , autocrat of Allied , who for a full year had urbanely held the Exchange 's Listing Committee at arm 's length . To make matters worse a committee of his own stockholders was soon found to force a special meeting early in AM ust in an attempt to elect four new directors and pry open Allied 's accounting system . <P> Unaccustomed to being thus boldly thwarted , but quite capable of coping with the situation , Orlando Weber struck last week at this revolt among his stockholders . <P> Allied Chemical was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . Stockholders of some of the merged companies did not hide their distaste for Mr. Weber and his methods . One of these companies was General Chemical Co .. founded by the late Dr. William H. Nichols of Manhattan . Another was Solvay Process Co. , founded and largely owned by the rich Solvays of Belgium . The committee demanding a new deal for Allied stockholders was headed by Charles W. Nichols , son of Dr. Nichols , and by Gordon Auchincloss , president of Solvay American Investment Corp .. holder of 500,000 shares ( 20% ) of Allied common . <P> Last week in a letter to stockholders Mr. Weber , always polite , always plausible , explained that they should not support the efforts of " a self-appointed committee purporting to represent stockholders " whose plans ' ' have nothing whatever to do with the company 's relations with the New York Stock Exchange . " The Exchange and the Company had agreed , in fact , on many matters . " As to others , discussions with the Exchange are being continued . " Then he launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " one of the most powerful chemical companies in the world , " interested in I. G. Farbenindustrie of Germany and in British Imperial Chemical Industries , Ltd . The aim of the Solvay interests in wanting to elect new directors is to steal information for use by Allied 's rivals . " The American Chemical industry is today fighting to maintain that the American market for American capital and American labor against the organized , combined and ruthless attacks of foreign competition . " <P> The Nichols interests which joined with the Solvay company to form the opposition are , of course , not foreigners , but Mr. Weber took the opportunity to dig Son Nichols by quoting a letter of his late father to Armand Solvay in which objection was made to the Solvays ' aim to build up a world chemical consortium and have Allied join it .
