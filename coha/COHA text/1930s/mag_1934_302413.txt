Reading eyes grow blurred , skip words and lines . Heads ache , nerves twitch , stomachs misbehave . Students fail in their classes . Motorists and aviators misjudge distances , sometimes fatally . Many a person so afflicted has gone from one eye doctor to another , without relief . He was suffering from no ailment known to ophthalmology . <P> Last week to the New York Academy of Medicine , Dartmouth 's Professor Adelbert Ames Jr . announced that his research department of physiological optics had found the ailment which may cause these disorders , had developed a means of correcting it . Though only about 1,000 cases had been observed , he estimated that 20% to 30% of all eye sufferers may be affected by a condition which he named aniseikonia . Said Professor Ames to the Manhattan doctors : " I feel that before aniseikonia was discovered we were somewhat in the position of the astronomers studying the solar system before all the important planets had been located . The effects of the unknown ones could be felt but they were still unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now worked out , as it is hoped that some day aniseikonia 's will be . " <P> Aniseikonia is Greek for " unequal images . " When the sufferer looks at any object , the image reflected in the retina of one eye differs in size and shape from that in the other . The struggle of the brain 's visual centre to fuse these two images brings aches , pains and frazzled nerves . Sometimes it can not fuse them . <P> The Dartmouth researchers are not yet sure of aniseikonia 's cause . They think it may be some malformation of the front part of the eye , or a larger number of light-sensitive cones in one retina than in the other . To detect the condition they have devised a complex instrument of peepholes , dots and lights , called the Ophthalmo-Eikonometer . To correct the condition they , and American Optical Co. , have developed " iseikonic spectacles " with miniature telescope lenses to balance images . <P> Tall , ruddy , good-humored Professor Ames started out to be a lawyer , turned to art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week the Press was ready to hail him as a new Hero of Science . But Professor Ames resisted any such public acclamation . In the first place , he insisted , other members of his Dartmouth staff deserved as much credit as he . And , ' ' It was research and that 's all about it . " <P> Professor Ames 's father , who died last year at 97 , was the last Yankee governor of Mississippi , the last surviving Union general of the Civil War . He was long the daily golf partner of John Davison Rockefeller at Ormond Beach , Fla . When Adelbert Ames Jr . set out to track down aniseikonia in 1927 , it was John Davison Rockefeller Jr . who furnished the money . Last week the New York Herald Tribune reported the fact that Son Rockefeller himself has aniseikonia , that he has obtained considerable relief from his iseikonic spectacles .
