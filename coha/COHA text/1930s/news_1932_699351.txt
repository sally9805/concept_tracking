A. , factory , saw mill and many bungalows , spread over 23,000 acres of countryside in the heart of the State , is to thrive again if plans now being considered by the southern division of the National Goodwill Industries materialize . The project will be the development of a Goodwill Colony patterned after the one in South Athol , Mass. , which is widely known as one of the most successful centers of relief .

Under ? the Mississippi Goodwill colony plan : the relief organizer observed , needy families will move from big cities to be given a home In Zama . Here the men will work and the women and children will have an opportunity to experience enjoyments that they were unable to have in crowded cities . There is to be ample entertain= ment facilities , schools , churches , and everything one might expect in a model town . At first , 200 families will be admitted , but the village , Mr. Beaman declared , has a capacity of 1000 families or 5000 persons . It is felt by those who have inspected the deserted town that the land around Zama is suitable for some cotton growing . The land is also good for all kinds of vegetable raising , thus assuring the community of fresh foods at nearly all seasons of the year .
