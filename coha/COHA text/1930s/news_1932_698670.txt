txt TURNER 'S FRONTIER The late Professor Frederick J. Turner  --  while insisting upon the significance of the frontier in American history ' was at the same time well aware of the limitations of his gen ' eralization . In 1912 in some menuI script notes I wrote : " Turner 's great thesis respecting the influence of the frontier ought to be subjected to a more severe test than has been applied to it . May it not be true that the most profound I influences , in American history come from the non-frontier and the East I and not from the frontier and the West ? " In 1917 when he happened to read these sentences he penciled on the margin of the manuscript the following-comment : ' But Turner was dealing in the large with that particular phase . It is far from being the only factor in American history . See his discussions , of sections , &c,; He knows the limitations to some of his generalizations and the importance of further refinement in detail too . " CHARLES 0 . PAULLIN .
