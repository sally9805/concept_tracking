In keeping with the vastly enlarged powers and responsibilities it conferred on the governors of the Federal Reserve Board , the Banking Act of 1935 required them to submit with their annual report a record of all actions on matters of policy . <P> Tendered respectfully to Speaker Bankhead of the House of Representatives last week was the second such record . With bone-dry formality it stated the decisions , votes and reasoning of the Board at 15 meetings during 1936 , disclosed one surprising fact : the Board was not unanimous but divided on its most generally applauded action , the first , 50% increase in member bank reserve requirements , which took effect last August . The dissenters : Governors John Keown McKee and Chester Charles Davis . Whether they disagreed in whole or in part with the Board 's consensus was not revealed . Whether or not they came around to Chairman Eccles ' side when reserves were hiked a second time last January ( TIME , Feb. 8 ) presumably will not be known until the Board makes its report next year . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Montana 's Commissioner of Agriculture &; Labor , was glooming in Glacier National Park at a meeting of the Montana Bankers Association . He confessed that although on leaving AAA for the Federal Reserve Board he thought he was " sailing from a storm-tossed sea into a comparatively smooth and protected harbor . " now , after a year , he was not so sure . Said he : " If another crisis finds the American banking system disorganized and ineffective , the American citizenry . . . may . . . seize a short cut . . . . Certainly public opinion at such a time will have scant patience with past timidity and inertia of bankers , and with petty bickerings for power among official agencies . . . . "
