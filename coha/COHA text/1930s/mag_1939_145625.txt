The Prince sat in the music room of his country palace , listening to a new symphony by his court Kapellmeister . The stocky , periwigged Kapellmeister himself sat at the harpsichord , bobbing out the rhythm with his head , cuing in an occasional oboe or bassoon with one lace-cuffed hand . Before him peered and labored a score of white-wigged , brocaded musicians . The first oboe closed the music on his stand , blew out his candle , tiptoed from the stage . The second horn followed . One by one , other musicians got up and went out . Soon there were only two violinists left . Together they played the symphony 's last note , then rose , doused their candles and departed . Silently the powder-haired Kapellmeister turned , bowed , blew out his candle , plunged the room into total darkness . <P> Thus did Court Composer Franz Joseph Haydn hint to his employer , Prince Esterhazy , that autumn was well along , and that he and his musicians were chafing to get back to Vienna . <P> That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall , where Sergei Koussevitzky 's famed Boston Symphony had announced a " concert extraordinaire . " Manhattan concertgoers could see that something was up when 18th-Century ushers led them to their seats . When Boston 's stiff-necked orchestra appeared in silk stockings and periwigs with Conductor Koussevitzky himself got up as Franz Joseph ( " Papa " ) Haydn , they began to catch on . Without batting an eye , poker-faced Koussevitzky led his men through Haydn 's rococo whimsey , bowed gravely , pinched out his candle and left the stage . <P> Almost before the candle fumes were cleared , the Boston musicians returned in white pea jackets , and were on their way to town with Composer Louis Gruenberg 's modernistic jazz score , Daniel Jazz . The result was hardly enough to shake a Brahmin into a shag , but it was pretty hot stuff for the Boston Symphony . <P> After another quick change , this time to their store clothes , Conductor Koussevitzky and his men gave Manhattanites their first taste of Serge Prokofieff 's children 's suite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear Peter 's duck ( the oboe ) quack mournfully inside the hungry wolf 's stomach ( three French horns ) . With the evening topped off with waltzes by Johann Strauss , Sibelius and Ravel , concertgoers felt that Henry Lee Higginson 's band had kicked up its heels about as much as any self-respecting 58-year-old symphony had a right to .
