Columbia 's Professor Colin Garfield Fink , who gave Industry a chromium-plated shield against rust , last week took out a patent for a tungsten-plated shield . <P> Twenty million tons of iron and steel rust out of use each year . Electrolytic iron resists corrosion , but is difficult to make . Chromium alloyed with iron makes " rustless iron . " " Stainless " steel contains iron , carbon and chromium . But for a multitude of uses a coating over the iron or steel objects suffices . Paint serves well in many places , as does zinc ( galvanizing ) , tin , copper , lead , concrete . Nickel does not tarnish readily , resists corrosion , has high lustre , is hard , and has long been used to plate iron &; steel . In all those qualities chromium surpasses nickel . When Professor Fink and others showed how chromium could be electroplated manufacturers quickly adopted chromium plating for electrotypes , motor car radiator shells , bumpers and other accessories , plumbing fixtures , mirrors , kitchen gear . <P> Uses of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief value lies in its resistance to hydrochloric acid . Only gold is so resistant . But gold is too precious to coat the pots and pipes of Industry . Professor Fink , 51 , claims to be the " originator of the drawn tungsten filament ' ' for lamps. * Another scientist given the kudos is General Electric 's Dr. William David Coolidge , 59 . In 1914 the American Academy of Arts &; Sciences gave Dr. Coolidge its prized Rumford Medal for the ' ' invention and applications of ductile tungsten . " Dr. Coolidge also was in last week 's news . Director of General Electric 's research laboratory since 1900 and vice president in charge of research since 1928 has been Dr. Willis Rodney Whitney , who once averred that he " would rather teach than be President . " He has been entirely responsible , as organizer and stimulator , of G. E. 's scientific staff and progress . Dr. Coolidge once said of him : " It is because Dr. Whitney is there that Dr. Irving Langmuir and I can play around . He stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dr. Whitney is now 64 , and worn out . Apart from his executive duties he has done research on his own account-solubility , colloids , suspensions , corrosion of iron , chromium sulphate compounds . His latest work has been on radiothermy , raising the temperature of the body by high frequency waves . Radiothermy is now being used , in preference to malaria , to create the artificial fever which makes paretics at least temporarily clear-minded . Two years ago Dr. Whitney suffered a nervous breakdown . Last week he was a patient of the Mayo Clinic . He had long wanted to abdicate his research directorship . But no one with G. E. was willing to supplant him , and President Gerard Swope would bring in no outsider . Last week President Swope made a decision , accepted Dr. Whitney 's resignation as director of research , continued him as vice president in charge of the 300 scientists whom the corporation employs . Promoted to stand between those scientists and demands that they " do something practical " was long-protected Dr. William David Coolidge.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
