Most uncomfortable woman in London last week was kindly , grey-haired Mrs. Lucy Macdonald , longtime manager of the staid and starchy Arlington Gallery . Mrs. Macdonald found herself with the season 's most sensational art show on her hands ; the pictures , she admitted herself , were terrible , and the artist admitted himself that he had palled around with real live U. S. gangsters . This appalling state of affairs came about because she had been too busy to go out to Chelsea and look at the paintings beforehand , and the artist " was so smooth and persuasive that I took a chance . When I came to the gallery and saw what was being hung , I just stood there gasping . " <P> Smooth persuasion comes easily to bullnecked , six-foot , 252-pound Jack Bilbo . He was trained in the world 's highest powered school of dialectic , the Chicago underworld . Jack Hugo Baruch was born 32 years ago in Berlin , schooled in The Hague , went to the U. S. at 16 . In Manhattan he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he changed his name to Bilbo , went to Chicago and fell in with gangster Al Capone in 1926 . How close he was to Scarface Al is a moot question . There is no record that he ever lay in bilboes in the U. S. <P> Since the garaging of the Capone machine , Jack Bilbo has had a hand in several less lucrative activities abroad-organizing anti-Nazi movements in Germany ( pre-Hitler ) , fighting for Haile Selassie in Abyssinia , for the Spanish Loyalists in Catalonia . On the side he says he found time to design three German villas and his own residence in Spain . <P> Bilbo 's first autobiographical tome , Carrying a Gun for Al Capone , had England by the ears eight years ago , ran into 17 editions , was translated into nine foreign languages . Five years and one book ( I Ca n't Escape Adventure ) later , Bilbo opened a highly successful night spot in London 's arty Chelsea , where he assiduously cultivated those in the know . Five months ago he started painting , now does nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a stretch . It would n't surprise him in the least if his fellow-refugee and longtime friend , Haile Selassie , should drop in for a chat and see what he has accomplished since the old Addis Ababa days . <P> For the most part , visitors to his one-man show last week agreed with Mrs. Macdonald . Bilbo 's sloppy , raw-hued pirates , animals , nudes and caricatures of Hitler looked as if he had dipped his gat in the paint pot and then let fly at the canvas . But with metropolitan art critics , the astute , silk-toppered Artist Sir William Rothenstein , the Duke of Kent and bevies of Mayfair socialites swarming to see his pictures , and with the whole show bought by Scottish Art Dealer Andrew G. Elliot , the bushy-headed , self-styled ex-gangster pal could well afford to smile .
