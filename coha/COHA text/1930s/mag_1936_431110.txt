 | Public Servant Condensed from Nation 's Business Kenneth Coolbaugh Nearing twenty years I have been a government employe , on the payroll of an eastern state . Regular salary checks , generous vacations , sick leaves with pay ; all these , and unforgettable friendships have been my lot . And yet if a boy asked me - " Would you advise me to try for a job in the public service ? " - I could n't in conscience answer yes or no . I could only tell him what the years have told me . And today , when politicians prattle of the sins of private enterprise , the story of a public servant ought to he timely . Take the first step - getting a public job . You have ideals ; you 're tired with zeal to serve your city , state or national government . The job you want , we 'll say , is Subject to Civil Service . Fine ! ( Civil Service , you think , plays no Favorites You take the examination ion and pass at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are a matter of public r ecord . So you wait hopefully - only to find that someone whose raring you topped got the job by persuading a senator or congressman to say a word where it most In lped . Such things are done today on a scale unprecedented . The power to bequeath jobs is the rivet that legislators believe will keep them in office . Do n't blame those immediately in charge of the offices . Times unnumbered I 've heard department heads and bureau chiefs exclaim : " He 's just the man I want . It would be my luck that he does n't know anybody . " " I 'd take him in a minute no matter what his politics , but I 'm powerless . If he only had the proper backing ! " Typical is the experience of an accountant who applied for a position in his state government . Hundreds of thousands - and I weigh my naughts - of men and women have swallowed the dose he did . He sent his formal application directly to the department head and awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made , he called upon the department head , who told him frankly that if he could get Senator Gray to endorse his application it would insure him the position . The Senator 's secretary suggested that he see Mr. White , his city councilman . White asked if he knew Brown , who ran the cigar store in his precinct . Yes , he knew the store . Then he saw Brown , who asked if  | he 'd seen Senator ' White . So it ran , up and down the line ; and meanwhile others got the positions , some because the Grays , Whites and Browns rated them as potential assets in the business of politics , some because they had influential friends in business and civic spheres . jBut for those who get these jobs , what is ahead ? The stark fact is that the overwhelming majority of public servants never attain a higher rank or have even a fighting chance to attain one . Their roads to broader public usefulness are ever dependent upon the judgment , whim or prejudice of men other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwrite appointments also influence promotions . What do you amount to in your home town , county , ward , precinct ? Who originally backed you ? Does he still ? If so , where is he sitting on the political carrousel - riding high or lonesome ? With what partyor faction thereof ? One wonders how long a commercial enterprise could survive if a directing head , wishing to promote a clerk , salesman or stenographer , had to seek the approval of someone outside the firm . But remember , the public servant owes allegiance to the man who underwrites him for the ob . A cabinet officer , department head , bureau or division chief is stricken , fired , dies or quits - what happens ? Someone next in rank assumes the larger duties - at his current salary . He simply keeps the office fires burning - and then breaks in a new boss . If miracles did happen and he were offered the position , he probably would prefer not to accept . " I 'm not sticking my head up , " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , public servants fear the ax of the political spoilsman . Experience has taught them that the bigger the plum the more grasping the hands to reach for it . So , content or resigned , they remain at their lesser posts . Come , too , the months when " Politics absorb the livelong day . " Would you work at the polls for a man your conscience says you should n't even vote for ? You may be " asked " to . Then there 's the contribution to the party war chest . If you do n't chip in it may mean your job . Most of the boys contribute more than they can afford . Some have to borrow the money . Or perhaps a bill you can not stomach is before a legislative body . You 're asked ( if asked is the word ) to see the assemblyman from your district and persuade him to vote for the bill . You are expected to lobby on your own and the public 's time . Then again - well , there was Mac . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came when he decided to move  | his family to a better environment , the children to better schools . " Nothing doing . We need you here in my district , " his ward boss said . But Mac moved anyway . " I 'll get you if it 's the last thing I do , " the big shot boomed . And six years later he fulfilled his threat . Is there anywhere a record of a like issue in the world of business ? Do they say , " If he moves to a different part of the city I 'll have to give the job to someone else who will stay in our ward " ? When jobs are scarce , the appointive officeholder and his job are raked by the fire of a public suddenly become public job conscious . He knows the pressure from those who want or need jobs for themselves , their daughters , their unemployed sons-in-law . Nothing can be done about it but take it , and take it again when the jobs on your payroll become a pawn in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalcitrant legislature . Unless you 've long held public office you do n't , you ca n't believe that a mayor , a governor , or a president would fire or even think of firing you from a job you were doing well because he had promised that job to another to corral a vote . But it has been done and it is being done . And finally , if you are marked to go , you go quickly . You are likely to read about it in the newspapers days or weeks before you get your official notice . But when you do get it , out you go without a minute 's grace , and under a glare of publicity . The public pays a staggering bill for this politics-ridden system . Some day a survey will be made of the cost of the labor turnover in the public service ; the cost of educating new cabinet members , department heads , bureau chiefs ; of instituting technics the small fry know are unworkable because they have seen them tried and fail ; of worker inertia due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand total is struck it will mount high ; high enough , perhaps , to change things , for Civil Service may be just what an ever-alert and articulate public demands that it be . Still , if I had a boy and he asked me : " What about it ? Shall I enter the public service ? " , I could only leave with him a fervent hope that should opportunity come to serve under a capitol 's dome or at a country crossroads he will not spurn it . For a country whose youth scorns peacetime enlistment is not the kind of country , I think , he 'd long care to live in.
