Five pounds lighter from his jaunt afield to Arkansas , Texas , Indiana ( TIME , June 22 ) , Franklin Roosevelt settled down last week to the not-so-arduous business of getting rid of Congress . Canceling his trip to the Yale-Harvard boat races , also his week-end yacht cruise , he swept his signature across scores of bills , none of which seemed to cause him great concern . Nor did he bother to put positive pressure on Congress to block or save any important measure . Thus he had time to attend to several other matters : <P> To write a note to Attorney General Cummings asking him " to take appropriate action " ( i. e. prosecute under the anti-trust laws ) against steel companies as the result of findings by the Federal Trade Commission that Secretary Ickes had been getting collusive bids on steel piling-an action which was shortly followed by Mr. Ickes taking a separate fling at the steel industry for failure to comply with the orders of the Labor Board . <P> To act under the flexible tariff law to boost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Guffey of Pennsylvania and Lonergan of Connecticut , who have in their constituencies the two big U. S. zipper makers . <P> To deny executive clemency to Arthur Gooch , Oklahoma convict who , in escaping from prison , kidnapped a policeman . Convict Gooch thereby became the first man to hang for kidnapping under the Lindbergh law . Said the President : <P> " Use of the executive power to modify the sentence imposed would be to render nugatory a law carefully considered by the Congress and designed to meet a national need . " <P> To declare that war between Italy and Ethiopia has ended and U. S. citizens are once more free to sell arms to and ride on the ships of Italy and Ethiopia . <P> One morning came a loud buzz on the doorbell of the White House Offices . Secret Service men rushed out-for not in months had that bell been rung-glared at a man who meekly said , ' ' I am Judge Mack of Poughkeepsie . I have an appointment to lunch with the President . " So he had , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week , as he did in 1932 , that it ought to nominate Franklin Roosevelt for President . <P> Still another guest was High Commissioner Frank Murphy coming to say " Hail " in token of his return from the Philippines , " Farewell " before departing for Philadelphia , in the interval to taste some White House food and while away a couple of hours planning a U. S.-Philippine conference to try to save the Philippines from the economic pains of independence . <P> On Sunday , Senator Alben Barkley with his keynote speech and Senator Joseph T. Robinson with his speech as permanent chairman of the Democratic convention , came to lay their themes on the lap of their chief for editing and correction .
