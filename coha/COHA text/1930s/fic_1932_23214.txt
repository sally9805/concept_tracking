MARRIED TO NIOBE A STORY BY MARGARET EMERSON BAILEY I F THEY 'D only talk right out , talk right along , not let him be a gloom , but take him naturally .. . Damn it , had n't he had kids himself ? Did n't he know the kind of things you did with them on a half-holiday ? Were n't those thoughts running through his head whether anybody said a word or not ? You 'd get the old bus out ; that 's what you 'd do , first thing . You 'd get it out not because it needed any overhauling , but because a youngster , any normal youngster , liked tinkering with a lot of tools , liked being smeared with gudgeon grease and thinking that he 'd been the one to figure out the trouble . And there 'd be walks . Mad . Lots of mud to plow through at this time of year . Along the swollen edges of a stream there 'd be wiggling pollywogs to be scooped up , and last year 's tattered nests to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pockets to be stuffed , no matter if you thought their treasure was a lot of tripe . Yes , and a plot in the backyard where you could show that you could drop a curve across home-base and still knock out a mean , hot grounder . But as surely as he went into the club car and made a fourth at contract , Ned Waring knew there 'd be an awkward moment . It would n't come at first . The men would keep to the safe , solid ground of stocks and politics . But later , while someone dealt thecards or added up the score , one of the others , looking through the window at the sliding scene outside and eager for the afternoon ahead , would start to talk . " Say , you know that boy of mine is growing like a weed . . . . " Below the table , a swift kick would finish that , or the man himself would break off short as though he thought you did n't wish a kid to grow . Let them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " You know that boy of mine 's the pluckiest little devil . You should have seen him . . . " Then decency , courtesy , some infernal law of etiquette would forbid him to go on . Could n't these men guess , could n't they know that what you wanted was to trail along and listen in ? Had n't they ever seen old Charlie Chaplin in the trenches , reading home letters over everybody 's shoulder , nudging up close to get a word from anybody 's home just to know such places did exist ? Why , it was an instinct to save sanity that made you want to know that normal life was going on . There , waiting for the train to start on its trip from the city , was the big , grinning negro porter in his neat white linen jacket that ran horizontal creases from its buttons . He 'd been the first real coal-black darkey Junior 'd ever seen . And Junior 'd been perplexed , as perplexed as he had been at anything they 'd just seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired a million ques-tions . Queerness in a person , he had sensed , demanded silence . It had been some deep instinct of politeness in the little fellow that had made him hide his curiosity and fright . Well , no one to-day was going to glance down at his small , firm paw to see if any black had come off to the touch . The porter was talking to a man , stout , rosy , sure of all good things in their abundance . " Hello , Waring , " he was saying , " Coming in ? Care to join us in a rubber ? " " No , thank you , not to-day . Ask me again some other time . " Had he been rude ? He had n't meant to be . It was only that he liked the sense of swarming life which went on in the common coach . For here , where bags and bundles bulged into the aisle , he could be any kind of sentimental , natural ass he liked . " Car'mels , salted peanuts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share a bag . He could give up the cherished place beside the window . No fat Jewess , no Italian mother with a swarthy , brown-eyed brood to huddle into place was going to notice his black tie or the band on his left arm . Here , ten to one , nobody 'd notice anyhow . And if they did , there were a lot of things you did n't see in commuters whom you sat with day by day . To shut out other thoughts , you tried to size them up . thought you knew their lives , could spot their types . There was the young salesman who cut quite a dash . One after another he tried them out , his pick-ups , the sort of girls who 'd ask for " chicken salad , please . " He did n't have the sense to know that the advertisements had got the whole thing wrong ; that he 'd better make a go of it , and while he was still young , with someone as unsure of everything as that . Yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a word all evening , andwho 'd got hell from his wife for it . But had he really ? If anyone should look at him  --  Ned Waring  --  and try to figure out just why he always chose the sunny side where a darting beam was brightening up a square of dingy , crimson plush , what would they make out of it ? Or if they saw him opening up the Evening Bulletin to the full-page display of modern fashions , the chances were that they would think that he was getting old and senile , was the kind of fellow who 'd gone soft and rotten till he 'd come to get some kind of kick from women 's lingerie . They 'd never believe him if he told them that , more than the backyards which ran down to the railroad tracks , these cheap and sleazy papers held the spring . Shrubs could put out their buds and leaves for all he cared . But " beige . " Whatever color that might be , it sounded soft and pleasant to the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy with a scarlet piping , grass-green , wheat green . . . " Even in cheap department stores there were women out like honey bees , coaxed out by the first warmth . There were women decking themselves out , obeying instinct and forgetting caution , knocking their meager little budgets to cocked hats , overspending their allowances , exulting in extravagance , doing this because it bought them what was bright and guy to please some man . It did n't do to think of where that led to in your ease , and it was funny . . . You 'd think a fellow would get used to black , that months of it would make him color-blind . He ought to get accustomed to its fiat , dull look , to its shivery touch , to its faint , stale smell of dye so that they were n't repugnant to him . It was ridiculous to let a thing like black get on your nerves . Only when he thought of Marian 's big closet stuffed with it , its hangers trailing dresses that had no surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had given him a separate room . To want to leave that room and to go back , he had to think of days when what she wore had caught the light . She 'd been a different woman then all right . Not that to-day she did n't spend more time and thought and money on her clothes . They looked just alike to him . He hated every one of them . But so far as he could judge from bills , black was infinitely more expensive . It had , she said , to be cut right . It had to have some style . It demanded the best dressmakers . And she refused to see that he was not the sort of man to give a hoot about the cost if cost could give her any comfort . But at least there 'd been a time when a closet was worth diving into . It had n't been a dark and somber place , a catacomb that killed desire . There 'd been a little yellow dress that she had made herself when expense had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she 'd called it . But when he passed a florist 's window now he stopped . A pot of stubby tulips could warm up his mind . They made him think about a dress that he had wanted to be close to , that had offered intimacy , called for it and provoked it , and had a kind of gaiety about its yellow frills . He was thinking about that when his eye was caught by the big captions . " Black In Vogue This Spring . " God , what a sell on Marian ! If she 'd known that every little " steno " in the town was going to take to it , what would she have done ? Cornered the market if she could , stacked great ware-houses to bursting so that not another soul might have a shred ? As it was , what would she do ? Retreat farther and farther into crepe ? When it came to being badged with mourning , he would bet on her against the world . Pretty thoughts to be having of one 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brute he seemed , there 'd been a lot of things he would have done . Gone to the mat with her , made her see he had his side to it . True , there 'd been arguments that he had put up for her good ; for what had seemed to him her good . But a mother 's grief went deeper . It was deeper and more sacred . The closeness of the bond was something that no man could hope to understand . His idea , for instance , that the one sane thing for them to do was to start right over , was to have another family , nature being willing . , . . That , it seemed , had not been merely gross . It had been an insult which had proved her point . If a man could ask that of a woman in her grief . . . if he could ask that of a woman singled out for lightning which struck twice . .. That went to show that men had children from pure vanity . From pure vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noisy life again about the house , he had n't felt a sharp disloyalty . If disloyalty had entered in , he would n't always have this sick and dizzy feeling when the train drew near to Cos Cob . At this time of year there was a haze , a film of leaves on the old , bristling willows . But New York could spread as much as it damned liked . It could rear apartment houses to the river 's edge . But it could never blot out a white sheet of ice that had been grooved by skates . Where the swift , dark current flowed between the muddy banks , he could always see a little boy , surprised by death , meeting it alone , with not a soul to help . Was it , Ned Waring wondered , the mere fact of that aloneness that had made one memory acute ; the lack of it that let the other grow so dull ? Was it because he had been numbed , surprised and numbed , had not had time to get his breath when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in her ease he had been allowed to spend a fortune , and would have pitched away another gladly ? Did the memory of nurses , doctors , doctors by the dozens , act like some sort of drug ? When he had had both children and had taken them for granted , little Sis had really been his pet . He 'd spoiled her and he had n't cared . Time and time again he 'd let her off , really been amused by things he 'd had to straighten out with a firm hand when it came to a son . But the plain truth was that now she might be any little girl among a million . She had simply faded out . Strange that when Junior had gone first , he knew he could still pick him out first shot among a raft of other youngsters ; he 'd still know him anywhere . Even from the back , there 'd be the set of his brown head upon his pipelike , little neck , the way his hair grew from his collar , the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if he turned , there 'd be his ruffled hair that would n't keep a part and was never brushed for mealtimes . There 'd be the freckles spattered on his nose , the brace on his front teeth that was going to be a damned expensive business , his eyes that had made impossible a shade of adult truth that was less clear than those round pools so like the clearest water . A homely little cuss , he used to call him . Then , thank God for the homeliness that the months had not wiped out , that still made him seem so possible , so near . The train was pulling into Stamford , Well , here he was . Men were crowding out of the Club car , some asking why he had n't joined them . As he came down the steps , there were children diddling up and down as they waited on the platform ; and from parked cars more children waving frantically . Women were moving over from the steering-wheels amid a jumble of old coats and sweaters . Doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Marked by its neatness and its emptiness , there stood his limousine . Ready in attendance , there was Barstow , his chauffeur . If it were n't for Barstow he would stretch his legs by walking up the But he felt sorry for him , honestly . To have to go about day in , day out in a black uniform . . . . The man ought to charge a lot for wearing it , for sticking round at all with not a kid in sight to interrupt his work with questions , to beg for the front seat , to get in the way and make himself a pestering little nuisance . There must be lots of other places that were overrun with youngsters . But Barstow would n't stick for long . He 'd feel important and mysterious until some healthy instinct got the best of him . Then , " I 'm leaving , sir , " he 'd say . " No , I 've nothing to complain of . " He 'd end up by being like the maids . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one thing in the afternoons , but every morning , sir , it seemed to take the heart right out of you . " And so it did . Those maids they had right now  --  he hoped they went out necking in the evening , necked in scarlet by the roadside somewhere . . . For even in the dark scarlet would feel different to the touch . Anyhow he could give Barstow what was left of the spring afternoon to fill up as he liked . As they turned in the gravel drive , he spoke . " I sha n't be going out again . You put up the car and shoot off home . " But it seemed that Barstow 'd had his orders to fetch the car around by seven-twenty . Mr. Waring was dining out this evening . He was going to the Dixons ' with Mrs. Waring and her house guest . Who ? Some lady who 'd arrived an hour ago . Where were they now ? Out in the garden , looking round , till tea-time , and Mr. Waring was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barstow recollected ; but judging from her luggage , she seemed intending something of a stay . The garden . As he got out and started on his way across the lawn , Ned Waring was remembering the time when they had moved , had felt they ought to move out to the country . How little they had asked of it just air fit for a child to breathe . Yet even at that first little house that had had friendly neighbors on both sides , he 'd said he wished to be the typical commuter , to pitch right in and show what he could do , and have a patch of earth that he had spaded up himself . In those days he 'd felt a rival 's pride about the curly , light-green leaves of lettuce , the outspread palms of carrots , the red spears of beets that had actually done their darndest and had sprouted for him . Then right through the neat rows , there 'd been the telltale footsteps of " a guy who 'd had to shack a ball . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made between his lettuce and the warm , pink , quivering noses of white rabbits . Queer , to think that those instinctive acts had been cause enough to get into a stew about ; a real reason for thinking up a punishment that had cheated you , yourself , of a half hour of company . Looked back at now , his garden had n't been a great success . Anyhow , if it had only been the best he could afford just then , it had been better than these things they called herbaceous borders . It had n't called for landscape architects , poor to chin with , solemn about planting , and dead-set on sticking in a lot of gloomy looking evergreens that were like the funeral plumes upon old-fashioned hearses . If by a miracle , a marigold had blossomed in his first garden , the great thing had been its blossoming . It had n't mattered that it cussed at zinnias that were a flaming red . It had been a swell place for a buttonholebouquet , too big , lopheavy , snapped off too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to wear to town in days when he had had to foot it to the station . Yes , and on muggy summer evenings , it had been a swell place to whisk the cooling spray of hose upon a pair of bare brown legs that had dared him to a sprinkling . But it had n't been a show-place for a lot of women offering sympathy by dropping in and wandering along its borders and going to such trouble to call the plainest and most ordinary flowers by their long Latin names . A show-place . Was n't that what Marian had turned it into Not the house exactly . That had been his business . There he 'd spread himself to prove that , even saddled with a family , he was going up the ladder quicker than some other fellows . Still , if he 'd enjoyed it in the past , had induced anyone to go through it who wanted to , he 'd always known that there were other houses , bigger , more expensive , more worth a ticket of admission . The plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to beat the future to it , when it came to needing room . . No , you could n't tag the house . And with all its swank , you could n't tag the garden . Not exactly . There were others more worth looking at than this that he had taken as the sign of a new , healthy interest . But if you liked the performance which it put on , this was a show-place after all . That was the reason why men had the common , ordinary decency to keep away from it . It was bad enough to have to see a fellow who was licked . But it was a darned sight worse to have to see one who made a parade of being so . Women it was  --  like that woman standing with his wife  --  whose kindness covered an unholy curiosity ; who when it came to tragedy kept a play running , crowding into all the front row seats . For a man would step right up , shake hands , get off a lot of guff to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't have to watch , not as the woman there stood watching . For far more interesting to her than Marian alone , was Marian in dusky black coming sadly towards the man who 'd been the father of her children . being sweet and patient with him , yet letting anyone with half an eye see that they were n't man and wife  --  not in the real sense any longer . She had given him the kind of kiss he did n't want because it was no kiss at all . And " Miss Sutton , " Marian had said , " I 'm going to leave you to my husband while I see if tea is ready . Ned dear , Miss Sutton has been good enough to spare a little of her time to us . " Vague recollections of a name . At some time he had heard it . But , as host , he should have been tipped off again and not have to blunder round alone to find some talking-point . It was Miss Sutton who had found one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , God wot , ferned grot , " for Miss Sutton looked so like the sort of woman who 'd be sure to know that poem and to think God walked here . Yet flowers did n't seem to be her line , or if they were , they seemed to serve some special purpose . They were where they were for mass and grouping , for effects of light and shade , for balance and for rhythm , to make a composition and to lend a background . There were several places that she must come back to ; and even then it would be some remark he dropped , some little thing he said that would help her to decide . Decide on what ? In the meantime she was walking by his side and saying something to him . " Your wife must find such consolation in her gardening . " " She does . " But , hell , why should she ? He had n't meant his bitterness to seem abrupt . Yet surely he had n't asked for much , for no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . If it was coarse to want a little warmth , new life , young life as its result , why men were coarse ? not that he had n't stifled his own wishes . But when it came to consolation , why turn to gardening that demanded warmth , sun , new life  --  yes , and manure ? Why not turn to someone who had lost out too ? Why not let him know that having been a father was n't just a wash-out ? But the woman with him had let him know that he was something else . His black band was the band that made her privileged . He was the tourist-guide to Marian 's grief . For what had she said ? " To keep that special place set off , to keep it just exactly as it was the day her little daughter left it . . . " Well , tourist guides were hired , kept in their jobs for lying well , for playing up . But no one , no complete and utter stranger could have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spot that they were passing . For days he had come home to find gardeners moving shrubs and planting evergreens . He 'd always liked a level , open stretch of lawn , but Marian could cut it into ribbons if she wanted to . It was only when he 'd seen a space set off , set off and fenced with a white-picket railing , that he had asked what was the great idea . And even when she had explained that while he might forget , she could n't ; that right here was the very place where little Marian had always played , he 'd thought about the child as she 'd come popping out of the least likely corners  --  out of the dumb-waiter in the kitchen , over the neighbor 's fence , from anywhere and everywhere . Great Scott , that you could n't leave her to herself two minutes , not with any safety  --  that had been the great complaint . And granted that she 'd been the sort of child who 'd been content to play for hours on end where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . A sand pile melted flat with rain . To be a little Alp , it had to be heaped up again . A wooden shovel weathered , rotted out in the course of a winter . It had to he replaced . A tin pail , rusted , ought to rust . To be as spick and span and neat as those before his eyes , someone had to see they were replenished . He had often wondered when and how . Thinking about that , he found it hard to pay attention to a voice that had the softest question in it . " Your little boy  --  I suppose he had his very favorite nook , his special lair , somewhere where you think of him as being . " There was no sense in telling any woman that " it was a kind of sissy thing to do to stick on your own place , that other fellows ' yards were always more exciting . " " I guess you would have found him almost anywhere  --  or nowhere . " He 'd been polite enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show he was n't going to talk of Junior ; that when it came to him a person could keep off the ground . Yet Miss Sutton went right on : " I seem to see him sailing all his little boats across the pool , launching them across the water in the sun . " As though a boy who 'd ever built a raft and poled it on a pond could ever go back to the limits of a concrete pool . At any rate , Miss Sutton could keep her own ideas . Marian had called from the house that tea was waiting . In the long living room the curtain had been drawn against the yellow sun as though a single beam of it would be an outrage . But here he could pass plates , ask Miss Sutton if she took two lumps , help out the maid , add courtesy to service . He had become an expert . But if Marian only would n't have her tea things placed beneath the lighted , full-length portrait of a little girl so neatly dressed in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps that never got scuffed out or scratched ; the portrait of a little girl who wore a bright blue sash that matched her eyes and all the bright blue flowers around her , who 'd never crash a party , tease or beg for cake until she had to be packed off , who was forever poised before a sand-pile , standing there between the white posts of a picket fence . It was that picture , though , that gave Marian the opportunity she wanted . As he moved about with one thing and another , he could hear her spin her story  --  how she had had nothing left , absolutely nothing but a photograph ; how she had waited , prayed and waited for an artist who would have the feeling and imagination ; how she had been led to one who was the answer to her prayer ; how they two had toiled and talked and toiled and talked until she , herself , the child 's own mother , had been startled by the likeness ; how sometimes coming by herself into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment  --  well , perhaps , for just the fraction of a second  --  she could have the blessed feeling that her little girl had been restored . " That is the artist 's great reward . " But though Miss Sutton seemed so sure of it , Marian was saying that this was n't like the ordinary portrait , done from life . In the way the mother helped with it , why there was something really mystic . True , the artist had come here to live , had had to live right here for weeks to get the tone , the background , the whole atmosphere . But working here and from a quite good photograph , at that , he could n't hope to catch the spirit of his subject . Even Tirrocchi  --  who to do this had delayed his sailing  --  had given up in a complete despair until he found that while he painted if she sat by his side and talked . . . Day after day she had sat close by his easel and  --  well , almost pretended ... If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd heard about the miracle a million times . But somehow this time it was different . Whether he was tired , fed up , with all his nerves on edge , he was aware that his wife 's words had touched a spring that left him facing the unvarnished truth . That portrait had been done when he would have stood for anything that could give comfort and distraction . But it was n't merely that it was n't Sis , was no more Sis than if he 'd snipped it out of some advertisement . If he 'd forgotten how she looked he 'd not forgotten how she 'd wriggled from his arms when he had used to pick her up because she was so irresistible . He could remember the feeling of a compact , squirming little body that had mostly hated kisses as an interruption . Smudgy , she had often been , and sometimes downright grubby . At her best in khaki bloomers and a jumper . At her worst and naughtiest when she 'd been rigged up for parties . There were a raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the reason that he could n't see her , that she 'd simply faded out , was because of that confounded portrait . As different from her as could be , it was just enough alike to get between . Yet what was it Marian was say-ing ? " So you see , Ned , this time it will be you who 'll have to help . I mean by thinking up his ways , the kind of thing lie used to say , and how he looked when he was serious and thoughtful . You see , Miss Sutton 's going to startin painting a companion portrait . Why , yes , of course . She 's going to start in doing Junior . " The hell she was ! Not if his father knew it . Memory might be a damned poor substitute for life . But what it kept , it kept . For what it lost it did n't offer candy substitutes that falsified . How he 'd ever got away and reached his room he did n't know . But on his dresser was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one there was , thank God ! Since his baby pictures , Junior 'd always been at the wrong stage for any photograph to give his parents any pride . Yet that was the way he 'd looked in his play shirt , open at the throat , and wearing his rough knickers . There was his ruffled hair that was never brushed for mealtime . There were his ears , alert and pointed like those of a wild creature listening . Impossible to see the spattering of freckles on his nose , but all the same , shown by his grin , there was the gap in his front teeth that was going to be a damned expensive business . Yes , and though they squinted in the sun , there were his eyes that expected things to be so really so , if grown up people said so . Just the same , not a day older , not a day changed , there was the little beggar to the life . How long he 'd sat there in his room , Ned Waring did n't know . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , the light had almost faded . " Dining out this evening , was he ? All right , he would be down in time ; he 'd started in to dress . " From his second drawer he had taken out an evening shirt , had begun fitting into its tight buttonholes , his jet-black onyx studs . But before doing that , slowly and deliberately , and without looking at it , he had taken a small snapshot from its leather frame and had torn it into bits .
