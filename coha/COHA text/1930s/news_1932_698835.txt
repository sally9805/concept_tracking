txt Will Rogers Urges Sales Tax To Care for the Unemployed To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , June 3 . ? Congress politically , but not economically , turned down the sales tax . Well , even out of the mouths of babes may come a good idea . Ham Lewis , a Senator from Illinois , suggests this : " Put a sales tax on now ( on objects not taxed under the present bill ) and use that additional money just for the aid of the unemployed . " Now there is some sense to a scheme like that , for it provides where the money is coming from before it 's spent ; there is not a soul ( unless it be a politician ) that would object to paying a few cents more for an article , if he knew it was going to some one who needed it worse than him . So come on , a manufacturers ' tax for the unemployed . Yours , WILL ROGERS .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
