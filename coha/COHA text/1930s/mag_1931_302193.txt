Into a drawing room on an outbound train at Manhattan 's 125th Street station was carried a case of Golden Wedding rye whiskey , one day last week . " But it was not a Senator or a Governor or even a Mayor who was leaving town for a pleas ure jaunt . It was New York 's nervous , hollow-eyed , pasty-faced little racketeer , Jack ( " Legs " ) Diamond . He was going home to the Catskill Mountains . Dressed in a flashy coat , grey spats and a checked cap , carrying two novels ( Jury of Death , Super-City ) , he had just been released from a city hospital on Welfare Island . <P> His paralyzed left arm still carried two re volver bullets , deposited there by unknown enemies who attacked him three months ago in a hotel bedroom ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) . <P> Five city detectives escorted Racketeer Diamond from hospital to station , lest some one start shooting at him again . <P> They rode as far as Harmon where rail road police took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Golden Wedding rye were carefully transferred to a Cadillac limousine , ferried across the river , driven to Acra , N. Y. <P> Said Racketeer Diamond to a large , attentive flock of newsgatherers from the Manhattan dailies : " Newspapers create a character for you and if you do n't live up to it the public thinks you 're no good . " <P> Jack Guzik , Capone gang treasurer , was sentenced to five years imprisonment , a $17,500 fine , for federal income tax evasion in Chicago last week . <P> Flaying racketeering , Assistant Secretary of Commerce Klein declared : " A monstrous growth , a vile , malignant para site rising from the slime of criminal greed ! . . . This evil must be rooted out if American business is to progress vigorously again . "
