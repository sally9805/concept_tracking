Not all scientists are suited by temperament and intellect to keep vigil on the heights where paradoxes flourish in the wind of metaphysics and knowledge fades into the unknown-to clock the flight of star clouds , chop the atom 's nucleus into mathematical hash or chase the primordial life-germ through a thicket of test tubes . Some workers must patrol the vales &; swales where humbler things may be found beneath any stone . Such upturned stones during the past fortnight disclosed the following : <P> In Cincinnati Vice President Thomas A. Carothers of National Marking Machine Co. described his company 's device which prints invisible laundry marks . The invisible ink used comes to view only under the light of a mercury vapor lamp . <P> In Manhattan Ichthyologist Christopher W. Coates of the Aquarium received from the General Electric laboratories in Schenectady a potentiometer for measuring the voltage of electric eels . Mr. Coates inserted the electrodes in the water , agitated the eel , read the voltage . Eels developed from 170 to 300 volts . <P> In Paris M. Raoul Michel-May suggested to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open ponds . At present a favorite method is to spread a thin film of oil on the water . When the mosquito larvae , which breathe through tubes in their tails , thrust their tails out of water to get air , oil clogs the tubes and the larvae suffocate . M. May recommended sprinkling the water with talcum powder impregnated with a compound of chlorine and ethane which would choke the larvae to death but would not harm human beings . <P> At University of Rochester Dr. Wallace Osgood Fenn and his associate , taking advantage of the fact that when the human eye moves it generates a slight electric current , invented a metre which bridges the face from temple to temple , makes a record of eye movements . They found that a subject moves his eyes about five times while reading a line of print , keeps his gaze fixed when shaking his head , moves his eyes before he moves his head when looking to the side . <P> In England Dr. Edward Arnold Carmichael of London conducted volumetric experiments which convinced him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs shrink in size . Reason : noise , like cold , pain , fright or excitement , releases nerve impulses which contract the capillaries , diminish their blood content . <P> In Paris Mlle Jeanne Levy explained to the French Academy of Sciences why bicarbonate of soda helps hangover sufferers . Her experiments on alcoholized rats persuaded her that it was not a matter of acid-alkali balance . The carbonated rats breathed faster than normally , and rapid , deep breathing is known to pass alcohol quickly out of the body by way of the lungs .
