Formidable was to be the name of a 23,000-ton aircraft carrier standing ready for launching on the ways of a Belfast shipyard last week . Formidable , indeed , was the launching . As if sensing the pressure under which the had been built , anxious to get into the water as soon as possible , H. M. S. Formidable waited only for a crowd to gather , a band to tune its instruments and Lady Wood , wife of Britain 's Secretary of State for Air , who was to christen the ship , to clear her throat , before slipping its poppet , breaking a cradle , careening down the ways . The wife of a shipyard employe was killed , 20 were injured . Caught napping , the band burst frantically into Rule , Britannia . Resolutely Lady Wood hurled a bottle of wine after the retreating ship , shouted her 50-word speech above a din of cries and crackling timbers , burst into tears .                    @
