When Richard Whitney , onetime president of the New York Stock Exchange , was suspended from the Exchange last month for insolvency and theft of customers ' securities , his older brother , Morgan Partner George Whitney , was in Florida on vacation . Wall Street took this as prima-facie evidence that George Whitney knew nothing of the pending debacle . Last week this view was considerably modified . <P> Testifying fortnight ago , Richard Whitney revealed that his brother had loaned him $1,082,000 in November , having already loaned him $2,000,000 several months before . Testifying last week , Richard Whitney was asked to recall their November conversation . His neck slowly flushing , the fallen financier took a deep breath and recounted : " The loan was made because I told him I had been using customers ' securities improperly . He was aghast at the fact and terribly disturbed . He said he would see if he could arrange to lend me the money I needed and told me to find out what was necessary to clear up the situation . I did so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Richard Whitney used his brother 's $1,082,000 to return more than $900,000 in securities and cash belonging to the Stock Exchange Gratuity Fund , which he had had in his custody and had pledged for a personal loan . Had George Whitney known that there were several million dollars involved in other fraudulent deals ? No , said Dick Whitney wearily , " So far as I know , he knew nothing about the rest until it all became public . "
