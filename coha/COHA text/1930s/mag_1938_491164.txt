SYNOPSIS OP PRECEDING INSTALLMENTS He regretted he had yielded to his wife 's insistence . It was against his hatter judgment that STZPIIKN GUNN left his office to accompany his family abroad . His father-in-law , peppery Our MAN Bswrocisr , owner of the business in which Stephen had been made a partner , had not been well . It meant that DAN SIIATTUCK , junior member of the firm , would have inure than his hands full . Paris , with all its gaiety , failed to raise Stephen 's spirits . Busy with her shopping , his wife , ISABEL , did n't have much time to spend with him . And his twenty-year-old daughter by his first wile , JENNY , had other companionship . On the boat she had met young ' Pway Huctias , now her constant squire . Not , however , without competition from her seventeen-year-old half sister , CECELIA , who had inherited her mother 's forthrightness . Even Stephen 's young son , Leslie . better known as BULLY , found little time to be with his father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently divorced , corning to Paris to cover fashion fur a New York magazine . Lonely , Stephen was thoroughly enjoying an accidental meeting with Lissa when they encountered Isabel . To Stephen 's discomfort , his wife made no secret of her annoyance . After Lissa left them , Isabel continued the scene . At the hotel Cecelia , irritated because Jenny was lunching with Harvey , refused to join Stephen and her mother for the afternoon . " What 's the matter ? " she asked . " Ca n't you two darlings keep each other interested any longer ? " Stephen 's second daughter had , as usual , struck home . A cable announcing the marriage of the Old Man to his nurse abruptly terminated their trip . Furious , Isabel hastened their departure . In spite of Stephen 's remonstrances , she was determined to have the marriage annulled . Stephen called on Lissa to say good-by and promised to luok her up in New York that fall . Home again , Isabel found that she was no longer mistress in her father 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a house of their awn . One afternoon . to escape the uncondertuble situation , Stephen went to New York to see Lissa . There he found the peace he missed at home . Harvey Hughes had returned to the States and ulled un the Gunns , hoping to sec Jenny . He did , but not before Cecelia successfully intimated that Jenny was in love with Dun Shattuck. arser 0 N THE night Stephen went to New York , ostensibly on business , but , as he knew and admitted to himself , to see Lissa Dabney  --  and us Isabel suspected , and suffered almost unbearably in her suspicion , to see a woman , she did n't know whom  --  Jenny and Harvey Hughes sat out in the dark in a pergola wreathed in late-blooming roses , and Harvey said : " I had to see you again , Jennifer . I was a fool to think I could break it off  --  that last night in Paris . I almost had you that night . If Cecelia had n't gotten in her dirty work . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jenny said : " No . " She almost said : " No such luck . " She almost added : " And never will be now , " remembering Dan 's eyes , contemptuous and cold , when , coming back from that perfect hour upon the old river road , they had found Harvey waiting . Cecelia waiting to introduce Harvey to Dan . Cecelia , always the expert opportunist . Jenny , when Dan had asked her about . Harvey , had said  --  and thought , " That 's over . " Not yet having learned that nothing is over until the witty ones that sit up aloft have had their laugh out . Now she heard Harvey say : " All right ; then my chance is as good as anybody 's . " He was somehow harder than the Harvey she had known on the ship going over and in Paris . He was n't so tender of her . Aa he was outspoken about Dan . " He 's too of for you , Jennifer . He 'd be fine fora woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , but not for you ! You do n't know what you want yet . Somebody 's got to teach you , somebody young enough to know how . " Jenny thought she had known what she wanted from the hour she was born , or anyhow from the first time she had laid eyes on Dan 's dark , dissatisfied grin . He was dissatisfied . She had always known that , as well as she knew her own groping heart . Harvey was saying coolly : " You 're sweet as the wild strawberries I used to buy you in Paris , and just about as frail . I do n't know why I keep hanging after you like this . But you 've spoiled my taste for more strongly flavored wenches . To go back to your friend Shattuck , how 's your arith4 metic ? " " I can add two and two , " said Jenny . " Strain yourself , " said Harvey . " When you 're forty he 'll be sixty . Take a good look at it . " Jenny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . She felt horribly helpless . " With a paunch , and not so much hair . and a chronic grouch , " said Harvey . " Hush , will you ? " said Jenny furiously , but even her fury threatened to defeat her , because , when she was angry , she was apt to cry . " How do you know what you 'll be like yourself when I 'm forty ? How do I know what forty will do to me ? " " Those deep-set shadowy eyes may look like passion to you " ? Harvey was implacable ? " but that 's liver , my girl . I 'm telling you . " Jenny said : " Did you come all the way from Chicago just to make yourself unpleasant ? Because , if so , your visit is a success . " In her struggle to control herself she was shaking all over . " I 'm u dirty dog , " said Harvey . " Admitted , but you need a dirty dog to take you by the back of your lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have is a good lesson . " Jenny sprang up with a small cry . He caught her and pulled her down again . " Do n't worry , I 'm too much in love with you to take my own advice . No , darling , no , toy sweet , do n't fight me so ; do n't be so frightened . " He was kissing her as he had not kissed her before , hard and hungrily , almost cruelly . " Let me go , " Jenny gasped . She was , very near hating him . Harvey held her a moment longer , then let her go with u sort of restrained violence . " What do you think I 'm stuffed with  --  sawdust ? " he inquired briefly . . Jenny said : " I told you in Paris that l did n't love you . I did n't ask you to come here . " Her lips felt bruised and violated . She could not keep her voice steady . " Yes ? " said Harvey . " If my memory serves me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night ? " They were standing . She felt him looking at her through the dark , through more than the dark of the night , a deeper dark . " I remember , " said Jenny . " You said you 'd tell me after we got home  --  about marrying you . You left not too much room for doubt , Jennifer , that the reply would be favorable . Stop me if I 'm wrong . " She did not stop him . What he said was true , and it shamed her . " But when you get home you think you still have a ( Cenfinued on Pose 28 ) February 1.1938 ( Contfnued from Paso 26 ) chance with the other man , so the skids are greased for me  --  which is why I say that you 're frailer than hell , that you do n't know your own mind , and if I had the sense God gave little apples , I 'd clear out and never set eyes on you again . " " Why do n't you ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ? " said Harvey . " Maybe I will . I 'll think it . over . " He was gay and cool and casual again . Not frightening now . But Jenny did n't care . All she wanted was to get away from him , get upstairs and hide her face in her pillow and cry . What she wanted was Dan , and Harvey had come back just in time to-destroy what . had seemed the beginning of confidence between ' them . She said : " I think I 'll go in , if you do n't mind . " " I ought to be running along anyhow , " said Harvey . But he did not go then , after all ; for when he and Jenny came to the front steps , there was Cecelia. sitting with her back against a pilla hugging her knees and singing softly to herself in what Han k had once called her Lueienne Boyer voice . Cecelia made an admirable excuse for Jenny to escape . " Do n't go yet , Harvey , " begged Cecelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Jenny said she was sorry to be so stupid , but her head ached and she was afraid she 'd have to go to bed . And Harvey c told her good night , said he 'd call her next day from the hotel , and sat down beside Cecelia . " Well , Sister Spider , " he said blandly , " how long have you been waiting ? " " Sines you and Jenny went out . to the pergola after dinner , " said Cecelia . " Got a cigarette ? " Harvey produced cigarettes and matches . ? " What I like about you , Cecelia , is your shyness , your wotnanly delicacy . " " I thought it would get you , " said Cecelia . She inhaled deeply . " I swear I believe you are out to get me , " said Harvey with a touch of admiration . " What a woman ! Would it make any difference if I told you I have just finished proposing marriage to your sister ? " " Not a bit . You 're wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " As you remarked one night in Paris . What was your idea anyhow , Cecelia , in that particular bit of skullduggery ? Just natural deviltry ? " " Not at all , " said Cecelia calmly . " I saw Jenny was slipping . If you 'd driven her to Cherbourg next morning , she 'd have been-engaged to you by the time we sailed . " " Interesting , " said Harvey concisely . His eyes were keen and cold on Cecelia 's delicately pointed face . " And how did you know that we had talked about driving to Cherbourg together ? " " I got it out of her later . " " With forceps , or only a pair of pliers ? Never mind . Results are what we 're considering . So you deliberately spoiled my chance at that time of getting Jenny . " Cecelia patted his coat sleeve lightly . " Would n't expect me to sit still and let her have you , would you ? When I 'd taken a fancy to you myself . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly word . " I 'd like to wring your neck . " " Good , " said Cecelia . " That 's the first real emotion I 've ever got out of you . Now we 're getting somewhere . I thought you were going to go on being polite to me forever . " Harvey laughed abruptly . He said : " I hope your intentions are honorable , Cecelia . " " We can take that up when we come to it , " said Cecelia . She and Harvey smoked for a while in silence . There was no moon . but a street lamp on the corner threw arabesques of greenish shadow across the steps , across Cecelia 's dimly shining hair . In a house across the street someone was playing a violin , softly , a little uncertainly . It was like a young bird trying its song . " So you did n't went me in the family , " said Harvey after a long time . " Not as Jenny 's husband , " said Cecelia . " It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You and I understand each other , " said Cecelia. : ' I could be lot of help to you . You could be a lot of help to me . " " Your altruism , " said Harvey , " is simply staggering . And when , if I may ask , did you decide to let me in on this unholy passion you say you have for me ? " " Tonight , " said Cecelia . " When I saw that Jenny was getting up her nerve to kick you out . I thought you might not be coming around again , and I 'd better talk while you were still hero . " " Well , I will say for you , " said Harvey , " that you 've got a good head , my child . " " That 's the least of my charms , " said Cecelia gently . She added after a meditative moment : " Of course I 'm nuts about you , or I would n't have gone to all this trouble . You 'll come back now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 761 // ( Continued from Pogo 741 Mr. Jackson 's speech is followed by the news that it exactly announces the President 's own thought . Under three-column front-page headlines , on December thirty-first , The New York Times reported : President Roosevelt was revealed today as the mainspring behind a concerted Administration drive against monopolies which has as its immediate object the beating down of prices in anticipation of a Federally sponsored private building program , by which he hopes to avoid a re-. turn to heavy spending for relief .... The opening gun was fired Sunday by Assistant Attorney General Robert H. Jackson ... . And two columns more . That makes a kind of sense , taking it in a vacuum . High prices do arrest buying ; high prices do retard building ; high prices may at length devour prosperity . This is elementary . But when did the New Deal discover it as an economic fact ? Its recovery program was entirely founded on the delusion that high prices created prosperity . Its great undertaking was to make prices rise , To make them rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue Eagle was born . And in order that big business might raise prices in a concerted manner the antitrust laws were suspended . The worst New Deal epithets were reserved for one who cut prices . He was the chiseler . In the throes of this price delusion , the NRA distributed millions of cards on which people were exhorted to pledge themselves to boycott any business that did not raise prices in order to be able to raise wages . Remember the little Jersey City tailor who was put in jail for cutting the price of pressing a pair of pants ? And if you think that all of that was meant only for the emergency , you " I 'm coming back to see Jenny , " Harvey told her curtly . He began to feel that the thing had gone far enough . " I 'll be here , " said Cecelia . " I hardly hoped you would n't , " said Harvey , " but any more dirty work where Jenny and I are concerned and ? " " It wo n't be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south . " But if it were , I 'd still be here . I mean it , Harvey . " Next morning Isabel observed thoughtfully : " I do like Harvey Hughes , Jenny . I thoroughly approve of him , and so does your father . " As if the thing were settled and done . Jenny turned a little cold . If she could have felt the reassuring and familiar presence of her father as she was accustomed to feel it ? But he was no longer so near as he used to be . Something was between them  --  a cloud , vaporous and immaterial yet not to bo seen through . He was there for three meals a day ; he slept , and rose , and read his paper , and talked to his family as he had always done ; but in a deeper and , to Jenny , achingly mysterious sense , he was not there . Something of him had gone away . So Jenny felt sorry for herself  --  she did n't know enough to refuse that most insidious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had known how unhappy Jenny was and that she needed him , He was surprised , on his return from New York have forgotten what the basic theory was , The President himself expounded it before the National Democratic Club , on April 25 , 1936 . There he challenged the horse-and-buggy economists who were saying " that the only way to get full recovery is to lower prices by cheapening the costs of production . " The President rejected that idea . Why ? Because , to reduce the cost of production , you had to have more machinery and higher efficiency , and that meant more unemployment , or you had to get more work done for the same wage , and that , of course , was out . Then be said : " Reduction of costs of manufacture does not mean more purchasing power and more goods consumed . It means just . the opposite . The history of the 1929-to-1933 period shows that consumption of goods actually declines with a declining price level . " That was the new economics . That was New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same New Deal was engaged in a drive to beat prices down . Does it say : " The idea we had that the consumption of goods actually declines with a declining price level was wrong " ? No . It says that sinister business , the sixty families , conspired to raise prices to satisfy their greed for profit ; and conspired at the same time to wreck prosperity in order to discredit the New Deal . It is only a New Deal mentality that could reconcile these two objects . Class hatred . If people can be made to hate , they will not think . Hatred excludes thought . But were the smudge pots lighted soon enough ? There has been time to think and now blight is followed by frost . The icy breath of doubt gathers on Mr. Ickes ' lemon groves ; the doubt that the New Deal knows or ever knew its stuff . after that first visit to Lissa 's apartment , to learn that Hughes had been in Eastridge overnight . " Jenny know he was coming ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel replied with entire justification . " She was terribly glad to see him , if I 'm any judge . You ought to be pleased , Stephen , instead of looking so glum . " Stephen unavailingly denied glumness . As he unavailingly kept silence as to what he had done in New York . Polite but definite questioning on Isabel 's part forced him at least to admission of things he had not done . Had he seen a show ? He had not . " What ? When there are so many good ones on ? Why , Stephen , how foolish ! " Perhaps a movie then ? No , not a movie . Isabel hoped at least the business end of things had been satisfactory . On that Stephen was able to reassure her . By a lucky chance he had concluded the deal with the man he had gone to New York to see . Brought home the bacon , as it wore . The Old Man was pleased . Only Dan , upon hearing of Stephen 's success , smiled a skeptic smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan was not coming around much nowadays , Stephen could not help noticing . At the office he was his usual competent self ; nothing left in his hands ever suffered from inattention , lack of judgment or lack of initiative ; but once office hours were over , Dan was now not easy to get at , Twice after Harvey 's appearance Ellen asked Dan to dinner . Both times , on some negligible pretext , he refused . " What 's the matter with Shattuck ? " Ellen asked Stephen thoughtfully . " Anything the matter with him ? " Stephen evaded the question . He himself had not been unaware . " Buck was asking me last night , " said Ellen ? she called the Old Man Buek ? " if he were n't sort of giving us the go-by . " " I 'll have a talk with him , " said Stephen . " Dan 's a solitary Lind of cuss , you know . Always was . " " We saw quite a lot of him before you got back , " said Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset your household too much . " He was irritated with Ellen for making a point of Dan 's staying away . Ellen slapped him on the shoulder as if she bad been another man . " Get along and shut up , Steve , or I 'll think you 're coming down with something . " It was n't a quarrel . She liked Stephen , she knew he liked her , but she could see that family life in the old house on High Street was getting on Stephen 's nerves , was , in fact , becoming something for all its lama tee to reckon with . xv A WEEK or so later Ellen had a /A patient on her hands . The Old Man backslid , he fell from grace . An old friend of his from New Jersey turned up one day about lunchtime , and not without some sneaking idea of exploring once again bachelor fleshpots , the Old Man took his old friend to lunch at the Eastridge Inn . That night , in the smallest . and most open to remorse of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines . Ellen did not wake anyone else that night , She did not think it necessary . This was a repetition , merely , of the attack the Old Man had had in July , Danger , of course , at his age lay in repetition , but she went about her business quietly and efficiently with that in mind . She knew what to do for him . She had done it before . With the first sharp cramps she had asked him : " Want a doctor , Buck ? I can have one over here in ten minutes . " " Hell , no , " he had grunted , doubling over in agony between the sheets . You know I hate doctors like the devil hates holy water . You can take care of me , ca n't you ? " So Ellen had taken care of him , eased the pain and got him quiet and fairly comfortable . At nine o'clock next morning , with dark circles of fatigue beneath her own eyes , but spotlessand cool in a eleanlinen dress , she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened . " Come in and see him for a moment , Stephen . He 's a lot better now , " The Old Man , propped against fresh pillows , with his big hands folded over his chest , was dozing slightly . He opened his eyes at once at the sound of footsteps , achieved a grimace of approximate amusement . " Well , Steve , I 've been and done it again . " " Gosh , I 'm sorry , " said Stephen . He followed Ellen over to the farther side of the bed , touched the Old Man on the shoulder . " Oh , he 'll be fine from now on , " said Ellen . " I 'll see that he is , " she winked at the Old Man severely . " You see , " said the Old Man with an enfeebled chuckle , " I got a good nurse any time I need her now , and it do n't coat me a thing . " " Drink this and do n't be so sure of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ever see such an old miser , Stephen ? " She was holding a glass to the Old Man 's lips and smiling at Stephen when Isabel walked into the room . " Morning , Isabel , " said Ellen . " Your father 's had a touch of indigestion again . " Isabel was pale and unsmiling . " Hello , Belle , " said the Old Man huskily . " You do n't look so chipper yourself this morning . " Ellen set the glass upon the bedside table and eased the Old Man back upon his pillows . " I have not been sleeping very well , " said Isabel , ominously quiet . " What 's on your conscience ? " said the Old Man , grunting with roughly affectionate laughter . Isabel came and stood at the foot of the bed . She looked at her father steadily . " I think / might have been told that you were ill  --  not left to find it out for myself from the servants . " " It 's nothing to get upset about , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel ! " said Stephen , surprised and angered , " Ellen knows what she 's doing . " Isabel continued implacably : " I think you ought to have a doctor , father ; someone quite  --  disinterested . " She had not meant to say it quite so flatly , but , once it was out , pride kept her to her point . Color rose darkly across Ellen 's cheekbones . " Do n't be such a fool , Isabel , " said Stephen harshly . " Do n't be such a fool , is right ! " said the Old Man . He glared like a wounded lion . Isabel and Ellen were looking into each other 's eyes . " You understand my anxiety , I am sure , " said Isabel to Ellen . She gripped the footboard to keep her hands from trembling . Ellen , immobile , said to Isabel : " I understand . " The Old Man protested in weary and irritated surmise : " What 's the matter with you , Belle ? You must need a doctor yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all the futile squabbling his fatherhood hod brought upon him . Ellen moved swiftly . " You 'd like a nap , would n't you , Buck ? . . . Isabel , wait for me in the sitting room , you and Stephen . " When Stephen and Isabel had gone , the Old Man muttered apologetically : " Look out for Belle . Got to handle her with gloves , you know . I do n't feel anywhere near so bad as I made out just now . " You get a nap just the same , " said Ellen . She patted his hand gently before she left him . Isabel was waiting in the sitting room , standing beside a window , staring out into the quiet street . Stephen was sitting in the Old Man 's chair with his hands locked before him , elbows on his knees . He stood up at once when Ellen came in . " Ellen , " he said , " Isabel did n't mean what she implied just now . " Isabel turned , straight-lipped . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did , " said Ellen . She walked over to the table where the telephone stood and dialed a number . " Is Doctor Knapp there ? " . . " We prefer Doctor Hatch , " said Isabel instantly . " We have always had him . " Doctor Knapp , " said Ellen , " is the best man in town for this sort of thing . Your father had him in July . Sit down , Isabel , and stop shaking . A bromide would n't do you any harm .

I 'll let you know when the doctor gets here . " " I am thinking of my father 's welfare , " said Isabel . She was , as Ellen 's trained eye had observed , momentarily at the mercy of her nerves , but Ellen had taken care of a good many nervous women in her time , and had learned to discount the importance of such tremors . " You are thinking as well of your father 's property , " she said ruthlessly , " and you 've suggested that I 'm after it . I dare say you 've made yourself believe that from the moment he married me . Well , fun is fun , Isabel .

Stephen broke into ironic laughter . The room in Paris  --  the room with the terrible wallpaper  --  Isabel raging , " I 'll have him declared incompetent . " " I 'm sorry , " said Stephen to Ellen 's controlled questioning look , Isabel 's passionately reproachful one , " but it seems that history does repeat itself . " " Take you forty-odd years to find that out ? " said Ellen crisply . Cecelia , languorous in bright pajamas , had been passing through the hall after her belated breakfast . Hearing voices upraised in the sitting room , she paused , listened long enough to get the gist of the argument . Now she entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Run along , Cissie , " said Stephen .

" The doorbell rang briskly , a businesslike sound . The maid went through the hall to answer it .. " That would he Knapp , " said Ellen . She started for the door . " You know his ring ? " said Isabel . Ellen stopped in her tracks and looked at the Old Man 's daughter . A spark crackling between charged electrodes is not quicker than that look was . Ellen said : " You are a fool , Isabel . " She went out of the room . As she went , she said to Stephen : " Wait here .

" After all , mother 's got a right to want a doctor for grandfather if he 's sick again . Ellen 's only a registered nurse  --  she 's not a licensed physician . " EVENING POST Stephen stopped and stared at those starry gray eyes , that soft girl 's mouth turned oracle . " And what do you think you know about it ? " he demanded impatiently . " A girl I know is taking nursing at City Hospital , " Cecelia explained , unmoved . " She tells me all sorts of stuff . A nurse ca n't prescribe without a doctor 's orders . It 's illegal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Isabel . Color came back into her face . She was not alone now . Her first-born had come miraculously to the rescue . " Good heavens , rsere n't you ? " said Cecelia . It amused her . " That 's only a. technicality , " said Stephen . He went on walking up and down the room . " It 's enough , " said Cecelia , " is n't it ? Even a doctor knows better than to treat his own family . " She went over to Isabel and put an arm about her waist . Together they faced Stephen ; Isabel reinforced in courage , Cecelia serenely supplying it . " Both of you make me sick , " said Stephen . He made no attempt to hide the scorn and resentment he felt . " Ellen is one of the straightest women I have ever known . " Bitterness mounted in Isabel 's heart . That Stephen should speak so of Ellen , by contrast damning Isabel . " Oh , Ellen , of course ! " she said bitterly . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny was standing there . Like Cecelia. , only a little later than Cecelia in leaving the haphazard family breakfast table , she had heard voices . " Come in , Jenny , " said Stephen sardonically . " You might as well be in on this . Everyone else is . Your grandfather 's ill . The doctor 's with him now . We 're waiting to hear what he thinks . " " The doctor ? " said Jenny . She went over and stood beside Stephen , slipped her hand through his arm , looked at Cecelia and Isabel , startled . " Is he as sick as all that ? Too sick for Ellen ? " Isabel said : " Surely you must know , Jenny , Ellen is only a nurse . She has no right , without adoetor 's orders ? " " Ilse your head , Jenny . " said Cecelia sweetly . Cecelia was enjoying herself . " Poor grandfather , " said Jenny . " Doctors always frighten him so . " There were footsteps in the hall . Ellen and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag in one hand , came into the room . " Isabel , " said Ellen , " this is Doctor Knapp , who took care of your father while you wore in Europe last summer . Doctor  --  Mr. and Mrs. Gunn and the Misses Gunn . " Her nice face was a mask of businesslike courtesy . " How do you do , Doctor Knapp , " said Isabel , quite quiet now . She looked at him with gentle apprehension . She put Cecelia one side . Stephen nodded briefly . He stood leaning against the mantelshelf , looking down at unlit logs . " Well , Mrs. Gunn , " said Doctor Knapp briskly , " I 'm glad to be able to relieve your anxiety about your father , At his age , of course , we ca n't have him taking too many chances , but this attack was caught in good time . Mrs. Bartlett knows from last July exactly what I want done under such circumstances ; and everything seems to be progressing nicely . A stitch in time , you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Isabel . Having made her point and gotten a doctor into the house , she was able to be February F , 1938 charmingly gracious . " You know how it is  --  one ca n't help worrying . " " Most natural thing in the world , " said Doctor Knapp warmly , " but I assure you , no need for it . " Ellen made no comment of any sort . " Thank you very much , doctor , " Stephen said without looking up . After a slight further interchange of politenesses the doctor , who said he was in a hurry , went away . Ellen went with him to the front door . " Nice family , " he said , shaking hands with her there . " Very attractive woman , your husband 's daughter . " " Yes , is n't she ? " said Ellen . XVI AFTER Isabel 's insistence upon hay- ing a doctor , Ellen was careful to call Knapp daily , until the Old Man eventually rebelled . " Listen here , Ellen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggnog with considerable relish , " I 'm malingering and it 's getting to be something of a strain on me . First , I enjoyed it , kind of . Now I 'm about ready to get out . " " Do n't think I do n't know it , " said Ellen . " But it has n't done you any harm , and if you 'll just play ball a little bit longer I 'll turn you loose with a clean bill of health for Mrs. Stephen Gunn 's approval . " " I 've been thinking about her , " the Old Man said . " She 's got so , now , she 's possessive as a setting hen . " " Well , she better snap out of it , " said Ellen . " If I 'm any judge , Stephen 's not liking it any better than you are . " The Old Man sighed gustily . " What I 'd like to know is why 's Steve running off to New York so often these days ? " " Supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business your foot I Has n't been a bit of business we had there this fall could n't have been handled right from the office . You do n't suppose , at this late day , Steve 's got mixed up with some woman , do you ? " " I rather wondered myself , " said Ellen . " Sure you did . Well , Belle 's wondering too . You can take my word for it . " Ellen put her hand over his and squeezed it gently . " That 's enough about you and your precious family . Buck , I have an idea . You 're feeling better , are n't you ? " " Better , " said the Old Man scornfully . " Woman , I 'm feeling my oats . " He picked up a brush and gave his hair a swipe or two . " I am myself again , " he announced solemnly . " I was thinking , why do n't you and I get away for a couple of weeks before you go back to the office ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got something there , " he said slowly . " Get away from the family for a while , oh ? " " You think you feel up to Bermuda ? " asked Ellen practically . The Old Man snorted . " There 's nothing the matter with me now , unless I 've got barnacles on my keel from sitting in that chair so long . Look here , you want to see how good I feel ? " Ile took a step or so away from her , kicked a small hooked rug aside and broke into a slightly stiff-kneed but authentic jig . His slippers slapped the bare floor . Above the noise of his jigging he lifted a rusty bass chant . Ellen lay back in her chair , helpless with laughter . The Old Man began to laugh at himself . He laughed so bard he had to stop singing , but he kept up his rakehelly dance . " That good enough for you , hunh ? " he was demanding , breathless , when Isabel burst into the room , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gone crazy ? .. . Ellen , what do you mean by letting him do such a thing ! I heard it all the way downstairs . " Ellen sat up with a final gasp , wiping her eyes with the tips of her fingers . The Old Man stopped in his tracks . " It 's enough to kill him , and you know it , " said Isabel to Ellen . " I suppose you put him up to it . " Ellen stood up , her laughter dying into contemptuous resentment . The Old Man looked from his daughter to his wife , and suddenly he thrust out a masterful forefinger . " Get out , " he ordered loudly . " You hear me , Belle Bartlett ? Get out of hero and mind your own business ! " He had never spoken so to Isabel before . She went away without a word , her eyes full of hurt and furious tears . When she had gone , the Old Man 's shoulders sagged a little . He went back to his chair and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat there . " Who 's afraid ? " he said . " That 's the boy ! " said Ellen . XVII T O STEPHEN , it was like cool air flowing , like the moon rising , like music heard across still water , getting back to Lissa ; who had no claim on him , who made no demands upon him , who wanted nothing of him except himself . The Old Man was right . Stephen had got himself mixed up with a woman . He knew now , when he went to New York , that he had no material reason for going . Little by little he had ceased even to offer reasons , merely said that he was going and went . With silence equally significant , Isabel had ceased to question him regarding these departures . Again the Old Man was right . Isabel was wondering . She had been married to Stephen too long not to know when something was happening to him  --  and through him to her . She shut her lips and ate her heart out wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feminine creed . Some creature had got hold of him and was making a fool of him . Nothing , according to the second article , for Isabel to do but sit tight and wait . Isabel 's rationalization was simple . Infatuation  --  it could n't be anything else  --  sooner or later worn itself out . Any good woman knew that . Give him time and Stephen would come hack . The Old Man would have said give a calf enough rope and he 'll tangle himself . Stephen would come back , and be sorry , and love Isabel all the more for having been patient while he had his fling . The day the Old Man went back to the office Stephen took the 6:15 . He called Lissa , of course , from the station . With some idea , perhaps , of avoiding premeditation , he never let her know when he was coming , but always called her as soon as he got in . Her voice came to him with a little ripple of happiness , recognizing his . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was no doubt in his mind  --  she frankly wanted there to be no doubt  --  that she was waiting for him , impatient of delay . Stephen rode along Fifth Avenue to the Square , whistling softly to himself . He could n't turn a tune . He thought he was whistling one . The Avenue was swept by a light chill wind . October was coming in with a rustle of drying leaves and an edge to veiny air . Itwould be good , sitting in Lissa 's window with her , looking down into the Square . Far bright Lights without . Soft warm lights within . When he paid of the taxi he gave the driver a quarter . The driver , an elderly red-faced Irishman , was surprised into an understanding grin . He touched his cap with a grimy forefinger . " Thanks , and good luck to ye I " Stephen went up the stairs two at a time . He was a little disconcerted when Lissa opened her door . There were people in the room behind her , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't want to intrude . I supposed you were alone . " " I asked you to come , " said Lissa. serenely . She drew him in with a hand on his arm . " You 've met Hugh Allan . Hugh , you remember Mr. Gunn ? " The lanky blond Virginian shook hands warmly . " Mighty glad to see you again , Mr. Gunn . I was asking Lissa about you just yesterday . " " And Sally Allan and her husband ? " " Lay off that Sally Allan 's husband thing , " the other man interrupted Lissa severely . He was as stocky and dark as his brother-in-law was tall and fair . " The name is Scott , " he told Stephen . He , too , shook hands in a friendly way . Sally Allan was small and exquisite , deceptively shy . She wore a new-looking wedding ring and a fair-sized diamond . " Do n't mind him , lamb , " she murmured to Lissa , in a. soft drawl not unlike her brother 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody ever heard of . " " These twoareup here on theirboneymoon , " Lissa , explained to Stephen . At which Sally slipped an arm around Lissa 's waist and laughed , reddish curls against Lissa 's shoulder . " We just ca n't get away from it , Mr. Gunn . Even Lissa labels us . " " What do you think of the sky lino ? " asked Stephen politely . It went through him like a small electric shock of pleasure when Lissa , laughed . " Oh , she thinks it 's cut out of cardboard , " said Scott amiably . " Can I pour you a drink , Mr. Gunn ? " A decanter and glasses and a siphon stood on the small table near the piano . Hugh Allan was holding a glass half full . Lissa , and Sally drew off a little to one side . They stood there for a moment or so , talking together in lowered voices . When they came back together , Sally said : " I 've been trying to persuade Lissa to try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of involved , are n't you , honey ? " said Hugh Allan mildly . " Go back and start all over again , why do n't you ? " Scott suggested , pulling a curl behind his wife 's ear . " You two let her alone , " said Lissa . Her smile at Sally was amused but sweet . " They 're going to the French Casino , Stephen , and they want you and me to go along . I 'm too lazy . I 'd have to dress . " " You look all right , " said Hugh . His eyes rested on her with something deeper than affection . Stephen could see that . " Oh , yes ? " said Lissa , laughing . She patted Hugh 's arm . " But it would be such fun , " pleaded Sally . She had taken Scott 's arm and was leaning against it . " Make her come , boys . We wo n't see Lissa again for goodness knows how long . " " They 're going out to Cuba to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bob has a job on a sugar plantation . " " Chemist ? " said Stephen to Scott . He did n't want to go out . He wanted to stay in that quiet lamplit room and talk to Lissa alone , but he bad a feeling she did n't want to go , either , and so left it to her to arrange it . " Engineer , " said Scott . " Lissa , what did I do with that letter you gave me to your friend in Havana ? " " In your pocket. , " said Lissa .. " You 'll have to watch him , Sally . Do n't let him lose the steamship tickets . " " I know . I 've just taken a boy to raise , " sighed Sally , gentle as a dove . " Sure you would n't care about the Casino ? " Hugh asked Lissa quietly . When she shook her bead , he said : " Then do n't forget . I 'll be by for you tomorrow at coon . " He set down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , Lissa darling , " begged Sally . " Mr. Gunn would love it , I know . We 're going to bang on the table and sing songs , Mr. Gunn . Were going to be abandoned . " " You 'll have to be abandoned some other time , Stephen , " said Lissa . " I 'm firm as a rock . " " Come along , Sally-Jane , " said her brother . " I know a rock when I see one , if you do n't . " Sally went over to Lissa and put her arms around her . " I just ca n't bear not to be seeing you again , " she mourned softly . She lifted her face to be kissed and Stephen saw that there were tears in her eyes . " Come along , " said Hugh again . Lissa held Sally close for a moment , then let her go . " You take good care of her , Bob . " Bob himself kissed Lissa soundly . His good-looking , good-humored face was momentarily serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down for a visit , Lissa. soon as we get any soil of a decent place to live in . " They were pleasant friendly people and it was obvious that . they were deeply attached to Lissa . Also they were ready , for her sake , to be more than pleasant and friendly to Stephen . The little bride told him , with her hand in his , saying good-by : " You certainly ought to be flattered , Mr. Gunn . Lissa had n't said she would n't go till you telephoned . Right then she turned us down flat . " I " I 'm honored , " said Stephen , meaning it . When the door had closed and he and Lissa were alone , he asked her : " Did you really say no to them ' because you wanted to stay here and talk  --  to me ? " " Welk hero I am , " said Lissa . She added , collecting glasses to take out into the kitchen , " Women mostly do what they want , Stephen . Not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think ? " Stephen said : " Maybe they do . I hope they do  --  when it 's you . " He wanted to help her with the glasses , but she would n't let him . " Sit over there in the window and I 'll be through in half a second . I 'm so happy you 're here , Stephen . " The window was what he had been waiting for . It was just as he had visualized it coming down the Avenue , just as he kept remembering it nowadays when he was away from her . Small rain had begun to fall . That made it perfect . It dimmed even the lights in the Square and shut Stephen in with Lissa away from the world . She came back and sat down beside him presently , brushed her fingers over his . " Stephen , I 've missed you . " Stephen said that with the Old Man well again , it would not be so long to the next time . " I 'm so glad , " said Lissa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in the amber half-light was clear and fine as a shell cameo . " He 's all right till the next attack , I guess , " said Stephen . " There was some talk about his going to Bermuda , but he decided not to . Do you know , Lissa , this is the first time I 've ever seen you with your own people . I feel as if I 'd just met you again  --  for the first time . " " Why , am I so different ? " said Lissa . She smiled her tender half-diverted smile , " Not different. , " he told her slowly . " Nearer somehow  --  that 's all . They were all so crazy about you . You were so sweet with them . " " Stephen , you 've been worrying about something , have n't you ? " said Lissa . " What makes you think so ? " You sound  --  lonely . " " I have been . Things have n't been going very well . " " Anything you want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him out of dark questioning eyes . " Now that I 'm here  --  no ! " said Stephen . " I 've been over it all so many times in my own mind I 'm sick of the whole mess . All I want to do is just sit here and look at . you , and listen to you ? " He stopped abruptly . Maybe if he told her how much he had been wanting actually to look at her and listen to her , she would turn it off or  --  unpleasant thought  --  would even laugh at him . Lissa was n't laughing . She said : " Yes ? " very softly . And waited . " You do n't know what it means to me , " said Stephen . " being here in this room with you . " " Are you happy with me , Stephen ? I 'm terribly glad . " Stephen could not take his eyes from her face . " I 'm beginning to realize that before I knew you I had almost forgotten what happiness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too , " said Lissa . Her low voice had wistfulness and compassion in it  --  like an old song that a man has heard as a child . " How do you know , Lissa ? " Once when he had asked her how she knew something about him , she had told him it was her job to know people . Now she just smiled at him and looked out of the window . " How could I not know ? Women do  --  about men . " They sat in silence for a little while . Stephen had thought it would be peace and quiet and rest to be with her , but this time something was growing in him like a fire in a deep wood . There was no rest in his racing pulse , neither quiet nor peace in his hands that now ached to take her face between them and bring it to his lips . She knew  --  she must know  --  sitting there so lovely and still , waiting . He said what he had to say , when the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lissa , I want you . I 'm starving to death and dying of thirst for you . That 's the kind of happiness it is , " " I know , " said Lissa . Stephen thought surely the two softest words spoken anywhere in the world that night . She stood up and walked over to the piano , put her elbows on its darkly shining surface and dropped her face into her hands . Stephen went to her , cold with fear . He had offended her . He had lost what he had of her for something ho would never have . But when he took her hands down from her face and loolced into her eyes , she only laughed , not too unsteadily , and lifted her face to him . " Stephen , I knew it would be like this . That first day in the Tuileries . " Kissing her was like kissing a living rose . When he left her that night , Stephen walked the streets for hours , The rain had stopped by then and the streets were dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower shops were open , he sent her the blackest red roses he could find . They had made no plans . Beyond admitting that they were in love with each other , which Stephen at the moment considered a good deal like admitting the rising of the sun , they had looked not at all into the future . The ecstasy of the present sufficiently occupied them . Now , however , Stephen wrote on the card that went with the roses : " I will see you again in a few days . My love always . " When Lissa saw the roses she put her face down on them and shut her eyes and remembered . When she read the card she kissed it and cried . " I 've let you in for a useless struggle , that 's all , Stephen darling . " She knew her Stephen , and she knew her world . XVIII 0DING back in the train next day Uf to Eastaidge , Stephen 's mind was full of Lissa . He seemed not to have left her at all . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned his head , he felt she might smile at him . The touch of her hands , of her lips , the beat of her heart against his was with him still . He could still hear her saying : " I Imew it would be like this . That first day . . . " Blind and deaf and dumb  --  Stephen had n't known . He had thought she was just an attractive woman . Just a delightful companion . Just someone to whom he could turn when life at home grew too stale and ignoble for a man 's tolerating . He had turned to her , and now he knew why . The force that had drawn him was stronger than himself . Where it might he leading him he had yet to find out , but he did not resist it . He chose not to . His life was taking on new shape . He was ready to aceeptwhatever ehangeconfronted aim . Strange , how overnight a man 's whole world could alter . He had left Eastridge , Isabel 's husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile was going back with one thing only starkly clear in his mind . He could no longer live with her . The word " marriage " had not yet passed between him and Lissa , yet he knew already that was what he wanted most . Suppose the home were broken up  --  what would become of the children ? Cissy  --  she flashed across his inner sight , laughing scornfully : " Oh , this is too , too much ! " Cissy could take care of herself , any time , anywhere . She 'd prefer , of course , to stay with her mother . Bully  --  well , anyhow it was time Bully was getting away to school . Being pushed out of the nest would do Bully no harm . Jenny  --  there Stephen 's heart . failed him . Jenny , his first-born , Juliet 's child  --  Jenny was the one he had to think about . Jenny was easily bent , might be easily broken . With a downright physical qualm , Stephen admitted what he had never faced up to before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't she be , poor kid ? " cried his embattled conscience . Juliet , dying the day Jenny was born . " Jenny never seemed to have much hold on life till she was two or three . " To whom had he told that ? To Lissa , sitting in the sun in those blazing French gardens . When Jenny ( Cantiew  --  d on Polo 82 ) ( Con finaa  --  d from Page 80 ) was not yet three he had married Isabel , and Jenny , just beginning to take hold , had come at once under the rule of Isabel 's hand , a hand of steel , however velvet clad . What chance had Jenny ever had to be herself , even to know herself ? One thing was certain . Whatever Stephen did now , Jenny must be considered . Jenny was his major responsibility . The pageant of the woods was marred by enormous advertisements of food , of cigarettes , of hotels , of meth-tine . Just as life was marred by the necessities of tribal living . No such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had held Lissa in his arms the night before was nut the Stephen who now sat in a chair ear , trying to work out his life as a man might work out a household budget . A new thought struck him like a blow on the chest . if he left Isabel he could n't possibly go on with the ( till 3.111n . It had never before route home to hiin with suet humiliating clearness that Isal  --  el and his job were so closely connected . It did nothing for his pride  --  that realization . Well . so what He ouebt to be able to get another jolt. and maybe the Old Alan would reeler miss him , with Dan there . The Old Man had a lot of faith in Dan . Stephen got up and went to the smoking compartment . After all , he could n't be expected to think the whole thing out in a couple of hours . One thing only remained hard and clear in his mind  --  what lie had to su to Isabel . His train was fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went up the walk to the Old Man 's house . Bully was playing with his dug in the front yard . teaching her to fetch a thrown ball . " dad , " called Bully without moving . " Hi , Bull ? , " said Stephen in reply . " How 's she retelling ? " " Watch , " said Bully , and threw the hall across the lawn . The dog bounded in pursuit and presently trotted bark , tail wagging , the ball held loosely hi its jaws . - How you like tliat ? " said Bully proudly , turning to face his father . His white pull-over sweater and gray slacks were very dirty . " About time you went in and got cleaned up , is n't it ? " Stephen suggested in a friendly way . In a minute , ' ' said Bully . He stooped for the ball and threw it again . Stephen walked up the path and into the house . Cecelia came down the stairs on a run as Stephen went in . She was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff over one arm . " Hello , darling , " she called back gaily over her shoulder . " I 'm just getting dressed . Going out to the club with Harvey Hughes . He 's in town again . " That was another thing . Harvey Hughes and Jenny . Was n't he Jenny 's beau ? Certainly Isabel had been definite enough about that . What was Ceeelia doing , going out with him ? At that moment Ellen came through the hall with the evening paper , " That you , Stephen ? I thought I heard somebody come in . " " Where 's Jenny ? " asked Stephen . Ellen cast an amused glance hack in the direction of the kitchen , where Cecelia was now imploring Lucy , the maid , to press her frock for her . " Jenny 's got a headache , " said Ellen . She smiled to herself . " Don't. worry , Steve . Nothing fatal . Came on very suddenly when Mr. Hughes telephoned he was bark . " " You mean she did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he transferred his invitation to Cecelia . It 's an ill wind , " said Ellen , with a glint of friendly malice in her eye , " which blows nobody good . " " Isabel home ? " asked Stephen . Ellen said : " She 's playing bridge somewhere . Said she 'd be back for dinner . " She went over to Stephen and put her hand on his arm . " Old buy , you look tired as hell . Is anything wrong ? " Stephen shook his head . He put his hal down on the hall table and rim a hand over his forehead . " St uffy on t he train . I 'll go up and gel a wash . The I MI Man all right this evening ? " " Hight as rain , " said Ellen . " Come doss II when you 've had your wash and I 'll make you a drink . Dinner wo n't be ready for twenty minutes yet . " Stephen said : " Thanks , Ellen . " He palled her on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her looking after potpie in that friendly way of hers , but it was comforting , at that . She was a nice woman to have around . He was with her and the Old Man in the sitting room a quarter of an hour later when Isabel came in . Isabel , fresh and cool in a new gray suit with a crisp frill in the front of it . " Well . Stephen , " said Isabel , " did you get back ? " She did not go near him , laid her gloves and other impedimenta down on a table and stood looking about her abstractedly . He had been to New York again , was what site was thinking . She let him feel her disapproval without speaking it . " Cocktail , Isabel I ' " said Ellen . " No , thank you , " said Isabel politely . " Better have one , daughter , " said the Old Man affectionately . " No , thank you , father , " said Isabel . She went out of the room and upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doghouse together , " said the Old Man . He rumbled with rueful amusement . There was a ring at the front door . Cecelia flashed through the hall . Her lightly hooting laughter Caine hack to them and a murmured interchange between her and Harvey . Then the door closed and she was gone . Another moment or so and Harvey 's ear roared away from before the gate , " Why' n't she bring him in ? " asked the Old Man , puzzled . " Because she did n't want to , " said Ellen . " Afraid he 'd catch sight ofJenny , maybe . " She winked at Stephen . Jenny was coming down the stairs ; she was coming into the room . She had her finger between the pages of a book . She went over and put her arm around Stephen 's neck . put her check down on his hair . " Hello , Steve . " " Sure you have n't a headache , really ? " asked Stephen anxiously . He held her off and looked at her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy ; slender , but when was she ever anything else ? Now she laughed . " I 'm all right . I just did n't want to go out with Harvey . " " Giving the young man a dirty deal , eh ? " said her grandfather . " I 'm surprised at you , young woman . " " Oh , he 'll be all right with Cecelia , " said Jenny . She sat on the arm of Stephen 's chair and pulled his hair gently . Stephen 's thoughts went round in a grinding circle . . . . Isabel . . . The Old Man .. . . Cecelia .. . . Bully .. . Jenny . . . Whatever happened , ho must not let himself and Jenny he parted . He had promised Juliet The autumn dusk was closing in . Ellen got up and lit the lamps . Jenny , snuggling against Stephen 's shoulder , sighed with satisfaction . " I love this time of day  --  now that you 're home , Steve . " There was a sound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breaking . Isabel stood there , " It 's nothing  --  I dropped my glasses , " She used glasses for reading or sewing . She had a piece of petit point in her hands . " Let me look for them , " said Jenny , jumping to her feet . " Do n't bother , " said Isabel , stooping and speaking very distinctly , " I have the frame . " She came on into the room . " Perhaps Lucy might sweep up the pieces , Ellen . " Ellen said with a calm disinterested face , " I 'll speak to her about it presently . " Jenny sank down once more upon the arm of Stephen 's chair , put her arm about his neck again . Stephen had an obscure feeling that she was coming to him for sanctuary . Isabel sat down in a chair near her father . She folded her hands upon her work . " Was n't that Mr. Hughes , Jenny , " she inquired aloofly , " whom Cecelia went out with just now ? " Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was Harvey . He got in about an hour ago . " " I kind of liked that young man the one time I saw him , " said the Old Man , From under amiably scowling brows , he kept a wary eye on Isabel . " Did n't he ask For you , Jenny ? " Isabel continued pointedly . Jenny said : " Yes , he did . " " Why did n't you see him ? " " Because I did n't want to , Isabel . I just did n't feel like it . " Stephen felt the slim body against his shoulder quiver very slightly . " Do n't you think you 're being abominably rude ? " Stephen endeavored to speak quietly . " Look here , Isabel , Jenny does n't have to see anybody.she does n't want to  --  young Hughes , or anybody else that persists in running after her . " He felt Jenny 's lingers clutching his shoulder , pressing into it hard , heard her imploring whisper at his ear , " Please , Steve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good breeding , " said Isabel . " Mr. Hughes is a gentleman . He has probably no desire to force himself on Jenny 's attention . 13v the way , Jenny , " she added with chilly detachment , " are n't you a little too old to be pawing your father t that way , like a spoiled child ? " Jenny 's face flamed . She tore herself away from the arm Stephen moved to hold her by and left the room . " Now , now , Belle ! " said the Old Man reproachfully . " Ai n't you kind of hard on her ? " Ellen watched Isabel speculatively . Let her come a cropper  --  the sooner the better . Of course she was unhappy , hut did that mean she had to make life hell for everybody around her ? " If only she 'd move out of here , " thought Ellen , " into a place of her own somewhere . Then she might stand some chance of getting hold of herself  --  of holding Stephen . " Stephen had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment or so after Jenny left him he had felt that he could not trust himself to speak . He said at length , quietly : " I 'd rather you did n't talk to Jenny in just that way , Isabel . " talk to Jenny , or anyone else , as I think best , " said Isabel . Her hands were shaking . There were red spots on her cheekbones . " I do n't like to see Jenny making a sentimental fool of herself and sou ? " He stopped her abruptly : " Later . " Isabel 's keen ears caught an unaccustomed ring in his voice , " Later , if you do n't mind . We 'll talk it over  --  later . " He who had fought shy of scenes all his life , to be betrayed into yet another domestic wrangle , under the Old Man 's regretful eyes , under Ellen 's frankly disgusted ones .
