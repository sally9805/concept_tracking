In the 21 years of its court-studded existence the American Society of Composers , Authors &; Publishers has fought many a stiff fight to collect revenue for its members when their music was publicly performed . Radio even prompted the Federal Government to charge ASCAP with violation of the Anti-Trust Law ( TIME , July 1 , et ante ) . The case is still pending but odds so far have favored ASCAP , which has made no bones about controlling the bulk of the popular music on which Radio depends . <P> Biggest blow of its career was struck at ASCAP last week from within its own organization , when four of its publishers and their subsidiaries resigned their memberships . Together the four claim to have published some 40% of the music most in demand . They are Harms , Inc. , M. Witmark &; Sons , T. B. Harms Co. and Remick Music Corp. , all subsidiaries now of Warner Brothers Pictures , Inc. which announced that it would hereafter do its own dickering . <P> Radio 's complaint is that ASCAP charges too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts ) . Warner Brothers says that it asks too little . ASCAP 's President Gene Buck stated last week that all the important songwriters were bound personally to the Society by new five-year contracts , that Warner Brothers ' experiment would depend on finding new talent . But ASCAP was obviously perturbed . Its strength has been its ability to dictate terms without thought of rivalry . An ASCAP rival is what Radio has long been wanting .
