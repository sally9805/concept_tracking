I T is hardly a month since the newspapers carried the announcement that President Roosevelt had lifted up one Lamar Hardy to the substantial post of United States Attorney for the Southern New York District , and that he had also , on the same day , elevated one John J. Kelly to the position of United States Marshal for the same area . Those who follow such matters carefully had also noted the appointment , a day or two before , of Max D. Steuer as counsel for the Congressional ( Sabath ) committee investigating real-estate-bondholders ' reorganization committees . The three appointments occasioned a considerable amount of discussion in several quarters of the metropolis , ranging from the offices of distinguished Wall Street lawyers to the well-known back rooms of a dozen Tammany clubs . Something , the theory was , lay at the bottom of all this . It took the better-informed a day or two to fill in the picture . Those who see it all now are suffering from that bleakness of spirit which comes to men who have looked upon wonders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be put in a nutshell , either . The Hardy-Kelly-Steuer appointments are but three tarnished threads in a rich and varied political tapestry . Concealed in its folds are matters as diverse as ( a ) President Roosevelt 's desire to be reelected next year , ( b ) the " guaranteed " - mortgage-certificate scandals , involving 300,000 investors and one and a half billions of investments , ( c ) the split between Tammany and the Administration , ( d ) the scandals attending many real-estate-bond reorganizations , ( e ) the decreasing importance of Leader Dooling and the increasing power of the James J. Hines ( of Harlem ) ? Edward J. Flynn ( of the Bronx ) ? Farley bloc in the Manhattan Democratic organization , and ( f ) the Administration 's plans to take that organization over before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November , 1936 . The civics books say that appointments to high law-administration posts should be conceived in the desire for effective law enforcement , and no such desire is listed above . The trouble is that civics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional committee appointments are made with an eye on the election calendar . J. J. Dooling , leader of Tammany Hall , did not want Lamar Hardy appointed United States Attorney for the metropolitan area . Mr. Dooling did not want John J. Kelly named United States Marshal , for the position carries heavy patronage authority . Mr. Dooling had other candidates for the two jobs . But there will be an upheaval shortly in Tammany , and Mr. Dooling stands an excellent chance of losing his own job . ' Whoever replaces him will be a most important figure in the coming Presidential election , and those who have the most patronage will be in the best position to dictate the choice of his successor . Mr. Kelly starts with several natural advantages , not even including the fact that he heads an advertising agency in which Elliott Roosevelt is a partner . He is one of the Tammany leaders who function under " Jimmy " Hines , in opposition to Mr. Dooling . He himself has been mentioned prominently as the next leader of the Hall and is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the torch . Lamar Hardy 's connections with the higher Democratic politics arise through the medium of Edward J. Flynn , Democratic boss of the Bronx , and Governor Lehman 's Secretary of State . Mr. Hardy , a distinguished'and able lawyer , has long had business contacts with Mr. Flynn , and it is those contacts which , in a way , provide the drama of this piece . Of that , more later . The point to keep in mind here is that by throwing these two appointments to the segment of the Democratic organization opposed to the present Tammany leadership , that leadership becomes subjected to a policy of attrition . By careful placing of their patronage , Messrs . Hardy and Kelly can wean away one of Mr. Dooling 's props after another , and can thus convert a regiment of the Tammany faithful to the truth , the light , and Jimmy Hines . Now let us return to Mr. Hardy , whose case cries aloud for individual treatment . The biggest financial scandal in the history of the state of New York is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record approaches the one and a half billion dollars of small investors ' money tied up in these certificates . The Moreland Commission , which looked into these affairs at the request of Governor Lehman just a year ago , returned a repoit that was an indictment of the whole top section of our financial community . One of the companies most severely criticized by George W. Alger of the Moreland Commission was the State Title and Mortgage Company . Twenty-five former directors of that company are being sued by the state Insurance Department for $5,000,000 for making " unlawful , unsafe , and unsound " loans to affiliated and subsidiary companies One of those directors is Lamar Hardy , who is also a founder , former counsel , and chairman of the executive committee of the company . As United States Attorney for the Wall Street sector , Mr. Hardy will have among his duties the prosecution of violations of the vast new body of securities and banking legislation framed by the New Deal to bring the more abundant life to the small investor . From the time he helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he severed his connection with it in October , 1931 , Mr. Hardy had the fortunes of a great many small investors at least partly in his care , but they do n't seem to have profited greatly by it . It is on record that the State Title and Mortgage Company was called on the carpet by the Insurance Department in 1931 for correction of " an unsound condition . " It is on record that long before the state took over the company an Insurance Department examiner reported that " the company is not observing the law . . . and the situation is terribly involved in intercorporate relations . " In a survey of the report returned by the Moreland Commission on October 5 , 1934 , the writer has found eighteen citations of the State Title and Mortgage Company for conduct that can be called questionable . John A. Dilliard , president of the company at the time it was taken over , is now valiantly appealing a jail sentence of six months for failing to disclose to investors the fact that , out of $4,091,698 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already pledged as collateral on RFC loans . State Title and Mortgage , with $75,000,000 of " guaranteed " mortgages and certificates outstanding , could not maintain the ridiculously low guaranty fund of $5,300,000 required by law ( two-thirds of its $8,300,000 capital ) . It reduced its capital to $5,000,000 and then to $1,000,000 in order to be able to reduce its guaranty fund  --  but its obligations were not reduced correspondingly . Ultimately , according to testimony taken , there was a guaranty fund of only $200,000 behind $75,000,000 of contingent liabilities . We ai e most interested in what happened during Mr. Hardy 's tenure . In 1929 State Title and Mortgage purchased a bank , which was operated thereafter as a wholly owned subsidiary under the name of the State Banking Company . When State Title needed cash , it would sell its mortgages to its own bank and repurchase them whenever the repurchase was advantageous , thus making the bank 's depositors unwitting purchasers of these real-estate obligations . " A very nicely thought-out idea , " said a bank examiner of this practice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an institution authorized to accept deposits . " The State Banking Company opened an account with the Bank of United States , in November , 1930 , a few weeks before the Bank of United States was taken over by the Banking Department . The bank examiners reported of this deposit : " This inactive deposit of $150,000 appears to have been maintained in violation of Section 290 of the penal law in that it has the earmarks of having been used to influence the Bank of United States to lend a substantial sum of money to one of the other subsidiaries of the National American Company " ( a unit in the State Title and Mortgage chain ) . In July , 1931 , State Title and Mortgage decided to engage in a typical " swap " operation in connection with mortgages in its group series " C. " " Swapping , " as practiced by many of the companies , consisted of lifting out good moi t-gages against which a series of " guaranteed " cei tificates had been issued , and substituting others , which might or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates rarely knew that any change had taken place in the portfolio of mortgages which supposedly backed their investment . The most frequent reason for " swapping " was the need for ready cash , and in those cases the most salable mortgages would be extracted , the less salable , or defaulted , mortgages substituted In the group series " C " case , State Title wanted to withdraw the 134 mortgages on deposit , of which only 19 were in default , and to substitute a single mortgage on the Hotel Victoria annex  --  a mortgage that was past due . To do this legally the annex property had to be appraised at $2,500,000 . An independent appraisal of the property at $1,925,000 was on.file . The company 's own appraisal , made in the prosperous year of 1929 , stood at $2,250,000 . But in the depression year 1931 , a vice-president of the company , a lawyer who had never before appraised any hotel property , obligingly made an appraisal of $2,500,000 , and the substitution was accomplished . That the hotel annex was doubtful security since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without expensive alterations was a thought not allowed to influence the deal . State Title and Mortgage Company was clearly guilty of most of the standard bad practices of the " guaranteed " - certificate business . It sold more than $27,000,000 of guaranties after its guaranty fund had been impaired to the extent of more than 50 per cent as of December 31 , 1930 . It boosted sales of certificates in series in which it acted as its own depositary , in preference to series in which there was an outside trustee . When a mortgage in a series was paid off , the company kept the money and put another mortgage into the group , instead of using the fund to pay off existing certificates . By a complicated series of intercorporate maneuvers , it put defaulted mortgages into the portfolios of an affiliate , made indirect loans to that affiliate , took this same money back from the affiliate as " interest " on the mortgages , and was thus enabled to record the interest as " paid . " The Moreland report has served as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy 's associates , in addition to Mr. Dilliard . Since Mr. Hardy was chairman of the company 's executive committee he either knew these practices were going on or he was extremely remiss in his duties . Edward J. Flynn , boss of the Bronx , was named earlier in this article as Mr. Hardy 's link with Democratic politics . New Yorkers may recall stories of the past two years concerning various crippled children who had recovered large money damages as the result of automobile-accident injuries , but who were now penniless because the City Chamberlain 's office , trustee for these minors , had placed their funds in sour mortgage certificates . The City Chamberlain 's office favored the securities of the State Title and Mortgage Company above all others for the years between 1928 and 1932 It bought $1,235,000 of State Title " guaranteed " mortgages , of which $1,169,845 dropped into default , and $890,000 of State Title guaranteed certificates , all of which went into default . For part of that period the City Chamberlain was none other than Edward J. Flynn . Mr. Flynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel for the State Title and Mortgage Company , and Monroe Goldwater was a director of National American Company , Inc. , which controlled State Title . State Title 's other point of contact with Democratic politics lies in the person of Joseph V. McKee , a Flynn associate of long standing . Mr. McKee , former Acting Mayor and former President of the Board of Aldermen of New York City , received a $25,000 fee from the company for negotiating loans totaling $4.700,000 from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation In 1932 he persuaded the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company to " tone down " certain damaging parts of a letter , which , as depositary for the issue of group series " C " of State Title certificates , it was about to send to certificate holders to inform them of the Victoria Hotel annex " swap " transaction . With Mr. Hardy 's qualifications for the post of United States Attorney thus illumined , where does Max D. Steuer , new counsel for the Sabath committee , fit into the picture ? Mr. Steuer is a major Tammany strategist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master-mind . Tammany , through transit , land condemnations , tax assessments , pier manipulations , has constantly been linked with the highest flights of New York high finance . Can it be that Mr. Steuer , aware of Mr. Hardy 's elevation , aware of the ring of patronage being forged around the present leadership of Tammany , sought a post which might enable him to remain a key factor ? Tammany influence may be weak in the ' White House , but it is strong in Congress , where it controls even the powerful Rules Committee of the House . Mr. Sabath 's committee has recently had its powers broadened . It can now probe into a variety of real-estate matters , including , perhaps , a certain title and mortgage company , one of whose former directors is to be United States Attorney . Is it possible that Mr. Steuer has formulated a plan ? Will there be a fight in the Senate against Mr. Hardy 's confirmation , as there certainly should be , and will Tammany , if hard pressed , join virtuously in that fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
