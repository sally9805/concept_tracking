Handsome Lance Corporal Arthur Charles Mortimer , an outstanding misogynist of the British Army who especially hated female cyclists , was held to be sane by a court in Winchester last week , sentenced to be hanged . In the circumstances Mrs. Violet Van der Elst , wealthy and eccentric British widow who usually protests in person every hanging in the United Kingdom ( TIME , April 15 ) , was expected to skip that of Mortimer . <P> Cyclists of both sexes now infest British roads to such a point that politicians talk seriously of having to win " the cyclist vote . " Aristocratic motorists are often heard to swear jestingly that they would like to do to cyclists some of the things Mortimer surprised and shocked the Empire by doing . <P> In the garrison town of Aldershot 27-year-old Lance Corporal Mortimer did not have to live in barracks because he had a wife at whose house he was supposed to spend the night . Nobody thought much of his occasional remark that " there are too many females on wheels in this world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arabia " who died in a motoring accident ( TIME . May 27 ) , was also a woman-hater , was also annoyed by women cyclists , and also used to tear over the roads . Five months ago Mortimer started suiting action to his words . In succession he stole several cars , all of which he used briefly in the same way . Overtaking a woman pedaling along a lonely road Mortimer would bunt her off her bicycle , then back up rapidly with profuse apologies only to bunt her again , if she had managed to get to her feet . After that , apologizing still more profusely , he would help her up , then send her spinning with a black eye or a clout to the jaw . In no case did Lance Corporal Mortimer make immodest advances and never was he drunk . The story told by Mrs. Alice Series , the first woman Mortimer bunted , made police think her slightly cracked . They could no longer doubt it , however , when the same story was successively told by Miss Nellie Boyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all eminently respectable and severely bruised . " I asked him why he hit me-unable to believe my senses , " testified Mrs. Series . " He replied : ' Why should n't I ? ' Then he scrambled down to the ditch in which I sat and punched me again . He said as he did so : ' Everybody knows that a bicycle on the road is more nuisance than the biggest motor lorry . ' Then he hit me again and I seemed to go to sleep . " Several women were too quick for Mortimer , riding their cycles off the road before he could bunt them . Near Winchfield the Oakes sisters , Betty and Phyllis , were pedaling to the hairdresser . As Betty neared a bridge she heard a big car roar up from behind , swerved well out of the way , then screamed as she saw it pass with her sister Phyllis spread-eagled across the smashed headlights and the broken bicycle dangling from the radiator . Lance Corporal Mortimer grinned down from the driver 's seat . A few yards farther on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rushed by her sister to a hospital , Miss Oakes died while friends remarked that only the day before she had written a poem on Death entitled Smile . A capable secretary , she had worked regularly for second-string Novelist Dorothy Brandon ( Beau Regard ) .
