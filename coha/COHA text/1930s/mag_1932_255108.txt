Ankuo , meaning " Land of Peace " is a nice name for a new country . Japan , having seized most of Manchuria and some of Mongolia , and having set up a regime of seven heavily bribed Chinese " Generals , " was pleased when the Seven chose Ankuo last week as a nice name , proclaimed that Ankuo is an independent , sovereign state and elected its Genshu . <P> What is a Genshu ? Japanese newspapers glossed that over , but they stated who Ankuo 's Genshu is to be . Pictures of this young man ( in Chinese costume ) and of his wife ( in a Japanese kimono ) filled the Japanese press last week . He is of course the puppet Japan has had up her kimono sleeve for nearly 20 years , Mr. Henry Pu Yi . Deposed at the age of six , he was until then the Emperor of China . <P> March 1 was announced as the date on which Ankuo 's Genshu will be ... inaugurated ? . . . Crowned ? Nobody knew which last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japanese blandly professed that they did not even know where the Genshu would be . . . . <P> Vexed , newsmen made up their own minds that Genshu can be translated either " President " or " Monarch , " and that the capital of Ankuo will be either Kirin or Changchun . <P> The weak , weak-eyed Genshu was not permitted by his Japanese guards to utter a word last week , remained plastic in Japan 's iron fist at Mukden , where his family 's Ancestral Palace stands . Manchu relatives of the Genshu talked . They said that he wants Genshu to be translated " Emperor " and that he wants to revive the Manchu capital at Mukden . <P> When one day old last week , Ankuo , the " Land of Peace " was mildly disturbed by one General Wang Teh-ling . Backed apparently by Koreans ( who hate and fear their rulers , the Japanese ) General Wang with 1,000 Chinese soldiers hastily wrecked or burned 18 flimsy bridges on the Kirin-Tunhua Railway . Promptly Japanese troops set out to slaughter or buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive committee in Nanking dispatched a message to Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang , censuring him for failure to attempt redeeming Manchuria from the Japanese , despite the fact that he commands 200,000 troops . It pointed out that Marshal Chang 's ancestors are all buried in Manchuria , that his father the late Marshal Chang Tso-lin awaits burial there . To young Marshal Chang as to any Chinese this was an offensive hint . He began mobilizing troops . <P> Under Japanese aegis enough local Chinese banks , whose funds have been impounded by the Japanese military , were hastily merged to create the Central Bank of Ankuo . It was capitalized last week at $30,000,000 , provided with silver bullion to cover an Ankuo paper money issue of $10,000,000 . Up to last week the paper money of Manchuria had been for many years an innumerable series of increasingly worthless wads of paper issued by this " general " or by that " War Lord .
