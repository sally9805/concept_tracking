txt A credit expansion for 1936 theoretically by as much as $4,000,000,000 is provided today by the Treasury 's decision ' , virtually to end its gold sterilization policy . Only if purchases of gold exceed $100,000,000 in any one four-months period will the metal be put into the Treasury 's inactive fund , on the basis of an announcement of Henry Morgenthau , ? Jr. , Secretary of the Treasury last night which had been heralded by several mystifying conferences of officials The new policy means several things . 1 . It means that a drain on national purchasing power of up to $400,000,000 a year will not take place . Had previous policies continued , a total up to that amount might have been taken from the American taxpayer or borrowed from American banks , and buried in " sterilized " form at Fort Knox . Ky. ? kept out of the reservoir of credit . 2 . Now , although the taxpayer or the banks will he called upon ultimately to pay for as much gold as formerly , the gold will be returned immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency . 3 . And . according to the calculations of monetary experts . every dollar added to the national monetary reservoir means ten dollars added to potential credit . Therefore , by this actlon , a theoretical total as high as $4,000,000.000 is added to the national credit . Originally a Brake Actually , the step is not quite so sensational as this would indicate . The gold sterilization program , inaugurated on Dec. 24 , 1936 , was intended to be a brake on inflation . Yellow metal was pouring In from Europe . Prices were rising rapidly , and under the modified sort of managed currency which the United States has had for the last five years . a deterrent action by the financial authorities was called for . Therefore the inactive gold fund was established to segregate the flow of monetary gold from Europe . and prevent it from entering the United States ' credit structure . Now almost the reverse of those conditions exist . So the Treasury acts to take off the brakes from a possible inflation . The step , as one official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary wagon uphill . It is not taken as a panacea which will bring recovery overnight , but it will facilitate the Other basic economic faetors of recovery , and lubricate their operation Mechanics of the step are very simple . In a ewo-paragraph an- nouncement , Secretary Morgenthau states that after conferring with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , he announces that " gold acquired by the mints and assay offices after Jan. 1 , 1938 will be included in the inactive account only to the extent that such acquisitions in any one quarter exceed $100,000,000. " $33,000,000 Released at Once The order is made retroactive , sc that $30,000,000 of sterilized gold purchased since the beginning of the year will be immediately released into the credit structure . It is not exIpected that at any time In the near future the inflow will exceed the maximum of $100,000,000 a quarter , and that to all intents and purposes he inactive-gold-fund policy discontinued . There remains in the inactive fund a total of $1.223,249,465 . It was reported that Chairman Marriner S. Eccles of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base needed a sum turned into the credit reservoir . He has long been urging that the boost , but Treasury officials have been less eager for sweeping action , and presumably the President 's decision went to them . Therefore the billion and a quarter total remains in the inactive fund , and only future intake , as well as that since the opening of the current quarter , will go for boosting purposes . The saving to the Treasury in the new procedure is simply that it will not have to borrow in order to buy gold and hold it inactive , since the gold can immediately be used as a monetary basis . The gold already sterilized will remain as a back-log in case a flight of capital should begin . To Aid Private Borrowing The Treasury will be able to remain out of the borrowing market to a greater extent than contemplated , thus leaving the way clear for private borrowers who want to put money to work . Bank funds will be increased at a time when privately-financed housing and loans-tobusiness are keenly desu ed activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater relief spending under the President 's new recomipendation for an additional $250,000,000 . The total of $100,000,000 does not apply to net but to gross intake of gold . Thus , if the domestic and foreign offerings of gold amounted to $70,000,000 , that amount would be released into the credit stream , even though an additional $50,000,000 were purchased by foreigners . The $50,000,000 for export would be taken from the inactive fund . It is admitted by officials that there are adequate bank reserves , and that the Treasury does not attach great importance to the increase of bank funds made possible by the move . But the general effects are taken to be inflationary , and a natural result of recession conditions , the halt in the inflow of gold , and the need for releasing the brakes .
