Landing in San Francisco from a tour of the Orient , the venerable Roger Babson had something to say to the press . Mr. Babson , who for almost 40 years has made his living selling the public charts and prophecies about business , announced last week that so far as the U. S. economy is concerned " The war in Europe is unimportant . . . . the important thing is . . . what is going on in the Orient . Trade always has moved westward . " <P> During Mr. Babson 's absence , however , the war undoubtedly made a bigger impression on U. S. trade . For the first time in years many a firm has now more orders than it can fill in three months ' full production . By last week U. S. Business had begun to ask " Here 's the war boom-but where are the war orders ? " <P> This question was justified by the condition of many a manufacturer 's order books : to provide against price rises and shortage , his customers had swamped him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasers have not yet come along ; he has a huge backlog but few new orders coming in . Shall he operate at 100% till January-and trust to the gods for 1940 orders-or shall he operate at 75% and be sure of keeping busy till March ? <P> Some last week 's evidence of this new stage in war boom : <P> &gt; New orders in the cotton textile industry amounted to only 30% of the quantity in production : <P> &gt; Copper sales fell off 95% from their boom peak in September : <P> &gt; In several industries customers who had put in big rush orders began sending instructions to slow down deliveries . Perversely , some frightened sellers tried to speed deliveries lest the orders be canceled . <P> &gt; Steel companies , faced with a $5 a ton rise in costs as a result of the $10 rise in scrap prices , * went on strike against $26 scrap , refused to buy till they got reductions of 25 to $1 a ton . Hard-bargaining Bethlehem managed to buy 90,000 tons in Buffalo at $22 to $23-a three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Wolcott of Coatesville , Pa. ' s small plate-making Lukens Steel , which has already upped prices $5 a ton , steelmen formed a committee of 1,000 scrap-buyers , resumed their 1937 agitation for stopping tonnage export of U. S. scrap ( favored by American Iron and Steel Institute President Ernest Weir , who also favors the embargo on munitions exports ) . There is a genuine scrap squeeze , mostly because Japan , England and other foreign buyers have taken 16,700,100 tons of scrap out of the U. S. in the last decade . <P> &gt; Steel production rose from 88.6% to 90.3% . The Great Lakes division of efficient , profitable National Steel ( which has a tonnage production monopoly in Detroit ) had to close one of its 16 open-hearth steel ingot furnaces for too long deferred repairs . New York 's Journal of Commerce commented sagely : " . . . May be a forerunner of a general condition in the industry . " <P> &gt; The coal industry , one of the few industries really exporting its product ( to neutrals whose English-German sources are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of steady , increasing exports to Canada , Bethlehem Steel ordered 6,000 tons of coke a month from the Steel Co. of Canada 's Hamilton ( Ont. ) plant .
