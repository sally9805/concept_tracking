In Madison Square Garden , Dynamite Jimmy McLarnin lashed his famous right , his jolting left against the long scarred face of Billy Petrolle , called by admirers " The Fargo Express " because he came from Fargo , N. Dak . It was a set-up for McLarnin , wagerers figured-the best welterweight in the U. S. against a washed-up lightweight . One minute of the first round had passed and McLarnin was landing punches as expected when suddenly Petrolle hit him with a terrific right-hand swing , opened a gash under his left eye . Through the rest of that round , and all succeeding ones , Petrolle chased McLarnin round the ring , landed accurate , hard left hooks , floored him twice in the fourth round , bashed his vainglorious , boyish face into a bloody muddle . McLarnin , half conscious , streaked with blood that oozed from his eyes , his nose and a cut in his lower lip , fought back with courage . He won the ninth round and staggered through the tenth somehow . Winner Petrolle may soon be matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won his title-he gave a hearty drubbing.
