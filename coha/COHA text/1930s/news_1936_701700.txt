txt The Bonus Legislation . There must be countless others besides myself who are filled with indignation at the recent passage of the bonus legislation . This flagrant achievement on the part of an organized minority makes a reeking blasphemy of the office oath of every Congressman who found it a personal , political necessity to support this measure . The attitude of its leading sponsors in shouting " Vote ! " before even hearing out the President 's reply in order to save telegraph ' expenses to anxious Legion members betrays a woeful lack of dignity . I propose that every honest-minded man and woman make it mandatory to himself to organize and militantly combat any further agitation for the payment of soldiers ' pensions ; to vow publicly to vote against any candidate for office who will not pledge himself to defy openly all such agitation now or ever . ROLAND H. CRAMER . Douglaston , N. Y. , Jan. 30 , 1936.
