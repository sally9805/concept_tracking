According to the Young Communists , one 17-year-old Stakhanovite mechanic in a Moscow carburetor plant has been swept into such a whirl of balls , banquets , meetings in his honor and general " bourgeois publicity " topped off by floods of flattering poetry that this carbureting Stakhanovite did only 16 days work in December , nine in January and seven in February . <P> As for famed &; fantastic Dusia Vinogradova , that highly temperamental young Juno of the Soviet Textile Trust who makes amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is able to tend simultaneously , the Young Communists sneered that Soviet cinema directors are following Stakhanovite Vinogradova around , beseeching her to realize that , with her obvious talents as a highly emotional actress , she is wasting herself in Stakhanovism and should go on the Soviet screen . <P> Officially in Moscow this week Young Communist headquarters summed up against pampered Stuck-Up Stakhanovites : " It is high time to deal drastically with the vulgar and servile people who corrupt and spoil our glorious noble youth !
