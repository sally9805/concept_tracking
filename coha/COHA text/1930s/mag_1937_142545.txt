Almost all U. S. colleges have some kind of rule to regulate drinking , but last week the University of Pennsylvania decided to enforce one . Since Repeal , liquor has flowed freely in Penn 's fraternity houses and four have cropped out with bars . Because 31 of the houses have been transferred to University ownership to escape taxes , they fall under a University rule which prohibits drinking on University property . This year the Interfraternity Council , at the suggestion of Penn 's administration , circulated a questionnaire which revealed that not one fraternity house was dry . As the University announced last week that hereafter drinking in them would be punished , the Philadelphia press blossomed with predictions that the houses would be raided , the bars smashed . Less impulsive , Penn 's administration promised no raiding or snooping if bars and bottles were out of sight by spring . For this wave of righteousness most observers credited President Thomas Sovereign Gates 's drive for contributions for Penn 's 1940 Bicentennial . <P> This year the polling Literary Digest announced that college drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " although of 581 U. S. colleges , 436 forbid students to drink at all , 105 have restrictions , only 40 have no special rule . Stanford severely provides that " the possession , transportation or use of intoxicating liquors ... in the university shall be grounds for expulsion . " Perhaps the most lenient administration is Harvard 's . Students may not only drink what &; when they like , but they may charge cracked ice and soda water on their term bills . Princeton men are not allowed to drink in their rooms , and Princeton 's eating clubs have a gentleman 's agreement with the administration not to serve liquor . Yalemen are not supposed to drink in their rooms , but many Yale clubs and fraternity houses have State permits for bars . <P> According to the Digest poll , there are more teetotaling women 's colleges than men 's . Both men and women student drinkers , however , prefer hard liquor to beer about 2-1.                    @
