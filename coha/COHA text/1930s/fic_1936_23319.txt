REVOLT IN SHANGHAI A STORY BY EMILY HAHN rr E lesson hour was drawing to a lose . Henry Kung 's head and his book moved nearer and nearer each other as he read aloud ; the room was growing dark , but neither the student nor his teacher was aware of it . Henry read , and Arline Petersen sat and watched him instead of listening , as the darkness thickened . Outside , the harsh noises of day were in abeyance ; children scampered home to supper , letting doors slam after them ; the white paving-stones and walls of the narrow lane , lined with crowded seething houses , gently and imperceptibly began to give off heat instead of drawing it from the air , from which sunlight was disappearing . Where the lane joined Bubbling Well Road there was a quickening of the whole long double line of traffic as limousines and taxis and vans swept by , their horns and claxons sounding . Coolies rested and slept , their legs drawn under them between the shafts of their rickshaws . An evening breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Shanghai . Henry was reading Keats from an annotated text-book . Within the room , cluttered with chairs and many small tables and glass objects and pictures , the muffled noise retreated and his voice was intensified . It was a light Chinese voice with uplifts in it which he tried earnestly to subdue as he struggled for a proper English monotone . . . Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold . Oft of one wide expense . . . I mean expanse . . . had I been told , That deep-brow 'd Homer ruled as his de  --  dewhat is this word ? " " Let 's see , " said Arline brusquely , holding out her hand for the book , and as he surrendered it and she tried to read she said , " Good gracious , Henry , it 's dark ; why did n't you tell me ? Turn on the light over there , please . . . . Mmmm , here we are . ' That deep-brow 'd Homer ruled as his demesne . ' " She rolled out the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demesne , Henry , is an old English word which means , well , it means something like domain , only you do n't have to bother with it because we never use it any more . I think you 're tired now , are n't you ? " As she asked the question her tone changed , strangely , for one would not expect that soft note from a woman who looked like Arline . She was tall and broad , with the full uncomfortable bosom of an elderly fat virgin . Her brown hair was long and untidy . Her face was mottled from the heat ; her large pale arms were freckled ; her hands were square , with clipped fingernails . She was dressed uninspiringly in thick white silk of a kind which is cheap in Shanghai . She wore pince-nez , the only literary and romantic touch about her , though she taught romantic English literature daily in the classroom and privately , twice a week , to Henry Kung . He said , " Yes , I am a little tired , " and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behooves a man to be polite to women . Arline noticed the gesture and glanced at him approvingly . It came to her for the first time that Henry was graceful in his slightness . His oval face was pale and spirituel above the high collar of his dark robe ; his hair was smooth and black and sleek . Some ardent young novice in a monastery  --  the thought came to her surprisingly  --  a medieval clerk , white-faced from long hours of illuminating scrolls . " I have lately studied the works of Milton , " said Henry with his faint accent . " It is somewhat difficult . It will not trouble you too much if I mark certain passages and present them for your help ? " " Yes , yes , certainly , " said Arline abruptly . She heaved herself awkwardly from her chair and turned on a strong center light ; seen from her height of five feet eight , Henry suddenly lost his fine quality and dwindled into a smallish Chinese gentleman in the usual dark robe . Arline passed dozens of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Very kind and very learned , " murmured her depreciated pupil as he gathered together books and papers . " I shall work before our next lesson together , but I do not have much leisure this week . We are busy at the bank . " " How 's your wife ? " demanded Arline . It was her usual question at parting after these lessons . She had once met Mrs. Kung at the Chinese Woman 's Club , a small earnest woman with glasses . " Thank you , she is better . I shall tell her you inquired . " He paused for more politenesses then , released , he bowed quickly and went out into the street . Arline loitered vaguely by the window , watching him . " He should n't wear a straw hat , " she thought . This loitering was a symptom of something momentous , a change in Arline . It had not been like her to idle at windows musing upon aesthetics . Seven years she had been in China , and not once had she given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained what she was , what she had been when as an ugly lumbering schoolgirl she had discovered that a retentive memory brought her attention and praise in the classroom if not on the dance floor . If you can remember all the forms and phrases of the code of your colleagues you need never go to the trouble of thinking . When she had landed seven years before , with a set of ideas as limited , as clean , and as commonplace as her luggage , she had made only one comment . She looked upon China as it displayed itself to her in Shanghai  --  the overbuilt streets , the stinking back lanes , the clanging rattling man-drawn traffic , the immense crowds of men and women sitting like patient beasts on the ground and panting through the summer nights . She had said after her first and only tour of inspection , standing at the top of an ancient pagoda , smelling joss-sticks that burnt at the door beneath her , " Does n't it make you just itch to reform it all ! " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten the wish she was sedately sure that she was doing her utmost in the way of reform by instructing English-speaking students in the plots and technic of Mr. Shakespeare 's better-known works . Her feelings toward the Chinese were those of a soldier engaged in a twenty-years ' siege ; she possessed the philosophy , amounting almost to good-humor , of that soldier toward her adversary . The entire Chinese race was represented to her in the person of her " boy , " over whom she kept relentless watch , counting stray coppers on his weekly accounts and occasionally tempting him with money left carelessly in the open while she waited hopefully , like a sniper , to catch him . With her friends , all female , she threw herself with passion into endless discussions of Chinese servants ; " the girls " never tired of retailing stories of the iniquity , lack of honor , stupidity , and mystery of these enemies of theirs . When she was talking thus or listening her pale-blue eyes glistened and her face grew animated . To newcomers who protested charitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know Them . Wait till you 've had to deal with Them as long as I have , and you wo n't be surprised at anything in the world They might do , Anything " She maintained a similar attitude toward her pupils . They were merely glorified house-boys , stupid and naughty and thievish . They would not behave properly no matter how kind you might be to Them . All of them were the same . AII , that is , but Henry . She had always thought vaguely of Henry as a nice boy  --  he was thirty-five , but they were all boys to her  --  since she had first replied to his advertisement for an English instructor and had met him . I Really , he knew quite a lot of English , but he was ambitious . He did n't have to study , yet he applied himself most earnestly to his work . Also he seemed to appreciate her knowledge and ability . Yes , Henry was a nice boy , and she repeated the statement to herself firmly to explain and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at sight of him so pale and picturesque in his long gown . A nice boy with nice manners . It was the thought of Henry which made her a little gentler , less waspish with her class during the following few days . Henry 's lesson hour was five to six on Mondays and Thursdays . Thursday morning she woke in good humor , and at five o'clock precisely she greeted him with cheerfulness . Alas , his lesson was not too good to-day : and he knew it . He apologized , gesturing with the book . " I waste your time , I have betrayed your faith , " he said shamefacedly . " I am not paying attention properly . Let us try again , if you will be so patient . " They tried again , but once more he stumbled and faltered , and his voice failed him . " It is no use , " he said , " obviously I have not studied and practiced enough . I must beg you to forgive me . " " That 's quite all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arline 's voice . " I expect they 're keeping you very busy at the bank ? " " Not this time ; I have not that excuse . I have allowed a small personal matter to interfere with my work , that is all . I have been wrong . It will not occur again . " " Anything troubling you ? " she asked briskly . " What 's on your mind ? " He waved his hand deprecatingly ; his face wore a sort of pout . " My wife . She is not strong , and the weather ? " He caught himself up as though he had been indelicate . " Miss Petersen , it is nothing , and I have not the right to bore you . I shall go now and on Monday I trust I shall have improved . " " Poor little fellow , " thought Arline , watching him as he walked dejectedly down the lane . " Worrying about a woman like that . I always thought They treated Their women like dogs . I wonder what 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . " The boy was clearing away tea-cups when she turned again toward the room . Fumbling , he did something unusual for him  --  he dropped a plate . It smashed with a small chiming noise and the split fragments skidded across the carpet . He did the safest thing under the circumstances , stood with open mouth , waiting for a deluge of scolding and announcement of a fine to be taken from his wages . His ears almost shrank visibly from the storm . Arline looked thoughtfully at the broken dish , and her nerves tingled ; the muscles of her throat got ready for the tirade . Surprisingly , she hesitated . The boy still stood speechless after her first words . " Boy , " she said in a voice husky with unaccustomed mildness , " you be more careful . That plate good plate . You be more careful . " As in a dream she walked through the little room and on to the staircase , while he stared after her , " I 'll have to run along now , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to-day ; are n't I brave ? My husband had to fire the chauffeur only this morning ; he caught him squeezing on gas . Two dollars a week , my dear , that boy was stealing . He was giving us small money change instead of big money and I never thought to ask . Disgusting , is n't it ? " " Perfectly disgusting , " agreed Arline mildly . Flora waited for some elaboration of this promising theme , but as none was forthcoming she began to talk again . " I said we ought to make him pay it back or have him arrested ; two dollars a week since we hired him six weeks ago ! It 's awfully bad as an example to the others not to do anything more about it , I told Fred . " It was at this point that Arline made one of the treasonable remarks which her friends had lately been criticizing . " Oh well , " she said , " after all when you remember a dollar is only forty cents in money . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were a faint squeal . She looked oddly at Arline . " Do you think you 're quite well , dear ? " she asked suddenly . " Ought n't you be taking more of a rest ? You 've seemed just a little under the weather lately . " " Under the weather ? Nonsense , " said Arline in her old brusque manner . " Never felt better in my life . Whatever do you mean ? " Mrs. Stecnback smiled sweetly . " I did n't mean you do n't look well , my dear ; you always look wonderful  --  goodness knows how you do it in this climate . Well , I must be getting on or I 'll have to drive fast and there 'll be such a rush of cars going out to Frenchtown , and the way these Chinese drive , my dear , it 's an outrage . And there 's no telling what sort of meal the cook will have under way unless I take a look at what he 's doing , and check up . When you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'd rather do my own housework , honestly ! " " Yes , " said Arline , interested . " We all did of course at home , and we could again if we had to , could n't we ? " Mrs. Steenback stared again , then collected herself . " Well , good-by , dear . Remember it 's your turn to call me up . " Plump and powdered and daintily clean in figured voile , she trotted down the path to her little car . A crippled beggar in patched blue clothes which had faded out to gray leaned over the window of the car as she turned the key . Arline saw his horrible old mouth writhe about his yellow teeth , and imagined the familiar standardized whine in his voice as he droned out some senseless patter : " Missee , missee . Missee , missee . No Papa , no Mama . " She saw Mrs. Steenback 's pretty little wrinkled face set in stern lines of annoyance and disgust . The car roiled away , carrying with it Mrs. Steenback in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing children were left in the littered lane under the bleached blue sky . To Arline 's gaze it seemed that something had happened for the better in that dirty landscape ; the dainty little woman and the shiny little car had been in the way in that street , a mote in her eye . They were gone and everything was natural again . She sighed at these odd notions . " Boy ! " she called , " bring tea . One man . " " Have more tea , " urged Arline , but Henry shook his head . The piece of cake he had taken was broken but undevoured in crumbs on his plate . " Thank you , I have eaten much . It is time I go . You have been most kind . " " Kind ? Not a bit of it . I like these talks we have ; they 're interesting . " He made a modest gesture . " Why should you be interested ? These are not the things to interest foreigners . " " Oh , indeed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , all that about Chinese customs in the family and all those quaint old ideas . . . and I 'm so worried about your wife , poor thing . Is n't there some way to help her ? " Henry shrugged his shoulders . " What can one do ? She was never meant to bear children and now she has had three daughters and it is a great strain on her , and all for nothing , as she thinks . Of course she does not complain . Chinese women , " he said proudly , " are too well trained to complain against woman 's fate . I think now she should never have married . With her nature she would have remained quite happy in her father 's house . " " Poor thing , " said Arline , almost crooning . " Poor , poor thing . I wish I could do something to help . " She tried to reconstruct the small figure of Mrs. Kung in her mind . She failed . Mrs. Kung was just one of the women at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small snub nose and glasses and her black hair coiled in a knot low on her head . She was an earnest little body and a good person to put on committees . Arline now became possessed of a daring spirit , and she asked a question which had been on the tip of her tongue for some days . " Henry , you married quite young , did n't you ? Before you 'd been educated how to look at these things , I mean . I mean , Chinese people usually marry young , do n't they ? " " Yes , " said Henry , " naturally we do , because we believe in marriage . I married before I went abroad for my education . My wife was only eighteen at the time . My parents were opposed to the marriage ; but parents always oppose what their children want , and we were determined . " He sighed . " I see now they were right . In a way I am responsible then for her illness . But she desired many children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arline nodded . " I can understand that . I can understand a man 's forgetting his wife 's side of it . A man has his own life aside from his family , especially if he 's a studious kind of man who likes poetry and  --  all that sort of thing , the better kind of thing . I can understand . " " My dear lady , " said Henry , very prettily , " you understand everything . " Arline flushed with delighted confusion . " I have never talked so much with a foreigner , " he continued . " It is not only that I feared to be uninteresting . But here vee do not  --  how can I say it without offending you ? ? we do not feel at home with foreigners . " " Of course not , " said Arline warmly . " You 've been tricked and bullied and ill-treated by us for years . " " Oh , no . No , " said Henry , as if in pain at such an idea . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Except such rare people as yourself , Miss Petersen . " " And you , Henry . " They both bowed with great courtesy over the teacups . " It is so difficult to overcome the barrier of race , " Henry continued thoughtfully . " I have hoped to have such a friendship with a foreigner , for I believe friendship should he possible . But I have never really expected to achieve it . " " We 've done it , have n't we ? " demanded Arline . Henry 's pale face lit up with a smile . " We have indeed , " he said . " I want you to promise me something , " she continued . " If ever anything bothers you or makes you happy or makes any difference to you at all , I wish you 'd tell me about it just as if I were your friend  --  another Chinese man . Do you promise ? " " I need not promise , " said Henry . " You honor me too much . I shall certainly confide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in you , " said Arline . Almost she dared ask him to give her his hand on it . Henry 's hands were fascinating , long delicately-boned fingers , and hairless and soft-skinned but strong . They looked all that . However , she refrained . " I thank you from the bottom of my heart , and I shall trust you implicitly , " said Henry . Again they bowed . " I 've invited Gracie and Mrs. Miller and Dorothy O'Brien , " said Mrs. Steen-back , " and all the others . " Arline stirred herself to show some interest . " I thought Madge had gone to Weihaiwei . I saw it somewhere in the paper the other day . " " Yes , she has . " Mrs. Steenback frowned fretfully . " It 's a nuisance , my dear , what with you being so busy lately and now Madge has gone , I 've quite fallen into the habit of having Hattie Sutterlee . Of course I do n't mind for myself , but some of The Girls are being a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one to do for bridge if you begin to be so particular and listen to what they all say ? Let them invite a few full tables before they begin to talk , that 's what I feel like telling them . " Arline stared absently at the fly-spotted menu . She had been coaxed into coming downtown for lunch , and neither the disspirited fan that revolved above the table nor her watery iced tea was compensation . She wanted her own dark dining room where she could lunch alone and think . Snit she made an effort to catch up with the subject . " What 's the matter with Hattie What'sher-name ? " she asked . Flora glanced at her suspiciously . " You know perfectly well what I mean ; I told you , though I 'd never have guessed for myself if Fred had n't put me on to it when I first came out . Not that it shows on Hattie except around the eyes if you look very closely . Her mother was probably not pure Chinese . Poor Hattie , how awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a very thoughtless man , to say the least . " Years of hiding the fact that she was not thinking had made of Arline 's face an adequate mask for thoughts . " I guess Hattie gets along all right , " she said mildly . Flora put down her ice-cream spoon and stared . " Why , Arline Petersen ! Everybody knows Sutterlee would n't have looked at her if it had n't been for the money . And you notice they do n't have any children ; quite right too . Of course I do n't mind Hattie the way some people do ; I always say she ca n't help it , and of course she ca n't . Only it 's a pity . " " Well , " said Arline , sipping at the wash they called tea , " I think she gets along . Perhaps it 's interesting to have a foot in each world . This East-West business is a lot of old-fashioned foolishness if you ask me . " Flora 's face became a narrow unpleasant pattern . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Iong time , " she began , crisply . She took a deep breath . " There 's talk about you . You 're getting some awfully funny ideas , goodness knows where . Probably in that school of yours . Any time a respectable person opens his mouth in common decent criticism of a Chinaman , you 're down his throat . What 's the matter with you , Arline ? It 's all very well , all this talk about fraternizing with Them , but let me tell you one thing , from a woman who knows this country , there is n't one of Them would n't sell you out as soon as look at you . Fred says he would n't trust one of Them round the corner . I 've been making allowances for you because you 're just a girl with no husband to look after you , but . . . " Arline 's mottled cheeks had taken on an apoplectic hue , and Mrs. Steenback paused in fright at what she had done . The schoolteacher pushed back her chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she sputtered . " What earthly right have you  --  going around giving advice when it 's not asked  --  people like you  --  no wonder the Chinese hate us  --  smug , conceited , overbearing foreigners  --  no understanding of the troubles  --  Christian charity . . . " She found coherence at last . " I 'm through with you , Flora Steenback , " she announced . " You can get somebody else for your bridge club and all the rest of it . I may be an old maid . . . " " Oh , Arline ! " gasped Flora , remorseful . " I may be an old maid , but I 've got my own ideas and I 'm going to stick up for them , " said Arline Petersen , and walked out of the tea-shop . " These people have no conception of friendship , " said Arline definitely . " They ca n't understand that two people can have a real friendship without things like race and , well , sex , interfering between them . " Henry nodded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what do they really know about China ? They live here year after year and do n't even try to understand the country where they earn their living ! Or their husbands earn their living for them . . . I ca n't understand these women who never think about anything but bridge ; such women disgust me . No understanding , no natural intellectual curiosity . " Henry nodded again , thinking of far-off things . " For instance if I should try to tell Flora Steenback about your marriage customs , she just would n't listen ; she would n't be interested . Now I think it 's one of the most fascinating things about the Chinese the way they look at marriage , almost the same as the French do . So utilitarian , so sensible . The Chinese are practical . " Henry began to pay more attention . " It is true , " he assented eagerly . The modern Chinese , when he hears about matrimonial ideals in America , is --  -- how shall I say  --  mystified and confused . Why this childish romanticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love his wife , the mother of his children , but what has that to do with his life outside his home ? He must have his friends and his interests . The Chinese wife knows this and devotes herself to her children , as she should . " He stopped for breath , not for words . His English had become much more fluent since he had lost his self-consciousness with Arline ; the lessons were turning into conversational hours . " Of course , of course , " said his teacher emphatically . " Mental stimulation . Fresh contacts . People who understand . " " Exactly , " said Henry . " Most Chinese wives know this and are content . It works out very well . Why not ? It has worked for centuries . " " Yet if I should try to tell Flora Steen-back . . . " began Arline . Henry suddenly smiled impishly . " Do n't try to tell her , " he counselled . " It will be our secret . " Summer grew fierce , reigned a space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , and in his peculiar way more beautiful . Arline , having cut herself off from most of her old circle , spent long afternoons alone in her house waiting for him to come and talk to her . She went out only on shopping trips , and discovered something interesting in the faces of people she passed in the street ; the set of their eyes reminded her in swift flashes of Henry , and sometimes a voice or a strange-sounding phrase made her wonder about his household , the people who worked for him . Did his wife cook ? Was he fond of his children ? He never spoke of them . No doubt he loved them and was bored by them , just a little . He did seem to enjoy his visits with her ; he had needed a place like that to relax in . How brilliant he was and what a new world she had found . Poor Flora . He came in one afternoon in late August , and there was no hint in his dignified bearing that a change was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it immediately , working up to it from a remark of Arline 's , which she had often made before , about confidence and trust . " Miss Petersen , " he said , " I think of you as my friend , and I remember promising to tell you of any important thing that might happen to me . " Arline was gratified and said so . She loved Henry 's stories . Sometimes when he talked it was as if she had left her small dark house and were moving with him through another world peopled by poets in long robes , smoking opium and having dreams which they allowed Arline Petersen to share . " I have been a lonely man , " said Henry . A premonitory thrill ran down Arline 's spine . " It would have been unbearable , save for your kindness , " he continued , " and I know you will rejoice with me . Miss Petersen , I am no longer lonely . Tomorrow I take a wife . " The world , poets and all , blew up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was shrill . " But you are married ! " Henry looked surprised . " Yes ? " he said gently . " Oh , I see . But the law  --  our law  --  allows me concubines . My wife understands . " He went on talking , seeing that some explanation was necessary to the nice Miss Petersen , who had hitherto always understood . His wife was not well . She was tired of bearing children . The other girl was a singsong girl and he had loved her unavailingly for some time . For months he had wooed her ; at last , the week . before , she had permitted him to give a dinner at her house . All his friends had attended ; the girl had sung for them , very prettily ; they had complimented Henry . To this wealth of ethnological detail Arline listened , but she was not appreciative . Only a very happy and oblivious man would not have noticed how unresponsive she was . Henry was that man . " Disgraceful , " said Flora Steenback . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , Arline . " " A dozen oranges every other day , " Arline swept on rapidly . " What I 'd been doing not to notice , I ca n't imagine . Why does the International Council allow such things to go on ? There ought to be some way to stop it . " " Remember , They get a rake-off from the tradespeople here when They buy from them , even when the stuff 's no good ; They understand one another , " said Flora , her voice trembling with eagerness . " Oh , you have to watch every step , dear . I know a few of Their tricks . When you break in this new one , be sure to make it plain that he ca n't do all his family washing with your soap . " " Well , I try to be reasonable , " said Arline , " but it gets on your nerves , yes it does , feeling how They 're around you all the time , watching , trying to get the better of you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just keep your eye on Them , dear . " Arline , oddly , began to cry . " I ca n't help it . No one could be expected to stand for it . It 's sickening . It follows you everywhere . . . . Excuse me , dear ; more tea ? Boy ' . Now where is that boy ? " Her voice rose in hysterical rage . " Oh , where is that boy ? Shall I ever get used to this horrible country ? Boy I Boy ! Boy ! "
