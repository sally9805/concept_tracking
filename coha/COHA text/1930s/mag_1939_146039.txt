Mrs. Roosevelt and the D. A. R. <P> Sirs : <P> Does TIME not err in announcing over and over in several recent issues TIME , March 6 et seq . that Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt has resigned from the D. A. R. because it did not allow Marian Anderson to appear at Constitution Hall ? <P> I am not a D. A. R. but in the interest of fairness was Mrs. Roosevelt a member ? I understood that she was not . That she was only an honorary member . <P> Also in the interest of fairness , is it not true that in Washington , as in all Southern cities there is a ruling . . . that no Negro may entertain in their first class halls ? . . . <P> MARGARET GORDON La Grande , Ore . <P> &gt; 1 ) Mrs. Roosevelt was a " life member at large " of the D. A. R. <P> 2 ) District of Columbia officials deny that there is any such ruling . - Ed . <P> First Lady 's Legs <P> Sirs : <P> I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed it . <P> I am disgusted with this last issue , April 17 . On p. 21 you speak of Mrs. Roosevelt , the First Lady of the land , whom we all respect and admire as " long-legged . " I am ashamed of you . <P> JULIA M. PECK Pompton Plains , N. J. &gt; TIME reported the facts. - ED . <P> Defenseless Feeling <P> Sirs : <P> I get the jitters every time I read in TIME , or the daily papers , the figures on the numerical strength of the U. S. Army . For example , the Detroit Free Press in a recent issue states that the U. S. has 185,000 men in its regular Army , and reserve forces of about 315,000 including the National Guard , whereas Germany , Italy and Japan have a combined active army of some 3,350,000 and reserves of about 16,000,000 . <P> It is not the status of our regular Army and Navy that gives me that defenseless feeling , it 's the lack of reserves , and this worry in turn raises the question of why can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve force ? <P> My guess is that the U. S. could have within one year a semi-trained , citizens ' voluntary reserve force of two or more million men at least , if official approval and public encouragement were given to such a movement . . <P> The social side of such a venture would not be unattractive as it would give married men an excuse for another night out a month , also enable all types of salesmen members to find new prospects and would probably increase the sales of the beer and pretzel businesses considerably . . . . <P> W. A. SWINGLE Detroit , Mich. &gt; When M ( Mobilization ) Day comes , the U. S. can throw 1,000,000 men into the field within 48 hours TIME , Aug. 22 . Backbone of this force would be the much maligned National Guard . - ED . <P> Suggestive <P> Sirs : <P> Re your article , " Hold Barred , " included in the Radio department of TIME , April 24 , be it known to you , sirs , that song lyrics need not be guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get themselves barred from the Great Chains . <P> I am co-author of a yearning song titled , You Set Me On Fire . It expresses the excruciating agonies of frustrated love . . . . Its lyrics are no more shocking than love is. ...
