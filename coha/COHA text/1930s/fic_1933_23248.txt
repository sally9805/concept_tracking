FOX HUNT AT CLONRUE BY LORD DUNSANY S S A THREAD of the warp in the weaving of cloth runs through all the threads of the woof , helping to bind them together , so runs the fox in Ireland through all our lives ; so that any man who is utterly unconcerned with the fox lives a little apart from the rest of us . Who such a man could be I do not know ; for , to begin with , no one owning poultry or turkeys can be quite immune from the fear of the footfall of that red visitor , inaudible on the stillest nights however closely you listen for it . And that is , I suppose , the original sin on account of which we hunt him , and it must have been to deal with those prowlings , too subtle for his own wits , that man first sought the help of his friend the dog in this matter . And , having sought it , this organization in defense of his poultry spread ramifications round the very heart of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of a fox stirs no more quickening of pulses than does the mention of guinea pigs ; but not in Ireland . For in the little Irish towns no man is so far into the dry waste of streets that the sounds of the hunt , from , say , in the south , can not reach him , and that some other pack on the northern side , passing the town 's edge , will bring him running out to see the red coats go by , and to feed his memory with the things that the pavement can never give . And so we give you the toast from our Irish shores : The Fox ( death to him ! ) , may he live forever . And nearly two hundred of us concerned in this matter were jogging now in the direction of Clonrue , with the hills at first on our left as we rode along at the feet of them , and then almost behind us when we had turned to our right . And who was not concerned in it First of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve miles round , and as many of their daughters as a horse could be found for ; then we had from a rather smaller area as many of the farmers as had a horse that could carry them ; soldiers , squireens , a few strangers , grooms , second horsemen , and men with young horses of which they had hopes that they had not named to anyone , but who , as a young girl sometimes looks to Heaven , far and yet not unattainable , looked to the Grand National . There were no priests at the meet , because they are forbidden to hunt , though not forbidden to ride ; and of course if they meet with hounds while they are riding , it is no sin to go the same way with them . All the priests in that part of the county were out riding that morning along the road under the hills from Gurraghoo to Clonrue . It was a long jog to Clonrue , over five miles : that is the beauty of Irish coverts , there are usually so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way to go to the next one ; and there was a wood of wild osiers beyond Clonrue near the bog , an almost certain draw . All the way as we went that fervor leaped up among all who saw us pass , a fervor for the quest not limited to those that were taking part in it ; men , women , children , and dogs were all awakened from other pursuits to let their thoughts soar up from their own fields and then to sail with us over the gray-green plain , now shining in sunlight far away from those hills . And if any say that our quest was not worthy of this awakening , I can only say in argument that perhaps whatever awakens us to any vivid intensities needs no other test of its worth ; but in evidence I can say this on oath , that I have seen the emptiness of many things , like a white damp wall of mist closing roads to the spirit utterly , but never yet have I noticed it in a fox hunt . Certainly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open , even the less presumptuous hope of being there before the tumultuous gathering at that furious feast was over , was as bright a splendor to me as could be the hope of any statesman to see the ruin of his enemy 's land with all its fortresses fallen . And so we moved to Clonrue till the hills were gray behind us , and the voices of dogs warning Gurraghoo that something strange was afoot were faint cries adding a weirdness to the solitude of those fields . And the dogs that guarded the houses of Clonrue took up the cry . And , among those that waited to watch our coming by , the first that I saw was Marlin . He was standing dark against one of the white walls , with a look in his eyes such as inspiration might have , as he gazed at the young girls riding there and at young well-mounted men and the young horses . And I saw then , once for all , that quiet age and calm and repentance , and at last Heaven , were none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from all of them , he would only look for such glories as youth can give , and would always yearn for that land whose history wasthe dreams of the young and that knew nought of salvation . And farther down the street we saw Mrs. Marlin , leaning upon a stick that was , rather , a crooked pole , with wisps of her dark hair hanging about the sides of her face ; her eyes watched us intensely , and more than the watchful dogs she seemed to be guarding Clonrue . Or perhaps Clonrue was but her outpost , and she watched for the sake of the bog , or for the sake of that land that lay under the frown of the bog , where her cottage stood and through which the river ran , where the gnarled willows leaned , a stretch of earth that always seemed to me strangely enchanted . What desecration she feared for this land I do not know , but she eyed us intently and showed no sign of enmity . " Shall we find in the sallies , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's waiting for you , " she said . " Will he give us a good run ? " I asked . " To Clonnabrann , " said she . I have often thought of those words and , looking back on them after all these years , and with the experience that years must bring , it seems to me now that , as every cottager thereabouts knew , a strong dog-fox lived in those sallies ; a southwest wind was blowing and , running down-wind as they do , Clonnabraim would be right ahead of him if he could get so far . To say , therefore , that he would get as far as Clonnabrann was no more than an estimate of his strength by one of those on whose chickens he nightly dined . There was a silence as the hounds went into the wood , a silence that hung heavily for what seemed a long time ; then one hound whimpered ; silence again , and then the whole pack gave tongue . We were all lined up on the bog side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for if he went over the bog none but the hounds could follow him . And there we waited for a sign from the master that we could let our impatient horses out . A mild man , as I have seen him in a drawing-room , the master , almost shy at a tea-table ; but on a horse the owner of a fiery tongue that held his field in awe , as his whip-lash held his hounds . Only for a few seconds he held us back ; I remember the waving line of horses ' heads ; I remember a patch of gorse at the edge of the wood , whose buds had already burst into two small blossoms ; then we were off . We used to have big fields out in those days , and for a hundred yards or so it was like a race ; and then each rider began to settle down to deal with his own difficulties , to cross each fence in accordance with the capacity of his horse , and to take a line in accordance with his estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different men for different reasons , of which these are three : because he is a masterly rider , because he is close to his own home , or because he is going in the opposite direction to what appears the right one . Before following the third kind one should know something of the man ; but if he is reasonably intelligent he must have some strong motive for turning away from the rest . I remember the first few fences to this day : the first of all a narrow bank five feet high , built of earth as thin and steep as earth will stand , and green with sods : it seemed impossible that it would not trip up a horse galloping at it , as it would have tripped up me if I had tried to clear it on foot . But I was forgetting the four hooves . Other horses cleared it , mine was hard to hold , and I let him go at it . He rose at it , touched the top , or near it , for a moment paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind me . The next was a narrow stream , with sides steep as those of a ditch , clear water that had cut its way through thesoft black earth . As I rode at it a man that I did not know called out , " Not there , Master Charles . " And I followed him , trotting along the bank . " Boggy landing , " he said . Soon we came to a place at which the far bank sloped , and there he plunged in . It was deep water , and the bank on the far side seemed nearly liquid , but the horse struggled up , and I followed . We came next to a double , a great bank thrown up from two ditches , and twelve feet high , with small trees growing along the top of it . It looked an impossible obstacle , but others had been before me through the stream and were now crossing the double in several places , cantering slowly at it and jumping as high as the horse could reach and doing the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sight .. So I checked my horse and jumped where another hail jumped before me , and he easily found a foothold in the soft turf for his hind legs , while his forelegs reached the top . With a heave we were there . Looked down on , the far ditch seemed wider than the near , wider indeed than could be jumped from a standstill , but you ca n't go back from the top of a double , so I left it all to my horse . He approached it as cats approach a garden from the top of the garden wall ; he went down and down the steep bank till I thought he would slip to the bottom , and just as this seemed certain be sprang , and we easily reached the field on the far side . For a moment from the top I had seen the hounds , going over a field together , and somehow reminding me of the shadows of clouds drifting over the flashing grass on a windy day . The next fence we came to was an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we were leaving the country of white loose stones from which they built it , a stone wall . We went fast at it and my horse hit it hard , but it made no difference , FOX HUNT for the stones flew with a rattle , and we were in the same field with the hounds . From patches of bracken and gorse , and pale gray stones sometimes as large as sheep , we looked to a wide plain stretching for miles in the sunlight , with large green fields and having a tended air . It was as though that loose stone wall that I had crossed were a boundary between the last of the things of the wild , lying behind us , and Earth subdued by man , lying before . Bog and the rough lands were behind us now , and the turf good for going ; the pace increased . Shall I breathe air again that is like that air that I breathed as I galloped down to the bright vale gathering sunlight ? What vintage in what golden and jewelled cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we galloped , so that we breathed it like giants quaffing wine ; and whenever one lifted one 's eyes from the fields and the fences , the rim of the plain far off shone gold as a godlike cup . Shall I ever breathe it again ? And the priest in this foreign town tells me not to think of these things any longer ; the time being come for thinking more of my soul . But he is not an Irishman , and has only ridden a mule . The time came for holding back my horse a bit . Hitherto I had Ieft the pace , and most things , to him , as knowing more about the business than I did ; but as I saw that wide valley opening to the horizon , and not a wood in sight , and hounds pouring away down the valley , it came to me that we were in for a long hunt . The horse was pulling still , but I held him back now , and there was the place for doing it ; for , riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was such a clear view of hounds , or at any rate of the hunt , that by riding straight where they turned a little one easily made up the ground that one lost while resting one 's horse . And I did then AT CLONRUE Q71 too what I have done ever since : if there was a gap or an open gate I rode for it , rather than tire my horse by the display of jumping a fence . There were plenty of fences ahead of us and , if I could get over all the fences I had to jump , I should have jumping enough . I think I had learned already , from noticing the effect on my horse 's festive spirits , that jumping one fence tires a horse more than galloping across two fields . It is strange that during this hunt I thought of the Marlins , but the green and tidy country to which we were coming was so unlike the wild willows about their cottage , and then the bog and those watery levels shining on its horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams of Marlin , that the very contrast made me think of them . The thought came to me that they would look fantastic among these tidier fields , and then it occurred to me that was leaving the country I knew and riding among landmarks that I had never seen before . And still the fox ran straight with the southwest wind behind him . Sometimes we had news of him . A countryman shouted , " A fine big dog fox . " " How long is he gone ? " called out the Master , galloping by . " A fine great dog fox , glory be to God , " replied the countryman . " Ikw long is he gone ? " shouted the Master again . But an excited man can not easily hear what is shouted among galloping horses . " Big as a lion , " shouted the countryman . And the hunt swept on . And then we came to wilder country again where brown lands , marshy and rushy , intruded amongst the green . For a while we saw no houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles were wide bog-drains . A small neat cottage appeared , thatched and white-walled , with a tiny garden beside it . We went by within a few yards of it , and a man and a woman came out and an astonished dog . Perhaps they would have seen three or four men or women pass that way in a week , and suddenly there were two hundred galloping by . For a while that lonely spot was populous , then it would be silent again . What did they make of us ? Only the thoughts of their dog could one be sure of . And his sole thought was defense , his duty to that white cottage . Then the green fields again , of the grazing country ; hedges and trees once more . I had no idea where I was . We saw a river shining , large enough to have a name that one must have known . But what it was I knew not . I was now a long way from home . My horse was going well but dropping back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Sweat was white on the horses wherever straps touched them . And then came our first check . It was very welcome to me . I came up to the field in which hounds were nosing thoughtfully , and dismounted at once . Almost immediately we were on again , but my horse was probably fresher for those moments of quiet breathing , and I had all that distance in hand from the head to the tail of the hunt , toward which I could drop back slowly as my horse tired . For I realized now , if had not done so before , that only by taking the utmost care of my horse should I see the end of this hunt which had come so far already and which gave rise to wonderful hopes that it might be one of those events that , though seldom told of in books , are topics of conversation in counties for years , and rare gold in old memories . There were no longer clusters in gateways , with steam welling up from the horses into one column ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the hunt on horses that could do no more , horses with no more foam on their necks , but looking as if they had just been bathed all over in mud and water , which several of them had . One had to be careful whom one followed now , for fear he was turning home . These must have been riders heavier than I was , which is likely enough at my age ; it can hardly have been that they had not recognized as soon as I had , with all my inexperience , that this was going to be a long hunt , unless the words that I had with the witch could really have taught me anything . The short evening was beginning to wear away . There was no more rest for my horse in the gaps in high hedges , where one had earlier to take one 's turn among twenty or thirty ; one crossed alone now or followed one other . But one was closer to hounds without these delays and able to go easier . And still my horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those in front of me were cut clear and dry . The late light hovering at the close of day seemed to overarch a calm through which we galloped , as dreams might glide through the still of a summer 's night ; and I remembered a heathen religion of northern lands that told of endlessly riding through everlasting twilight . From this thought I turned away , but it came back more than once . What the time was I did not know , but it must have been after four , and that meant we must have been galloping over two hours . The meet had been at eleven , but we had not moved off till after the half-hour ; then we had spent some time going up to the gorse-covert and drawing it blank , and it was nearly a quarter to one by the time we returned to the village . From Gurraghoo to the covert beyond Clonrue had taken us over an hour , and the fox had left about two o'clock . The fences at first had seemed things to watch and pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , when the time must be coming near when one 's horse would fall at one of them and lie still , breathing heavily , now they seemed no more than those strange old furrows lying wide and green , the relic of ancient plowing , that one sometimes meets in a field . And as every fence was passed that same joy rose like a flame , the same exultation at an obstacle passed and the chance of being up at the end of the hunt brought nearer . Still the hounds ran with the southwest wind behind them . A little more and the fading light would add so much to our difficulties that any fence would beat us . And suddenly above the bare green fields , and clear of hedges and trees , I saw a small town shining on a hill , in light that was flung up there from the last of the sunset . A row of houses below , then two streets running up the sides of the hill ; all the town white ; and , set among those two streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's summit . I did not know that except in old pictures of Italy towns were built like this upon hills . Certainly I never thought of seeing one , but believed that they belonged to poetry or romance , or to times long past or countries far away . Hounds were going straight for the hill ; if I went round it , in the fading light I should lose them , but a hill at the end of that eighteen or twenty miles was more than my horse could do . Heaven and earth seemed against us , light fading and the land sloping . It was time to pull out and turn home ; and I should not see the end of that wonderful hunt . And suddenly in my dejection a strange thought struck me , so that I reined back to a slow canter and soon lost sight of hounds , but I watched instead the white walls of the houses that were gleaming along the hill . I took two more fences , open ditches , and just got across . And suddenly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going up the slope to the houses . Then the hounds . He seemed making straight for the streets : what shelter he looked for there I could not imagine . And then the hounds got him . The master and two whips were there when I came up , and eight or nine others . The dead fox had already been taken from the hounds by the master , and his head and brush removed , but I was in time to see the rest of him thrown back to them , and to hear their voices change to that deep roar to the tune of which a fox is torn in pieces and eaten . Then one by one a hound with a bit of a leg or a rib walked away from the rest to eat his morsel alone ; and the whips with their ruddy faces looked on with a deep contentment , faces that nearly matched the skirts of their coats , which the sweat of horses and the water of ditches were gradually turning to the color of fuchsias . Now window after window up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour of the steaming kettle , of warmth and the gathering of families ; but doors opened and children came running out down the hill , and soon they were gazing at all these strangers , by now twenty or thirty of us , who had come from they knew not where , tired and triumphant , and bad brought a new way of life to their very doors . I have had , like other men , my ups and downs ; Fate has given me much and taken much away ; but that day Fate gave me the brush . From the hand of the master I had it , the brush of the finest fox that was known in all that country for many a year . I have it still , what is left of it , in the very room in which I write , and many an argument I have with Monsieur Alphonse , who says that to keep this tail of a fox , now in such poor repair , shows that I am no serious politician . Nor am I , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because I have never known him really serious himself , and because I would burn every political paper of both of us if in the smoke of that burning I could see by any necromancy some vision of the hunt that we rode that day across twenty miles of some of the finest pasture of the old Ireland I knew . There it hangs on the wall , and I turn from it once again to the scene that still shines in my memory : the whips collecting the hounds together again , men climbing up again onto tired horses , the children gazing silently , the town above us now glowing with lights , and I turning round and asking its name as we rode slow down the hill . " Clonnabrann , " sang the children . SOLDIER BY C. T. LANHAM T HE stars swing down the western steep , And soon the east will burn with day , And we shall struggle up from sleep And sling our packs and march away . In this brief hour before the dawn Has struck our bivouac with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron wreath of deadly fame . I see the fatal phalanx creep , Like death , across the world and back , With eyes that only strive to keep Bucephalus ' immortal track . I see the legion wheel through Gaul , The sword and flame on hearth and home , And all the men who had to fall That Ccesar might be first in Rome . I see the horde of Genghis Khan Spread outward like the dawn of day To trample golden Khorasan And thunder over fair Cathay . I see the grizzled grenadier , The dark dragoon , the gay hussar , Whose shoulders bore for many a year Their little emperor 's blazing star . I see these things , still am I slave When banners flaunt and bugles blow , Content to fill a soldier 's grave For reasons I shall never know .
