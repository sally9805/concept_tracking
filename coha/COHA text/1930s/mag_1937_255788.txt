At its triennial convention nine years ago the Protestant Episcopal Church appointed a Commission on Marriage &; Divorce to whittle down its Canon 41 , which stoutly enjoined Episcopal pastors from solemnizing the marriages of divorced persons . Under the chairmanship of Michigan 's grey and liberal Bishop Herman Page , the commission consists of sixteen churchmen and laymen including Colorado 's Bishop Irving Peake Johnson , Missouri 's Bishop William Scarlett , longtime Director of the Russell Sage Foundation John Mark Glenn , onetime ( 1917-21 ) U. S. Ambassador to Japan Roland Sletor Morris , and Justice Origen S. Seymour of the Connecticut Court of Common Pleas . Three years later the commission persuaded the Church to split Canon 41 for the first time , by permitting pastors to remarry a ) the innocent party in a divorce for adultery , b ) those who had secured annulments for any of nine premarital impediments. * At the 1934 convention the commission made no further requests but reported " progress .

When the commission released its report last week , it gave many a right-thinking Episcopalian a ruder jolt than he expected . To Canon 41 the commission recommended a simple amendment : " Any person whose former marriage has been dissolved for any cause by a civil court may , after the expiration of one year from the granting of the divorce , apply to the bishop of his or her diocese for permission to marry another person ; and nothing in this Canon shall deprive the bishop of his ecclesiastical power to permit such remarriage , if , , in equity and good conscience , he shall choose so to do . " <P> Crying that this would place unprecedented discretionary power in the hands of bishops , the High Episcopal organ , The Living Church , asked with heavy sarcasm : " Why not repeal the Canon altogether and set up a new one : ' Communicants of this church shall not ordinarily be permitted to have more than one husband or wife at the same time ?

Desert , Me. : " It is the report of a very one-sided committee . . . . Those who are married by the Church are still requited to say ' till death us do part . ' " <P> For his colleagues Justice Seymour placidly observed : " There is very little chance it will pass . But it is on its way , and three years from now it will stand that much better chance of being approved . " One purpose of the amendment , he explained , was to safeguard the rights of remarriage of innocent parties in adultery cases who squeamishly bring suits on such grounds as " excessive cruelty . " When it was pointed out to him that under the amendment bishops would be free to authorize the remarriage of divorced adulterers as well , Justice Seymour snapped : " Why , no bishop would do that .
