THE MIND AND SOCIETY - Vilfredo Pareto-Harcourt , Brace ( 4 vols. , $20 ) . <P> When in 1921 Professor James Harvey Robinson wrote approvingly of the work of Vilfredo Pareto in his The Mind in the Making , few U. S. readers had heard the name of that eminent Italian sociologist or knew what sort of ideas he had advanced in his nine fat volumes . Widely recognized in Europe as a social scientist of great originality and erudition , as a vigorous commentator on world affairs in French and Italian newspapers , as professor of political economy at the University of Lausanne , Pareto 's transatlantic reputation grew slowly after his death in 1923 and was almost entirely limited to academic circles . Last week Professor Arthur Livingston looked upon the publication of his translation of Pareto 's four-volume masterwork as the realization of 15 years of " dreams and efforts , " the fruit of 9,000 hours of personal toil , a triumph over international difficulties , and claimed the honor of having been the first to publish a U. S. note on Pareto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English of his subtle and difficult writing . <P> Few may follow Translator Livingston 's example and read The Mind and Society 20 times ; few may find it , as he does " the most significant book I have ever read without any exception whatsoever . " But most readers will agree that the translation of so long and intricate a work , packed with cross-references , diagrams , mathematical equations , footnotes in many languages , quotations from modern and classical writers , represents a superb scholarly accomplishment . <P> The difficulties in translating Pareto date from 1922 , when Publishers Alfred Harcourt and Donald Brace attempted to secure translation rights from Pareto 's Italian publisher , dickered until 1926 before they discovered that the Italian publisher did not control translation rights , that the publisher of a French translation controlled only French rights , that Pareto 's widow alone could give them the world rights in English . With an agreement for world rights sealed and signed , with Professor Livingston started on the translation , it was discovered that a tentative translation of most of the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oberlin College , working with Professor James Harvey Rogers , who only thought of translation rights when the work was almost finished . After more negotiations Professor Bongiorno 's draft was turned over to Translator Livingston , and five years later a faithful translation of the text , of the footnotes that made up a third of the entire work of 2,033 pages , was completed . More than a year was required for reading proof , checking references , making the 100-page index . <P> Estimates of the permanent value of Pareto 's contribution to human thought range from the extravagant claims of disciples who rank him with Newton and Aristotle to the deprecations of Socialists who consider him a borrower from Marx and Sorel and damn him as the philosopher of Italian Fascism , whose appearance he predicted . Although Mussolini was inspired by Pareto , and made him a Senator , Translator Livingston doubts that Pareto approved of Mussolini or Fascismo , feels that his remarks when Mussolini took power were the expressions of a prophet 's " I told you so ! ' ' satisfaction .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
