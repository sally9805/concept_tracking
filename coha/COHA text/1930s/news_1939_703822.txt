txt qwq The church dispensed its blessing . But there was a special dispensation , accepted with gratitude by the attendant throng , in the form of Spring 's most brilliant sunshine and its blandest breezes , caressing the man-made isle in San Francisco Bay which President Roosevelt designated as " our newest insular possession . " Before some 100,000 witnesses ? swelled to the proportions of millions , presumably , through the medium of a national radio hook-up ? the program got under way tardily , but , once started , proceeded smoothly . Among the multitudes clustering for hours in the vast plaza before the Federal building , known as the Court of Nations , rumors that Governor Culbert L. Olson had become ill and could not appear were dispelled by his ' arrival an hour late , Both men , in morning clothes with gardenias in their coat lapels , had ordained that this preliminary ceremony , scheduled for 10:30 A. M. , could well be postponed to dovetail more closely with the noon formalities . It all worked well . The unlocking ceremony over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , they climbed back into their open car and swooped out of the Court of Reflections into the wide roadway that swings in a broad arc , riding around to the reviewing stand , where the other dignitaries waited . It was nearly noon . This was the moment for which the throngs had waited . For this the San Franciscans , who limped home late last night on weary feet , had risen in the cool gray dawn , and converged by the thousands on the old ferry building at the foot of Market Street , shining with new lumber and fresh paint in honor of the day . Citizens in Carnival Garb For this moment the loyal citizens had donned their carnival garb again , a brave show and a heartening one as the living tide streamed onto the ferryboats which moved the crowds across the Bay , 2,000 at a time , at ten-minute intervals . There were few hitches and no traffic snarls . Those who chose to go by automobile used the magnificent new Bay bridge , which is one of the chief factors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not all lead to Yerba Buena Island and thence to the exposition , so that some who found themselves in the wrong lane had to continue on for the four miles more to Oakland . Ferries were , by all odds , tha popular transportation . Along with a few sedate and unimaginative visitors who wore no costumes they carried full quotas of forty-niners. cowboys and cowgirls , caballeros and senoritas , pirates with fierce and pointed mustaches and Vandyke beards , unself-conscious belles in taffeta hoopskirts in pastel colors and bands of strolling musicians who clicked their castanets or strummed their banjos with gusto at the slighest provocation . There was even a troupe of Scotch bagpipers and dancers in black and red plaid kilties. who obliged with the Highland fling at intervals . Crowds Handled Smoothly Five ferry slips at Treasure island received this exodus from the city , the arriving and departing crowds being smothly shuttled past each other up different ramps without interference . Equally smoothly the visitors filed through the turnstiles without a pause to find their passage through the grounds expedited by the spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As by common consent , or through the efficient operation of the official guide service , the arriving thousands passed through the numerous archways under the imposing elephant gates and into the wide esplanade dominated by the 80-foot symbolic statue of Pacifica , hands upraised in salute and in greeting . Behind the gigantic figures shimmered and swayed the gleaming disks which form a metal curtain , gently undulating in the breeze , against the wall of the building which is the theme center , of ' the exposition . At the feet of the goddess splashes a huge circular fountain reminiscent of Versailles . Beyond that , her sightless gaze contemplates the majestic Court of the Seven Seas , a vista of high pillars draped with vertical pennants of white and blue down to the steep and slender spire that constitutes the Tower of the Sun . This way the crowd went , still en masse . A turn sharp left at the end of this avenue faced the multitudes to the east toward the Arch of Triumph and the shallow , lovely pool from which the Court of Reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nations , toward the mainland side of Treasure Island , where the Federal Building hugs the shore . Speeches of Officials Are Brief There President Cutler , with the assistance of Mayor Angelo J. Rossi of the hostess city ; Daniel C. Roper , former Secretary of Commerce ; George Creel , the United States commissioner , and others conferred the exposition on the remainder of the country and the world . Climaxing as it did a period of some five years of labor and of preparation , the formal noon-time ceremony seemed of abbreviated scope . Each of the speakers managed to pack his sentiments and felicitations into a space of minutes which orators of an earlier day would have rejected with disdain . But the whole lacked nothing of dignity or of pageantry . There was the simple declaration by Governor Olson , touched with a consciousness of the unrest in other parts of the world , and inviting the universe to participate in this festival of peace and of commemoration of progress . " We here on the shore of the Pacific , finding peace and progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our common welfare , are shocked by the horrors of war and threats of wars from which our fellow-beings are suffering in foreign lands , " he said . Olson Calls for World Peace " We pray for world peace , which can only come through assertion by the people themselves , who are being led to war against each other , of a determination to replace warlike leaders by representative governments devoted to disarmament and peaceful settlement of territorial and economic disputes . " As Governor of the great , sovereign State of California , and on behalf of her people , I bid the world welcome on this opening of our wonderful exposition . " There was drama , too , a spinetingling , throat-tightening interval of utter stillnes in that sea of spectators , brought to their feet almost in one motion as the exposition band , in scarlet uniforms trimmed with gold , blared forth the first notes of the national anthem . A great flag , its colors vividly fresh , rode majestically up the fiftyfoot mast , and billowed into the ? wind above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every hat was off , every tongue silent . To the right of the reviewing stand , drawn up in double file , stood detachments of marines and sailors from the airplane carrier Saratoga , which arrived last night in the Bay ; to the left , a similar corps of khakiclad troops , the Thirtieth United States Infantry stationed at the Presidio , and at right angles to them a corps from the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth Infantry , National Guard , assigned to the fair for one day . Archbishop Invokes Blessing One after another , the celebrities on the rostrum stepped to the loud speakers for their addresses . First came the Most Rev. John Joseph Mitty , Archbishop of San Francisco , to invoke God 's blessing on the work of man . Atholl , chairman of the board of directors of the fair , saluted his co-workers who created it . Fernando Berckmyer , dean of the Consular Corps at San Francisco , representing Peru , was spokesman for all his colleagues , proclaiming himself proud indeed ' to voice the congratulations of forty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congregation Emanuel , and by the Rt . Rev. Edward L. Parson , Bishop of California , augmented the petition of Archbishop Mitty , and former Secretary Roper , personal representative of President Rosevelt pleased the Westerners mightily when he said : " The Atlantic seaboard may have been the cradle of America , but it was in the vast stretches this side of the Rockies that the infant republic grew up and put on bone and sinew . " There is also the added consideration that today the great western empire is second to no other section of the country in its contribution to the prosperity and permanence of the nation . " Then from Key West , Fla. , where he was about to board the cruiser Houston for a review of the fleet , there came through ' the microphones the voice of the President of the United States , in greeting and in congratulation : " Although I have commissioned Mr. Roper to act and speak for me in the ceremonies that mark the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition , I can not forego this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From what I saw with my own eyes last July , I can well imagine the beauty of the completed undertaking , and I look forward with eagerness to the visit this coming Summer that I have promised myself . " Newest Insular Possession " " Treasure Island , with an area of more than 400 acres , is America 's newest insular possession . It is an outstanding example of territorial extension without aggression . " In wishing the exposition all possible success , the President declared in closi : " It is as an instrument of international good-will as well as an expression of the material and cultural progress of our West and of our Pacific Ocean neighbors . " Not only the massed thousands assembled in the Court of the Nations heard the President 's message , transmitted through the loud speaker system linking all the patios , avenues and plazas throughout the grounds . It reached the Port of the Trade Winds to the south , from whence the clipper ships of the Pan American Airways rise for their long ? flights to the Orient ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thousands streaming in , and , north , to the parking and the recreation areas , many blocks distant from the scene of the ceremonies where the majority of the younger generation had turned promptly for diversions . Chorus Gives the Theme Song There were musical interludes in the official program , as when the Thirtieth United States Infantry Band , concluding a brisk and martial concert preliminary to the broadcast , put their hearts and their best efforts into " The Stars and Stripes Forever " ; when the exposition 's massed , mixed chorus lifted its soprano , alto , tenor and baritone voices in a rousing rendition of the theme song : " The Bells of Treasure Island . " Or when the Don Cossacks , stationed to one side of the officials on the platform , stood up to sing one of their deep-throated native melodies . A salvo of whistles from the boats in the bay provided an unscheduled obbligato to the noon-time exercises Over and through their screeching came the bonging of the bells of the carillon high up in the Tower of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , from on high , the thrumming roar of an airplane motor as one of the clipper ships circled and dipped its wings in salute . Hardly had the last period punctuated the final sentence of the dedicatory exercises than the throng shed formality , and flocked out of the plaza to investigate what this new playland had to offer in the way of amusement and of beauty . It found a plethora of each . The San Franciscons strolled through the major sections of the fair in that same spirit of geniality and jubilation that had sent them home last night all but exhausted . They had stayed up last night to witness the first full illumination of the island , when an electric impulse from the sun then shining at Bombay , India , automatically set off the chimes of the carillon , with the first motion setting off the switch controlling the lighting . Spectacle From the Hills From the city 's several hills so nearly perpendicular that . minus traffic , they might constitute a skiers ' paradise , the citizens had gasped in ecstasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them in its full refulgence . Tonight they saw what it all looks like from within those shining walls . The fair is dedicated mainly to mark the completion of the giant bridges that now connect the peninsula of San Francisco with the Oakland region on the east , and with the main shore to the north across the Golden Gate . San Francisco regards the $35 , - 000,000 Golden Gate Bridge with affection , and the soaring $80,000,000 span across the bay , via Yerba Buena ( once less romantically but equally accurately called Goat Island ) , with appreciation tinged with awe . Its manifold towers , they confide impressively , rise nearly seven hundred feet , and its over-all distance stretches more than eight miles . Seen from the bay below , the proportions of an entire train on its way across the bridge are comparable only to a toy , and automobiles are so dwarfed that they seem mere dots , hardly perceptible except in rapid motion . Civic pride could not be better expressed than it was by a two-foot , wholly American little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand of his middleaged father , in robes and black skull cap , as one ferryboat plied fairward this morning . The father tossed his head in the general direction of the artery above the bay and asked his son : " You like ? What you think ? " The youngster wriggled to look up from under his sombrero , and snapped back : " Yep , it 's got zing ! " Hotel Men Here Send Greeting A telegram was sent yesterday to John P. Mulpeter , president of the San Francisco Hotel Association , by James A. McCarthy , executive secretary of the Hotel Association of New York City , as follows : " Personally and officially I extend to your association and its members , on behalf of the Hotel Association of New York City and its members , congratulations on the opening of the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition . " We earnestly hope that it will be a great success and will bring benefits to your city and State . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
