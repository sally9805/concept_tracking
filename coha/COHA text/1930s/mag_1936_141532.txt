The American Chemical Society is no less eager to publicize itself and its doings than is the American Medical Association . Early last week the Society 's publicity department handed reporters a copy of a speech by a Jersey City manufacturing chemist named Herman Seydel in which that Doctor of Philosophy declared that a compound of benzoates of his devising was the long-sought single cure for arthritis ( TIME , Sept. 14 ) . The speech was released for immediate publication , though Chemist Seydel was not to deliver it before the Society , meeting in Pittsburgh , until four days later . So closely watched is all news pertaining to health that upon the advance mention of this new concoction Chicago headquarters of the American Medical Association was immediately overwhelmed by long-distance calls , telegrams , letters , personal visits . What was that new drug ? Was it really a cure ? Why was the medical profession not using it ? <P> Stirred by that bombardment , vexed that a chemist dared to make a medical statement were Dr. Morris Fishbein , A. M. A. publicist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. M. A. 's chemical laboratories . Chemist Leech whipped off a telegram to President Edward Bartow of the American Chemical Society , and rushed to Pittsburgh to protest in person . The Leech telegram : " Dr. Morris Fishbein , editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , and I join in protest to the American Chemical Society against the use of its agency in aiding the premature and unethical exploitation of this proprietary . . . . May we suggest that proper officials remove Dr. Seydel 's speech from program because of unwarranted and harmful publicity . " <P> Dr. Fishbein immediately reinforced this by giving all news agencies copies of a vigorous editorial which he intended to publish in the next issue of the A. M. A. Journal , The editorial : <P> " For several years the annual sessions of the American Chemical Society have been accompanied by extraordinary publicity in the lay press concerning new chemical discoveries applicable in the field of medicine and particularly for the treatment of disease . Each year has seen several disappointments associated with the subsequent fate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the preparations thus announced have found a certain field of usefulness . The medical profession has thus far refrained from criticizing this interference in its field . This year , however . . . the American Chemical Society can not dodge its responsibility in this case . It is neither within its province nor within its competence to give critical judgment on the treatment of disease . If it wishes to maintain the respect of the medical profession and the public , the American Chemical Society can not permit itself to be used as an agent for unestablished proprietary remedies in the exploitation of the sick . " <P> Thus was sharply drawn a problem between two mutually dependent professions . Doctors must have chemists to invent new drugs ; chemists must have doctors to try out new drugs . But should chemists wait until doctors say : " We want a new drug to do so &; so . Try to create it " ? Or should chemists say : " Here is something new . See what it is good for " ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
