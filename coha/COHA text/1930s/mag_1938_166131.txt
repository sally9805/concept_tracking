Men With Wings ( Paramount ) is the first Technicolor picture with an aeronautical background . It is also the first picture with an aeronautical background that attempts to take the long view of flying , not as hazardous profession or exciting adventure but as the latest and most spectacular chapter in the long history of transport . Starting with the Wright Brothers ' first , incredible , 59-second hop , Men With Wings proceeds , with great pictorial beauty and praiseworthy attention to authenticity , to run through the whole amazing chronicle of aviation . For its intention and for its photographic content the picture deserves to rank as one of the year 's most important productions . Were the narrative , the writing and the acting in Men With Wings up to the same standard , it would rank as one of the best pictures ever made . Unfortunately , they are not . <P> Properly impressed by the dramatic fact that people who were children in 1903 had barely reached middle age by the time Franco 's bombers were pounding Barcelona , Director Wellman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole bright saga of flying through the prism of a conventional triangle plot . When Pat Falconer , Scott Barnes and Peggy Ranson are moppets , sailing kites in imitation of the airship Peggy 's inventor father is trying to rig up in his workshop , the device succeeds brilliantly . By the time the children have grown up into Fred MacMurray , Ray Milland and Louise Campbell , the narration of their story seems a tediously oblique fashion of presenting material which would make almost any purely personal romance seem drab by comparison . Net result is proof that the cinema , less complete as an art than aeronautics as a science , has not in its parallel career reached the point of being able to present facts as facts instead of sugar-coating them with fiction . <P> The shortcomings of Men With Wings are not due to Director William Augustus ( " Wild Bill " ) Wellman 's lack of qualifications for his job . A Lafayette Flying Corps pilot during the War , he launched aviation as a major cinema subject with Wings in 1927 , thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation epics . More lately his forte has been screwball comedies ( Nothing Sacred ) . To Wellman these apparently dissimilar types seem closely connected . The extraordinary conduct of Pat Falconer in Men With Wings illustrates his belief that Wartime fliers experienced such intense emotional turmoil that none of them afterwards could adjust themselves to normal living . <P> An even better illustration of this belief is Wellman 's own career . Respectably reared in quiet Brookline , Mass. , he left high school to sell chocolates and woolen goods , failing miserably at both . After the War he went to Hollywood , persuaded Douglas Fairbanks to give him a job acting in The Knickerbocker Buckaroo . After William Wellman took one good look at himself on the screen he decided he was an even worse actor than salesman , became a messenger boy for Samuel Goldwyn . When General Pershing was being shown around the lot one day he spied Wellman , whom he had known when Wellman and Poloist Tommy Hitchcock were famed for their trick of flying low over German towns and firing their machine guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , you old son of a gun , how are you ? " Next day Wellman was made an assistant director .
