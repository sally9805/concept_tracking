Not a candidate for office , and hence less philosophic than Governor Curley ( see above ) , is Michigan 's onetime ( 1932-35 ) Governor William Alfred Comstock , a Democratic wheelhorse who went bankrupt last year , but whose cash and efforts had been credited with sustaining his Party in Michigan through some 30 lean , mostly Republican , years . Charging that National Chairman Farley had broken a 1932 promise to distribute Michigan 's Federal jobs through the regular Party organization , handing patronage instead to such political parvenus as Father Coughlin , Democrat Comstock last week announced his resignation from the Party . Cried he : " The Hogskis and the O'Piggys , in their scramble for jobs , have upset the trough . "
