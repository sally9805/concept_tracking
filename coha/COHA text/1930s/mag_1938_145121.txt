Favorite subject of progressive educators is social studies-how and why people live and work together . Modern schools start teaching this subject early , explaining it to moppets by describing a simple society like that of Eskimos . Centerville , a textbook published last week , * brings social studies closer to U. S. children by analyzing a simple society in the Middle West 's corn belt . For nine-year-olds in the third grade , Centerville is a story of a ' " typical " ( but unidentified ) village of 309 people in Indiana . Authors of this child 's Middletown are Stanford University 's young Professor Paul R. Hanna , progressive education 's No. 1 curriculum expert ; University of Chicago 's Professor William S. Gray , a top-rank expert on reading ; and Genevieve Anderson , a Des Moines assistant elementary school director . <P> Chief problem in Centerville is poor dirt roads , which keep a traveling library away , make newspapers and mail late , compel farmers to do their own carrying to market . When Farmer Hand , trucking strawberries , gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people decide to build a concrete road . Crotchety old Farmer Banks ( who is unpopular among Centerville 's children because he chases swimmers from his creek ) stalls progress by refusing to let his barn be moved out of the way , but finally gives in to avoid accidents at a sharp turn in the road near his farm . He becomes the village 's traffic policeman . The plot ends with a surprise staged by Farmer Banks at a Community Day in Centerville 's new school . He gives the village part of his land for a swimming pool . Aim of Centerville 's subtle propaganda : to wean the younger generation from rugged individualism to cooperation . <P> * Scott , Foresman and Co. ( 92 ' ' ' ' )
