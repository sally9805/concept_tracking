Popular in Czechoslovakia is the Government 's policy of seizing the broad acres of great nobles and parcelling them out among the poor . Last week seizure threatened 75,000 Czechoslovak acres belonging to a reigning sovereign , gentle old Franz Paul I , Prince of tiny Liechtenstein . This year Europe 's register of kings , the famed Almanack de Gotha , has picked Franz Paul I for its frontispiece , displays him in hoary majesty . That from this old man the young republic of Czechoslovakia should plan to seize 75,000 acres seemed monstrous , infuriated the 10,000 Teuton Catholics who populate the Principality of Liechtenstein . <P> <P> Abruptly in Prague the plans were changed , but scarcely for the better . <P> <P> Prince Franz Paul I was informed last week that he can keep his 75,000 acres upon payment to the local Czechoslovak Farmers Co-operative Society of $6.66 per acre , or in all $500,000 . Rich is the House of Liechtenstein , but such a sum represents more than twice the annual public revenue of the Principality of Liechtenstein . Few doubted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will have to be refused by the ancient , snowy-bearded prince .
