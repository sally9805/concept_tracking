( See front cover ) <P> From the lacy steeple of the Stephans-dom in the centre of the parish churches in the suburbs , all the bells of Vienna bonged out in Jubilee last week . A great glittering crowd had assembled in the sweeping crescent of the Heldenplatz before the former Imperial Palace . Hemmed in by glittering buttons and braid and feathers of the entire diplomatic corps , sat enthroned three scarlet-robed Cardinals and their Brother-in-God the Papal Legate from Rome . Bands played , a choir sang Schubert 's Deutsche Messe and , grave with emotion , little Chancellor Dollfuss stepped forward and laid a wreath at the ornate bronze equestrian statue to Prince Eugene of Savoy , who helped defend Vienna in 1683 . <P> The celebration , last of a series that has been going on all summer , was officially to celebrate the 250th anniversary of that victory . Everyone in the crowd , and all Europe , knew that it celebrated another , more immediate victory for the Dollfuss Government . While choir boys shrilled Schubert 's mass , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police guard were on their hands &; knees , picking up one by one paper swastikas that they had scattered in the streets . This was the first crow of triumph that the Dollfuss Government has permitted itself since its struggle against Hitlerism began . <P> The Siege-From the beginning of his administration , when Naziism held the sympathy of about 50% of the Austrian people , it has been the strategy of Chancellor Dollfuss to fight the lush promises of Adolf Hitler with a revival of Austrian patriotism . It was not an easy job . Austria has a colorful , scarcely a ' glorious history . She never won a war without the assistance of powerful allies . The Habsburg Emperors gained at various times control of over half Europe by the practical but not very inspiring habit of marrying heiresses , but there was one time when Austria was truly great , when Vienna saved Europe . In 1683 the Turks under Sultan Mohammed IV made a last attempt to conquer Western Europe . An army of 400,000 men swept into Hungary and across the Danube to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vienna 's defenses were in the hands of a peruked gallant , Count Rdiger von Starhemberg , who had under him a man destined to be one of the world 's great generals , Prince Eugene of Savoy . Again the victory was not truly Austria 's . What sent the Turkish legions pell mell back across the plains of Hungary was the arrival of the galloping lancers of King John Sobieski of Poland . Whoever won it , it was a great victory . Western Europe was saved for Christianity . The Turks never returned , but they left behind them things to enrich the world : coffee to start the first caf in Vienna , the first lilac bushes in the west .
