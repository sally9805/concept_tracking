Any Aryan who has the slightest Germanic strain is a " German " to Adolf Hitler , who has laid down in Mein Kampf the mystic affinity of all " German blood . " Last week " Germans " in the Free State of Danzig finally forced the dissolution of the last remaining political party opposed to the Danzig Nazis , the Catholic Centrists , whose leaders were thrown into jail by Nazi stalwarts , charged with " treason . " This made Danzig a 100% Nazi State , nearly justified the New York Times 's , excited headline : " DANZIG NAZIS LINK FREE CITY TO REICH . " <P> Meanwhile " Germans " in the Republic of Czechoslovakia were being egged on by the official Berlin press to demand " autonomy . " There were even lurid rumors in Prague that Nazis were scheming the assassination of Czechoslovak President Dr. Eduard Benes . He , famed as " Europe 's Smartest Little Statesman , " cracked out activity in Czechoslovakia by prohibiting for the time being political meetings of any party in the republic . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in 1914 were subjects not of the German Kaiser but of the Austrian Kaiser-that is they are Austrians who find themselves and their old homes now in the new state of Czechoslovakia . From the Sudetes Mountains many of them take the name of Sudetendeutsch , and leader of the Sudetendeutsch Partei is pudgy but strenuous Herr Konrad Henlein . He was embarrassed recently by the arrest of his chief henchman , Hans Henrich Rutha , and 16 young men as homosexuals . <P> To distract public opinion from this , Herr Henlein made a much-advertised visit to England , returned last week to announce that he had found " widespread sympathy " for all Germans in London , precipitated a free fight between Sudetendeutsch members of the Czechoslovak Parliament , who had come to hail Leader Henlein , and Czechoslovak police who did not know that these zealots who tried to break through their lines were persons with parliamentary immunity . The cracked crowns of the deputies were to be investigated by Parliament committee , but Adolf Hitler 's press was screaming with such rage at latest reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep major strife from erupting in Czechoslovakia .
