txt Great Britain is still mistress of the seas , Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty , told the House of Commons this afternoon in a speech marked by optimism , though tempered with caution and tinged with sarcasm against an enemy that once before tried and failed to bring Britain to her knees by undersea warfare . There was cause for cheering when the First Lord of the Admiralty reported that in the first month of the war the British Navy had swept the seas clear of German shipping , forcing 2,000,000 tons of it to seek refuge in its own or neutrall harbors . He dramatized and gave new importance to Prime Minister Chain-1 berlain 's statement of last week that " six or seven " German sub-1 marines had already been destroyed , explaining that this meant that one-1 tenth of the German undersea fleet and perhaps one-third of that on active service could no longer menace Allied shipping . Germany might build new submarines , as she did in the last war , he conceded , but he pointed out that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the last war , he declared , twenty-five skilled submarine commanders accounted for one-third of all the damage done to Allied and neutral shipping . Moreover , Mr. Churchill said , lost tonnage in this war is being replaced faster than German submarines can be expected to sink it . As proof that Britain was beginning to convince Germany that she could beat the Nazis at their own game , Mr. Churchill referred sarcastically to German submarines ' apparent preference recently for neutral shipping as objects of attack , citing the sinkings of Finnish , Netherland , Swedish , Greek , Norwegian and Belgian ships . In the same ironic vein he told the House of Commons that since the Prime Minister had reported ' the sinking of " six or seven " submarines there have been some " fruitful , hopeful days . " He told of the capture of a chivalrous submarine commander who took the trouble to radio him at the Admiralty to give the position of a ship he had just sunk . " I was in some doubt at the time ' as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Churchill . " However , he is now in our hands , and he is being treated with all consideration . " In his address Mr. Churchill gave new details of the loss of the Courageous . He said risks had to be taken with airplane carriers in the early days of the war , pending operation of the convoy system , and explained that two of the four destroyers protecting the Courageous had gone to hunt a submarine attacking a merchantman bound for England . The carrier , he recounted , had just turned into the wind to allow her own aircraft to land on her decks up-wind and littd " happend , by what may have been a 100-to-1 chance or more , to meet a U-boat in her unpredictable course . " These were interesting and important revelations , but by far the most important had to do with the manner in which Britain is meeting the submarine menace to her shipping and how she purposes to meet it in the future . Difficulties of Arming Ships At the outbreak of the war Brit- 1 ash merchantmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , describing the difficulties of arming them , providing convoys and taking other protective measures . He cited the fact that on an average day 2,000 ships flying the Union Jack are at sea , to indicate the magnitude of the task the Admiralty faced when war broke out with submarines lurking in wait . In the first week of the war , Mr. Churchill told the Commons , 65,000 tons of British shipping were lost . In the second week only 46,000 tons were sent to the bottom . The third week showed a loss of 21,000 tons , and in the past six days this had been cut to 9.000 tons . " In that period . " Mr. Churchill Informed the House , adding to the joy his diminishing figures provided by declaring that the system of contraband control was now effective , " we have actually arrested , seized and converted to our own use 67,000 homeward bound from the United tons more of German merchandise than has been sunk in our own ships . " Not only was Britain convoying her merchantmen with ships of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarines and destroying them when found , but merchantmen were being armed and armor-plated against attack from beneath the sea or from the air , said Mr. Churchill , Chamberlain Reviews the Week The First Lord of the Admiralty spoke before a House gathered to hear Prime Minister Chamberlain 's fourth weekly review of the progress of the war . It was a fighting speech , and it gave the Commons and the people what they hungered for  --  news of progress in at least one phase of this war that has been marked by no spectacular action in any sphere where the British and French forces are operating . When he finished the lobbies and corridors of Parliament buzzed with enthusiasm . It was commented from the floor by several members that arrangements should have been made to broadcast his address as the best possible propaganda . The Prime Minister in his own way contributed something to the picture of what Britain was doing toward achieving her announced aim , the destruction of Hitlerism , by describing the work of the Ministry of Economic Warfare , which he disclosed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general object , he said , was to disorganize Germany 's economic structure to such an extent that it would become impossible for her to carry on war . If Britain can prevent importation by Germany of the raw materials essential for war industries , he said , it would cripple her power to prolong the conflict . But he warned that the Nazis already possessed large reserves and that immediate results could not be expected from the work of this ministry . Mr. Chamberlain answered the German charge that Britain was waging inhuman warfare by seeking to starve civilians . He declared he had never heard of a siege commander allowing a free flow of rations to a besieged town . He likewise replied to the Nazi assertion that the British blockade would not hurt Germany , which Chancellor Hitler insists is selfsufficient , but would disrupt neutral trade . The truth , said Mr. Chamberlain , was that the British were anxious to recognize the bona fide trade needs of neutral countries and eager to consider proposals from neutral governments for maintenance of this trade . Declaring it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from participation in the work of the Ministry of Supply , whose duty it is to speed up production of war materials , the Prime Minister said his government was " ready and willing to take the steps necessary to secure their good will . " Yesterday , Clement R. Attlee and Arthur Greenwood . Labor Opposition leaders , called to ask that labor have an equal interest with the government and industry in this phase of the war . Labor unions were reported to have made a more formal protest against being treated as " stepchildren . " CONVOY SYSTEM PROVED Britain Lost Only 24 of 1,502 Ships In 99 Groups in World War Winston Churchill 's report as Erirst Lord of the Admiralty on the progress of the British campaign against submarines recalls the similar campaign during the last war .

By August , 1917 , all British ships States , South America or Gibraltar , and incapable of exceeding a speed of twelve knots , received convoy protection . Faster ships were later included in special fast convoys , although the excessive strain of such manoeuvring often played havoc with the crews . By October , 1917 , 1,502 steamers , totaling 10,656,300 tons dead weight , had arrived in ninety-nine separate convoys with the loss of but twenty-four vessels . Of these , ten were sunk and the rest lost through inadvertent or deliberate disobedience on the part of their masters . With the Admiralty hard at work formulating methods of detecting and destroying U-boats , several new practices were introduced which soon lessened the danger to shipping . Camouflaging of all ships was rapidly adopted . Smoke screens were released at the sight of a periscope , freighters were refitted with a minimum of superstructure , and observation kiteballoons were introduced in the convoy escorts . The most effective dodges uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of all ships , thus making doubly difficult the job of aiming a torpedo , and , secondly , the use of depth ' bombs , deadly explosive charges ' that crushed the undersea craft as if they were eggshells .

From then on they were the most efficient means of halting the ravages of the unrestricted U-boat campaign conceived and introduced by Admiral von Tirpitz . MERCHANT SHIPS ARMED British Prepared for Submarine Warfare Long in Advance Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Sept. ** with anti-submarine gun , Great Britain 's merchant ships are now ready for active warfare against Germany 's submarines . In the first three - weeks of the war British merchant sailors took to lifeboats and watched Germans sink their ships . From now on , however , they will be returning the submarines ' fire and racing at full speed for port , as Winston Churchill announced that all British merchantmen were being fitted with guns in ports all over the empire . This does not mean that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are not now and never will be equipped to do that . Their new weapons are entirely defensive , and , although their guns are heavy enough to sink submarines if they happen to score a direct hit , the object of this equipment is primarily to give British ships a chance to get away . One almost inevitable result of this move will be that more ships get away but that more men will lose their lives . German U-boat commanders are not likely to give British crews time to take to lifeboats , now that their ships are armed . Naval experts do not expect this system is going to stop the sinking of merchantmen . They estimate that the submarine still has something like a sixty-forty advantage over most ships in the merchant fleet . It is estimated that about 1,000 vessels have already been strengthened and that the entire merchant fleet will be so protected within six months . Captains in the merchant marine have been instructed to man the guns twenty-four hours a day and to increase lookout staffs . Their lack of submarine-detecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
