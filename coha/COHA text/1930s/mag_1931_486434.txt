WHATEVER may be the deficiencies of the Administration 's tax program , it must at least be conceded that it is much better than any outsider until lately had reason to expect it to be . As late as a month ago Mr. Hoover seemed to have shut his eyes to the necessity of any tax increase whatever . Now he and Secretary Mellon have presented Congress with a set of tax proposals which , for the most part , deserve a respectful hearing . Secretary Mellon estimates that if there is no increase in taxes , there will be a gross deficit next June of $2,123,000 , - , 000 , and of $1,417,000,000 on June 30 , 1933 . Mr. Mellon does not propose tax increases sufficient to wipe out these deficits entirely . He presents a tax program which he estimates should bring in additional revenues of $390,000,000 between January and June of next year , and of $920,000,000 for the following fiscal year . If estimates of receipts and expenditures were realized , this would still leave a deficit of $14733,000,000 next June and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , allow for statutory debt retirement , Mr. Mellon expects that the net increase in the public debt next June will not be more than $1,321,000,000 , that there will be no net increase in 1933 , and that in 1934 net reduction of the debt will be resumed through the sinking ) fund . This general program has already been vigorously attacked from opposite points of view . Mr. Walter Lippmann has very ably stated the opinion of those who hold that the budget must be balanced entirely . Professor E. R. A. Seligman , on the other hand , contends that in Secretary Mellon 's program " too much is expected from taxes and too little from loans . " Neither of these criticisms can be dismissed as unintelligent , but The Nation believes that Secretary Mellon 's position on this point is more defensible than that of either of these critics . The case against any attempt to balance the budget completely at this time is a very strong one . It would , to begin with , be practically impossible to do so . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise tax rates months ago . Last June at the very latest , when he had been compelled to propose his debt moratorium and when a deficit of $903,000,000 for 1931 was officially established , it was the President 's duty to call Congress in special session and propose most of the tax increases he is now recommending . Such a measure , enacted last summer , would have reduced the prospective 1932 debt by several hundred millions of dollars more than it is now possible to reduce it . Discussion of what the Administration should have done last spring , however , is futile . It would be unwise at the present time , in any case , to impose new taxes greatly in excess of those that Secretary Mellon actually proposes . He is quite right in pointing out that " it is not easy for any people to determine to assume a large additional tax burden at a time when their resources are depleted through business depression . " There is , moreover , as The Nation remarked in its issue of December 2 , a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans at an unusually high- rate in good years , and offsetting this to some extent even by fresh borrowing in years of severe depression . There is no sounder principle in taxation than that the burden should be placed on individuals in proportion to their relative " capacity to pay , " and if this principle is sound as applied to individuals , it is equally sound as applied to years . Further , since we reduced our debt from a total of $26,600 , - 000,000 in April , 1919 , to $16,200,000,000 at the end of the 1930 fiscal year , a net increase in the public debt of $1,321 , - 000,000 would not damage the national credit . On the other hand , there is no assurance that the deficit will not be more than this , particularly when Mr. Hoover admits that receipts for 1932 will fall below the original estimates by the staggering total of $1,717,000,000 . Further , when he remarks that the present increase in taxes " shall be definitely terminated in two years from next July , " he is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly since all his previous guesses regarding the length and extent of the depression have been notoriously bad . All this does not mean that it is immediately necessary to balance the budget , but it does mean that it is necessary , if the government 's credit is to continue to maintain unquestioned standing , as it must for new bond issues , that Congress show its readiness to raise taxes courageously in the present crisis . Many of the specific tax increases which Secretary Mellon proposes , based to a large extent on the revenue act of 1924 , are also worthy of indorsement . This applies to the taxes on passenger automobiles and trucks , on tires , on radios and phonographs , on amusement admissions over ten cents , to the increase in the tobacco tax , to the restoration of the income-tax rates to a maximum of 40 per cent compared with the present maximum of 20 per cent , and to the rebroadening of the base to include lower incomes . The taxes on checks and drafts and on telephone and telegraph messages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unpopular and objectionable as nuisance taxes , but they would place a needless burden on general business activity . The necessary revenue could be raised from many sources not mentioned by Secretary Mellon . Congress might consider a small federal gasoline tax and taxes on numerous luxuries and semi-luxuries such as domestic jewelry , cosmetics , perfume , chewing gum , and the like . The corpora- , tion-income tax , which it is proposed to raise from 12 to only 12% per cent , could be raised to 15 per cent . Above all , the inheritance tax could be raised very much above the 25 per cent maximum suggested by Secretary Mellon  --  at least to the income-tax maximum of 40 per cent , with gift taxes to prevent evasion . The 40 per cent rate on inheritances existed in the law of 1924 , and European inheritance-tax rates are much higher than this . These increasing revenues will be worse than ineffective unless accompanied by drastic economies in expenditure . The most obvious place for these is in the army and navy appropriations . But the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest and sinking-fund requirements on the war debt , is more than five times what it was before the war , Is sufficient prima facie evidence of extravagant spending . Navy or President ? WHO runs this Republic  --  the navy men or the Execu- tive ? We had thought this question settled long ago . The founders of this country , with their deep-seated hatred of the ships and sailors and soldiers of His Majesty King George III , certainly believed that they had decided the issue once and for all . But today it is pretty clear that the navy thinks it directs the government , that it does not recognize the President as the Commander-in-Chief and proposes not only to pay no attention to his wishes and program but openly to defy them . For that is what is now taking place . The annual report of the Secretary of the Navy calmly ignored the President 's policy in that it was a well-considered plea for the enlargement of the navy which the President seeks to check . Now Rear Admiral Upham , Chief of the Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he - declares that the new operating plan of the navy , insisted on by President Hoover , " will inevitably result in materially lowered training and efficiency , and in the event of war would be of the gravest consequence " ; that it means " the serious impairment of the strength of the navy as an arm of the national defense . " . This plainly raises the whole question of who is to run the navy . The President has just given his word to the Congress that the navy has never been in a higher state of efficiency and that this situation will continue . The Rear Admiral 's statement is plainly a direct challenge which will further fan the flames of Mr. Hoover 's unhappy controversy with the Navy League , which he should have ignored as beneath his contempt . The way out would be prompt action by the man in the White House . If Mr. Hoover had a normal amount of backbone , Rear Admiral Upham would be detached from the Bureau of Navigation  --  always a hotbed of intrigue  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Administration . For the , simple truth is that , whether he is in this case mistaken or not , the responsibility is Mr. Hoover 's under the Constitution , that ' he has the clear right to demand loyalty of his subordinates and to dismiss them if they can not give him that loyalty in fullest measure . That an Executive may be overruled by Congress is always possible since that is provided for , but the idea that the President may be overruled at any time by any of our too numerous admirals , or by his Secretary of the Navy , is just a little bit too much . If this were a sporadic case of insubordination it would be easy to express this opinion and let it go at that . But the publication of Rear Admiral Upham 's outburst is but one more incident in a long list . Ten , days ago Rear Admiral Moffett also forgot that , under the United States government , policies are formulated not by naval or military officers but by the civilian authorities , and demanded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ships , and more and faster airplanes . " Even the Associated Press commented on the " bluntness " with which this admiral penned his demands . This officer , who appears to be in charge of navy propaganda , has been heard from before . It was apparently he who sent out to " Navy Day " speakers instructions to make an unblushing demand for the increased navy to which the President is opposed . Then he became worried and issued fresh instructions of a milder character . By pure inadvertence  --  of course ! ? both sets were given to the press , and from the jingo dailies the big-navy appeals got a lot of the desired publicity . The Navy Department has a record of its own . Mr. Adams first disobeyed the President by submitting an increased budget instead of the reduced one asked for . The department then released to the press a confidential document to the effect that the President was demanding a $61,000,000 reduction in the estimates when he was asking a reduction of only $20,000,000 below the current appropriations . When to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false instructions and Rear Admiral Upham 's latest attack , it must be perfectly obvious that any vigorous Executive would give Secretary Adams just about twenty-four hours to clean house or start home for Boston . Well , we hear it asked , should not chiefs of bureaus and Cabinet members have the rightto speak out if they believe the country in jeopardy ? Not if they are in the military or naval services . Just imagine a battleship commander talking publicly against the policies of Rear Admiral Upham or Secretary Adams . How long would it be before he " hit the beach " ? He would be lucky if he escaped court martial . When a man enters the army or navy he deliberately accepts the muzzle ; he agrees to subordinate himself and his opinions to the discipline of the service . Why is any rear admiral to be excepted ? Why should the department be permeated with insubordination ? There was formerly a clause in the Army Regulations reading : - SUBORDINATION TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES ? 1559 . Respect and obedience to the civil authorities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more particularly of those who are armed in the public service . In 1881 this was dropped out of the army regulations . It ought to go back into them and into those of the navy . And every bureau chief and rear admiral in the service ought to be compelled to paste it in his cap with this addition : " For it is the American way and the American people desire no other . " Briining 's Last Stand C HANCELLOR BRUNING himself inferentially admits that his drastic emergency decree of December 8 represents his final effort to save Germany from economic collapse and possible chaos this winter . The decree gives the government virtually absolute control over the economic ' life of Germany . It reduces wages in private industry , the salaries of all public officials , the prices of standardized articles , all house rents , and the interest rates on domestic loans , bonds , and mortgages , whether public or private . The decree also provides for the appointment of a price commissioner , who may upon his own initiative fix the prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom and practicability of these and other provisions of the emergency order , and one may charge Bruning with having set himself up as dictator of Germany , but one must in any case acknowledge his great courage . Never before has the government of a capitalistic state gone so far toward controlling national economy by a single gesture . But , then , never before in peace times has a capitalistic state been faced with such grave problems as those now confronting Germany . If they are to be solved without injury to the state , immense courage is necessary . Does Briinigg today govern Germany with the consent of the governed ? This is a serious question that can neither be readily answered nor lightly dismissed . In his decree of December 8 he incorporated definite measures designed to suppress popular opposition to the course he has chosen . Political meetings and the wearing of political uniforms are prohibited for the time being , persons who criticize public officials may be sent to prison , and the state authorities are clothed with extraordinary power to prevent violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curbing free speech , and suppressing freedom of the press . He has promised that if these harsh measures do not suffice , martial law will be declared to protect the government . But the Chancellor must not forget that suppression invariably breeds violence . We admire him for his great courage , and it is possible that the end  --  stability and economic security  --  is to be reached by no other means . However , by his action Bruning is openly defying a considerable section of the German population . Adolf Hitler now lays claim to 15 , - 000,000 followers , and the recent astounding election successes of the National Socialists suggest that this is not wholly fanciful . The Communist voters number 6,000,000 and their strength is also growing . Moreover , the opposition to Briining within the still faithful Social Democratic Party is spreading rapidly . Should Briining 's program fail to accomplish the desired purpose , it is almost certain that that failure will bring an explosive reaction . Two countries can in generous measure help Chancellor Briining to prevent an internal collapse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp downward revision in reparations , and , the United States by agreeing to forego a large part , if not all , of the war debts owed to this country by Europe . But the mania of nationalism still keeps both of these countries blind to what has become an imperative duty , not to Germany , but to themselves . At the meeting of the special reparations committee held at Basel the German expert , Dr. Carl Melchior , presented a comprehensive and alarming statistical picture of Germany 's plight . The figures he produced should have been enough to convince the most skeptical that Germany must be granted immediate and adequate relief . But the French delegate , Professor Charles Rist , according to the Associated Press , " declared the German case was invalidated by the very evidence submitted " by Dr. Melchior . The summary , Professor Rist said , " showed the great uncertainty in Germany , and was sufficient justification for the belief that the present was not the time to reevaluate Germany 's capacity to pay . " To what madness has their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of our own Congress . Mr. Hoover 's suggestion that the war-debts question be reexamined was timid enough , but even this mild suggestion has met with the most obstinate resistance from Congress . Secretary Mellon 's frank declaration that the European countries simply can not pay " failed to break the Congressional resistance . " Will anything less than the bankruptcy of Europe , with its inevitably disastrous effect upon this country , convince the Washington patriots that revision of the war debts is a question of economic security for everyone ? Look Up , Not Down ! OME of Harold Bell Wright 's novels have sold as many as 2,000,000 copies each . It is probably fitting , therefore , for young writers to attend to what he has to say about - novel- writing . In a recent interview he declared modestly that he knew nothing of literature and was not competent to judge writers ; he even added that he employed an assistant to correct his spelling , " because my own schooling is- so terrible . " But he has his ideas , nevertheless , about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Wright to begin with , which " should be beneath an artist 's notice . " " Although I believe I have made some very accurate studies of life I have known some things I would not care to put into any book of mine . " " I feel the average reader wants entertainment plus . He wants to feel after reading a book that he has been entertained but has also gotten something out of it , some encouragement or a new outlook on life . " With these unexceptionable sentiments Mr. Wright aligns himself with the Stork-and-Santa-Claus school of fiction , as anyone might have supposed that he would . One might pause to wonder , however , just what sort of literature we might hope to have if his precept and example were generally followed . In the first place , let us take the Bible , that unfailing criterion whenever anything is to be demonstrated . The merest cursory glance at an index to that estimable work reveals the word " lust " and its derivatives listed forty-five times ; there are seven " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lewds , " and the word , with its derivatives , that Mr. Wright would probably write " wh-re " if he wrote it at all is dignified by no fewer than forty-nine mentions . One might also urge on those who incline to Mr. Wright 's point of view a careful reading of the stories of Tamar , David and Bathsheba , and Potiphar 's wife , to mention no others . Then there are the Greeks . But at them one gives uo in despair . These husband-murdering , mother-marrying , virgin-ravishing creatures would have no place in Mr. Wright 's literary paradise . Vergil and the other Latin poets come off no better ; Chaucer  --  but let us pass quickly over Chaucer ! Let us not pause too long with Shakespeare either , or Fielding ; let us completely forget to list those misguided gentlemen Boccaccio , Rabelais , and Benjamin Franklin . Indeed , it is only when one comes into the safe fold of the nineteenth century that one feels Mr. Wright would be perfectly comfortable , and even there the - unfortunate insinuations of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole , one may conclude that it is just as well that Mr. Wright is not intimately acquainted with literature . It would be too strong for him . His purpose in writing books is uplift ; " mountain tops instead of sewers " are his province ; he dislikes those writers " who like to stir life with a stick to get the stench out of it . " Well , why not ? There is a stench in life when it is stirred with a stick and there is an odor of sanctity . On the whole the stench has seemed to remain with us a little longer , but who can tell ? We may yet see naughty Shakespeare , or even the lesser moderns who try to see sewers as well as mountain tops , give way to the undeviating , the relentless glare of sweetness and light . -
