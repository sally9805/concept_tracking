txt Henry Ford , the outstanding hold-out against signing an industrial code , broke his long silence today and discussed the ' efforts of the Washington administration to bring about recovery . In an exclusive interview with this correspondent In his offices at Dearborn , Mr. Ford made public his views on the NRA for the first time since the battle of the codes began last Summer and General Johnson threatened to " crack down " on him for his surprising refusal to sign . But it was no blast against the NRA which Mr. Ford gave . Nor did he have a word against General Johnson . Indeed , in an hour 's freeranging conversation Mr. Ford did not even mention the recovery administrator . Instead Mr. Ford , who always does the unexpected , declared his complete belief in the ideal behind the NRA . More than that , he called the NRA the first move , though a faulty and halting one , toward a new industrial and social era which , when it comes , will be a millennium of justice and plenty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that it interfered in industry , but that it did not go far enough  --  that and his belief that there is too much selfishness in the support being given the NRA and that it is pretty much in the hands of the same old crowd who were the high priests of the " old deal . " And so , though it would be exaggerating to say that Mr. Ford endorsed the NRA as it stands now , it also would be exaggeration to say that he attacked it . " Opposed to the NRA ? " Mr. Ford exclaimed when the interviewer suggested in the beginning that that was his position . " Why should we be opposed to it ? President Roosevelt is only trying to make industry do what we were doing twenty years ago ! " Mr. Ford , though his name has been placed at the top of the list of opponents of the New Deal as embodied in the NRA , revealed himself today as an admirer of and sympathizer with President Roosevelt and his efforts to lead the nation to lasting prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best he could in an extraordinarily difficult situation . It is Mr. Ford 's belief that the whole industrial system , especially the distribution phase of it , is shot through with faults . It is basically wrong , he feels , because it is devoted to making money instead of making human values . It must be reformed clear down to the bottom , and he is convinced that some day it will be . He believes , furthermore , and gave clear indications of it today , that President Roosevelt may be leading the way to the complete reform he contemplates , although it may take him another year to get really started . Mr. Ford holds that , as the President 's purposes take form , many of those who are now counted his most earnest supporters will become his most determined enemies and that Mr. Ford himself , now accounted . critic , will be standing by the President . This correspondent learned today on unimpeachable authority , though not from Mr. Ford himself , that the motor manufacturer has made known his attitude directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told some of the President 's most cpnspicuous advisers there that four years from this time , when Mr. Roosevelt has really developed a policy and they are knifing him for ' it , he expects to come forward as the President 's warmest supporter . Holds He Lives Up to Code . Mr. Ford granted this Interview , which had been sought by this correspondent , in one of the severely simple , meticulously clean offices in the Ford engineering laboratories . The manufacturer , now 70 , and looking not a day older and not a trace less fit and springy than when the correspondent saw him there a year ago , sat in his favorite position , tilted back against the wall in a plain office chair , his feet on the edge of the desk . It was a thoroughly frank interview as far as it went . But there were two points upon which the manufacturer simply would not be drawn out . One was the considerations which made him refuse to sign the automobile code last Summer , when General Johnson had confidently expected Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we sign it ? " was Mr. Ford 's invariable answer . " We 're obeying the law  --  everything in the law , " he added once . " In fact we were obeying it before there was a law . " The other point was whether he intended eventually to sign it . Mr. Ford gave no hint whether he would or would not , , but the impression he left was that signing the code would be an extra legal affair in which he had no interest . He appeared to be resting on the position that his Company was complying with the law and even going beyond it . Long ago General Johnson himself announced that the Ford Motor Company was observing the automobile code . Optimism Tinged With Caution . As Mr. Ford talked today he ranged back and forth across the field of industry . Speaking in clipped , telegraphic sentences , sometimes almost in riddles , he touched on mechanics and money , on the merging of industry with rural life and the blindness of business , and always came back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and plenty will replace the ugliness , noise and injustice of the present one . Today found Detroit wreathed in optimism . In the newspapers were enthusiastic accounts of the automobile show in New York , with orders running 35 per cent above last year 's . Armies of men were back to work . The assembly lines in the great automobile plants , Henry Ford 's among them , were stepping up and pushing cars out into a world which now seems eager to buy them . But Mr. Ford 's optimism was tinged with caution . He foresees gains , then recessions ; gains , then recessions , in the same old vicious circle , unless a genuine new era is brought in . But he believed that the NRA was aiming at bringing in this new era , even if it was doing so faultily . The interviewer asked the manufacturer his opinion on the NRA almost at the beginning of the conversation . " You can say it in a very few words , " Mr. Ford responded : " There is no possible way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust " Was Blocked . And a little later , in amplifying his views , Mr. Ford declared : " The ' NRA is being improved . We believe absolutely in what it is trying to do . There were possibilities of harm at the beginning , but somebody with good sense seems to have stepped in . " We 're not against it . Why should we be ? We 've been doing all the essential , worth-while things which the NRA prescribes for twenty years . " And what we did , paying high wages , establishing shorter hours , made us work . To be able to realize these things has been a real job . We have had to exercise ingenuity from the beginning . " Mr. Roosevelt is trying to make industry do what we were doing twenty years ago . " So , up to the present time we have believed absolutely in the ideal behind the NRA . But the NRA has n't tackled the fundamentals yet , there 's been too much selfishness in the support of it . Some interests thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out the independents . " Well , it did n't work . But NRA did n't stop them  --  the independents did . You ca n't squash people out . Independence is part of every American . And it has not been responsible for any of our ills  --  our loss of independence is what causes trouble . . " But if these supporters of the NRA keep on trying to crush competition they 'll get left . Competition furnishes the incentive for peole to rise , for genius to come up . Resents " Superstition of Money . " " But there 's no way for them to crush out a rising spirit . If they try that they 're up against a fundamental . " " A fundamental of the American character ? " the interviewer asked . " No , " said Mr. Ford . " A fundamental of the Lord Almighty . " " They 're up against nature , and you ca n't hurt nature no matter what you do , " he continued . " That 's why I say they ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the same old way . But the new era will not be in the hands of people who try to do things in the same old way . " The attention of its supporters is concentrated on money . They are trying to hang on to the money system . They are trying to rebuild things in the same old circle . And it ca n't be done . We have got to break out of that circle if we 're going to get anywhere . " Mr. Ford has in no way mbdified the strong views about money which he disclosed in detail in an interview in THE TIMES a year ago . Money should be the mes.ns of industry , not its end , he believes . When asked today what he thought of America 's departure from the gold standard he said , almost im-patiently : " That does n't interest me . That 's just part of the superstition of money . People accept gold because it looks good to them . " He held the misconception of-the function of money to blame for wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fallacy in Price System . " The object of living is work , experience , happiness , " he said . " There is joy in work . All that money can do is buy us some one else 's work in exchange for our own . There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something . " There is some terrible fallacy in the price system , something humanly wrong . The NRA is tied up to the price system and so is beginning at the wrong end of the problem . " In making prices go up we are merely buying and selling money . We must reverse the process . We must put the commodity on the top and money on the bottom as the conveyor of industry instead of as its product . " We have never seen any overproduction of anything . There is no overproduction of wheat when men are hungry in the cities . There is no overproduction of cotton when people lack decent clothing . " There is no overproduction of anything so long as there are . people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . There never has been a use surplus , only a price surplus . It was not a wheat surplus that troubled the country , but a price surplus . " Our breakdown is in our system of distribution , and to reform that we must reform the money system because distribution is dependent upon that . " The trouble is not with human beings  --  they are much better than they are permitted to be  --  but with the system . " There is a fallacy also , " Mr. Ford continued , " in the assumption that industry exists to support the people . It 's the other way around . It 's the people who support industry . They use the things of industry in getting a living . " Doubts Great Buying Power Rise . Mr. Ford expressed doubt that the NRA had materially increased purchasing power . The wage rises had been too small in the industries affected . " Raising wages from $6 to $12 a week does n't ' increase purchasing power , " he said . " At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are excellent . " Mr. Ford expressed the belief also that the recovery efforts as exerted thus far had retarded the movement from the cities to village and country . This movement has become almost a religion with Mr. Ford . It encompasses the decentralization of industry from huge plants in the cities  --  where the lives of thousands of men and their families are dislocated when plants are shut down ? to small plants in the country , where workers combine agriculture with ; their shop work and have the land to fall back on in an industrial crisis . Mr. Ford already has carried this movement a long way in his own industry and thousands of small plants in rural places are making parts for his automobiles . " The NRA has kept men scratching around in the city when they had better be in the country , " he said . He believed also that the Civil Works Administration was overlooking an opportunity . " If it organized and built villages , as Rabbi Franklin once suggested , it would have something to show , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much charity , though it is doing some good by keeping up the habit of work . Holds Industry Too Concentrated . " But we 've got to ' mix land with industry  --  that 's the new era , " Mr. Ford continued . " Industry ca n't go along in its present concentrated form . It is too costly . " The economies of concentration must now be realized through a wide distribution of industry . By carrying the workers back to the land we will be bringing our markets back . The workers will raise their own food and they will have the earnings of their industry to spend besides . They will be independent of the industrial employment cycle . " Mr. Ford has been referred to in print in recent months as the last of the " great individualists " of industry . He has been called a true individualist because he never has sought help , governmental or otherwise , but has asked only to be allowed to go his own way and let others go theirs . So intense is Mr. Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paying them many millions of dollars , as soon as he could . He showed a Wall Street banker the door a few years ago for suggesting a financing plan for the Ford Motor Company which involved giving the bankers a voice in running the business . The interviewer suggested to Mr. Ford today that his individualism was at the bottom of his refusal to sign the NRA code , because Mr. Ford might see in the NRA , as many do , an infringement of individualism . " Selfiamess Not Individualism . " But Mr. Ford would not admit this and would not even call himself an individualist . " The new era will not crush out individualists , " he said . " It will allow them to become more individual than ever . Narrow selfishness is not individualism at all . " He laughed , at the thought of the erstwhile " rugged individualists " importuning the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for loans . Turning once more to the NRA , Mr. Ford remarked that it was an experiment on the way to the new era  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting now , which would lift the load of drudgery off millions of men and women . " The experiment is just starting , " he said . " Like all experiments it can not be expected to come out perfectly at once . But It will not be thrown away . No experiment is ever thrown away . And I do n't want to do anything to keep this experiment from going on . " But as to just what this new era will be like he would not prophesy , because , he said , events always confound prophets . When Mr. Ford was deploring the fact that money is almost universally considered the aim of industry , the interviewer recalled an anecdote of Mr. Ford 's boyhood as an indication that money of itself had no value to the future manufacturer . Writes " Good Work " on Pad . The anecdote was that the youthful Ford , just because he loved machinery , became an expert watch and clock repairer and scoured the countryside for broken down timepieces , which he repaired free of cost for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still ? do , " exclaimed Mr. Ford with a delightful smile . " I have a watch here which does n't run well and I am going to fix it myself . I practiced on another watch for an hour and a half yesterday and I can do it all right . My hands are as steady as they ever were . " He held out his watch to show its works , visible through the transparent case , and pointed out the mechanical inefficiency of watches , which use so much power and employ so much machinery just to push two featherweight hands around . At the beginning of the interview Mr. Ford had put a little scratch pad on the desk in front of him , as if to take his own notes . Occasionally he toyed with a pencil . When Mr. Ford terminated the interview there were just two words on the pad : " good work . " They told Henry Ford 's entire philosophy . of life .                @ @ @ @ @
