Marrying the boss 's daughter is something of a tradition in American Rolling Mill Co . Armco 's founder and chairman , white-haired , patriarchal George Matthew Verity , married his boss 's daughter ; Armco 's president , wiry , little Charles Ruffin Hook , married Leah Verity . And President Hook would probably be delighted if his daughter , Jean Catherine , now in school in Connecticut , wed an up- &-coming; Armco man . For good relations with its employes is a prime Armco policy . Last week Armco 's happy relations with its workers-attested by the fact that it has had no strike in its 39 years-flowered anew . <P> Six months ago a workman in Armco 's Middletown , Ohio mills suggested that the management sponsor a housing development for employes . His letter passed from executive to executive , 15 university experts were consulted , the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Agriculture queried . Finally 80 workers were called in to approve the management 's ideas . They did , and last week President Hook announced the creation of Fertile Valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Middletown . <P> There , on an acre of soil-tested land apiece , 60 modern houses will be built-a two-bedroom size at $4,500 , three-bedroom at $5,300 . Total cost for the 60 families will be $300,000 , financed jointly by the workers , Armco and FHA . To keep costs down , the 60 are now forming their own building company . <P> Since Fertile Valley Homesteads will be made of prefabricated steel built by Armco , the company is in effect developing a new outlet for its products . Armco is thus following the lead of big U. S. Steel Corp. , which since last September has been stamping out prefabricated steel parts for a similar housing development at Clairtown , Pa. near its vast new Irvin Works . <P> With an estimated shortage of 2,000 houses in and around the Clairtown area , the building firm of Gilbert-Varker , Inc. persuaded Big Steel to cooperate in erecting a 300-house , 92-acre subdivision known as Colonial Village . FHA got behind 80% of the project 's $1,314,000 total cost , local investment bankers did the rest . Costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 7,000 lbs . of steel , compared to the 2,380 Ibs. in the usual small dwelling .
