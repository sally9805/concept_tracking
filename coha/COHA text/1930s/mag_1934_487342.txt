IF MAYOR LAGUARDIA had spent his entire time in office looking for the worst possible tax , he could not have found one worse than the sales tax which he has imposed on the city of New York . Judged from any point of view , the sales tax is indefensible . It is clumsy , costly to administer , bureaucratic , and detrimental to legitimate business . The burden of the levy falls chiefly on those least able to pay it , both because this group constitutes the great hulk of the consumers and because the wealthy spend a comparatively small proportion of their income on consumers ' goods . To say , as one alderman is reported to have said , that a part of the tax will be paid by non-residents of New York is to admit that it violates even further the principles of sound taxation . If the money is to be used for the relief of New York residents , there is no reason why the city  --  the wealthiest in the world  --  should attempt to shift the burden to outsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number have been suggested which would be better than the one imposed . The Citizens ' Conference on Unemployment has formulated a program designed to raise from $50,000,000 to $70,000,000 by alevy on high incomes and business profits . While this would be sound , we believe a tax on luxuries to be even more defensible . Figures were forwarded to Mayor LaGuardia , for instance , showing that a very considerable sum could be raised by a graduated impost on all restaurant meals costing more than 50 cents . A tax on rents in excess of $75 a month would also yield a substantial income . Even ex-Mayor O'Brien 's much-derided levy on automobiles was far more equitable than that devised by LaGuardia , who only a few months ago was emphatic in his denunciation of attempts to throw the burden of the depression on the poor . FOR THE THIRD TIME Great Britain and the United States have made strong representations at Tokio against the oil monopoly recently established in Manchuria . From a legal standpoint these protests , are undoubtedly in order . The two Anglo-Saxon countries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchoukuo is an independent country . Nor can there be any doubt that Japan has deliberately violated the " open-door " principle contained in the Nine-Power Treaty . But it is both strange and disheartening that the State Department should not have taken a firm stand on this point until the profits of the Standard Oil Company were endangered . The hopeful aspect of the situation lies in the fact that on this issue as well as on that of naval disarmament the United States and Britain appear to be working more closely together than ever before , a development which Japanese diplomacy has sought above all else to prevent . If this cooperation can be maintained during the difficult year ahead , it is inconceivable that the Japanese will long persist in their present intransigent attitude . T A4 CKING a more substantial cause for gratification , the press has bailed the 36 per cent increase in the value of American exports for the first ten months of 1934 as indicating a " recovery of our international commerce . " An analysis of the trade returns , however , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been made in agricultural products , where our surpluses lie , but in motor cars and manufactured goods , where the advantage obtained by devaluation of the dollar has been most apparent . Even more serious is the fact that imports have shown practically no gain , apart from the rise in prices . Since the United States is a creditor country , the increased export surplus tends to throw our international balance of payments still farther out of adjustment and to intensify pressure on the debtor countries . For the past few months it has been the policy of the Administration to take the balance owed us in the form of gold and silver . But obviously this can not be long continued without disastrous effect upon the countries depending on these metals as a basis for their currencies . It is a situation which in theory can be corrected by the reciprocal tariff negotiations now under way . Action will have to be prompt and courageous , however , to overcome the damage which has already been done by an ill-conceived monetary policy .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
