Because Josephus Daniels , genial publisher of the Raleigh ( N. C. ) News &; Observer , was Secretary of the U. S. Navy when that navy bombarded Veracruz in 1914 , loud have been the Mexican murmurings against his appointment as Ambassador to Mexico . The murmurings were so loud last week that Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Puig Casauranc felt called upon to deny officially that the appointment of Publisher Daniels was in any way displeasing to the Mexican Government : <P> " Various badly informed groups have attacked the appointment of Mr. Daniels with absurd and even calumnious statements . The Government of Mexico is interested in correcting the ' supposition ' that the new American Ambassador has been named by his Government ' as a discourteous act embracing a stern and fearful warning . ' . . . " <P> In Guadalajara Mexican police raided dozens of houses and shops , seized and burned bales of literature demanding the expulsion of Ambassador Daniels by force .                    @
