Best-known emblem of U. S. shipping around the world is a white dollar sign mounted on red-banded stacks . Last week , leaking badly at the seams , its brightwork tarnished after decades of shining renown , the Dollar Line signed away by its crew of heirs , assignees and moneylenders , was to be taken over by the U. S. Maritime Commission . <P> Keel of the Dollar Line was laid some 40 years ago by dour old Captain Robert Dollar who needed ships for his lumber business in the newly opened Pacific Northwest . A goat-bearded gaffer with a self-made man 's canniness and mistrust of others , he drove many a skinflint bargain . In 1928 , at 84 , he wangled a Government ocean mail subsidy calculated to pay him about $3,000,000 annually . For some $9,000,000 he had already purchased on time from the U. S. Shipping Board twelve vessels then valued at almost $16,000,000 . By 1931 his fleet of President liners had been increased by two bought from the International Mercantile Marine and two built for him mainly with $11,000,000 loaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 and his son , R. ( for Robert ) Stanley , fat , red , fiftyish , took over . Trained in the Dollar lumber camps , R. Stanley had a hard time figuring out the financial maze his father had managed so shrewdly . He got help from Herbert and Mortimer Fleishhacker and their Anglo California National Bank of San Francisco . Straightway , the Dollar maze got mazier . Criss-crossed family corporations were set up , existing companies expanded . Soon the Dollar Line owed Anglo California some $3,000,000 ; and of the Dollar stock , the Fleishhackers owned 109,000 shares , the Dollars 93,000 . <P> Last year , when the Merchant Marine Act terminated all ocean mail contracts . Dollar whirled nearer than ever the maelstrom of 77B . In January , the Maritime Commission caught it just in time , awarded a $1,400,000 temporary six-month subsidy , ordered the leaky financial hull scraped and calked before it would consider a permanent subsidy . When the six-month grant expired , the Dollar crew had not completed the required financial overhaul , proposed instead counter plans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that for the old Captain 's bargain ships , on which $7,000,000 was still due , the Government should pay $18,500,000 . When this sort of bargaining failed , the line decided to surrender to salvage . <P> When last week 's deal was negotiated , eleven Dollar ships were laid up , only four were in commission . To get them afloat again , the Maritime Commission will make a loan of $1,500,000 , and get an RFC loan of $2,500,000 for working capital , grant a five-year operating subsidy of some $3,000,000 a year . To the Commission goes all the line 's Class B stock ( 2,100,000 shares ) , almost half of its 252,000 shares of Class A stock . Six months after the transfer , the Commission will abandon the Dollar name , and the familiar dollar-sign insignia will disappear for good from the high seas .
