 | On Discovering America Condensed from Survey Graphic Pearl S. Buck Author of " The Good Earth , " Fighting Angel , " etc . I HAD LIVED all my life an American away from America . Then I returned , a sort of immigrant among immigrants , except that I came to my native land . But it was as new to me as though I came from Sweden or from Italy or Greece . It seemed to me the country was full of foreigners . The people were like English people , or Europeans . I asked continually , " Where does one find the real Americans ? " To my bewilderment everyone replied the same way - that is , he was American , his ancestors had come over in the Mayflower or before the Revolution or the Civil War or something . I hurried to American literature , reading books praised as being American . But the books varied even more than the people and each might have been written about a totally different country . There are the people of New England ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born elsewhere , who are the staunchest New Yorkers ; and when I go South nothing I have learned north of the Mason and Dixon line does me any good ; and there are the far reaches of the West , where other kinds of people live and none of them is American - and they are all American . These true , typical Americans I had been looking for did not exist at all . Of course , the truth is , we are all immigrants , we Americans . I find it ridiculous that a man whose great-grandfather came to this country should look down on one who comes in now , and call him " alien . " For what is a hundred or two hundred years in the life of a nation ? The nation is and will be for centuries to come made up of people from all countries . And looking at all these people , I discover in them all the diversities of the world in race , in culture , in religion . They have only one thing in common with which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restless has ever come to America . The quiethearted , the contented , the peaceful minds , are still in old countries . When visitors speak with wonder of the ceaseless hurry and activity of America , I am not surprised .  | For were we not naturally restless , none of us would be Americans at all . But when we come to America , we are not onlv restless individuals . We come as races , as nations , as transmitters of the past to a country without a history . The prejudices of all peoples on earth are now American prejudices . Hungarian Catholics still hate Hungarian Protestants on these new shores , and pugnacious Irishmen still wear the green . We change , perhaps , the material aspect of our lives . We use electricity and running water and we buy an automobile , but inside we do not change . We remain what we are , and to America 's endless variety we add our own bit , and so we become American . Even one 's children are different from another 's children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion picture and cheap magazines and the public school system see to that - but their hidden , unrecognized roots are , through their blood , in their bones . And I observe that those roots never become lost - at least , not yet . It will take hundreds of years before we forget we came from England or Ireland , Germany or Italy or France . I am not at all sure we shall do well to forget , even then . We ought not to forget , or allow our children to forget until in long common national life we have achieved an American culture . And we can not make an American culture by sitting down and thinking or writing about it . I can not but believe he will be an extraordinary person , that pure American - perhaps a thousand years hence . He will have what no other human being has had in just the same richness ; the inheritance of all ages , all races , all cultures . He will have a fine direct eagerness which will be our restlessness , refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving force which will carry him to heights of human knowledge which we can not even dream of now I believe , then , in exactly the sort of America we have now , except I wish we could see that what we have is good and inevitable , and so cease to hate each other . Our country is based upon diversity of race and upon freedom of belief , and this is our chief claim to being unique and great . In an age of race prejudices and class hatreds we alone stand as the one possible country where the races can and must live together , and where birth fixes no castes . For though men hate each other when they come , they should be taught as the basis for American citizenship that here we may differ each from the other , and that diversity is our strength and our nature , and each man is to believe what he feels true , and our one common belief is only this .  | The reason why we exist together at all in peace is , simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us started to fight there 'd be no end to the people to be fought . We could not divide into two nice clean divisions , and have a simple war , for instance , between Fascists and Communists . The Republicans and Democrats would refuse to be anything else completely , and so would the Episcopalians and Presbyterians and the Townsendites and the D.A.R . and the Bostonians and Virginians and all the menagerie of Lions and Elks and Moose and what not . None of these would be willing to be a Fascist or a Communist , because he considers being one of these thousand other things is the only important thing to be , and in so behaving he is being an American . Yes , in our diversity is our safety . There are capitalists among laborers and there are Socialists among millionaires . I hear rumors of a dictator to come , but I hear , too , the familiar rumble of stubborn protest which makes me feel a dictator would find it very hard going here . We will never have a vast bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tolerate any one group having so much power as to make such fools of the rest of us . And because we believe in having a good chance ourselves , we give people a better chance than does any other country . I believe in keeping clear and wide the source of our national strength - immigration . This is not at all to say that we are to allow just anybody to come into America . But we have not yet the rational basis for immigration . It is not racial or national . The wise man will open his doors wide to the intelligent and to the good , whatever their race and nation . Brains and inherent character should be the passport to America . We need honesty and industry . No nation can have too much of these qualities . I should like to think of America as forever the land to which the restless and the bold , the brilliant and the good , out of every people , could come and make their home . I am not fearful of such people starving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . They enlarge industries and they are able to solve the problems of life . America can not do without them . We must teach our children , native and foreign alike , that there is no final America yet - that they are making America , too , by what they themselves are . We must teach the foreign-born to laugh when silly children cry , " You 're wops-we 're Americans . " The truth is , Americans are all something else , too , and are going to be for a long , long time , and the truest American knows it .
