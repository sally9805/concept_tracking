txt Letters From Readers of The Times on Topics in the News OUR UNPREPAREDNESS REASON New FOR WAR DEBT CANCELLATION General Pershing 's Story Viewed as Evidence An unusual number of press articles have appeared of late on the subject of interallied debts . Practically all the arguments assume either sentimental or business reasons as the only possible bases for cancellation . The vast majority of cur people are too widely removed ' from Europe in sympathy and understanding to feel any urge to assume a huge burden of taxation on sentimental grounds . As to business reasons , or expediency , there is no more question . that the people should be deeply impressed by the arguments of the financiers and economists for cancellation than that they will not be so guided , at least not until too late to secure the benefits these advisers foresee for us in that policy . When President Hoover , Secretary Mellon , nearly all our Senators and Representatives , and most of the business men one talks to fail to see any merit in these arguments , what hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A third argument for cancellation which , in my experience , makes a much stronger appeal to the average man than either of those mentioned above , once he has grasped it , is based on what is known in common law as the doctrine of implied contracts . If an automobile builder 's clerk tells him that some one who owes him a thousand dollars will purchase a car ( from him or from some one else ) if the debt is canceled , and that a week 's employment for six men and . a possible , profit for himself will result , he will probably reply that he prefers to have his thousand dollars , with which he may buy a piano , thus providing the same amount of employment , but having the piano for - himself , instead of the debtor having the car . But let the clerk add that the debtor happens to be the surgeon who performed a major operation on the manufacturer 's child , f or which his fee is a thousand dollars , and the matter takes on an entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies has been occupying considerable space in THE NEW YORK TIMES daily for nearly two months , in General Pershing 's story a our part in thei World War . We Took Our Own Time . Making Our Position Untenable We declared war not to help the ' Allies but at our own time and for our own reasons , after what was probably the longest and most impressive warning of danger of involvement in a great war which any nation ever had . It then became as much our war as England 's . Of all the nations involved we alone were able to take the time to prepare after declaring war . Why were we exempt from the universal rule ? Whence our immunity while we made up for our unpreparedness  --  a unique experience among all nations in all history ? The answer is that the Allies did our part , as well as their own , for four-fifths of the time that we were in the-war . Their losses in lives were increased by hundreds of thousands , and in treasure by billions of dollars , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to do all they did if we had not declared war , so they were just as much to the good by the help they ultimately got from us . " Let one who uses that argument try the same principle the next time he rides on a railroad train . He may say that the train is going to make the trip anyway , so the company will be no worse off than If he had not got aboard , and that as he will pay for the last quarter of the journey the company be that much to the good . How far would he get ? Let a landowner in a district subject to floods , on learning that his neighbors have formed a reclamation district to protect the low land with dikes , say that their work will protect his land , so why should he pay more than he sees fit ? The court would tell him why very ouickly , Tor American law covers that case and the case of implied debts incurred for services from which one has benefited , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case . The loans to the Allies cover expenditures in this country for supplies used in our defense while we were unable to defend ourselves , as well as the defense of the borrowers , and in principle rest on all fours with cases covered by American law . But because our debt commission refused to allow this question of counterclaim to be &cussed,; and because our debtors ' needs after the war for banking . loans for rehabilitation would not permit them to defy us , we have been able to keep out of international law this principle of implied contracts for services , which is fully established in American law , I and which if incorporated in international law would make our position on these debts untenable . Because of our inexcusable unpreparedness our Allies paid a bill in lives and treasure beside which these debts to us are a bagatelle . Not only are we demanding from them payment for munitions and supplies that our own men would have used . and given up thousands of lives in the using , had we been even efficient in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large profits to our people and huge taxes to our government , which taxes helped to pay part of our own direct war costs . So we not only refuse to offset material used largely in our defense against Allied lives substituted . for American lives , but we paid a good bit of the cost of equipping our own men with the taxes thereon . In conclusion , I quote a few lines from many columns to the same effect of General Pershing 's story : " It was depressing to think that ten months had elapsed since our entry into the war and that we were just barely ready with one division of 25,000 men . With all our wealth , our man power and ability , that was the net result of our efforts up to the moment , all because our people had been deceived by a false and fatuous theory that it was unnecessary in time of peace to make even preliminary preparations for war . Here we were likely to be confronted by the mightiest military offensive that the world had ever seen * ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . see the Allies again suffer losses of hundreds of thousands of men . " " The War Department was inefficient and not alert , nor did it seem to appreciate the urgency of the situation . " " Certain Bureau Chiefs * * were determined not to work in the great team in which cooperation is essential to success . " " Little had been done when there were so many things that might have been done before . It had been apparent to everybody for months that we were likely to be forced into the war , and a state of war had actually existed for several weeks , yet scarcely a start had been made to prepare for- it . ? * * In view of the serious possibility of war that had confronted the nation since the sinking of the Lusitania ( two years before ) there was not the slightest reason why well-nigh complete plans should not have been made . " In April , 1918 , speaking of recent changes in Washington , he writes , " If  --  a similar awakening had taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half a mile Hon combatants in France for the Spring campaign . " Our Inefficiency Was Costly . At another place he says that had he had this force of trained fighting men at that time , the great German offensive might have been broken up and the war thereby ended . long before it was . In other words , allowing six months after we declared war for the War Department to - hit its stride , more energy and intelligence would have given him a trained army in April instead of in September , 1918 . Quoting again from Pershing 's story , " We were called upon to make up in a few months for the neglect of years during which self-satisfied provincialism and smug complacency had " prevented the most elemental precautions to meet such an . emergency , " For all this inefficiency there was a tremendous bill in lives to be paid , and the Allies paid it , for that very inefficiency kept our men from the trenches until three-quarters of our period in the war had passed . The supplies for which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of the war while we slowly prepared . The money they cost was by far the most efficiently spent of any used in our defense . Vast sunas were spent by us for supplies for our army that were not ready until after the war had ended . Of the billions spent on aviation and artillery for our troops the net result was that not one American airplane flew over the German lines , and but twenty-nine American guns got into action . So far we have not yielded one dollar for those services . The only concessions have been on the admitted ground that the debtors could not pay more , a basis of composition for which gratitude is neither expected nor given in ordinary business . Why should it be different in international affairs ? S. L. G. KNOX . Boston , *ASS. , Feb. 26 , 1931 . A BAR TO MINORITY RULE Proportional Representation Viewed as a Safeguard Against Governmental Ills To the Editor of The New York Times : In THE TIMES editorial on the British Government 's proposal of the alternative vote for Parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportional representation " the tendency of proportional representation to swell the number of little parties , make Parliamentary government unstable , promote intrigues between shifting groups , bedevil a composite government having no clear and single majority , and alternately beaten by or reinforced by elements from an opposition as heterogeneous as itself , has been admitted by its candid advocates . " As one of its candid advocates I want to protest that statement and also to call attention to the fact that France , which is cited as " a flagrant example , " has never had proportional representation , though the very unsatisfactory hybrid system which was in force there from 1919 to 1927 was improperly labeled proportional representation in the law . A method of election which does not give political groups representation in proportion to their voting strength is not proportional representation , whatever it may be called . Not long ago this same charge of promoting instability was made several times against proportional representation in a series of articles in The Saturday Evening Post by Richard Washburn Child . Elsewhere in the same series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having satisfactory stable government , the United States , Great Britain , the Netherlands and Switzerland . The Netherlands and Switzerland are among the countries which have for some time used proportional representation . The injustice of your charge may perhaps be best illustrated by , referring to the last two elections in the Irish Free State , which uses the best form ' of proportional representation for all its elections . In the first of these , held in June , 1927 , the dissatisfaction of the voters with the policies of the two major parties was expressed in an increased vote and representation for the minor parties , Labor , Farmers and National League . Incidentally the opportu-. nity to vote effectively for these minor parties made it possible for the voters to rebuke the government without turning the country over to the Republicans , with whom a majority a them were not in sympathy . By the next election , held in September , 1927 , both the major parties had heeded the writing on the wall and modified their policies to bring them more into accord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost ground and there was a decided swing back toward the two-party system . Since then . the Irish Free State ' Government has remained continuously in power , and I think you will agree that its record compares very favorably in the matter of orderly progress with the government of Prance , which has the so-called majority system in single-member districts , or even with that of our own government at Washington . This reform of proportional representation is not merely the theoretical project of such great thinkers of bygone times as John Stuart Mill , to whom you refer . It is advocated , on the basis of actual experience in every one of the great English-speaking countries of the world , by such practical people as Professor John R. Commons and Professor Paul Douglas , to whose work on unemployment you referred in another editorial in your same issue . It is the only effective safeguard , not only against " taxation without representation " but against minority rule . R. W. KELSEY . Haverford College , Pa. , Feb. 23 , 1931 . FALLS ARE HARMED BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times : The Commissioners of the State Reservation at Niagara desire to Convey their appreciation of and thanks for the editorial in Simday 's TIMES , " The Niagara Treaty . " The fall of rock from the face of the crest of the American side of the cataract on the night of Jan. 17 was inevitable , being a continuation of that erosion which during a period variously estimated at from thirty thousand to thirty million years has produced the gorge of the river . This erosion can be retarded by the creation of the remedial works of which you speak , and their creation at once should be begun by the Federal Government . There is , however , an additional matter the Federal authorities should consider . Approximately seventeen years ago , a board of army engineers suggested that the diversion by Chicago of ninety thousand cubic feet of water a second from Lake Michigan for the purpose of its drainage canal result ' ed in the impoverishment of the American side of the falls , in that water thus abstracted  --  save a small loss by evaporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cataract . They suggested that Chicago should ' dispose a its drainage and garbage by incineration . So far as we are aware the situation remains unchanged . A. T.

GREAT-HEARTED PHYSICIANS GREAT-HEARTED PHYSICIANS To the Editor of The New York Times : There have been recently several articles ' dealing ' with the high-price doctors and we all know that there is much truth in what has been said , but I would like to pay a tribute to the great doctors who do not send great bills and who temper the wind to the shorn lamb . It has been our privilege to have been under a surgeon 's care for the past two years , in which time there have been five operations . The first bill was sent after ex months and my husband and I , calculating roughly what we thought.it would be , overestimated it by ; 400 . The second bill , at the end of the following four months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the country . We asked for an explanation , but were told that daily visits throughout the doctor 's technical vacation could not be counted . It had been an arrangement made at his unselfish suggestion to avoid our remaining in the hospital all Summer . We are hoping to get even with him yet . The third bill was received after two more operations and was , in our minds , one-third the size it should have been . In defense of his act , the surgeon pleaded that we had had more than our share of doctors ' and hospital bills during that year . We sat up late into the night composing a letter in which . we tried to tell him all we owed him spiritually and financially and sent him a check for double what he asked , not daring to send the other third lest he refuse altogether . Another experience of ours with a doctor at the head of his profession in this country was his refusing to send a bill for a consultation in regard to a case in which we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and a half away from home over a Summer week-end . Still another surgeon , ' at the head of one of our hospitals , only after repeated request sent us a very moderate bill for a , consultation which robbed him of half of one of his rare Sundays in the country . These are but single instances In the lives of these men , but no one ever will know or can repay what they give of themselves and . their skill freely . It has been an inspiration to have watched these men on their hospital rounds carrying , like St. Christopher , not only the burden of our loved one on their shoulders , but countless others " without measure anclwithnnt price .

During our three years in the Executive Mansion we have felt the need of a library , and it has suggested the idea of establishing in the Governor 's mansion a permanent Kentuckyana library , not only for the great pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give lasting honor and recognition to the host of Kentucky writers who have since the appearance of the famous Dr. Walker diary been contributing outstanding books on many and varied subjects to the literature of the world . There are no funds or appropriation for this collection , but our hope is that each living Kentucky writer may share the vision of what a collection of this character will mean to the future of Kentucky , as a distinctive memorial to its gifted writers , and lend his cooperation in carrying to completion this idea by I sending autographed copies of his renditions and helping to bring all other books of Kentuckians into this permanent Kentucky Library . The most perplexing problem now Confronting us in this undertaking is to find through the cooperation of former Kentuckians the means of securing the complete works of some I of the well-known Kentucky authors who are no longer living .

New York State 's Reservation Seems to Have Been Disregarded To the Editor of the New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end with congratulations from Congressman Schafer to Attorney General Mitchell because of his gracious Intention to enforce the law lawfully . But it seems not too lawfully , for In States where wiretapping is barred by law , we must note , according . to the chief law officer , that " no State statute has ever been . held . to apply to Federal agents . " With Federal policemen free to ignore the laws of the States in which they operate , we have come a long way from the theory that the Federal Government is of limited delegated powers . That theory underlies the Tenth Amendment . It was admirably expressed by the constitutional convention a New York when it ratified the Constitution of the United States , with reservations .

NO BUILDING BOOM FORESEEN One Takes a Pessimistic View of Prospects and Frankly Tells Why To the Editor of The New York Times : Everywhere I go I 'M assailed with sighs and lamentations , " When will building revive ? " The answer to the query is so simple and absolutely certain : Not until a new crop of suckers grows up , or the present generation grows old and senile enough to forget the trimming it got so recently . Oh , yes , there will be some building  --  homes , Industrial plants , all that sort of thing  --  but not the wild , unbridled riot of hotels , apartments , theatres and such , the orgy of the building boom so recently gone smash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided and abetted that building boom . The bond houses carefully nurtured it . The architects licked their chops over it , they became fairly delirious with joy , egged it on , and did the work with lavish hand . Builders waxed fat and im- pudent during that boom and the building trades added to the festivities by tietting foolish rates for their labor and doing as little work as they could bluff through . So that the cost of building was not only exorbitant but positively indecent . One day the owner of a building under constructionsand I were looking at the steel workers in action . The rat-tat-tat of the riveter lulled for a moment . " Oh , hush ! " said he . " And why " ? I said . He wanted a fair start at counting the tap-tap when it began again . If he could only count them it would give him some idea of the cost of the building , as each tap represented a dollar ! Oh , it was a great game . Of course there was some legitimate building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shoestring . " And the process was simple . Formerly some one was interested : a man needed a building for his own purposes or at least he owned a lot he thought would produce a fair return with a building upon lt . But in the boom it was nearly all " promotion . " Any impecunious nobody , endowed with sufficient gall , could get an option on a lot , borrow a little from a friendly banker upon the prospect of an adequate bond issue , enlist the willing help of an architect who could design a flashy front over a large number of rooms . Then the bond issue would be made . Then would begin the slaughter of innocents . Legions of handsome , welldressed young men would descend upon the small tradesmen , the retired doctors , the teachers , officeholders , the widows , the orphans ? every one suspected of having a dollar or two put away for a rainy day . And the poor sheep fell in droves before the attack . Granted , those misled ones sinned , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , were bitten by the bug , the desire to make big money on small investments . And how much or how little per cent are the latter making on those glorious investments ? And echo answers : " How much ? " Oh yes , there will be some building done , but at lower prices , involving lessened wages , lessened profits , lessened commission and " velvet , " and only materializing after much purification in the temple , and , perhaps , some sackcloth and ashes . But I wish people would not ask me when building is going to revive . They are thinking building boom ! I am thinking just-building , normal construction , and even that is going to be subnormal for quite some time , as compared to what we called normal a long time azo . F. W .. kITZPATRICIC .

THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC To the Editor of The New York Times : Allow me to make a brief explanation with respect to the report published in Trull Truss relative to the Dominican Republic . This unofficial report refers to the circumstances that could have guided the negotiations  --  until now confidential ? to my knowledge initiated in New York by the Dominican Government for a loan . I do not know under what circumstances these negotiations have been conducted . But three considerations stated In the report are inaccurate . These considerations are : That the government presided over by General Trujillo administers " ruthlessly " the public affairs ; That it has consummated " political assassinations " ; That it has accomplished indiscriminate removal of Federal judges . I am moved to make the following explanation : The tact and cautious prudence with which the government of General Trujillo manages the public affairs are evidenced by the significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid  --  interest and sinking fund ? in strict conformity with the stipulations of the Dominican-American convention of 1925 . These obligations have been religiously fulfilled even at the time when the Dominican Republic was suffering the rigors imposed by the terrific catastrophe of Settember . The political crime imputed to the Dominican Government seems to be the death of the seditious chief General Cipriano Bencosme , accomplished by the army in an encounter in the interior after the government bad exhausted all peaceful and friendly means of converting this rebel chief , offering him guarantees of amnesty for sedition and disruption of the public peace . The removal of Federal judges was constitutionally accopiplishecL after the expiration of the terms of the previous- judges , the present ones having been nominated after free deliberation in Congress . If General Trujillo. lacked support of the Dominican masses he could not be the President of the Dominican Republic , and if it were not the Dominican people that demanded the negotiation of a loan , General Trujillo would not impose it , as previous governments have done .

Prisons remain without political prisoners , thanks to King Alexander 's liberal rule . Dictatorship abides de jure only , except that the press is not free to publish what it pleases . Otherwise personal freedom and private property are now more insured than in the days when politicians had their way . Railways and other public utilities are running in order and with a fair degree of efficiency . Civil service Is improved and the pnblic can transact its business far better than it was able to do in the days of the Parliament , when obstruction was the order of the day . Little is heard nowadays about corruption . One hears often of radical changes as forthcoming in the near future , but I see no positive signs of them . Of course , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers I find a good deal about alleged political persecution in Yugoslavia . Frequently I see the names of people who are supposed to be imprisoned or who are said to have fled from the country , though at the very time that the paper was printed in - the foreign country I happened to be with them , walking in the pretty little park on the Danube . . HERBERT THOMAS : Belgrade , Jan. 25 , 1931 , DECISIONS OF SUPREME COURT ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT Variations Are Noted in Methods of Interpreting Parts of the Constitution To the Editor of The New York Times ; The decision of the United States Supreme Court relative to the appeal from Judge Clark 's decision on the constitutionality of the Eighteenth Amendment was quite according to expectation . Possibly a few remarks relative to the reasoning used by the justices in their decision might be of Interest . The most strikinh statement in that paper seemed , in the light of previous decisions on other amendments , to be the following : " Thus , however ? clear the phraseology of Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limitation on the discretion conferred on the Congress , so that it will read , ' as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress , as may be appropriate in view of the purpose of the proposed amendment . ' This can not be done . The Constitution was written to be understood by the voters ; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary , as distinguished from technical , meaning ; where the intention is clear , there is no room for construction and no excuse for interpretations or addition . " In other words , if perfectly clear to the ordinary man , the court is not at liberty to modify or interpret in the spirit of the rest of the instrument , as suggested by Mr. Everts . But consider the decision of the United States Supreme Court in United States vs . Cruikshank , 92 U. S. 542 , 553 , MT &; tive to the interpretation of the Sedip ond Amendment to the Constittttierfis The Second Amendment reads : " A well-regulated Militia being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed . " Now the Supreme Court took MIS perfectly clear statement , which et &; tainly purports to insure the peosilei in their right to bear arms inside t4e . United . States and decided . as Moi . lows : " The right of the people to keep and bear arms is not a right granted . by the Constitution . Neither is it in. any manner dependent on that instrument for its existence The Second Amendment declares that this right shall not be infringed , but this means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress . This amendment is one of those that have no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government , and not those of the States . " # Meaning , Was Twisted . To my way of thinking , the am preme Court on this earlier occasion : took a perfectly clear statement and . twisted it around to mean something entirely different from what it pure . ports to mean , in violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Questions of intent , of contemporary custom , a expediency were all considered , in. spite of the present Supreme Court 's decision that such things need not be considered . Some courts , in studying the Second Amendment , have held . that the kind of weapons should be limited to those useful to a militia . Hence we may prohibit the carrying of pistols , dirks and the like , but rifles are all right . On that basis WO could seize a gangster 's brass knuckles , knives , pistols not of a. type suited to a militia . but his submachine guns , automatics and other valuable war equipment could not be touched . All this in spite of the clear statements of contemporaries of the writing of the Constitution , who show no tendency to limit the right to bear arms . In the present case , it has gradually dawned on the people that the methods of amending the articles of the Constitution need clarifying so as to properly safeguard the liberties of the people . This need was not so clearly felt when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were adopted . Holding this failure to attack the earlier amendments as reason for disregarding the points raised by Judge Clark seems to be an attempt to write into the Constitution a statute of limitations of the right of appeal . In this case , also , the disregard of the Tenth Amendment , which according to the justices is so clear in reading as to admit of no misinterpretation , is rather peculiar , for they interpret this interest of the people in rights not assigned specifically to the United States or the States as having no meaning as broad as the simple , non-technical words would indicate . It may be presumption on my part , but I confess I can not see why one clear passage can not be interpreted , while an equally clear passage is practically rewritten in interpretation . Methods of Interpretation Vary . If we applied the methods of interpretation used in the case a the Second Amendment to the Eighteenth , We should find that the right of Congress to define intoxicating liquors by law , and the right to prohibit manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly limited to interstate commerce , government distilleries and such purposes , and that it had no mandatory force on the States . Men of much greater ability than I have discussed most of the points raised by the decision . These few comments of mine are , I believe , in somewhat different form than those which have been considered , and are , hi some respects , sufficiently striking to raise serious question as to the consistency of the Supreme Court ir . its deliberations . Certainly in the light of the variations in point of view which have governed the Supreme Court in its rulings on the constitutionality of amendments and laws , the rather contemptuous , flippant even , tone of the document augurs rather poorly for the court 's interest in acting , as its members are sworn to act , as defenders of the Constitution . It seems , then , that the Supreme Court is , in effect , a distinctly arble tary moderator a our legal proce. ? dure . EDWARD ADAMS RICHARDSONs Bethlehem , Pa. , Feb. 26. 1931 . TASTE AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : THE Times mentions the experiments being conducted by Dr. Laird . of Colgate University on the relation between food taste and digestion . It corroborates the deductions arrived at by Hindu physicians ( Ayurvedists ) , several thousand years eel ) . It is interesting to'note that the statement of Dr. Laird to the effect that " sweet tastes have a most beneficial effect on digestive processes " are in complete agreement with the conclusions arrived at by Charaka , Susruta , Vagbata and others . It is most interesting to speculate on other points of corroboration which may evolve out of further experiments by Dr. Laird , and to watch with interest the points of divergence and the basis therefor . The conceptions , in brief , of tastes as taught by the followers of Hindu medicine are as follows : There are two types of taste  --  one , Rasa , as recorded by the tongue , and the other , Vipaka , Is the taste of food after it has been acted on by the secretions of the mouth and stomach . Rasa taste is divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pungent and astringent . VIpaka taste has three subdivisions , sweet , sour and pungent , as salty substances are altered by chemical changes into sweet and the bitter and astringent into pungent . The relation between the ex tastes of foods and medicines to their Mo . chemic values is the subject of books . On the compatibility or compatibility of tastes in food , osy the overindulgence in foods of One taste and its chemical effects , many a learned Hindu wrote . Of course , to all these rules on tastes of food exceptions were made . The restose.tive or healing values of tastes were considered to be as follows : Sweet was the taste whose value to the body economy was of the highest value . Next in value was the sour taste , followed in rotation by tastes of diminishing values , salt , , bitter , pungent and astringent.
