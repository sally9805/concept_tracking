The seas of the world are inhabited by innumerable billions of tiny , drifting organisms called plankton . Some of this is animal life , but the vegetable plankton , largely one-celled diatoms or algae , is the basic food of the ocean ; for all marine animals either eat the vegetable plankton or devour other animals which in turn are directly or indirectly dependent on it . <P> Vegetable plankton use sunlight and carbonic acid dissolved in the sea to produce carbohydrates . By measuring the amount of carbonic acid which thus disappears from a unit volume of water , marine biologists some time ago estimated the annual plankton crop at ten tons per acre of ocean surface . Recently scientists of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla , Calif. , set out to check this figure , last week reported a yearly crop of five pounds per square meter of ocean surface , which agrees closely with ten tons per acre . The Scripps Institution scientists pointed out that this figure compares favorably with the yield per acre of food plants on land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
