txt The Yankee Clipper , largest plane in the world , was nearing the Azores early this morning on the first leg of its flight to Europe after taking off from the Baltimore Municipal Airport at 2:34.30 P. M. , Eastern Standard Time , yesterday . The forty-one-ton plane is expected to reach Horta , the Azores , between 7:30 and 8:30 A. M. The plane reached the half-way mark on its pioneering flight at 11 o'clock last night . Up to that point fair weather had favored the trip , and every star in the sky was visible for navigational checks on its direction . Slightly turbulent air currents were encountered at midnight and clouds were banked solidly under the plane at 7,000 feet but the craft , speeding along at 8,300 feet altitude , had unlimited visibility and ceiling . At 3 o'clock this morning the plane was 2,054 miles out , with 826 miles to go to reach Horta . Final Decision Delayed Reports placed in the hands of Captain Harold E. Gray , its commander , before the take-off indicated that fair weather would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbances near the Azores . He announced that after he had been on his course for two hours he would decide whether to proceed or turn back . At 5 P. M. , when the plane had put 450 miles between itself and Baltimore and had stopped climbing and settled down for the long pull overseas , Captain Gray decided to continue and twenty minutes later sent the Pan American Airways radio station here the following message : " Everything satisfactory . Going ahead . " The plane reached Jones Corner , where transatlantic planes flying this route turn east , at 6:28 o'clock last night and at the halfway point , just before its radio swung - from Baltimore to the Azores for directional bearings , it swung northeast to head straight for Horta . Captain Gray was at the controls until 5:30 P. M. , when the other flight officers took turns .

Eight thousand persons crowded the two sea walls near the Pan American Airways administration building as Captain Gray swung the 82,440-pound gross weight of the giant flying boat into a light five-mile-an-hour wind and headed it southeast down the river in a light haze , its four 1,500-horsepower Wright Cyclone engines rising to a thunderous roar . The plane gained speed quickly , swept past a Pan American Airways launch stationed at its probable point of take-off and , after a fifty-second run , lifted gracefully into the air . Within a few seconds it was lost to sight in the haze and was on its way toward the far-off cluster of Portuguese islands .

" She said that their two boys , Harold Jr. , 9. and Frank , 7 , had become so blase in the matter of their father taking flights for distant parts that they had not come to the airport .
