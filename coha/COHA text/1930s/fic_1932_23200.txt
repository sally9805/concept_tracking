WOMEN HAVE NO CHOICE A STORY BY LEILA SHELLEY I 4 6 HAVE always hoped ? " said Thyrza , and trailed away into some glamorous words about success and love . Adrienne was not listening . She sat leaning back in her chair with her eyes on the dead brown garden in the March sunshine , letting her breakfast coffee grow cold . She was drowsy , and still tired from traveling all the day before . After Chicago , the old house was peaceful as a forest in midsummer : the breakfast table in a sunny window , the wood fire crackling behind her , her aunt 's dear aging face and plump form . Aunt Thyrza , who had always hoped .. . " ? for you , the advantages that I never had , " Tbyrza was saying earnestly . " Not so much money as freedom  --  being able to do what you want to . " Adrienne looked at her aunt 's serious , wistful face and said nothing . It was beyond belief that anyone should think her free . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aunt Thyrza was a chain , the office in Chicago was a chain , and the fellowship in Paris , and Gerald , all were chains . She struck a match and lighted a cigarette , biting back a sigh at the thought of Gerald Leybach . " I 'm thinking what this fellowship will mean to you , " Thyrza continued . " Why , it 's a wonderful thing ! I 've always wanted to send you to Paris . You need the work there , but you know how it 's been . The money  --  since the War it 's been nip and tuck to get along . Oh , I think surely you 'll get it all right , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes  --  anyway I hope so , " Adrienne answered , and it was a Iie . " Of course I do n't know a thing about architecture , " Thyrza admitted . " It 's always seemed wonderful to rile how you could plan a building out in your head and then figure in all the lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the way you planned it . But I do think you 're good , Adrienne ! Anybody who could take this old tumble-down barn and do it over as well as you did . . . " Her eyes wandered about the beautiful little room , marked the English wallpaper , the bright hangings , the simple old-fashioned furniture that Adrienne had found and brought in to replace Grandmother Benedict 's knobbly walnut . There across the table sat Adrienne herself . For months she had not seen the girl . Thyrza looked the young figure up and down : the thick hair , vaguely waving , the slender shoulders in a blue flannel robe , the long white hands , the pale face , and the dark eyes veiled in wavering smoke . How tired she looked , and troubled . " Sometimes I think you do n't want to go to Paris , " Thyrza said . " I have to want to , " Adrienne answered , smiling . " It means every-thing to me . But you know I shall hate going , too . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! thought Adrienne . Why could n't Aunt Thyrz4-1. understand ? But when you thought of it , how could she , living as she had lived ? Like a nun in a cloister . Never to decide , never to take a train and leave what you loved , never  --  Adrienne wondered if Aunt Thyrza had ever been in love . " You mean you hate to leave your friend Gerald , " Thyrza ventured , half mockingly . Adrienne had written about Gerald . Thyrza was not sure about him . " Well , of course , " Adrienne admitted , " Gerald is a comfortable sort to have around . " Good heavens ! Comfortable ! Had she ever had a moment 's comfort from Gerald Leybach ? Had it not always been as it was now , a bitter combat , her pride against his pride , ambition against ambition , desire against desire ! But Thyrza could never have known the meaning of love like hers . " I 'll miss him lots , " she continued calmly , " going about to exhibitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so much ? " " Yes . " ' the little bitter monosyllable hung heavy in the air . Thyrza felt its weight , and sighed . She had wondered about this painter chap in Chicago , pondering Adrienne 's guarded phrases . Now , in one short word , she knew how it was . But you can not ask a woman whether the man she loves loves her in return . " What does Gerald think of the fellowship ? " she asked , feeling her way cautiously . " He does n't know I may get it , " Adrienne answered . " I wrote to him night before last , but of course I have n't heard yet . He had to go over to Columbus for a few days . So he does n't know . " The spurt of volubility thinned away , and Adrienne sat silent , elaborately smoothing the ash off her cigarette against her plate . But now he knew ! She tried to imagine him reading her letter , seeing through her pretenses , a smile starting in the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " said Thyrza , " then he does n't knowyou 've applied fur the fellowship . " " I mentioned it to him , " Adrienne said casually . " He did n't think much of it . " She remembered his laughter . It had happened on one of those cold days when their love was at its lowest ebb . They never quarrelled , but at these times they drew apart , tired and puzzled , and Adrienne thought of the end . On such a day she had heard of the opening and had applied for the fellowship . That night she had told him of it , rather defiantly . And Gerald had laughed . " You wo n't get it , " he had said . " You do n't want it in the least . You will stay here with me . " Adrienne herself laughed now . " Gerald 's not much of a feminist , " she said . " He admires me immensely , but as an architect  --  pf ui ! " " I 'd show him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Gerald creeping over her . To control herself she rose and began to carry away the dishes . A man  --  one of those men who despise women and ca n't live without them , who expect a woman to crawl about . Thyrza set the coffee pot down hard on the kitchen stove . She was getting to be a narrow-minded old maid . It was forty years since she had said good-by to her lover at the door of this very house . Through those years a slow corrosion in her heart had worked unchecked . The ruin was complete , she thought , as she felt in herself the wish that Adrienne should lose her lover , should be cast adrift to make her own place in life . For how could she wish that for Adrienne  --  how could she wish it for any girl , remembering her own youth ? The thought of George Winters cut through her like a knife , and to dispel it she went back into the sitting room where Adrienne was . Adrienne was sitting on the floor before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " there 's no one like Toby . " Her long white fingers buried themselves in the black fur , while her eyes narrowed in the firelight . No one like Toby , she had said ; and she had meant , no happiness like the peace of quietness , firelight , unhurried meals , sleeping cats . Suppose Gerald should marry her ! Suppose they had a house , security , permanence , respectability . They could have children . " And Gerald , " Thyrza pursued , crushing out her rancor . " Is he so good  --  I mean , is he a good painter ? " " He 's a swell painter , " Adrienne said . " He 's been very successful , sold a lot of things . But aside from that , he is really good . He sees to the bottom of things . " Was that true , she wondered  --  she could not tell about Gerald 's work . In retrospect she could see his pictures , row upon row of them , brilliantly conceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bitter humor . But she knew that she never saw his pictures truly ; in each one she saw his face , his smile , his love . Still , he was successful . . . and if he married her .. . Thyrza dropped into a low chair and mended the fire . " Do you  --  ever think of marrying him ? " she asked boldly . " Frequently ! " Adrienne laughed . " Then you are engaged ? " " Oh , no , we are n't . " This would take explaining . Would Aunt Thyrza ever understand  --  would she ever understand herself ? " I suppose we 're very well off as we are , " she said carefully . " Of course Gerald 's in and out of the city a lot ; a home would n't be much use to him . He usually goes to New Mexico in the winter , sometimes abroad in the summer . And of course I 'd have to be in Chicago . " It wasall true . She had told herself so a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , domesticated as Toby here , the lion in him suppressed . The lion .. . Was it necessary for him to make this trip to Columbus , or had he gone to see Norma Thomson ? Other women . . . Thyrza would never understand that Gerald was an unsuccessful monogamist . " Men are selfish , " said Thyrza . " They wo n't make adjustments , because they do n't really care enough . Only for themselves . " " I suppose so . " Adrienne sighed , and rose to her feet . " All women , of course , are models of self-sacrifice and generosity ! " How could she have said a biting thing like that , when Aunt Thyrza stood before her , the kindest woman in the world ? " Oh , women , " Thyrza answered , laughing . " Women have no choice ! " Some women , she amended to herself , as she folded the breakfast cloth away . You could not say that of her sister , Isabel Archer , any more than you could say of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was herself ; there was Rachel , Adrienne 's young mother , who had no choice but to die ; and there was Adrienne . " It 's spring here , " Adrienne exclaimed , looking out the kitchen window at the upper pasture , where faint green was appearing . " I ca n't get over it  --  there was a foot of snow when I left Chicago . " " It wo n't last long , " Thyrza replied . " We had snow the first of the week . Spring here comes and goes . But its nice to-day . What do you say we go out and look over the farm ? " Adrienne brought two old sweaters from the hall , and they stepped out into the yard , with Toby capering at their heels . They surveyed the lawn , the vegetable garden , the asparagus beds ; they walked slowly to the end of the long grape arbor and passed through the gate into the lower pasture . " It 's quite a farm , " said Adrienne , meaninglessly , because she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the top of the pasture they looked down over the little remnant of the old Benedict farm , and beyond to the thorn-apple hedge that shut out the hubbub of First Street . " This is a lonesome place to me , " Thyrza commented . She had sold most of the old farm years ago , and recently the real estate agents had cut it up into small dreary lots . On every side the old earth that she had first seen in wheat fields and cattle pastures was laced with concrete streets and set with rows of small modern houses . In the middle stood Thyrza 's three acres , green and unkempt , a sentimental anachronism . " You could make a lot of money by selling this land or building an apartment house on it , " Adrienne observed . " You can do that when I 'm gone , " Thyrza said . " I like it this way . The neighbors hate it , but I 'm off to myself . " " That 's what I like about it too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream and the destruction of the Benedict kin . A breed of hermits  --  yet not that , either , for always , like Adrienne herself , they were reaching out for others , for the one other , the elect , to share their solitude . And it would not work ; they were not understood . Gerald Leybach had come near understanding , but not for always , not for Long . They sat down on one of the shelving white rocks that cropped out of the hillside . It was good to feel the sun on their shoulders . Uncle Toby lay in a patch of dusty earth at their feet , alert , watching some robins and catbirds in the orchard . " I used to play in this field , " said Adrienne . " It 's a good hill for sliding in winter . " " You and the Maddern young ones and Bob Hayward , " Thyrza reminded her . " Remember Bob ? " " I should hope so ! " Adrienne smiled . She used to be in love with him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now she did not know what had become of him . " What 's he doing now , I wonder ? " " He 's a road contractor , " Thyrza told her . " He married a girl from Illinois . They have three children , four maybe it is . " " Good Lord ! " Adrienne felt suddenly old yet half proud that she had taken the path that she had . She was successful ; she was beautiful now ; and at the same age Bob 's wife would be already aging , careworn , ordinary . Bob 's wife had only Bob ; and Adrienne had Gerald Leybach , sophisticated , glamorous , a personage . The personage had a private life , and she was the center of it . " People like Bob grow old quickly , " she said . " Yes , " Thyrza said absently . She must have grown old quickly herself , she thought . She had been old for centuries . Yet Adrienne had never been so young , never in her life so young as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to sit on these very rocks with George Winters beside her . She could see the young Thyrza sitting where the old Thyrza sat now ; the slender , dancing , vital body in the place of these heavy limbs , these sagging breasts , these hard , wrinkled hands . In this very spot , save for an interval of years , a girl that was herself had , on a June night , received a proposal of marriage and accepted it . " What are you sighing about ? " Adrienne asked , prodding her aunt in the ribs . " Just thinking , " Thyrza admitted , with a little laugh . " You look kind of solemn yourself . " " Thinking , too , I guess . It 's a fool thing to do . " " Yes . " Thyrza looked at Adrienne 's tired , intent face . The girl was sitting with bent shoulders , her long brown-stockinged legs extended in the sun , her eyes fixed on the orchard and seeing beyond it . The future ; Adrienne was seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highhanded way ; the future would become a present , then a past , and Adrienne would be sitting as Thyrza sat now , looking backward . " But you ca n't help thinking , " she concluded aloud . " It 's worst when you are in love , " Adrienne said . " I know , " said Thyrza , very low . Adrienne looked at her aunt with a faint unbelieving curiosity . " When you were my age , " she asked , " were you so much in love , too ? " She had not thought of it before ; it made her a little sick to realize that Thyrza , that a woman of Thyrza 's quality , had played for the same stakes and lost . " I was younger , " was all that Thyrza said . She got up slowly , feeling a stiffness in her joints , and hobbled toward the garden gate . How young Adrienne was , how incredibly young , under the smooth veneer of book-learning and city ways ! She was twenty-six , but she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thyrza , leaning against the gate in the sunshine , could feel the blood pulsing in her old wounds . Unthinkable years bowed her shoulders . She thought of the spring weather in ' 86 , when she had fallen in love . To look back over those days was like turning the pages of a book which , from numberless rereadings , one has learned by heart . It seemed to Thyrza that she remembered all the walks she had taken with George Winters , all the long summer evenings they had spent together in her father 's orchard , all the frocks he had admired , the flowers he had stuck in her hair , every endearment , every promise , every kiss . It had all ended years ago , before Adrienne was horn ; but she remembered it all . Thyrza started at the sound of Adrienne 's voice . There was the girl plodding up the hill , with Toby wriggling in her arms . From some mysterious fountain laughter had welled into her voice , young vigor into her step . " After the catbirds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an anti-social beast , an enemy of society . Got no sense of right and wrong . Have you , Toby , have you , have you ? " She squeezed the old tom cat hard against her body and ran down the garden path with his claws digging into her shoulders . Thyrza followed slowly , smiling . After all , Adrienne was young ; Adrienne could suffer a wound and the flesh grow again with only a faint scar . She was so lovely ; there would be other men . It was not with her as it had been with Thyrza : one man and no other all her life long . Girls were different these days ; they must be different , harder and healthier . Adrienne dropped the cat on the porch and passed into the hall and up the stairs toward her room . As she ascended , alone , the gaiety faded from her eyes and she felt the old heaviness in her limbs . Something in Thyrza 's look came back to her . Aunt Thyrza had played and lost . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . You never knew in advance whether a move would be good or bad . The letter she had written to Gerald  --  perhaps it would end everything . She could not know . She permitted herself for a moment to think , supposing it were the end ! Beyond the hall window lay the hill , the town , the sunny world , outside herself and totally without meaning or excuse for being . France , fellowships , Gothic cathedrals , houses to be built , people to know ; all the senselessness of life . " It would be easier to die , " she said . The morning wore quietly on . Adrienne wandered from room to room , doing slight things , pausing to talk or to light a cigarette . Without confessing her uneasiness to Thyrza , she was listening for the door knocker or the telephone bell . She had asked Gerald to wire her , but perhaps he would not . To him it would be a matter of course  --  one way or the other foreordained , without room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was Gerald saying to himself , now , as he looked through her letter ? He might be saying , " Good Lord ! A fellowship in Paris that would separate me for three years from the girl I want to marry ? She ca n't take it . " Or he might be saying , " It is Adrienne 's great opportunity . She must take it . " She sat for half an hour over the morning paper , reading the murder rases , the stock market , the radio programs , reading anything that would Lake up time while she argued with herself about going to the attic . There were things she needed from the attic , but could she hide herself away there , out of range of the bell and the knocker ? " I do n't understand about the fellowship , " Thyrza remarked , as she peeled potatoes for lunch . " Did you say there are several candidates still being considered for it ? " " No , " Adrienne replied . " It 's been offered to me , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , " said Thyrza . " But what did you say about a letter ? " " From Gerald , " Adrienne confessed . " I thought I ought to get his advice before I actually accepted . He knows a lot more about such things than I do . " His consent , Thyrza commented to herself . " I should think you could make up your own mind better in athing like that , " she said acidly . She knew she was talking pure nonsense , applying the caustic gratuitously to Adrienne 's wounds . There before her sat a free woman , an adult , an artist , an emancipated intellectual ; there she sat like an Oriental in a harem , bound hand and foot by the word that a man might choose to pronounce . No , women had no choice . At noon they heard the postman 's step on the porch , and Adrienne ran to bring in the mail . Hut there was no letter for her ; only an advertisement or two , and a letter for Thyrza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Thyrza commented , as she finished reading Isabel 's letter to Adrienne . " Isabel 's letters are all alike somehow . " " I suppose she does n't have much to write about , just the grandchildren and little things from day to day , " Adrienne said . She had never found her Aunt Isabel 's family interesting . " She never did , even when Sam was in the Senate at Washington . " Thyrza folded the letter and was about to replace it in its envelope . " Oh , here 's something on the back  --  a postscript from Sam , I guess . " She glanced at the brief note in her brother-in-law 's scrawl . " He says , ' What do you hear from Adrienne ? Tell her if she does n't look out we are going to have another old maid in the family . ' " Humph , " said Adrienne . " That 's a lot for him to be worrying about . " " That 's his favorite joke . I 've had that to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could not begrudge Sam the fun that he had when for all those forty years and longer he had been married to Isabel . Adrienne looked at Thyrza , who had been an old maid since before Adrienne was born . After all , old maids looked very much like old wives or old mothers ; there was the same thickening line about the hips , the same flattening of 1 the breasts , the same soft , lined face and graying hair . Thyrza was a picture of her own future . Strange people , rude cousins , clumsy jokers like Uncle Sam , would be looking at her in years to come , and they would be saying , " Poor old Adrienne ! " and " Just cut out to be an old maid ! " And there would be no truth in it . " Well , it 's not a very funny joke , " she said coldly . " A thinking person would know that just saying ' Old maid ! ' does n't make a woman one . " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " I 'm not so young any more , and I 've certainly never been married . " Well , of course ; for Thyrza celibacy meant virginity . " Did you  --  you do n't mind my asking , do you ? " Adrienne hesitated . " Did you give him up because you could n't get away from home ? " " Yes . " Thyrza , had scarcely expressed it to herself in that way before . It sounded well . It must be true . " I had my mother on my hands , of course , and then there was your mother . She was just a little thing at that time . " " You must have wished many times that my mother had never been horn . " " Oh , no , I did n't . Not after she was any size . Before she was born I hated it terribly , because it seemed awful for mamma to get that way after Isabel and I were grown , practically . But after she came I could n't help but love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adrienne said firmly . " Perhaps if my mother had n't been born I should have been your daughter , " she said , and then lost herself in an effort to think what of herself could have survived that change in parentage . " No , " said Thyrza , " I should have lost him anyway . " That was inevitable from the beginning . For the thousandth time Thyrza thought , as she left Adrienneand went into the kitchen to cook lunch , how she had lost George and what she might have done or left undone to hold him . Never , since the summer night when she had made her choice and had become an old maid forever at the age of twenty , had she been able to solve this riddle . Thyrza had laid the table for lunch in the dining room , a formality in Adrienne 's honor . They sat down in the stiff chairs and began to eat in silence . " If I married Gerald , " Adrienne said suddenly , " we should probably be unhappy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lots of people are . But why should you be , any more than anybody else ? " " Well , I ca n't do much of anything . I ca n't cook , for instance . " " He 'd surely be able to hire a cook , would n't he ? You ought n't to have to spend your time in a kitchen . " " He would think I ought to know how , would n't he ? And children  --  I do n't know anything about children . " " Oh , you End of pick that up as you go along . " Thyrza carried away the plates and brought on the coffee and the early strawberries for dessert . " The trouble is , Adrienne , " she said as she sat down again , " that you do n't really know what you want to do . Do you ? " " I do n't seem to , " Adrienne replied . " It 's like this , Aunt Thyrza  --  the common sense of the question all points toward my taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just do n't see any significance in the fellowship or anything else . . . without Gerald . " " That 's just an idea , " Thyrza affirmed . She could feel the denial in Adrienne 's stiffening muscles , but she continued , " You get over that . I know how you feel , but that wo n't last . " Adrienne shook her head , wearily , and Thyrza was sorry for her . " You get over it , " she repeated . " Other interests occupy your mind , and it is easy to forget  --  comparatively easy , that is . But it 's later . " " The loneliness , " Adrienne offered . " Yes . It is better to be  --  married . For a woman , it 's better . " Adrienne felt impatient at her aunt 's halting speech . " You mean physically , " she said roughly . " It 's hard to get along without physical love . " " I suppose that 's it . It gives you a feeling of inferiority , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you suffer . " " I should think so , " Adrienne admitted . " That 's certainly a part of it . " That part she had thought of before , and she had settled it in a bitter summary way . " But there are always other men , " she indicated . " Yes , " Thyrza agreed . " That 's what I hope for you , that you will marry someone else . " " I will marry no one . Gerald or no one . " Adrienne leaned back in her chair , staring out at the pine trees . She saw the tragic map of her future as if it were laid along the straight line of Locust Street . She would not be able to marry Gerald . And she would marry no one ; she would live in utter loneliness till her very death , and every contact with other human beings would make her more lonely . " But I do n't intend on that account to live like a vestal virgin , " she said calmly . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , Aunt Thyrza , " Adrienne explained elaborately , " things are not just as they were in your youth . Women nowadays ? " She paused , thinking how she hated generalities . " At any rate , I , and lots of women I know just because we ca n't get married , we do n't simply suffer in silence to the end of time . I think a woman has a right to be satisfied as well as a man . " " It 's not very easy  --  not even nowadays , " Thyrza objected . " No , " Adrienne said , thinking of some days in the past . " But I 'm not sorry . " " You mean that you and Gerald ? " " Yes . Do n't you see  --  we were so much in love , and it was just a matter of course for us . I have my apartment , and he has a key  --  and it 's just the same as being married , prac-tically . " " Practically , " Thyrza agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adrienne said . " You 're thinking if had resisted him and ' held myself dear ' then he would have wanted to marry me . That may be so . I do n't know . But he might have left me sooner , and this way I have had what I have had . " " Far be it from me to say that , " Thyrza replied , " or to say anything except that I do n't know . " She rose heavily and began to clear the table . " You 're a dear , Aunt Thyrza . " Adrienne walked around the table and impulsively kissed her aunt . " I wonder if you still love me just the same ? " " You are all I have left to love , " Thyrza said , holding the girl in her arms . " And I want you to know that I want you to be happy  --  I do n't care how . " " Do n't worry  --  I 'm happy , I 'm outrageously happy , nearly all the time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her life . Thyrza dawdled over the dish-washing , thinking of the conversation she had just had with Adrienne . " The same as being married , practically . " Her niece , the child that she had reared so carefully , was the mistress of this strange man , Gerald Leybach . She had given herself to him without exacting from him so much as a promise . She was a bad woman . And Thyrza did not care in the least . She looked upon the spectacle of her dear child 's abandonment ; she thought how shocking the story would be to her neighbors , to her sister Isabel ; and she rejoiced . In the thing that Adrienne had done she found atonement for her own narrow life . " He might have left me sooner , and this way I have had what I have had . " Yes , Adrienne had had what she had had , and it was good ; for Gerald would leave her . Thyrza could not tell why ; there was no sense in the idea that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she knew he would do it . IIer love for George Winters had been such a love , and he had tired of it . There was a quality in that love , in the unstinted , unconcealed passion of women like herself and Adrienne , that was too strong for men of George 's caliber . It might he that there were men who could assay its worth , but George was not one of that number , and Thyrza was sure that Gerald was no stronger than George . " She has had what she has had , " said Thyrza , addressing the cat . " She has had that much , and you ca n't blame her . " Uncle Toby yawned deeply , and began to wash his face with a fine air of male detachment . Adrienne sat at the writing table in her room , holding a pen poised above an empty sheet of paper . What could she say to Gerald ? What was there , until she had heard from him , that she could add to the letter she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not after she had wrapped her heart in an envelope and sent it to him special delivery . He had it now , that utterly candid letter , and he could judge for himself . For the first time she had spoken to him without reticence or pretense ; " I would rather not accept the fellowship unless you wish me to . If I go , that will mean theend for us , and I do n't know whether you realize it , but I would rather have you  --  if you want me  --  than any opportunity in the world . " She had thrown herself at his head . She had let him see that her love was not a free gift , to be picked up or laid aside as he chose ; she had given him a glimpse of the snare that women lay for men , the net that must never be visible . Gerald would feel her bands reaching out to entrap him , and he would entrench himself in his freedom . Adrienne knew his feeling , and though she hated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of men to cherish freedom , and the way of women to desire permanence . In the beginning neither of them had thought of the future ; in their imperative passion they had taken each other without question or promise . It had been a deeply satisfying love . They had been lovers for three years , and to Gerald their relationship seemed perfect and timeless . They had made a marriage without responsibility and without faith . Adrienne within herself knew that if their union lacked these qualities it was because they were not in Gerald 's character , and no letter that she could write would implant them . She had known him long enough to have learned and charted all the faults and weaknesses that were in him . She had come to him a fresh young girl , full of romantic ideals , and little by little she had remolded her love for him to fit the man she found him to be . She had learned to demand few considerations , because Gerald was selfish , and to appreciate instead the impulsive gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she had been deeply happy . She had been so happy that now , as she contemplated the end of their love , she could see nothing but emptiness stretching down the years . He loved so to see her smartly dressed , to catch the admiring glances that followed them as they walked down Michigan Boulevard ; but for that , what motive would she have to look charming ? What pleasure would there be in reading hooks if she were not to argue with him about them afterward ? And how did one become accustomed to hearing concerts and seeing exhibitions alone ? Without his critical participation , the cynical enjoyment that had so often annoyed her to distraction , they were nothing . . . . Books , pictures , music , with all their delight made worthless . She had shared with Gerald all the good things of her life ; without him there would be left only the pleasures that he had never enjoyed . There would he only her work  --  he had never sympathized with that  --  and one other . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she first came to Chicago ; she was more beautiful , she was older and experienced , and she was  --  she would be  --  utterly cold . She was attractive now to men ; and when she was no longer engrossed in one man they would find her irresistible . They would pursue her , and one by one , without too much difficulty , they would overtake her ; she would enjoy them each in turn , and when she tired of them it would cost her nothing to desert them . And Gerald , in the meantime , Gerald would hear of her , and he would know that she was what she was because of what he had done . He would never respect her as an artist , no , not even if she achieved an international reputation ; and then he would no longer respect her as a woman . He could not respect her  --  Gerald , in spite of some laxness , was full of old-fashioned notions about women  --  but he must pity her . He would pity her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pass . And whatwould he be doing himself ? Wasting his life , neglecting his art , the victim of scheming women . Ruined  --  two lives ruined . Gerald ruined , Gerald a failure ! Adrienne saw it , and it made her own life seem inconsiderable . She remembered a certain winter night when he had sat on her sofa , a night when they were both full of mellow gaiety over some success he had had , some picture that pleased him more than his work usually did . You did it , Adrienne , " he had said . " If it were n't for you I should just be piddling around . Without you my life would have no center , no motive . I guess sometimes you think I do n't care much for you , but there 's this much you can always remember . Great art has a meaning back of it . I do n't know how great I am , but my work does have a meaning , and it 's you . " Not a month later she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been unfaithful to her ; she had suffered , and he had not cared . But he had come back ; he had repented ; he had repeated all his declarations . Some day , she had thought , he would go and not return . But that must not be . Without her he was nothing . He would realize that , sitting in a hotel room in Columbus  --  where Norma Thomson lived  --  and he would write it all to her . To-morrow a letter would come , asking her to be his wife , to bind herself to him forever . Adrienne dropped the pen and picked up a pencil and a ruler . She began to sketch on the paper before her an idea that had been hazy in her mind for several days . A little place facing the lake shore ; rough stone walls , a row of glazed casements on the north for Gerald 's studio , sunny rooms on the south for the children . . . they would have two children . The plan was nearly completed when Thyrza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware once more of time . Supper that night was a cheerful meal ; it seemed to Adrienne that food had never been more delicious , the old dining room , bathed in western sunshine , more beautiful . A band of yellow light fell across the bowl of marigolds that Thyrza had ordered from the florist ; red spangles caught on the edges of the glassware and dropped their reflections across the old flowered plates . They sat long talking , and Adrienne described the house that she was planning . " My last house , " she concluded , as she leaned back in her chair , watching the smoke float upward from her cigarette . " Gerald would want me to give up my work , and I should n't care so much . Sometimes I think , Aunt Thyrza , that I only took up architecture because I have wanted all my life to plan this house  --  a house for myself and my family . " " I should n't wonder , " said Thyrza , and thought of a time when she herself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Adrienne continued , " think of me as a modern sort of girl  --  emancipated , and all that sort of thing . But I 'd rather be just ordinary and be married and have children and live exactly like everybody else . " " Well , you are n't ordinary , " Thyrza replied . " If you were you would want all the time to be different . " " I suppose that 's true , in a way . But , oh , Aunt Thyrza , can you see any reason why I should n't be just normal ? I 'm not a genius . I can do my work , of course , but when I think of having just that all my life long  --  why , I hate it . If I were cut out for that kind of life I should prefer it , should n't I ? " " It is n't what you prefer . " Thyrza sat for a moment in silence , looking outat the western sky . " It 's just what comes . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth why you should n't be right . And I think you would be happier married . " " Much , much happier . " Adrienne in turn stared out the window , looking northward up the street which at noon had been a desolate map of her future without Gerald . To-night she felt calmly confident . With a little concentration she could hear Gerald 's happy laugh , see his blue eyes narrowed in smiles , feel his arms closing around her shoulders . The long , long years as his wife , as Adrienne Leybach . She tried on his name as if it were a new dress . A bar of music from a Chopin nocturne that they had liked together ran through her head , and she went into the living room to pick it out on the piano . Thyrza stood before the kitchen window when the supper things were cleared . A thread of music floated toward her across the hall , a tune half remembered and haltingly played , casual chords falling like drops of honey . It was a sad tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Adrienne 's moods were brief ; by now she might he in despair , and if not now , then to-morrow . Thyrza sighed sharply and fixed her eyes on the west , which now was banded with crimson and full of great clouds . " Rain to-morrow , " Thyrza thought , and a shadow of depression settled over her mind at the prospect . She turned on a light and went about tidying the kitchen , hearing still as she worked the stabbing notes of Adrienne 's music . When she had finished she stood before the black pane of the kitchen door , not wishing to join her niece and interrupt her playing . She looked out until the darkness cleared a little and she could see the shapes of things lying in vague misty moonlight . Some day it would happen to her . Some day her life would blink out and leave a dark patch . No , you could n't imagine it , but it would happen so . It was restful to think of death . most she would not have cared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , was the thing that held her ? It was the same that had made her cling to life all through the years . For the life of her she could n't say what it had been ; just now it seemed nothing at all , and yet  --  worth waiting for . When Thyrza went into the living room she found Adrienne sitting in the dusk , her fingers quiet on the piano keys . " Shall I turn on the light ? " Thyrza asked . " Let 's sit in the dark , shall we ? " Adrienne said . They sat down on the sofa beside the unlighted fireplace . Presently the cat came in and settled himself in the middle of the sofa , accessible to caresses from both sides . He broke the stillness with his loud , even purring . " He 's perfectly satisfied with us , " Adrienne remarked , her fingers gently rumpling Toby 's black fur . " He 's easy pleased , " Thyrza answered . " For a man , he 's pleasant enough to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is pleased he tells you . " " Food and love , " Adrienne mused . " Those are not hard to supply . Most men are more complicated , and that 's what causes trouble . " " Well , even Toby requires careful handling . For instance , I would n't for the world have him know that I depend on him to catch all the mice . If he knew that he would consider that he had me in his power , and I am sure he would take an unfair advantage . However it is , the whole thing is a part of his tremendous vanity . He is a thoroughly selfish cat . " " I know , " said Adrienne . " Gerald Leybach is exactly like Toby . " " Most men are , " Thyrza replied . " Childishly selfish and cruel even when they mean to be kind . It 's becausethey do n't grow up . In other things they mature , but towards women they never do . All their lives they treat women as small boys treat girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess that 's so , " Adrienne sighed . " Everything has to come their way . But surely some men ? " " Oh , of course there are exceptions . My father was and so was yours . " " Dad was good , was n't he ? " Adrienne said . " I do n't remember him much , except during the War , just before he was killed . But I thought he was good . " " He was the kindest man in the world , and always was , " Thyrza replied . " Even when I first knew him ? he was just a boy in college then . I suppose he had been brought up that way . But then , he had to be , with your mother . She was so young and rather delicate , and I guess I had spoiled her . " " That 's always the way  --  it 's the spoiled , demanding women who bring out the best in men . Next time , " Adrienne said contemptuously , " next time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't , " Thyrza answered , laughing . " You will treat the next one just as you have treated Gerald , and you will get the same return  --  probably . " " I do n't think there 'll be a next one , " Adrienne said somberly . " If this is the end for us I shall throw myself into my work , and only you will ever know that that is n't what I have chosen . And I wo n't be interested in men . " " Maybe , " Thyrza admitted . " But you 're only twenty-six , and my guess is that you will keep on chasing after your idea of what love ought to be . " " Well , I sha n't find it , " Adrienne said conclusively . " It would only be a wild goose chase . " " What else is life ? " asked Thyrza . " What else but slaving for something in the future , something you imagine  --  something , if you could see it , that you would n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the hall . Adrienne could hear her locking doors and turning furnace drafts , settling the house for the night . It was bedtime ; the day had gone , and no word had come from Gerald . Adrienne dropped her head on the sofa arm with a shudder of disappointment . The future . . other men ... better men . . . and no Gerald ! Gerald away from her , Gerald in Columbus with Norma . . . . She would have traded her future away to have lain in his arms that night . Adrienne stood before the old-fashioned dresser in her room , brushing her hair . She pushed hack the lamp shades , the better to examine her reflection in the tall shadowy mirror . In the strong light she could see gray hairs gleaming in the dark waves , and she pulled them out one by one . The lamps cast their light obliquely upward , throwing into relief the lines of her wide , straight nose and her curving lips ; deepening the violet shadows around her eyes and the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in half a dozen years , there would be more gray hairs than she could pull out , and there would be hollows that would not disappear under make-up . You could not bold it , even a dark woman with a thick creamy skin could not hold her youth forever . It would be no matter  --  she could not wish to be young forever , and it would not matter , if only . . . But there is nothing in old age for a woman alone . How many times Aunt Thyrza must have stood before this mirror  --  in the old days it had been her aunt 's room  --  stood before it and watched , bycandle-Iight or oil-light or the unflattering morning sunshine , how her youth was going . Adrienne wondered how many years it had taken Thyrza to grow used to that process . Her hair had been slower to turn , but she must quickly have lost the glow in her delicate blond skin . Had the change been insensible and slow or had she wakened one day to the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years under the stigma of being the family old maid ? And how had she come , eventually , to treat her situation with casual humor ? " I 'm getting morbid , " Adrienne muttered and looked about for something to read . She picked up a smart little weekly , full of clever short articles , slightly off-color cartoons , and pictures that were brilliantly conceived and did not look too much like anything . Adrienne turned through its homelike pages , pages full of the atmosphere of her daily life , and read nothing ; it was dull and tasteless in this foreign air . She paused a moment to read an advertisement for a new kind of incinerator ; that was a thing she must find out about . There was a notice concerning preserved kumquats at a Chinese importer 's ; she would get some of those for Gerald . . . . Or no , if she gave up the apartment , had no more tea on Sunday afternoons , left Gerald .. . On the next page there was an illustration for a drapery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room hung with dark-blue chintz dotted with silver stars . What would you use with that ? " Oh , my God , " Adrienne interrupted herself , flinging the magazine on the floor and dropping the ash tray on it with a thump . " I 'm sick and tired of this  --  if he 's got to throw me over I wish he 'd make up his mind about it . People have lost their wits over less . " She snapped out the light and slipped down under the blankets , shivering as the damp spring air blew in at the open window . Gerald  --  Gerald  --  when had she ever had an hour 's peace for thinking of Gerald and wishing for Gerald and worrying over Gerald ? It would be a thousand times better if they parted , a thousand times better if he left her , that is , for she knew it was not in her to give him up of her own will . Better , much better , she argued bitterly and , arguing , dropped off to sleep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window The rainy morning was still gray and half dusky when Adrienne was awakened . For a moment she lay quiet , inclined to be cross at being disturbed so early . Then she remembered : at this hour there could be only one person at the door  --  a messenger with word from Gerald . She jumped out of bed and ran down the chilly stairs , pulling on a bathrobe as she ran , " Special for Miss Adrienne Mason , " the man mumbled . She ripped open the envelope and sat down on the bottom stair to read the letter . For a second she could not begin it . She looked at the familiar round script without reading it . How many times she had received letters that looked exactly like this one And always she had felt a wave of pleasure as she opened the envelope , followed by a vague disappointment over the contents . " My dearest Adrienne , " he wrote . " I 'll begin by congratulating you . Of course I am not surprised that you won the fellowship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " She knew he had . " It looks to me like a great opportunity . I know what your profession means to you , and you know , my dearest girl , that I care too much for you to stand in your way . I am trying to think of your future happiness . " You could not tell what he was driving at . Adrienne hurried on , skimming through his fine phrases . " Would rather have you in Chicago if it were only myself to consider . . . Happiest days of my life . . . Only woman I could ever feel was a part of myself ... But ? " He was coming to the point now . ? you are perfectly right in thinking that we can not go on forever as we are . It is not fair to you , for you have your life to live , and I have no right to hold you there . I suppose you have thought of marriage . " Yes , she had thought of it . " Adrienne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I do n't think I ever could be . You deserve a husband who will stick to you through hell fire , put you before everything else , give you security and peace . I think you will find such a man , but I could never be like that . " That was the end . He had written two or three pages more , but for Adrienne that was the end . She sat very still on the bottom step , clasping the letter against her knees She had said it would be better if Gerald deserted her , and he had done it . She was alone now ; she was free . Freedom , she had that . She had not thought of it before . Somebody said  --  Freud , no doubt  --  that when a loved one died the grief of the bereaved was tempered with satisfaction , with relief over the solution of one problem in human relationships . That was what she felt , perhaps . That was the meaning of the lightness in her head that made her feel almost like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newel post weaving slightly before her eyes . The silly block of walnut that had seen plenty of other Benedicts in their moments of crisis . Aunt Thyrza would be glad . She was probably lying there now , awakened by the knock and waiting to hear the word from Gerald . Gerald , the name that had meant to Adrienne the half of her life for years ; more than half ; there was only a little fraction of Adrienne sitting on the stairs now . She knew how a man felt when a shell took off a leg and left him living without a part of himself . She must go into Aunt Thyrza 's room and tell her . " Did you get your letter ? " asked Thyrza . She sat up in bed and looked at Adrienne 's face , guessing what the letter had contained . " Yes , I got it , " Adrienne replied , and marvelled at the coolness in her tone . " What did lie say ? " Thyrza asked , although she knew . Adrienne 's face looked flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the bed , and Thyrza put an arm around her shaking shoulders . " Ile wants me to take the fellowship . And I 've been thinking , Aunt Thyrza ? it 's a hell of a lot better . After all , I 've got my profession . " The sound of her own voice put strength into Adrienne 's bravado , and she hurried on . " As long as I hung around Gerald I 'd be getting nowhere as an architect . Particularly if I had children . It 's no use talking , you ca n't have children and succeed in any kind of work . " She reached for a cigarette and sat smoking , curled up on the foot of the bed , her eyes avoiding Thyrza 's and wandering out the open window . " It just would n't be right , Aunt Thyrza ; I 've got some talent , and I 've got a little start in architecture . It would n't be right to let that go to waste . It would n't be fair to you after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Adrienne was looking very white . After a moment 's silence she threw her cigarette at the open fireplace and sank back across the bed . Thyrza cried out in alarm . " Just a little dizzy , " Adrienne mumbled . " I forgot  --  smoking before breakfast always gives me a giddy feeling . Be all right in a minute . " Thyrza got out of bed and padded into the kitchen in her bare feet . Adrienne could hear her fumbling about . Presently she was back , putting a glass of something to Adrienne 's lips . " Drink it , " she said , with an arch smile that was somewhat out of place , Adrienne thought . " It 's some of papa 's  --  I keep it for sickness . " Adrienne drank the ancient whisky and sat up again , warmed and strengthened . " It 's good , " she said . " I 'm going up to dress now . Do n't look so scared  --  I 'm all right now I hope you do n't think me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say what she thought . Adrienne picked up the sheets of Gerald 's letter , which had got scattered on the floor , and folded them neatly into the envelope . She remembered , as she stuck the letter into her pocket , that she had never finished reading it . She would have to do that , later , out of politeness ; it was not that she was interested . No , she was not interested any more ; she did not care what shows Gerald had seen in Columbus , what friends he had met . For Gerald was a stranger now ; she could not know how long the blessed conviction would last , or whether it was only a passing illusion , but for the present Gerald was a stranger . Thyrza as she dressed quickly and began to prepare breakfast , heard Adrienne 's step marching firmly up the stairs , heard her closing windows and running water for a bath . The girl was suffering but she would not break down ; her wound would heal , her young flesh grow back stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , built like their old house , to weather storms .
