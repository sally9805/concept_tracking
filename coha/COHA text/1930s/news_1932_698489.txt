txt President Hoover 's economic rehabilitation program does not constitute inflation , as seemingly is the belief in some foreign countries , it was said today at the White House , with the explanation that the interpretation placed on the President 's policies abroad had been so erroneous as to warrant official correction . In Europe inflation generally means the printing of additional currency to pay for governmental expenses . The United States , it was declared on behalf of the administration , contemplates no such inflation of the currency as part of its program to end the businces depression . E iropeans , it was explained , in charging that the American Government was starting a policy of inflation , immediately visioned the overtime operation of printing presses turning out paper money . Administration officials were not surprised when informed that this view was taken in certain quarters abroad . No proposal of the administration , it was said , has the remotest relation to any such thought or plan . Methods With Budget Cited . Instead the administration , it was explained , proposes to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current fiscal year by the issuance of bonds , and will balance its budget for the fiscal year 1933 by increased taxation , aided , probably , by some cuts in expenditures . Other steps , such as the creation of the $2,000,000,000 Reconstruction Finance Corporation , soon to be organized , will be taken to liquidate credit in American financial institutions . None of these courses , in the view of the President and other administration officials , constitutes inflation . Officials , in fact , have avoided use of the word " Inflation " in connection with any part of the President 's reconstruction program . In his speech in New York City last night , Ogden L. Mills . Under-Secretary of the Treasury , spoke of the " spectre of inflation , " and asserted that critics of the President 's program failed to distinguish between inflation and the arresting of a deflationary process which had gone to extreme lengths . The term " inflation " is in common use among Senators and Representatives , however , including those who support the administration 's program as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Capper , Republican , of Kansas , in a radio speech today expressed the belief that a moderate inflation was . necessary . " Confidence will help some , but we need some more dollars in circulation , " Senator Capper said . " More dollars in circulation mean cheaper money ; that means higher values for commodities , for labor , for evidences of wealth . More dollars in circulation will give more jobs , will enable debtors to pay interest on their debts , will enable taxpayers to pay their taxes without forfeiting their property . Congress 's next job is to insure an expansion that will be the equivalent of a moderate inflation of the currency . " The Senate today receded from the position it took when its added a rider to the bill to appropriate $500 , - 000,000 for the capital stock of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , giving the Secretary of Agriculture authority to hire employes to set up an organization to administer seed loans to farmers as part of the $50 , - 000,000 allotted for the relief of agriculture by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider and would have sent the bill to conference , but the Senate , with Senator Norbeck , Republican , of South Dakota , objecting , threw out its own rider after Senator Jones , Republican , of Washington , chairman of the Committee on Appropriations , had assured Senator Norbeck that , if necessary , he would see that the Secretary of Agriculture received an appropriation for this work by some other methods . The bill then was signed by Speaker Garner and Vice President Curtis , and now goes to the President for his signature . Money for the corporation will be available as soon as it is organized through the sale of $350 , - 000,000 in treasury certificates authorized by Secretary Mellon . The appointment of the third Democratic member of the corporation will await agreement among the Democratic Congressional leaders as to whether they shall recommend a candidate from west of the Mississippi and north of Arkansas and Texas , or a man from the Southeast , according to information at the White House . It was explained that each section desires representation on the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision is reached . The Southwestern section received representation on . the directorate by the appointment of two Democrats , Jesse H. Jones of Texas and Harvey C. Couch of Arkansas . The Senate Committee on Banking and Currency will meet tomorrow to consider the nominations of Messrs . Jones and Couch and that of Charles G. Dawes . who will be president of the corporation . No opposition to either General Dawes or Mr. Jones is expected , and there is not likely to be any effective opposition to Mr. Couch , whose connection with public utility corporations has made his apponitment subject to criticism by some members of the Progressive group in the Senate . Representative Howard , Democrat , of Nebraska , who was once secretary to the late William J. Bryan , offered a resolution in the House to ask the President who recommended the appointment of Mr. Couch . Senator Robinson , Democratic leader of the Senate , when informed of Mr. Howard 's question , said that he had recommended Mr. Couch to the President , ending any necessity for action on the resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover is known to be extremely anxious for legislation to aid depositors in closed banks , no progress was made in that direction during the day , because of the necessary absence . of Senator Glass , Democrat , of Virginia , elsewhere . Senator Goldsborough , Republican , of Maryland , had intended to hold an executive session of a subcommittee of the Committee on Banking and Currency to discuss the Thomas-Beedy bill and to hear Senator Glass explain the liquidation feature of his bill for a general revision of the banking law . Reports that- the administration desires to have the Thomas-Beedy bill pushed are reaching the Capitol . The argument is made that this bill contains a concrete plan to aid depositors , disassociated from other features , while the Glass bill is a r general revision of the banking laws . with the liquidation corporation I merely a single feature . According ; to reports , the Glass bill is due for severe criticism , administration Senators saying it would take at least two months to pass it in the Senate , and even then . not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Glass proposes to have his liquidation corporation buy the assets of failed banks , and have the government , in effect . conduct the liquidation , whereas the Thomas-Beedy bill proposes to make loans to receivers who would carry on the liquidation . Likewise , it is argued that the Thomas-Seedy bill proposes . a directorate of only three men  --  a Federal Reserve Board member , the Secretary of the Treasury and the Controller of the Currency  --  for the Depositors ' Relief Corporation , while the Glass bill establishes a control of the liquidation corporation by thirteen men . The thirteen would include representatives from the Federal Reserve districts and the Controller of the Currency . Assets Under Two Bills Compared . The assets of the Glass liquidation corporation to aid depositors in failed national banks and member banks of Chi Reserve System would be about $213,000,000 , it is stated , and the assets to aid non-member banks $200,000,000 . Contrasted with this , it was noted that the ThomasBeedy bill provides a capital of $150 , - 000,000 and additional assets of $600 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has objected to a part of the Thomas-Beedy bill whereby $50,000,000 of the capital would come from the Federal Reserve Bank surplus . He and others assert that Since the Depositors ' Relief Corporation would be an independent agency , it would be illegal to use part of the surplus of the reserve banks , which , Mr. Glass holds . are private institutions . Solicitor-General Thacher has ruled that the use of this surplus would be within the law . Replying . to Mr. Glass 's contention , administration Senators say that if there is a question of illegality about the use of the Federal reserve surplus the relief corporation could be financed entirely by an appropriation from the treasury . I from which the bill now proposes that $100,000,000 of the capital should ' be drawn . The liquidation corporation , planned in the Glass bill . would operate entirely within the Federal Reserve Board . Senator Lewis , Democrat , of Illinois , introduced a bill to organize a Federal bureau of insurance to insure deposits in national banks , with the banks to pay the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
