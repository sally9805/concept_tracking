WE HAD a slight feeling of un- easiness as we slipped our mooring at Falmouth early on October 4 . The captain who had brought us over from America had died , and we had had difficulty in replacing him . We had had to organize a new crew and bend a suit of winter canvas , which was delayed in delivery . Only such accidents kept us on the English coast in October ; only the fact that we had to sail our ship south or abandon her thousands of miles from home justified a Biscay crossing at this Iate season . But there was little visible justification for this uneasy feeling . The new captain was beside me on deck , the weather fine and clear , and the barometer hanging quite steadily around 30 as we stood out . We brought the Manacles abeam at ten o'clock , and here we set our log and took our departure . There was an easy swell and a light wind out of the west as we ran past the Lizard and Wolf 's Rock and dropped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gales we had encountered in the Channel had now blown itself out . I had determined tomake our westing early in the passage , so that we should have sea room in case of bad weather and an opportunity to keep clear of the dangerous cliffs and currents of Finisterre . As the day wore on , however , it was clear that this was not going to be an easy matter . By evening the wind out of the southwest had already reached force 4 on the Beaufort scale and was freshening . The short chop of the Channel had given place to a succession of long , sweeping Atlantic gray-backs . The barometer was dropping . Climbing the companionway to a midnight watch , I passed the barometer and saw that it had moved down twotenths . On deck , one quick glance showed me that we were carrying all working canvas and charging westward , but the going was heavy . Overside , the first impression was that of a rather heavy sea , broken waves sending a lop of spray aboard Gradually I was aware that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . The waves we saw were just surface waves . They were simply riding over the top of great even , mountainous swells that came piling up out of the southwest . Such swells are created by storms at a distance ; they travel faster than the storm ; they are sometimes the precursors of bad weather . I remember thinking this as I turned to take the watch from the Captain . We stood looking overhead , where hung a high , gray pall against which dense , dark masses of clouds were moving rapidly . As these dark clouds swept over us , squalls of wind hit us . Kinkajou bent to them and shook and leaped ahead , climbing for long moments up a gray slope and then sliding , sliding , down an interminably sinking hill . " Captain , it looks as though we are in for some bad weather . " " I do n't like the look of it much . But the worst of it may be blown out before it reaches us . " " Need we shorten sail before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's only the squalls that are heavy and they do n't seem to have the weight in them that they did an hour or so ago . " " All right , Captain , I 'll call you if it gets worse . " It did get worse , and by morning we were under shortened canvas , making a few painful miles to the westward whenever the gale let us , and finding ourselves all but hove-to when it was blowing its worst . There was a dull , gray surface over the whole of the sky , and the even , unearthly light fell on fantastic moving mountains of water . Yachtsmen talk about their vessels being dry in a storm ? going through a blow without taking a drop of water . I 'm sure that this is just a relative term which seamen use . In a full gale or in a hurricane dryness is impossible . I know that once the gale was well established , Kinkajou was wet , though at that time we had taken no solid water aboard . The force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the crests of the waves . It shaved the tops off them and sent a horizontal volley of drops over our decks that stung like bullets . High above our deck our sails were soaked with spray , and runnels of water blew out of the leeches . All about the ship vision was obscured by spindrift and gray water fumes . The air was full of sound . At first the sound is impossible to analyze . You are simply conscious that many noises are blended in one great uproar . This uproar accompanies you wherever you go . The wind , of course , has already choked up all ordinary utterances . Even shouted orders are taken out of your mouth as they are formed and carried aloft with the spindrift . Your voice is painfully weak , lost in this vast symphony . It is only later , crouched in the lee of a deckhouse , waiting your trick at the wheel , that you have opportunity to observe the components of chaos . There is , of course , the howl and scream of the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds about a house during a high winter storm . But , in addition to this , there are the special noises of the sea : the low , heavy thrumming noise , set up by the vibration of the rigging . Our taut-set backstay runner had an insistent ominous note of its own . All during the gale it kept up a low moaning , and when the worst of the squalls hit us , its pitch would rise into a weird chant . From the sea itself there come two sorts of sound : the slap and thunder of the waves that strike along her side ; and behind these the continuous roaring undertone of the waves that break about us without reaching us . Then it 's your watch below . You must shove back the hatch slide , duck down , and close it again as rapidly as possible . At first you feel that you have come into peace and quietness , but you have merely exchanged one order of clamor for another . The tumult of wind and waves is dimmer , and the whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house . But the thrumming of the masts and rigging is carried down into the hull and reverberates there as the sound of the strings echoes in the body of a violin . There is some noise from the motor turning slowly to improve our steerage way . But its rhythm varies in speed as the vessel labors up the side of a wave or plunges rapidly and distressingly into a valley . There is added also all the noise from the body of the ship herself . For no vessel , no matter how well built , can stand this buffeting without speaking her mind about it . There is a great , dull boom forward , sensed as a concussion rather than as a sound , as an unusually heavy wave strikes her on the weatherbow . There 's a momentary shock , and the vessel shakes herself as she gathers headway again and begins nosing over the crest . " That shook me up , but we 'll go on , " she says . Just after you think she has come dry through that attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , a thunder of falling water on the deck , a sloshing about as she clears through the freeing ports . We took some that time ! We had reckoned on storms but nothing of this magnitude . " I 'm all right , " said my wife , " but this seems more than we bargained for . Ca n't we get out of it for a while ? Is n't there a port we can run into ? " " There is n't , I 'm afraid . We 're beyond the British Isles . We 've made a good deal of our westing and we 're two hundred miles from Falmouth , but I 'll call the Captain and we 'll take stock of the situation . " In oilskins and dripping sou'wester , Captain Carter came and sat on the companionway steps . He was quietand slow of speech and relatively cheerful . " Captain , " I said , " these are your home waters . What do you think of the weather ? Should we run for a port ? " And the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may hang on , it might blow out even before we can run back to port . There is nothing good in the Scillys and they are almost as far as Falmouth . I do n't like the French ports ; there are dangers off them , and the tides are terrible , particularly in bad weather . And then you 're worse there , for there 's more westing to make when you start again . " Georgia asked , " Is the ship all right ? Shall we get through this ? " " Oh , the ship 's all right . She can stand it . How about you , madam ? We 'd be easier running . " Georgia looked at me and shook her head . " No , Captain , we do n't want to do it all over again , and it may blow out soon . " So that was settled . Even while we were talking , sunlight began to come through the cabin ports . I went back on deck with the Captain . Unexpectedly the sky had cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . We entered the wind in our log as force 8 , for both the Captain and / had a feeling that the tendency in a small ship was to exaggerate our estimates of wind and sea . Later we learned that another ship near at hand gave a conservative estimate of force 10 , and that the English and Irish coasts close by us recorded full storms and wind speeds varying between 70 and 90 miles an hour . II Do you know what wind speeds of even 60 miles an hour mean at sea ? They choke the breath in your nostrils . You have to turn year head or shelter your face to breathe freely and deeply . In heavy clothes and oilskins you make a great target for the blast . Even at 40 miles an hour you can fairly lean against the wind . Every movement is an exertion , yet has to be made with precision and caution , for the deck is heaving , and a misstep may send you lurching toward the lee-rail . A bit of canvas or rope not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gear like a block takes charge and goes bulleting about the deck till it breaks somebody 's shins or is mercifully ' washed overboard . For some hours that day it stayed clear , and the sea and sky made a monstrous spectacle . The sky was a deep , hard , vivid , intense blue , and the sudden sunlight was dazzling after so many gray days . But all this seemed unreal and incongruous with this fury about us . The changing blues and greens of the waves were translucent . Behind their outlines you could discern other moving , mysterious shapes . The great mountains of water went marching by the ship like warriors in white plumes . I suppose we all intellectually knew that the blue of the sky was too deep and too intense to presage real clearing and milder weather . Yet we all irrationally took heart . It was a game that was worth playing . Though many of us aboard were periodically sick and often uneasy , we turned up promptly for our watches and carried on . The fo'c's'le was wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pans . Though the cook was sick and the fire failed and no water for dish washing would stay in place and though even the pot of coffee had to be held on the stove , we still managed to get irregular bites to eat . Little Henry , the steward , was white-faced and wobbly-kneed but he smiled wanly and managed somehow to distribute rations . We all caught something from the determination and the fury of the weather and turned this spirit to our own account in going about our duties . But it was my watch below . No matter how much beauty or wonder was to be gathered from the scene on deck , sleep was better . I lumbered down the companionway steps , and as I passed the barometer noticed with a start that our glass stood at ! ? 9 ? 5 ' . That was n't too cheering . Still . . . " Look here , dear , it 's bright and clear on deck . There 's probably still some wind coming , but it looks a little better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the barometer . I 'll lie down here and if I do n't wake up you call me every hour and I 'll take a reading . " I thought that we might be encouraged by a mounting glass . We were on the starboard tack , and my bunk was to windward . It seemed too much of an effort to crawl way up there . Anyway I had to get up each hour , so there was no good shedding clothes . I pulled together a few deck cushions , braced my feet against the drawers of the leeward bunk , and wedged my back against the entry to the wash-room . " Let ' er pitch and roll . " Pitch and roll she did , and I tried faintly to sleep . First a suitcase that had been stowed behind the companionway steps escaped and came charging down on top of me . Then a square wooden box with a spare fourinch compass in it jumped out of its euddy and struck in the middle of my back . The catch of a door sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific uproar with each roll of the ship . I got it locked and had just settled down again when a drawer in my bunk broke from its retaining catch and shot across the cabin . It made a dent in the woodwork just an inch or so above my head . Before I knew it the hour was up . The barometer had fallen a tenth . Then I did some fitful sleeping . Every hour for the next four hours it had dropped a corresponding tenth . " Shall we run for it now ? " I would ask Georgia . And she would say , " No , we might as well stick it through . " She was right in this , for it was now our only course . It was too late to run . Our safety lay in working off to the westward and southward and heavingto when we had to . My memory of the sequence of events through the succeeding days is vague . The whole orderly routine of ship-life was cluttered with extra duties and fractured by emergencies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened other than the notes that went into the log . There was a Iot of work , and of course we must have taken food and done some sleeping , but the order of these events is difficult to follow . We went through them mechanically , and my memory is hazed with the tumult and fatigue . Even the familiar ship took on a fantastic , sodden , bedraggled air that made it hard to associate with the orderly vessel she had once been . Yet certain scenes and details come to mind with great vividness and I set them down here as I recall them . It 's midnight of the 5th . I am coming down the companionway from a trick at the wheel . We have been underway with a slow motor and a foresail set for steadiness . We have been making slow progress to the west and south , and my hack and arms are numb from the labor of holding the wheel steady against the bucking seas . My hands are cold and it 's almostimpossible to open them . My fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . The barometer is rising now as rapidly and steadily as it dropped . It goes back to 29 ? 5 ' and hangs there . The gale is blowing colder now out of the northwest . I grope my way into the cabin and fling my short oilskin coat in a corner . My clothes beneath it are soaking wet . I am conscious that my toes are squnching water out of the heavy socks in my sea-boots . The effort of struggling out of those boots is more than my tired will can cope with and I just drop into a dull sleep on the floor in the cabin . An explosion rings in my ears . It carries even above the noise of the storm and is succeeded by rolls of thunder . As my eyes come open I can see by the cabin clock that it is 1:30 . Without being told , I know that I am wanted on deck and must somehow get up there . As I come on deck the man at the wheel jams his body against the spokes and gropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved bar of metal . It 's a bit of the fore-sheet traveler that has carried away . This ring of metal holds the sheet-block to the boom and thus keeps the whole foresail under control . It 's gone now , and the foresail with its boom and gaff are swung outward and are crashing about in the fury of the storm . That confusion must be subdued or the sail will tear itself to pieces and the gaff and boom shake loose from the mast . I take the wheel while the seaman and the Captain wrestle with that task . As the men are grouped forward , the lop of a great wave sweeps across the deck , and their forms disappear in a welter of water and spray and foam . There is a little flat following a great comber like that , and I take this opportunity to bring the ship up into the wind . Her deck rises steeply as the next wave comes up under her but she takes no more water , and the water on deck clears rapidly out of the scuppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the boom and twice it breaks away from them before they can get a turn . Once two of them get catapulted across the deck and nearly go overboard . I rush forward and grab one of the men and push him toward the wheel , and we re-order our attack . Two of us go to the peak and throat halyards and slack away a good bit . For a while the flapping and confusion seems increased but we make fast and creep back to the waist of the ship . Then we watch our chance and jump simultaneously for the leech of the sail as it bellies over our heads . We smother it and can hold fast just long enough to get a hold of a reef-cringle . We heave this down , and the wild waving of the boom is damped . Now it , too , can be lashed amidships . Now we can lower away smartly and smother the canvas as it comes down . It seems a long , slow job getting everything made up and secure . Then there 's the fore-staysail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the old Norwegian . He has always been saying that we have n't seen real heavy weather yet . I shout in his ear , " Blowing now ? " " Ya ! Plenty . " I have just taken an amazed look around before dropping below . It 's a wonder to me that we are still all sound and all aboard . The gale from the northwest has been running for some hours now , and a new sea is working up from that quarter against the undercurrent of the old one . The waves have changed their shape . They are no longer orderly successions of crests and hollows , but confused pyramidal structures that tower up and collapse suddenly , so that you are conscious of the solidity , the weight , and the impact of great masses of water . The ship is behaving beautifully , but we ca n't dodge all of them , and every once in a while part of a crest comes aboard and sweeps the deck . This seems to me more dangerous than anything we have had yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just face dull , hard work . I 'm too tired even to worry . I just drop to sleep again . I see in the log that during his watch the Captain reports " continued gale and heavy hail-squalls . " One or two large stones are still melting in our scuppers in the morning and a heavy oilskin has been cut by their impact . . . I think it 's the morning of the 6th that the Captain has a weak moment . He comes to ask if we do n't want to try running off , taking a chance of working our way out of the Bay in more favorable weather . We shake our heads . Our decision seems justified . It moderates in the afternoon . The wind entries for successive two-hour periods run 6-5-4-3 . There 's still a terrific sea running . The cook has pulled himself together and got the rudiments of a hot meal , and Georgia and I are wedged together in the lee bunk eating in celebration of our respite . But the 7th is just a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and set a storm trysail on our foremast . Instead of swinging around to the north and east and blowing clear , the wind is back into the southwest , and we seem to be starting all over again . We are close hauled on the port tack . Somebody is pounding on my hatch cover . Even in my dull weariness I know this is my signal to turn out . By a glance at the clock I see that my watch below is but half up . " My God ! What is it this time ? " At least I do n't have to struggle into clothes , but my legs in my heavy sea-boots are leaden , and it seems an effort even to raise my arms . " Why do things always happen when I 'm below ? Ca n't those fools on deck take care of the ship ? " I 'm too tired even to swear . These curses just shape themselves in my mind and even as they shape 1 know that they are unjust for all hands have been called repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laziest sailor into willing action . After all it 's my responsibility and I 've got to get up that companionway . After a roil and a lurch the ship steadies for a moment . Now for it . As I step over the companionway doors and combing , my boots splash into a surge of water . The Captain is at the wheel . He is yelling something in my ear and waving his arm at the darkness , where the light from the engine-room fore ports just shows some of the men huddled in the waist of the ship . " See .. . broke aboard . Fo'c's'le hatch carried away . . . washed out below . " I shout back . " Have to run off . " He just nods . " Watch chance .. . ease foresheet . " We are into the wind , but the trouble is that the wind and the sea are n't coming from the same quarter . Even as Captain Carter is working his way forward , a great wall of water rises on our starboard bow . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall never rise before that wall collapses on us . And the hatch cover off ! Wo n't our bow ever come up ? In my anxiety I stamp on the deck , " You 've got to come up ! Ur ! UP ! " The base of the wave is under us now , and I can feel the whole hull heaving . Then the stem begins to rise , and forward I can see the crest curling mast-high , its foam a spectral green , like witches ' fire . It 's toppling towards us , but our bow is rising wildly now . The crest is sweeping rapidly aft towards us , but it breaks short , and only the boiling of its collapse comes aboard amidships . Another giant goes by harmlessly . There seems a momentary lull in the wind and just a vague , confused heaving of waves about us . Now is the time ! I turn around sideways to the wheel to get a better grip , and tug on the spokes to bring her about . At first she responds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the vague shapes of the men , their oilskins glistening . The foresheet is eased and now it is filling . There 's a strain on the mast , and the ship gives a lurch as she feels the sudden impact , but it 's only for a moment . She eases as we gather headway and now we are off before it , tramping white water under foot . It suddenly seems quiet . Where has the sea gone ? Our motion is easier and our deck is dry . The engineer has rigged our gangway light that we use in port , so that it sweeps the foredeck . The men have gathered most of the hatch from about the scuppers . They are fitting it together , improvising other board coverings , lashing down , covering all with spare canvas . At last the weary job is done , our ride is over , and we must come about to the seas again . It 's the morning of the 8th , and our gale is still holding . The fo'c's'le is washed out . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the saloon . It 's pathetic to see their efforts to find bits of half-dry clothing . And to see their cherished mementos of brief trips ashore floating around on the wash that is still slopping about across the floor . The galley , too , has taken its share of salt water , and the fire has been put out and rekindled half a dozen times this morning . The men are spread around the saloon floor now , wrapped in extra blankets . Some of the wash forward has swept under the doors , the carpets are soaked , and with each lurch of the ship little puddles of water are chasing themselves across the floor . The men have wedged themselves between overturned chairs to prop them against the rolling . They are too tired out to notice the noise and the discomfort . They are sprawled in awkward attitudes , mouths open , while the runnels of water slop back and forth about them . We have n't had a clear shot of the sun since our bright hours , days before . We have changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in our dead reckoning . The Captain is for a direct southerly course , and I am still for keeping up to westward . After ali this to run down and find that ae were still inside the line of the Cape and caught in Rennell 's current , which sweeps into the lower end of the Bay , would be too discouraging . All morning we have been waiting with sextants ready , hoping for a shot of the sun , however murky . Georgia knows that we badly want our position and when we do n't get it this seems to her the last straw . " You know , Len , I 'm just miserable . I do n't think I can stand any more of this . If we ever come to port , I think we 'll have to lay up the ship and take the steamer home . " Then after a little pause , " Do you think we shall get to port ? " It is pitiful to see her weariness . I must whisper her something encouraging . But how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insistent roar of the gale and when you have to jam yourself in a door frame to keep yourself from being pitched across the cabin ? How can you be encouraging when you have just come from looking at that appalling ocean ? There is no beauty in itnow : it is gigantic , gray , sickening . I must say something . I grip the lee board of her bunk and kneel down beside it . " Of course we 'll make port ; and this northern weather will be all behind us . Now , look here , dear , I know this is tough , but we 've got to stick it . There is no other way . We 've had as bad a time as comes to people even on a small ship , but it 's going to be better . We figure we have good sea room around Finisterre . Even if the gale holds , we shall be edging around to the southward to-morrow . Now , let 's forget it for a while ! " I grope my way forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sealed tin , a can of salted nuts , and a bottle of champagne . It 's impossible to bring glasses , but we share the drink out of a thick , china cup and , though we eat literally hand to mouth , things begin to look a little more cheerful . We fall to reminiscences of the summer and to speculations as to what is going on at home . By the time it 's my turn on deck again Georgia is ready for an easier sleep . It 's the night of the 8th . The barometer is rising now and for some hours the wind has been gradually shifting . It is blowing now from the northeast , and we are plowing along through a heavy , confused sea . It 's still mean going , but we 'll clear the Cape and how glad we 'll be to see the high cliffs of the Spanish coast ! It 's the afternoon of the 9th and we have been driving south by east . There is still a fresh gale , force 8 , blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on the chance that we were on soundings , I have let go the lead ? I30 fathoms and no bottom . We are all feeling that things are going easier and that we 'll come in 171 If now and pick up the coast , but chance still holds a trump against us . With a w eight of water in our hold , the engineer suddenly reports that the electric bilge pump has stopped working . We had taken a good deal of water forward during the time that the fo'c's'le hatch had been off . This must be got rid of . We man the hand bilge pump on deck , only to find that the suction pipe is somehow obstructed . This suction pump is now deeply submerged in icy water , but hurried search reveals that the shipyard that had this matter in charge had never provided a proper strainer , nor had they removed all of the wood chips after fitting our new engine bed . It is these that are now making trouble for us . We dismantle the hand bilge pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water back down the pipe . We break into laughter ! It seems a mad thing to do , standing there in the driving rain with the wild sea about us and the wash slopping about our feet ? pouring water back into our ship . But the mad thing works . The head of water washes away the obstructions from the pipe and for a time , pumping furiously , we throw a good stream . Then it clogs again and the operation has to be repeated , until finally the bilge begins to clear . In the gray morning of the 10th we sound-100 fathoms , no bottom . Wind still from the northeast and strong , though possibly diminishing a little . The Captain reports that we have passed shipping in the night . We must be near the coast . I insist on getting a definite position before we come in on it . The early morning light is gray and cheerless , but the sky has a kindlier look . Then on our port hand and up to windward of uswe spy two black dots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape on the horizon . Can that be land ? And those ships ? can we come near enough to exchange signals ? At least we must try . We select one of them and then make up to cross her path with all the speed that motor and sail can give us . I haul out the signal flags and begin to arrange our hoist . We watch carefully how the hearing of the freighter alters and how she increases in size . She 's a big fellow and coming down rapidly with the force of the wind behind her . She 's going by us ! No ! We 're closing on her . Up goes our ensign at the main peak and our code flag beneath it . She 's moving fast now and , to save time , at our port main spreader we run up the number of our ship : Bracing myself against the wheelbox , I hold the binoculars to my eyes and wait for the flutter of flags from her rigging . The hoist of our message is all ready laid out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international code that cries the needs and the news of a ship in a universal tongue . But does it ? We 've closed with the other vessel now and we 're running along beside each other in clear sight . She looks very solid and efficient plodding along . On her deck we can see a few deckhands moving slowly about the last duties of the morning watch . Probably putting in time until they can flog eight bells . But she flies no ensign . Nobody is running toward the signal halyards , and there is no sign that she recognizes our existence . Thinking we may be misunderstood , we lower our ensign and code pennant and hoist them again . There 's no sign from the other vessel . Then the door of her chart-room opens , and an officer in blue coat and white cap steps out on the wing of the bridge . Now he sees us . He has raised his glasses and is looking our way . We wave but draw no response . For a little while he stands in the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel is drawing away from us . Then he moves in from the wing , in a leisurely fashion and , leaning on the high rail , he looks down on his own foredeck . And that is all . The ship has drawn well away from us now and we can just make out a name that seems to be Santa Therese , but the port beneath it is a blur . We 're quiet , stunned . So this is all there is to the code of mutual assistance at sea . I look around the horizon again and see that in the meantime the second vessel , farther on our port hand , has also drawn ahead of us . There 's nothing further to do so I go below . Now the Captain is calling , " Please come up here , sir . The other ship , she 's put about and is coming back . " I rush on deck and sure enough it is true . The other ship is growing now every minute in our sight . And though she is a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In great haste we run up the hoists we have previously set and immediately add the in our port fore-spreader . We know time is valuable to her and this is no occasion to hang on formalities . She is quite close now , and already the flags are fluttering from her halyards . The Captain calls the letters off , Georgia , now sitting in the companionway , writes them down , and I dig into the international code book . Then I run for the chart and prick off the position , 25 miles off the Portuguese coast ; Leixoes , the harbor of Oporto , lies some thirty miles to the north and east of us . Hurrah ! I rush for the deck . There 's another hoist of flags now , but there 's no need to dig it out for she 's come around and we 're running along together , the Kinkajou hanging close aboard her starboard quarter . Somebody with a megaphone is standing in the wings of the bridge . At first we do n't hear and then the voice comes louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we help you ? " She is gaining a little distance on us now but catches our answer : " All right . No thanks . " Men are crowding along the afterrail in nondescript costumes , some from the deck , some from the engine-room , and even the steward 's department is represented . They are waving as they draw away from us . There 's her name now : Nice ship that , and good fellows ! We hoist a final signal . As she draws slowly away from us in the growing light there 's no doubt that the wind is moderating . Could that be a touch of sun showing on the water down there ? Then I bring the chart aft . " There we are , dear . It 's a day 's run to Lisbon but it 's only a few hours north and east to Oporto . " Georgia thinks for a moment , but only a moment . " Oh , if we 're all right let 's go on . I do n't like to turn back even a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
