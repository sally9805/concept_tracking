not riding in a carriage , but walking down a sandy road with a country girl by his side , and they both were too poor to ride even in a steer-cart . " Such crazy idees a feller 'll have , " he muttered aloud . " What did you say , Alvin ? " Ivy asked . " Oh , excuse me , " he answered hastily . " I 've got in the habit of talking to myself sometimes . " And they walked on in silence together . A few days after that Ivy invited him down to supper , and he went . She was dressed up in her newest frock , and Alvin himself had put on the best clothes he owned . It seemed like old times , sure enough , sitting at the table and talking easily about the crops and the people in the neighborhood and the plans for the coming year . " Wonder what poor Mr. Clem will do now , with Mis ' Addie gone ? " Dollis was saying . " I heard Miss Marthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that he 'd writ to his niece up in Richmond or somewhere to come visit him awhile . " " I do n't see what he wants her for , " Dollis mused . " Well , why not ? " his wife queried . " ' Cause she was down here a few years ago and I never saw such a harum-scarum girl . She 'd be out at daybreak , riding old man Clem 's horses up and down the road , and the country was scandalized . She did n't stay but a week or so and went back . " " Well , there may not be much harm in that , " Gertrude said . " Anyhow , I do n't like to see girls do that way . Do you , Ivy ? " her father answered . " Maybe she was lonesome or something , " Ivy replied in her kind way , for she would never say harsh things about anybody . When the supper was over and Milton had gone to bed , the parents retired to the main room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said they would sit and talk . " Why do n't we wash ' em ? " he asked , for he felt his old embarrassmentcoming on him when alone with her . " No . I 'll do that after you 're gone . Let 's just sit and talk . " But Alvin could think of nothing to say . At last she spoke up andP201asked him about his crop for next year , and he told her that he and Mr. Turner had arranged for him to have five acres of tobacco . " We 'll help you out with it any time you need us , " Ivy said . " No . I reckon I can handle the five acres by myself , all right . " " Yes , I suppose you could , but nobody else would be able todo it . " " Thank you , " he answered . And then a silence fell between them . " How did you like Sunday school ? " she finally asked . " Oh , fine , fine ! Goodness ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about the Bible ? " " I 've been reading it since I was five , " she answered . " Golly ! All them queer old names  --  kings and wives and prophets ! Your head must be just stuffed with them . " " It just comes natural to me , I suppose . I used to know all the generations of Adam down to Methuselah . " " Let 's hear you say them , " he said , with playful tcasingness . And Ivy laughed and began reciting sing-song , like a girl at a school commencement : " And Adam begat Seth and Seth begat Enos and Enos begat Cainan and Cainan begat Mahalaleel and Mahalaleel begat Jared and Jared begat Enoch and Enoch begat Methuselah . And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselahthree hundred years , and Methuselah begat Lamech and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years , and he died . And Lamech begat Noah and Noah begat Shem , Ham and Japheth  --  and it goes on like that . " " Good gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've already read the Bible through four times , " she said with innocent pride . " Did people really live as old as that  --  nine hundred years  --  back in them days ? " he inquired . " Yes , they did , for the Bible says so . " " Golly ! A man could get somewhere in nine hundred years , could n't he ? " " Now , Alvin , you 're thinking about your plans again , " she teased in turn , " so go ahead tell me about them . "  |p202And  finally he confided in her his dream about getting possessionof his grandfather 's old house down there , and building it up and making something out of it . She was surprised that his people had ever lived here on this farm , and seemed more pleased at learning that old Clay Jones had been a preacher than that he had taught himself music and knew many things in books . " It 's wonderful to think that your grandfather was a preacher , Alvin . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little touch of spirit . She let her eyes fall and sat looking at her dress . " Come on , " he said suddenly . " Let 's go in where the old folks are and we 'll parch some peanuts . " " Yes , let 's do , " she answered , rising . And when they had parched peanuts a while and talked about the next hog-killing weather , the coming of Christmas , and the time to start preparing the tobacco-plant bed , Alvin said good night and went away . Sometime later that evening , when Ivy and her mother were washing up the dishes , Gertrude turned to her daughter and said , " Has Alvin really rented some land from Mr. Turner ? " " Yes , that 's what he said . " " Then I reckon he plans to sort of settle down here . " " Maybe . " " Did he say anything about Thad ? " " No . " " Thad liked you , but  --  but Alvin likes you , too . " Ivy shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan . " Why , what 's the matter , Ivy ? " " Nothing , Mother . " " Did he hurt your feelings ? " " No , Mother . " And then the motherly Gertrude pulled her daughter 's bowed head to her ample bosom and patted her shoulder . " Aw , foolish , do n't be in such a hurry . Why did he buy your box ? Why did he come down here tonight ? ' Course he likes you . " The weather continued warm almost up until Christmas , andp203those farmers who had been trying to put a few extra pounds of fat on their pigs decided they 'd have to wait for the killing till after New Year when the cold weather would certainly come . And so work was generally slack and everybody had his mind full of Santa Claus . On Christmas Eve Alvin received a package in the mail . He opened it , and there was a Bible , on the fly leaf of which was written , " To Alvin from Ivy . " Touched by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy her a present in return . He thought of a nice toilet set , but found none in the stores . At last he had to go over to the drug store . " Oh , hello ! " said Boyd Collins . " Have n't seen much of you lately . " " Have you got a toilet set ? " " You do n't mean a toilet set ? " " I said a toilet set . " " I got some here for five dollars , but I suppose that 's too cheap for a moneyed man like you . " " Let me look at ' em , " said Alvin . He chose a nice one , paid for it , and went off up the road to Ivy 's house . " Here 's a little something I brought Ivy , " he said to Gertrude , who came to the door . " Wait a minute and I 'll call her . " " No , you need n't . Just give it to her . Say I wish I had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , he turned and went away . This exchange of gifts , he knew , would seem to mean more to the neighbors than it really meant to him . For as far as Ivy was concerned , Alvin 's heart remained a dull weight in his breast . And vet the more he considered her the surer he was that she was an ideal companion for some hard-working man . What was the matter with him ? he wondered . Here his whole life was set on becoming a successful farmer , and nobody in the world could help him work and save and build towards that end better than Ivy . And yet  --  and yet  --  all his feelings towards her were those of sympathyand pity and kindness . She never set his heart thumping or his blood racing the way the treacherous Rosa or Gracie had done . And yet she was worth a hundred of such , and he knew it . The weather turned cold after Christmas , and up and down the countryside the smoke of the hog-killings rose from the wash-pots and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lard-making and sausage-stuffing , and then the farmers would be back in the open again . In late January they turned their attention to preparing the tobacco-bed . Alvin chose a spot for his down south of the pasture where the sun shone warm on the side of a little hill . Day after day he grubbed and dug up the stumps and raked the earth . And then with the help of Les Gillam he worked a hundred pounds of nitrate of soda and cotton-seed meal and a little potash into the soil . When at last everything was as soft and fluffy as a feather bed , he and Les sowed the seeds , covered and rolled them . From the town of Dunston he fetched cheese-cloth , stretched it above and tacked it to the enclosing log frame to protect the plants from the insects and the frost . Spring was in the air . The underbrush in the woods began to be touched with little patches of dark green , and the twigs on the tops of high trees showed green oozings of little leaves against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foam of white lace , and the wild plum bushes along the hedges held their snowy limbs towards the friendly sun . The pink veils of the Judas tree were hung out through the woods , and in the orchard below the house the peach trees blossomed in radiant color . And then the pear tree , the dogwood and the apple trees in order , added their gaiety to the countryside . And the warm air at noon was filled with the droning hum of the honeybees . The snowbirds had disappeared from barnyard and field , and the sparrowswere scattered into the woods . The robins whistled and pulled worms from the soft damp earth close by the houses , and the yellow-billed cuckoo and mourning dove sent their hollow , dreamy calls across the land . The larks disappeared and the wild swift-flying turtle doves sat in the road in loving pairs . At any hour of the day the cows could be heard lowing in the pasture , the geese quacked and whistled by the branch , and the proudp205ganders mounted any little rise of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mates who had already begun to lay eggs in the edge of the brier and plum thickets . Every day or two the light clouds would discharge their balmy showers and pass away into clear sunny sky . The asparagus plants , Jerusalem oaks , and chickweed grew amazingly , and the iris and gladioli in Mis ' Addie 's neglected flower-beds stuck their thin green bayonets farther and farther into the air every day , as if an army of little warriors were pushing up out of the ground in a vertical charge . The elm trees on the lawn were covered with a myriad of little dewdrop pearls , and the goldfinches swarmed among them , picking and eating from morning till night and swinging ecstatically on the slender twigs like tiny children at play . Spring was early this year . Already the tobacco plants were two inches high under the netting , and some of the farmers had started to plant their corn . Old man Icca Purefoy shook his head in foreboding . " Old winter 's sly lak a man , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em a wad o ' frost . " And then in truth his prophecy seemed about to be fulfilled . In the last days of March the weather changed and a cool dry wind began to blow out of the southwest . The sky was swept clean of clouds except in the deep vastness where the faint slaty-gray strings of the mares ' tails betokened unchanging weather . The thermometerbegan to drop . At evening the sun went down with the orange glow of autumn days and the air was sharp with chill . The farmers were anxious about their sprouting seeds and went often to examinethem . But no frost fell , for the wind continued to blow night and day . Where the disc harrows had been run the tobacco fields turned white , and circles of little icy whirlwinds played the dust up unceasingly . The bubbling note of the whip-poor-will was heard no more at evening , nor were the wild geese seen flying north any more across the sunset sky . The bluebirds disappeared for a while , a few stray juncoes returned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the briers . The geese hovered their eggs more closely , and the masterful ganders paced restlessly up and down on their hillocks . The love-lowing of the cows ceased in the pasture , the screaming peacocks stopped strut- ting on the lawn and stayed close by the henhouse , for it seemed that winter was certainly back again , and the housewife 's vision of bushels of pear and peach preserve and wagon-loads of red cider apples began to fall . But still the wind blew and no frost fell . Then one night the weather grew almost suddenly warm , the wind died , and by nine o'clock dark yeasty clouds had begun to weave across the face of the moon . The farmers in their beds began to sweat and sleepily kick the heavy quilts off . Before midnightthe rain started falling , the first of the April showers . Now winter was over , and the world burst into life and song once once . In the intervening weeks Alvin had been busy , as usual . Thad Keane , with his mother and sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded by a Negro family from the Cokesbury section . The Negro 's name was Jim Massey . He had a little greasy yellow wife and half a dozen stringy children . It fell to Alvin 's lot to fetch them to their new home in one of Mr. Turner 's wagons . It grieved him no little to see his grandfather 's old place fallen into the hands of such a cluttering lot , and he determined more sternly than ever to get the place into his control within a year or two . The arrangements with Mr. Turner concerning himself had been concluded . He was to go on boarding in the house as before , and keep an eye over things , with the difference that now he had to pay fifteen dollars a month for room and board and had no salary to do it with . But never mind , he thought , when the fall came the advantage would be his . The long-expected visit of Mr. Turner 's niece Mary Belle was now at hand . Alvin drove over to Dunston to meet her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pert nose and freckled face and wore a kind of tam o ' shanter over her short hair , the like of which Alvin had never seen on a woman before . She had three or four heavy suitcases that followed her off the train . Alvin stuffed them in the back of the buggy and they started home . She bubbled over with talk and asked a hundred questions before they 'd gone a mile . " And what 's your name ? " And , " How do you like Uncle Clem ? " And , " What is that growing over there ? " And , " Everything certainlyis quiet down here . " And , " Do n't you get lonesome on the farm ? " She pulled a package of chewing-gum out of her purse ,  |p207offered  Alvin some , which he declined , and then stuck a stick in her own mouth and went on talking . One of her long-fingered hands was decorated with two rings , a little rough silver-looking one and a big green one that had a set in it resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expletives of excitement , disgust , admiration , or chagrin as they drove on . " Jee-rus-a-lem ! Did you ever see such a skeleton of a horse as that that went by ! " and , " Land of Goshen ! that chimney looks like it wants to lie down and rest . " And , " Good grannies-alive ! has the cat got your squaller , boy ? " And , " Oh , fiddlesticks ! " And , " Oh , shoot ! " she said when they came by the store in Linnyville and found Mr. Turner out . And for a few minutes she sat on the counter , swinging her legs and asking the amazed Carl Stevens a flood of questions . When Alvin helped her out at the front portico of the Turner house he was ready to agree with Dollis Chadbourne . What the landlord could want with such a relative as that around was more than he could understand . Of late , he had seen little or nothing of Ivy , and when the tobaccoplantingtime came on he saw still less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants , he preferred to work his land himself . With Mr. Turner 's agreement he hired Jim Massey 's oldest boy , Orus , to help him out , but he watched every plant as it was stuck in the earth and watered , as a mother might watch her child being handled by a suspicious stranger . Now and then he would catch a glimpse of Ivy in the field where she worked with others , but he never made a step in her direction any more . After that last meal at her house he had done a lot of thinking . He had begun to realize that his feelings for her were not those of a sweetheart and never would be , and so he kept away . Gradually it dawned upon the neighborhood that perhaps , after all , Alvin and Ivy were not to be married , and more than one person commiserated over Ivy 's lot . " Now look-a-there at her . She give Thad the go-by for that young fellow , and now he 's given her the go-by . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin . But little he knew of these things , for he never went anywhere except whenp208he took his solitary stroll through the woods on Sunday or walked expectantly about his five acres , minutely examining his plants and considering the next day 's work . Another thing that kept him busy was the lively Mary Belle . It seemed to be her way not to let people alone . She was always wanting Alvin to go down to the village for hairpins or toothpasteor powder or stationery or some trifle , until at last he had to tell her he had work of his own to do , and she blinked at him with her pale-blue eyes , twisted her thin lips in a wry smile , and said : " All right . Do n't bother . " Thereafter she took to driving down herself , though he would have to hitch the horse to the buggy for her . And then she asked him to help her fix up her room . She bought a can of paint and brushes and by lamplight at night Alvin helped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift furniture , and then reshift it . She never seemed to be still or satisfied . Sometimes she 'd rise up at dawn , go out to the barn and get one of Mr. Turner 's horses , and ride through the countryside just the way Dollis Chadbourne said she did . And dressed in a pair of outlandish breeches and man 's shirt , away she would go clumpety-clump with her collar open and her short hair flying in the wind . And the neighbors out feeding their stock by the gray morning light would stare after her , shake their heads , and say , " If I was old man Turner I 'd send that gal back where she come from  --  out running my horses to death like that . " Next Mary Belle got into her head the idea of building a tenniscourtout back of the scuppernong vine . And she kept pestering Alvin until he had to help her lay off the ground , hoe it up , and pack it down . She did her part as a worker , too . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Turner 's straw hats she hoed and fought at the iron-weeds with a will . On Saturday afternoon she called in Jim Massey 's Orus and they put up a high wire fence at each end to stop the balls . And then early the next morning she had Alvin out with rackets and balls to play with her . But after half an hour he was so disgusted at the whole business that in spite of her remonstrance he quit . Before long Boyd Collins began to come up to play with her . And after the games they would sit on the porch and talk or drink a brandy.  |p209And  sometimes he and Carl Stevens would come up together . And at night the sound of her guitar could be heard as she entertainedthe two sports . Boyd Collins ' loud laugh would shatter the darkness at some of her jokes , and Carl 's low snicker would follow after . Gradually it got to be the thing for the village girls and boys to come up to the old house and play tennis or sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor and dance while Mary Belle played the piano . And so life and laughter and joy came back once more to the lonely , silent house . But it seemed to make no difference to Mr. Turner one way or the other , for his mind was on his business in Linnyville . And then just as suddenly the opposite whim would take Mary Belle . She would stay in her room and read for days , and Boyd Collins and the young folks were turned away from the door by the polite Miss Marthy , who would say that Miss Mary Belle was n't feeling well this evening . From morning till night she would lounge and yawn about the house , shaming Alvin to confusion with her dress  --  long yellow silk trousers and a loose flower-woven shirt that stayed unbuttoned halfway down her bare bosom . Sometimes she would flop down in a chair across the table from him , her eyes squinted up as her face rested in her propped hands , and sit there blinking at him until in his embarrassment he could eat no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would drawl . " Go on and eat . I like to see you gobble it down . " " Did n't know as how I was gobbling , " he would reply , pushing ( back his chair . " I reckon as how you were , " she insisted lazily . And she would yawn , stretch her clenched fists into the air , and wriggle her slim body under the folds of her pajamas , as if she wished to be free from them . There was something about her on such occasions as these that reminded Alvin of a slender long-legged kitten . Then just as suddenly she would be all vivacity and tomboyishness again . And she would ask Alvin an endless stream of questions about his crop , about what he was going to do with his money , and whether he liked that girl Ivy or not . " You do like her , do n't you ? " she would say . And Alvin would mumble out some indistinct reply , wishing to heaven she 'd go away and leave him in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes . " Anyhow , if you do n't like her she likes you . " " H-m . " " H-m . I asked her . She did n't want to acknowledge it , but I could see it . Why do n't you go down there to see her sometimes ? " " I got a lot of work to do . " " You know in the old days they told about women who faded away for the love of some man who 'd gone riding off to the wars in Turkey . It 's true , too . Women do that , do n't they ? They still do it . " " Did n't know anybody had rid off to the wars in Turkey , " he would answer sourly . And then she would switch the subject and babble about the far-off cities she had lived in , New York , Philadelphia , and even Paris . " Do you know where Paris is ? " " No , I do n't . " " It 's across the ocean in France . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heap of money to do that . " And he looked up at her with interest . " Yes , I suppose so . But I had a little Father left me , and so I used it in the search for  --  well , searching for happiness  --  la-la . " " And did you find it ? " he queried satirically . " I guess I found about as much as you have , staying here and slaving on this God-forsaken farm . " " I like to slave on this  --  this farm . " " Oh yes , you do , " she jeered . " Say , Marthy , bring me another cup of coffee , " and Miss Marthy , who could make neither head nor tail of this strange creature , served her in silence . " And so you are happy , working here and sweating your liver out day after day ? Not on your tin-type , I bet . What good does it do you ? The first thing you know you 'll be getting old and your bones will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back 'll be bent and your eyes get yellow and dead like glass marbles . And you 'll be just like everybody else around here , whipped and beat down and ready for the boneyard . " " I reckon you 're plumb off the track now , " he answered frigidly . " Oh , am I ? " And her voice began to rise to a note of shrillness.  | I I " Why , boy , you folks down here are slaves  --  slaves to this poor old gully-washed land . And the worst thing about it is you do n't know it . It ruins everybody that touches it . Look at the lazy , ignorant niggers . Look at Ivy . She 's typical  --  thin and beaten and worn . Look at Uncle Clem . He was one of the most brilliant men that ever graduated from Yale University . Ever hear of that place ? " " No , I ai n't . " " Did n't think you had . He came back and settled down here to carry on the plantation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to creep over him like paralysis ; and every few years he 'd sell off a piece of his land to the bank or some hog like old man Dave Collins in order to pump a little life into himself . What is he now ? An empty husk with his nervous ahem and fiddlingways . And look what it did to Aunt Addie ! She 's like that ruined flower garden of her 's out back of the house  --  with its twisted boxwood , over-grown sweet flag and lost mint beds . Walk around there in the dews of night and your feet crush out the pitiful perfume of her broken , crazy life . " " Reckon I 've heard tell that folks go crazy in the big towns , too , " he spoke up sharply . " Yes , but all the big men are in the big cities , now are n't they ? " " I du n no where they are . " " Oh yes , they are  --  there where big things happen , where life runs in a mighty stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you leave here , Alvin , while you 're young ? You could go to night school and educate yourself to some trade . You might be a genius at machinery . Who knows ? " " I do n't want to . I belong here . I like it here . And , besides , " he went on with gathering feeling , " you can throw off on it all you want to , but farming 's the biggest thing in the world . The farmer feeds the human race ! " " You 'd be real fine-looking all dressed up in a gray suit and a blue tie and a nice soft gray hat , would n't you ? " she concluded with a sudden contemptuous laugh . " Good Lord ! " he exclaimed half-angrily . And then he went on , angrily : " And why did you come down here , then ? What is therep212to interest you about it ? Looks like you 'd no more come here than you 'd want to go to Alaska or somewhere  --  some un-godly place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for the last week , " she answered seriously , staring out through the window where the heat wiggled the air across the wide land like a billowy sheet of gray silk . " Well , Uncle Clem wrote and invited me , and I thought I might cheer him up a little bit , considering all the trouble he has . That reminds me , " she said , springing up , " I 've got to go up to the asylum and see Aunt Addie . So hitch up the horse . " Late that night she returned , and Alvin heard her telling Mr. Turner that Mis ' Addie was beyond any help now and did n't need any visitors . She sat all day long and never said a word . But she was harmless now , and the doctor said she 'd never try to kill herself again , for she had no interest in either life or death . " Ahem , " Mr. Turner said . " Thank you , Mary Belle . It was nice of you to go up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would n't do any good now , " Mary Belle answered . The next Sunday , when Alvin was poking around his field and examining his knee-high tobacco for any signs of worms , he heard a faint high call coming from the woods down towards the river . He looked around and could see no one . A moment later the thin elfin call sounded again , as if coming out of the depths of the sky or the air around him . And then he saw a red creature that looked like a pileated good-god sitting on the topmost bough of a high sycamore tree . And the woodpecker was waving a tiny white handkerchief at him . " Lord-a-mercy ! she 'll break her neck ! " he shouted , setting off rapidly down towards the river . When he got to the foot of the tree he called up loudly through its leafy thickness , " You 'd better come clown from there , you crazy thing ! " And in a moment she came scrambling down , swinging herself shamelessly out from the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop lightly at his feet . " I just went up to see how far I could see , " she laughed . " And way to the east was the water-tank and smokestacks of that town you met me at . What was its name ? "  | " But that ai n't Dunston . That 's that mill town of Irving you saw . They ai n't any such water-tanks and smokestacks in Dunston . " " And then you could see on and on towards the ocean . And sitting on that limb , I let the wind blow me back and forth , back and forth , I was feeling all warm and sleepy , and then I saw you coming across the field . " Sinking down on the ground she began singing , " Rock-a-bye , baby in the tree top . When the wind blows the cradle will rock , When the bow breaks the cradle will fall , And down will come baby , cradle , and all ! " Alvin kept watching her intently . " I bet you would n't a-cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked sternly . She looked up startled , stared at him , and then smiled . " You do n't mind if I smoke , do you ? " And as Alvin made no reply she pulled a little leather bag of tobacco about the size of a dollar out of her pocket , and then she fished out a tiny white pipe with a little yellow curved handle . " My land of Goshen ! " she said . " Do n't look so queer . Did n't you know I smoke ? " " I were n't thinking of that , " he said . " Still , I never heard of a woman smoking a pipe , " he presently added . " It 's the best smoke there is . I took it up when I lived in Paris . My friends over there always said it was cute . " Then Alvin remembered that often when she was near him at the table or brushed by him in the hall he had smelled her funny , smoky breath . She lighted her pipe and puffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began tossing stones through the trees into the river . " Sit down , Mr. Baseball Pitcher , and talk to me . I need it . " " Ych , you do , but I got nothing to say . " " You 're keener than I thought , Alvin. " 1 le made no reply to that . Finally he sat down against the bole of the great sycamore tree and watched her . " Did I ever tell you about living in Paris ? " " Yes , the other day you said you had . " " Well , I was over there in school for two years . I had a friend . 1 ) i ( 1 I ever tell you about my friend ? "  | " No . " " He was going to be a great painter and I was interested in music , and so we got along fine together . I lived with him for a couple of years . " Her voice died out and she began digging in the ground with the stem of her pipe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm through smoking , anyhow , " and she kept on digging . " What became of him ? " Alvin asked , after it seemed she had no interest in speaking again . " Oh , he found out he was n't so great , and he went back to his folks to work at a bank . Then I found out I was not so great in music and I too drifted back home . " " Where 's your husband now ? " " Good grannies ! He was n't my husband . " Alvin stared at her uncomprehendingly . She laughed and showed her level , slightly discolored teeth , then with a quick wriggling of her body came over and sat by him . " You think I 'm a crooked woman  --  like one of those that stay in a bawdy house , do n't you ? " And she rested her elbows on his knee . Alvin shook his head . " Now do n't look at me so terrible . " " Does Mr. Clem know about that  --  that fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no use telling him , but I would n't mind . " " Let me give you some advice  --  do n't you ever tell anybody else about that . " " Well , I 'm not ashamed of it , " she answered with some spirit and drew her arms from across his knee . " The thing I 'm ashamed of is that he did n't turn out to be a Rembrandt and that I failed to be a Clara Schumann . " " Who were they ? " " Oh , some great folks lived a long time ago . You would n't be interested in them . And so it is that I go tinkling on the guitar for such fools as Boyd Collins and Carl Stevens . You 're worth a thousandlike them . " And rising on her knees , she suddenly turned and kissed him full on the lips . Before he could speak she jumped backp215and sat propped up by her hands behind her . " Now what you think ? " she said in a little hard , dry voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me feel like a  --  er  --  a fool , " he stuttered with crimson face . She kept looking at him without saying a word , and gradually the depths of her eyes and the corners of her eyelids hardened into introspective narrowness . " Shoot ! You are just a new-born baby , are n't you ? " she muttered in disgust . " Well , if you act like that , many a man would n't be as polite to you as I am , " he mumbled . " Maybe I do n't want to be treated polite . " And then she laughed again , a little spiteful , metallic ring in her voice . " I 'm sorry I kissed you , Alvin . I 've wanted to lots of times . I bet other girls have , too , have n't they ? Many a night I 've lain awake there in the house thinking of you there over the kitchen , sleeping all alone . Last night I was about to get up and tiptoe down there where you slept . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I do , too . It was remembering how you looked the other day when you said you thought farming was the biggest thing in the world . That kept me from it . Now , would n't you have been surprised if I had come slipping in to sleep with you ? But do n't let it scare you  --  I did n't do it and I wo n't do it . Some other woman will have to teach you wisdom . I would hurt you , maybe ruin your golden , shining , wonderful future , and  --  and you might hurt me , too . Do you know why I like you ? " she went on . He said nothing but kept staring off towards the river , which showed in little patches through the trees . " Because you 're lonesome like me . You 're huntingfor something and I 'm hunting for something . Ivy does n't tellLitt what it is any more than that fool Collins tells me what it is. aybe you 'll find what you 're looking for  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hope so . How old are you ? " " Twenty , " came the muffled reply . " I 'm twenty-one and I feel about forty . Four years ago I gave my big recital . The world was full of the singing of birds and I was the queen of butterflies dancing from flower to flower . You know what I mean . The papers said I had a great future , and I was carried away with my own greatness . Then I went abroad , and gradually the bitter truth came to me . I was second rate . I 'd never climb to the top and look out over the world spread below mc . Proof of it was I chose a second-rate man . But you 're first rate , Alvin . There 's a fire burning in you  --  something . And you know , " she continued , now looking up at him in frank kindliness ; " as I gradually got to know you a crazy idea began to develop in nay mind  --  except that it was n't crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to tell it , " he murmured , still without looking at her . " I was going to get you to go away with me . " " Go away with you ? " And now he looked at her hard and searchingly . She had suddenly become a stranger to him , and once more the old doleful feeling came over him . Ah , these people , deep and strange , mysterious beyond all reckoning . Always things ran in their minds clean out of reach of his grasping . " Yes , go away with me to New York  --  somewhere . I have enough for two to get along on . And there , away from this certain death and slavery , you would go to school and I would help you all I could . And some day you 'd be the great man you want to be . " " Good gracious ! " he murmured , now almost speechless with amazement . " You see it 's not crazy , after all , except that it will never hap-pen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , " he exclaimed . And then he went on with miserable lameness before the queer look in her face : " You  --  you  --  No , maybe it was nice of you to think like that , anyhow , and I ought to appreciate it . Yeh , I do , Mary Belle , " he concluded kindly . " But I got to stay here  --  on the land . " " I know you will . I knew after that day we talked at the table . If I were a bigger woman myself I would find some way to help you just the same , but I know I ca n't . And so , " she continued in a hollow tone , " they 'll sink you in the lonesome lowland low , sink you in the lonesome sea . " " What do you mean by that ? " " Just what I said about the worn-out wheel . And me , too ? Yes.  |p2171-la  ! the world spread out at my feet or at the feet of the man I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bitter laugh . " Maybe that 's why now , instead , I climb to the tops of sycamores and look out across this God-damned Little Bethel Country ! Come on . Let 's go home . " And springing to her feet , she held out her hand . " I 'm leaving tomorrow . " And so she did . Mr. Turner urged her to stay , but she kissed him quickly and said she had to get back to work again . " What sort of work  --  ahem ? " " Why , my music . I 'm devoted to it . Do n't you know that ? I 've been away from it so long , so long . " Alvin drove her back to Dunston , and they covered the twenty miles with hardly a word between them . And as he put her bags on the train she looked down and smiled at him . " Ah , Alvin , " she said , " I 'll miss you . You 're the one thing in Little Bethel that 's worth remembering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " " Thanky , thanky , " he mumbled without getting the drift of all her words . " And I hope you get all the land and the houses your heart craves , and that you 'll be happy and that you 'll live a hundred years , for I wo n't see you any more , no and I wo n't . And when you come down to die , turn your face toward the rising sun , the rising sun , Alvin . Cling to your one gallus and your freedom , boy , for that 's all you 'll have . This desolate , empty land will rob you of that if you do n't watch out . But the rising sun , Alvin , let it be on your sweet face , your baby face . Oh , Jerking Judas ! I 'm about to cry . Good-by , good-by . " And she hurried into the train . For several years Alvin continued to think of Mary Belle as a bit queer and , if the truth were known , somewhat off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ahead , far beyond his visioning , when he would remember her words and find some of them making sense.  | I T WAS the latter part of May now , and in the sweaty , sultry days the tobacco grew by leaps and bounds . The farmers worked unceasingly from daybreak until dark , plowing and choppingout the weeds and scrutinizing each plant for signs of the dreaded tobacco worm . And besides , there were a thousand other things to do . The corn must be regularly plowed , chopped , and sided , and the young cotton likewise . So far the weather had been ideal , turning in a regular clock-like round  --  hot sun for three or four days that brought the salt out on your back , and then a shower , sun again , and a few days later another good steamy shower . Alvin 's tobacco was the equal of any in the neighborhood , knee-high and like thick green silk . And why should n't it be , for he hardly slept away from it . He would be up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow , the latter job being recently taken on to help Miss Marthy . And then , after a hurriedlysnatched breakfast , he 'd take his mule or his hoe and lope into the fields . At noon he dashed to the house for a bite and then back again , there to remain till darkness drove him in . Around the first of June the rain began to fail . Alvin , like most farmers , was sensitive to the changes in the weather , and he watched the heavens apprehensively . That blue infinite sky without a shred of cloud in it looked surprisingly like dry weather . A week went by and his certainty increased . All the plowing had been caught up with . The five acres stood as clean as a flower-bed , the suckers were all pulled , and no worms came to trouble the plants . A second week went by and Alvin , with anguish , saw his crop slow down in its growing . Up and down the neighborhood the drought became the one topic of conversation . When was it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after day the hot empty breezes blew from the southwest , sucking the moisture out of the earth . The little branch by the pasture ran slower and slower , finally ceased to run altogether andp219stood in little brackish puddles so foul the cows would hardly drink from them . The creek shrank down to a narrow rivulet , and even the mighty Cape Fear River itself dwindled to half its size . It seemed that the powers in heaven were conspiring to frustrate pitiful man . Sometimes in the afternoon the wind would die and the land stand still under the heat . Like the farmers themselves , the plants and trees seemed to sweat and beg for water . Alvin thought to himself , " It 's bound to rain before morning , the air 's so still and sticky . " And then , as the sun was going down , a low bank of clouds began to rise in the west , and by nightfall low reverberations of thunder sounded below the earth . He sat on the kitchen porch into the far hours of morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others in the neighborhood at the same time were doing likewise . The thunder would increase , the clouds come up and darken the light of the stars , but then the wind would start swirling and swishing among the trees and only a few big drops would fall as the clouds were blown away to the cast . At last he could endure it no more . He hitched a mule to the one-horse wagon and went down to the village and bought two large wine barrels . He brought them home , stopped up the bungs and knocked the heads out . He hired Orus Massey to help him haul water to the fields . Some of the neighbors , who were idle by force of circumstance , came by where he and the Negro with two big gourds were pouring a half-gallon of water around the base of each stalk . " I never heard of anybody doing that , " said old Ham Urquhart , who farmed on the land of the neighboring landlord , Atlas McKay . " It 's perishing for water and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never slacking his work . " And how long y ' expect it to take you to do that ? Why , you would n't be through till Christmas . " " Well , it 's better than setting still and seeing it burn up in the fields , " Alvin called over his shoulder as he hurried back to where the barrel waited on the tobacco-sled . For three days he and Orus worked like dogs , and on Friday night had watered only half an acre . And as far as the look of the plants was concerned , he could ace no difference.  | It seemed now that the drought really was to be serious . The changing of the moon had come on with many signs of falling weather , but none of them had worked . Several times the clouds boiled up low in the south and rolled across the sky in the late afternoon like great birds or ships or golden palaces . Out of the west they came , in endless succession , floating buoyantly up and drifting lazily across the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great cannonade of field-guns . And thus they dischargedthemselves in a glory of lightning without a drop of water falling , and finally dissipated themselves into the air . The church-going people began to pray at night for the blessing of rain . And all kinds of charms and signs were invoked to bring it to pass . If some one killed a snake , he hung it up in a tree in an invocation . Another one would drag his bed out in the yard at night and sleep there hoping by his rashness to cause the rain to fall on it . And still others began burning piles of brush in the open , since it was well known that a great portion of all clouds were composed of smoke . But Alvin neither prayed nor hung out charms . He kept working away like a demon , hoping to save what plants he could by watering them . Then on the sixth day the water in Jim Massey 's well began to fail , and he had to stop . " We just as well stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Cause it 's gon na rain now , Mr. Alvin . " " How do you know ? " Alvin asked anxiously . " ' Cause this morning I caught a big tick on my dog and turned him over on his back and put him under a rock . That sho will bring the rain , Mr. Alvin . " " I hope so , " Alvin answered spontaneously . And then he said , " Oh , pshaw ! there 's nothing in that , Orus . " " Oh , yessuh , they is . " " Then why'n the devil did n't you do it sooner ? " And Orus did n't know what to say . Alvin was acquainted with all the superstitionsand folklore signs among his people , and in spite of his disbelief in such things he soon found himself watching every token . If he saw a wren flitting about a fence jamb he would stop and listen to see if it would sing , for that was a good sign of rain . And now and then he 'd notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And on the night when the fireflies rose thickly out of the grass around Mr. Turner 's house , he felt cheered up , for that , too , was a good sign . And if in the morning the spider webs were thick on the bushes he would hope that this might mean something . Or if he found a be-shame vine growing along the hedge , he would stop and watch it to see if it showed any signs of closing up . At noon if the water-glasses sweated , Miss Marthy would say , comfortingly , " That looks like rain . " " Yes , it does , " Alvin would answer . Or if the smoke from the kitchen chimney happened to settle down across the field , he became encouraged , for that too was another good sign . Then one night when he saw a ring around the moon he spoke the old saying aloud , " Moon in a mistIs worth gold in a chist . " Each morning he anxiously watched the rising sun to see if it had a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of all . And if the evening was gray and the morning red , he remembered another old rhyme and spoke it hearteningly to himself , " Evening gray and morning redBrings down rain upon man 's head . " And then one night when he saw the lightning wink in the north he was certain that the drought would soon be broken , for that was the best sign of all . But the next morning the sun rose clear and yellow and in the afternoon the usual dry whirlwind came traipsing up the road and twinkled off across the field . And in angry disgust Alvin tried to take his mind off these signs . If he kept on worrying so much , he 'd wind up like the man over on Black River who stood in the yard and shook his fist at the sky and said , " Rain , damn ye , rain ! " Getting his brier hook , he went down to the edge of the field and began to slay the Jerusalem oaks and dog fennel that had grown up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Sunday clothes and told him that Brother Snipes had called all the Little Bethel people to pray for rain.  | " You better come , Alvin . Every voice will help , " he said . " What the devil good does that do ? " Alvin replied angrily . " The weather 's the weather and it 's got man in its control . It 'll rain when it will rain . " " That 's what you say , " Dollis answered kindly , " but Brother Snipes is right . The reason we ai n't having rain is ' cause people have got so weeked . They got to get right with God again . " " Rats ! " Alvin snorted , and then he suddenly stopped the swish of his scythe , for he had seen a spider crawling down his web . " Hey ! there 's a good sign of rain , Mr. Dollis , " he called . " Spider going down towards the ground . " " Huh ! So you think spiders know more than God , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is it just do n't rain , that 's all . And look out there at our tobacco . If we make half a crop we 'll do well . " " Aw , do n't let 's git discouraged . If we can have a good rain pretty soon that stuff 'll come out so you 'll never know it . " " Well , it 'd have to , if we make anything this year , " Alvin answeredgrimly . " How you been getting on lately ? " Dollis inquired kindly , apparentlybeing in no hurry to get to the church . " We ai n't seen much of you . " " No , I been sticking pretty close . How 're your folks ? " " Well , we 're pretty good as usual , except Ivy . She 's sick . " " That 's bad . Come to think of it , I ai n't seen her in the fieldsfor a week or so . " " No , the doctor told her she 'd have to let up a while . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there to Mr. Collins ' drug store and got her some medicine . She 's been taking that , and I think it holp her . " " Can I do anything ? " Alvin asked in the usual manner of the neighborhood . " No , I reckon not . " " Well , tell her  --  tell her I hope she 'll be better soon , and I 'll come down and see her . " " All right , I 'll tell her , " said Dollis as he went off towards the road that led to the church . The next day when Alvin was down in the village getting somep223groceries for Miss Marthy , he bought a bag of oranges and bananas and apples and took them over to Ivy . She was feeling a little better , Gertrude said , and was sitting in a chair . She thanked him for the fruit and asked him to stay a while , and he sat down by her in a chair . Mary Belle had been right , Ivy was almost skin and bones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , Ivy , " he said , touched to the heart by her appearance , " how long you been sick like this ? " " Oh , I 'm not really sick . I just feel sort of weak . " " Now look here , " he said with a hearty laugh , " you got to get out of this . Why , if you stay in the house this-a-way the whole neighborhood will go to rack and ruin . What they gon na do without you over there at the Sunday school ? " And so he sat and talked , blustered and cheered her up as he had often done with his mother . And before he left Ivy was smiling and seemed to be a great deal better . Whether God heard the prayers of his oppressed people or not , the rain came before the end of the week . On Friday morning , when Alvin got up , there was a different feeling in the air . He sensed it even though the fields and outbuildings stood muffled in the gray dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had strutted the lawn in silence for three weeks began to scream . And by nine o'clock the rain crows had begun their echoingprophecies down in the pasture . " Maybe today it 'll come , " he murmured as he stood at the tool-house and stared out over the burning fields , where the crops and trees waited lifeless under the wilting heat . Unable to bear the sight of the burning tobacco , he went into the tool-house and began to half-sole his shoes . And after lunch he mended the harnesses and greased the wagon reins . Every few minutes he would go to the window and look towards the southwest . And then about two o'clock he saw low on the horizon edge a faint little wad of cloud no larger than the fabled one Elijah saw , and hope sprang up in his heart . And as he stood there watching , another little cloud appeared swimming up the sky , and then presently another and another . " Ah , that looks like business , " he breathed fervently . And he stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these upboiling racks , and in a few minutes or so he saw a low dark swollen band shoving itself up above the line of sycamores along the river . Presently there was a deep roll of ominousthunder below the earth and the windows rattled in their sockets . The moments passed . The dark wide stretch of cloud now showed itself reaching from north to south , and it kept pushing up and up until it curtained the edge of the burning sun . Now it obscures the sun . The moments pass , a flash of lightning marks a sudden fiery track from sky to earth , and the elm trees around the house seem to shiver with strange delight . The chickens start going into the henhouse and the doves fly into their cotes . The two proud peacocks march in side by side under the wagon shelter . And then up the back lane from the meadow the old bell cow comes leading the other cattle , her head high and her tail arched merrily . Another roll of thunder sounds . Then a gust of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lane as if trying to keep up with the swift edge of the clouds which now has raced across the sky and passed over the house . The wind blows more strongly . Somewhere a door slams . And Alvin continues to stand there , still as a post , waiting for the rain to fall . Suddenly the wind dies out and the thunder is no longer heard , nor is there any lightning . Everything is breathless , expectant , still . And then , with a sudden clatter like stones on the roof , the great drops of rain begin to fall . A fine mist of dust is beat up in the yard and in the lane and out across the field ; like a morning ground fog it is . And then it , too , is wetted down to earth as the rain settles into a steady pour . A sheet of wetness begins to blow in on him where he stands in the door of the tool-house , but he keeps standing there , letting it wet him to the skin ; and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water wriggling down the dry ditch behind the garden . And out across the fields as far as the eye can see the great curtain of the rain is falling , falling , falling on the perishing tobacco plants . The drought is over . Alvin closed the door to the tool-house and set off down towards his field . He took off his hat and let the blessed rain wet his hair , wash down his face , and pour along his throat and chest and down into his shoes . He lifted back his head , opened his mouth , andp225drank from the water that fell from the sky . His heart was singing with gladness ; he felt like running and shouting ; and a great thankfulness was in his heart to whatever power it was that had saved his crop . That afternoon he dressed in his best clothes , got an umbrella from Miss Marthy , and went down to Dollis ' house . He must share his joy with somebody . The family was sitting on the little porch , watching the rain fall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivy was there also , and her gentle , dreamy smile brightened when she saw him come up the step . " Ai n't this fine ? " he said , by way of greeting as he closed up his umbrella and turned to look back the way he had come . And so they sat and talked about the great work that now lay ahead and discussed whether the tobacco had been badly hurt or not , and Dollis concluded that with the proper " seasons " to follow you could n't tell that there had been a drouth in a few weeks . And so Alvin stayed to supper . The talk lasted until late at night and Ivy was cheerful all the while . And after supper when she read from the Bible and the family knelt in prayer , Alvin bent far over , but he did n't get down on his knees . And for the first time in his life he felt as if there were some presence around him or above him to whom he could give thanks . Dollis was right . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed in a hurry to make up for lost time . The weather continued hot , with just enough rain and sun to satisfy the growingthings . And when the middle of July came , Alvin was pleased with his crop , though , so far as he could tell , he had not outstrippedhis neighbors , nor did the tobacco he had watered during the drought show to be any better than the other . It must have ken as old Icca Purefoy had said , " A ' baccer plant drinks water statue as a steer , and a half gallon wo n't do it no good . " During the harvesting and the curing Alvin saw a great deal of ivy again . She had completely recovered from her illness and was back in the fields , keeping her steady gait along with the others , or it the looping-shelter , where her nimble fingers made their swift circular threading motion from morning till night . And now that the tobacco was cured to its final weight the farmers began top226realize what damage the drought had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lift a dozen loaded sticks with one finger . And another thing that bothered them was the price . This year the market seemed dragging behind . Mr. Turner spoke of it one day to Alvin at the table , and said that after the big prices last year all the people in Georgia had planted down the world , and the same was true in South Carolina and Virginia and Kentucky . Alvin reported these things to the tenants in the pack-houses as they graded their tobacco , and Dollis glumly acknowledged that he reckoned it was so and they would have to set their hopes on another year . " Mr. Atlas McKay said yestiddy the border markets had opened the lowest a-tall . " Ivy spoke up , as usual , and said they could n't hope to have success every year , and last year they had done so well they might expect a change . Alvin tried himself to take examplefrom her patience and control his feeling of frustration and anger , but constantly brooded on what might have been . He had counted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it would be a different story . If it had n't been for that drought he would be able , next month , to go to Mr. Turner and talk about buying a piece of land . But money must do the talking , and for another twelve months he must bide his time . When the winter came on and the last of the tobacco was sold , Alvin sat in his little room and figured up his gains and losses . His neighbors would have counted him lucky , for , unlike most of them , he had made a profit , and not such a bad profit at that . After deduction for fertilizer and labor he was two hundred and fifty dollars to the good . And that with what he 'd already saved brought his total up close to seven hundred . For a long time he sat debating with himself whether he 'd speak to Mr. Turner or not , and at last he decided he would as soon as he got a chance . " After all , seven hundred dollars ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not even by Mr. Turner . " The landlord 's behavior this year was different from the last . He seemed to take much more interest in the price of the crop and was quick to meet the men when they returned from the markets and ask how things had gone.  |p227When  the end of the year came on Alvin heard some grumbling among Les Gillam 's family and the Masseys . Mr. Turner had exactedthe last cent out of them for supplies which he had provided ( luring the summer , and they were left even with the world and would have to run on a credit for the coming year . Soon after that Les moved over to Mr. McKay 's place and a white man by the name of Obie Beasley took his place with his swarm of children . Alvin had thought of his people down on Mr. Byrd 's place several times since he left , and at Christmas he decided to send his mother a present . He scrawled a few words on a piece of paper to tell her that he was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new ten-dollar bill . A few days later an answer came back from Grangie saying that they had almost starved on the farm the last year and had all moved back to the mill again , and that " Ma is failing fast and you ought to come and see her . " And then he added that Bull Cox had asked him to inquire of Alvin whether they needed another tenant up there where he lived , for he was going to move from Mr. Byrd 's place . Alvin decided he would speak to Mr. Turner about it . Now that Jim Massey was planning to leave , he would need another good tenant , and Bull was a hog for work . He did n't know anything about tobacco , but he could learn , or else he could plant cotton . This year cotton had been a good price , and those who raised it had come out as well or better than the tobacco farmers . Then the thought occurredto him that perhaps no one would move in to take Jim 's place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That evening he got up courage to speak to Mr. Turner . He went upstairs and knocked on the door . " Come in , " said a voice . He cntcred and found Mr. Turner sitting by the cold stove , with his specs on , reading from a book . " Oh , sit down , Alvin . What can I do for you ? " the little man said , pushing back his specs and beginning to finger in his vest pocket , as was his habit . " I thought maybe I 'd talk with you about next year , " he said , taking his seat on the edge of a chair . " So you want to try it again ? " " Yes , sir . "  | " Well , that 's the way with farmers . Knock ' em down one time and they come right up again like one of these stuffed dummies you throw balls at in a fair . Ahem  --  yes I reckon that 's the way it is with all of us  --  we keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in your mind ? " " I wanted to talk with you about the house Jim Massey 's living in . " " Well , that sounds interesting , " the little man spoke up brightly . " Who 's the lucky girl ? " " I  --  I do n't mean that . " " Come now , do n't try to hide it . You and Ivy going to tie up , ai n't you ? " " No , sir . " " Then you 're more foolish than I thought . You 're getting on in the world now , and you know what you want to do with yourself . You want to farm , do n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , let me tell you Ivy Chadbourne 's the pick of any of them . I 'd go so far almost as to try to scrape up the money to build you and her a little house , if that 's what you got in mind . " " No , sir , I ai n't thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's your idea about Jim 's  --  the Massey house ? " " That 's what I want to talk about . " " All right . Go ahead and talk . " And after much faltering and fumbling Alvin explained to Mr. Turner that he wanted to buy the place and that he 'd saved up seven hundred dollars to make a first payment on it . " Good gracious ! You mean you want to buy a piece of land ? " the little man queried , staring at him now over his glasses . " Yes , sir . " " That 's funny . Everybody I know wants to sell theirs . Look at me . I own three hundred acres and get poorer every year . Do you have any idea how much thirty acres of land and a house like that would cost you ? " " That 's what I wanted to ask you , Mr. Turner , wanted to ask you what you 'd take for it . " " How does five thousand dollars sound to you , son ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected him to say about three thousand , and he had figured that in five or six years he could pay for it . And then the little man pulled a sheet of paper over on his book and began figuring . " Let 's see . Five thousand dollars . You pay seven hundred dollars down . That 's forty-three hundred left . Your interest at six percent  --  eighteentwenty-four , twenty-five  --  two hundred and fiftyeighta year in interest . Suppose I gave you five years to pay for it . Over eight hundred dollars a year payment , plus two hundred and fifty-eight  --  a thousand and fifty-eight . Why , boy , you 'd be an old man before you ever got it paid for , counting the bad luck and all . " Alvin answered with spirit that he 'd thought all these things over before . " No , sir , I would n't . I 'd pay for it , all right . " Mr. Turner looked at him and smiled broadly . " Yes , I supposeYou would if anybody could , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahem  --  well , I might have considered giving you a chance at that place , Alvin , but I 've made other plans . I 've known for a good while that damn scoundrel of a Jim Massey was going to leave me . So I wrote to Dave Layton . He used to live round here years ago , and one of the best cotton farmers I ever had . When they started tobacco-growing up in Granville County he moved off up there . I 've heard since then that that land 's been pretty well used up with constant tobacco-farming and the farmersare moving out . So I 've written to him on the chance that I Can get him to come back here . But I 'll tell you what I 'll do , " he went on as he watched Alvin 's crestfallen face . " You 've been a lot of help to me here , looking after the stock and being company for Miss Marthy . You can have your room and board next year for nothing  --  just keep on taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of things . " " Yes , sir . " " And then have as much land as you want to farm on , the same terms , half and half . How much you want ? " " I 'd like to have maybe the same five acres , seeing as how it is . " " All right . " " And I 've been thinking I 'd better try a little cotton . "  | " All right . Help yourself . Where you want that ? " " Well , sir , I 've been thinking it 's kinder slack times and I could put in a lot of work if you 'd let me have that  --  that old-field piece beyond the pasture . It 's grown up in broom straw and pines and maples and a few oaks . I could  --  There 's about four acres of it and I could clear it off . " " Yeh , that 'll come in fine , " the landlord answered . " The wood will , I mean , for tobacco-curing . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll go half and half . " " No , sir . I thought maybe if I cleared that off I could have all I made on it . " " All right , " laughed the landlord , " then you can have all you make . " As Alvin rose to leave the room he fingered his specs and said : " What you ever do with that money I spoke to you about ? Did you put it in the bank ? " " No , sir . " " You mean you still got it in that tin box or wherever you keep it ? " " Yes , sir . " Mr. Turner began to figure busily and importantly on the paper . " Why do n't you put it out on interest ? Make it earn something for you . You know I 've got thousands of dollars on my books down there at the store and ca n't collect a dime . I could use that money , Alvin . At the same time it would be doing you some good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sunveyed him steadily . Then suddenly a cunning thought came into Alvin 's mind . Supposehe lent it to Mr. Turner and he could n't pay it back next year . Then maybe they could work out some deal by which he could get possession of his grandfather 's old place . From association with Mr. Byrd and from his year with Mr. Turner he had already learned that a man 's name on a piece of paper was as bindingas death . That was one thing down in the court-house yonder that was stronger than all these mighty men . And then Mr. Turner said what he hoped he 'd say , " I 'll givep231you my own personal note , of course . Twelve months after date I promise to pay '  --  and so on . " Alvin stood thinking a moment . " Maybe I could spare six hundred of it , " he said . " I 'll need something to run on . " " Six hundred it is . And I 'll make out the note right now . " He turned quickly to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in , signed his name with a flourish , and handed it to Alvin . " You can give me the money any time you want to . You 've done a good thing , too , Alvin , ' cause this house might burn up or homebody might rob you . " " All right , sir . I 'll go get the money right away . " " Oh no , you need n't hurry , " and the landlord picked up his book as if money was the last thing on his mind . " Yes , sir , I 'll bring it right now . " In a few minutes he returned with the tin box , counted out sixhundred dollars , and placed the little slip of paper inside . " So we begin another year together , " Mr. Turner said in conklusion , as he laid the money carelessly over on his desk . " Yes , sir . " " Good night , Alvin . " " Good night , sir . " After that Alvin sharpened up his ax again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored he thought of the time when is land would be his . Not only would his work not be thrown way , but in addition he would have the use of one crop of cotton , with half the expense paid by Mr. Turner . " Maybe I 'm getting gong so I can deal with them , too , " he thought . " They are smart d mighty and all-powerful , but I 'll learn . I 'll learn how to figger ght with ' em . Let them plan how to outdo me in the day , I 'll lie wake and plan how to get the best of them at night . " And with at he set to work with renewed vigor . A few days later Mr. Turner told him that Dave Layton was tiling to live on his land , and then mentioned in passing that he did n't have the force he once had . All of his children had married IT except his youngest daughter . " But , " he went on , " I reckon hat he lacks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir , he must have a dozen . " " Thirteen , and another one coming . So I guess we 'll have plenty of help for the next year . " A few days after the moving of Jim Massey over the river to Mr. Collins ' place , Alvin looked up across the fields and saw a wagon-load of furniture drawn up in front of the door . The Laytons were moving in . They had brought their household goods in their own wagon , for Mr. Layton was renting on the quarter share , being able to furnish his own tools and stock . Near the end of the week he heard the sound of hammers and saws up there , and he could see a man repairing the end of the porch where it had sunk rottenly down . That must be Mr. Layton , Alvin thought , going right to work fixing things up . And as the days went by he noticed that the new renter had patched up the lot fence and covered the shed where he kept his two mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank with a brier-hook , cleaning up and burning the hedge-row bushes . Alvin 's interest was aroused . He guessed he could learn something about farming from that man . And then one morning Mr. Layton came across the fields and spoke to him . " I seen you over here a lot and thought I 'd come and say howdy , ' " he grinned . " My name 's Layton  --  Dave Layton . " " Mine 's Alvin Barnes . " " Oh yes , I know your name . I 've heard Ethel speaking about you . " Alvin looked at him questioningly . " Ethel 's my youngest daughter , the only daughter left . She alreadyknows everybody in the neighborhood  --  the Chadbournes and the Beasleys and the folks that live over on Mr. McKay 's land . I reckon she noticed you down here working and somebody told her who you was . " Dave Layton was a man of medium height , heavy and almost fa  --  about the waist , but light on his feet , as Alvin had noticed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chubby and heavy jowled , and his eyes , surrounded by little crow's-feet of fun , were quick and full of life . " How you like it down here ? " Alvin asked , politely . " Oh , purty well . The house up there is sort of a mess  --  niggers ,  |p233you  know  --  but we finally got it fixed up . We had to scour it from rafter to sill . Aye , they always make a mess wherever they live , like buzzards . " " Yes , sir . " " Yes , " he went on , " I reckon it 's about as good here as anywhere . I 've lived on a lot of places in my time , and Mr. Turner 's a purty good landlord , and up there in Granville the tobacco businesshas just petered out . " " You must have made a lot of money out of it , though . " " Oh , some years I did and some years I did n't . But "  --  and here he sighed and looked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised a family . That 's about as much as I could ask , I reckon . " " Yes , sir . " " You certainly are clearing up around here , ai n't you ? What you going to plant on this ground ? " " I thought I 'd put some cotton in . " " Pretty rough for that , ai n't it ? " " Well it is now , but when I get through with it it wo n't be so rough . " " I reckon that 's right , from what I 've seen of you . They tell me you 're the king of the woods down here , far as work goes . I used to be a power in my time , too , " he went on , " but I 'm failing . I ai n't got the git up and git I used to have . Well , even mules wear out , do n't they ? Goodby . " And with a wave of his hand he bore off down towards the pasture where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day Alvin began burning the brush in his new ground . Hacking fat husks of lightwood off the stumps , he would get a good hot fire going and then pile the brush on until the flames mounted in the air high as a house . And by evening time he had a row of great burning heaps behind him . With his hat and Coat off and his sleeves rolled up he worked away furiously , dragingthe tops of pine and oak trees and lifting them up and thrown ; them with a swish on the fire . He was so intent upon his work that he failed to see a girl who came out of the pasture with an armful of little sprouts and stopped behind him . She stood watching him for a while , and then called out good evening . Alvin turned around and looked at her . " Good evening , ma'am , "  | 34 he said politely , reaching up for his hat , which was absent from his head . She was a trim , neat girl of medium height , slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that showed under a little cap like ripe corn silks . And later Alvin remembered that her complexion was like Gracie Byrd 's , though a few freckles here and there dotted her cheeks and nose . She was chewing a blackgumtwig like those she carried in her arms . " I was just watching you work , " she said , showing her white teeth in a frank , genial grin . " You must be Miss Layton , " he said politely , as he reached in his pocket , pulled out his handkerchief , and wiped his grimy hands . " And you must be Alvin Barnes . " " Yes , that 's right . " " I went down to see if the cow was still in the pasture . Father says the fence has got to be mended , I saw you out here and came by . We 're going to be neighbors for a year and I thought I 'd speak to you . " " Thanky . " " Well , I can see you 're anxious to get back to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Oh yes , you are , for they say that 's all you study  --  work , work . " And now her eyes were smiling at him from under her lids , and her red full lips were puckered around her tooth-brush twig . Crowding the little black-gum sprouts suddenly up under her arm , she pulled off her cap with both hands and shook back her heavy reddish hair and put it on again . " How you like it down here ? " Alvin mumbled , for want of something better to say . " I think I 'm going to like it fine , " she spoke up pleasantly . " I lived here when I was a child , over there in the house where Obie Beasley lives . " " I did n't know that . " " Yes , we 've lived in lots of places , and I suppose if you live long enough you 'll come back where you started out , the way they say chickens and animals try to do . You came from down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . How did you know ? " " Ivy Chadbourne told me . She 's a fine girl , is n't she ? " And that night Alvin , thinking back , remembered that she did n't say " ai n't " like most folks , but said , " is n't . " " Yes , she is . " " I 've already been down and had supper at their house . She came up and helped us scrub , scour , and clean , and we are going to church together on Sunday . I like her a heap , and I like her father and mother , too . And the poor old Beasleys are not so bad  --  though the children swarm over the house like flies . " Alvin had forgotten his work now and wanted to continue the conversation . " You must already know everybody in the neighborhood , " he spoke up quickly as she appeared about to move off . " Yes , I do , " she laughed , " most of ' em . I 've even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " " Who ? " " Oh , that nice boy , Carl Stevens , that works at Mr. Turner 's store , and what 's the name of that fellow that runs the drug store ? A sort of sport ? " " You mean Boyd Collins ? " " Yes , him . He was awful nice to me . Gave me all the ice cream I wanted and would n't let me pay him a cent , " and she broke into a low , gay laugh , a laugh that reminded Alvin of something , somebody , he could n't tell who , but not Gracie , nor Rosa , nor Mary Belle , nor anybody he 'd met at the box party . Still , it seemed as if she laughed like somebody he had known . " Look , it 's almost sunset , " she said suddenly , " and I 've got to get supper . Goodby . " And turning quickly , she walked rapidly off . Alvin threw another brush on the burning heap and then stood staring after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when she disappeared behind the little barn he turned back to the fire and warmed his hands . For a long while he stood gazing into the bed of burning coals . And though he knew that she was now in the house , cooking supper , it was as if she stood there with him . And he thought about her voice and her laugh , the way she said things , and they reminded him of somebody  --  somebody . And then he suddenly said , " Why , she 's like all of ' em ; she 's all of ' em put together , in a way she is  --  Gracie and Rosa and Mary Belle and Ivy . " The next Sunday morning a young giant of a fellow with nicely brushed yellowish hair and well-pressed clothes sat near the back of the church and gazed at two people who sat on the front seat . And of all people singing " At the Cross , at the Cross , where I first saw the light , " he heard only the low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish silky dress . And another young man with his black hair parted in the middle , and his New York clothes of latest cut and tailor-made , sat over to the right and heard the same girl 's voice . For today Boyd Collins had swept up into the grove with his two horses and light yellow buggy to pay one of his visits to the church . And when Alvin saw him sitting there he knew that Ethel Layton was the reason for his coming . As soon as the benediction was pronounced , Alvin got up and went outside and stood among the groups of farmers , listening to them talk about their crops . Presently Ethel and Ivy came down the steps , and Ivy gave a look of pleased surprise when she saw him . In her frank way she came over to him . " Why , Alvin , it 's good to see you ! " and she looked at him and smiled . " Yes , I was walking around and drifted over this way , " he answeredapologetically . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Well , hardly at all . " And turning to her companion , Ivy said , " This is Alvin Barnes , Ethel . " And Ethel bowed and smiled and stuck out her hand , " Glad to meet you , Mr. Barnes . " Then Boyd Collins drifted up , took off his gray felt hat , and bowed , " Good evening , ladies . Good evening . " And his darkbrowneyes darted about and played freely over Ethel 's face and figure . " Good evening , Mr. Collins , " she said lightly , and Alvin was glad to see that she did n't seem to be impressed at all by Collins , the sport and man of means . " Good evening , " Ivy said , in her submissive , child-like way.  | " Are you ladies walking ? " the sport inquired , with a slight wave of his hat towards the waiting equipage . " Sorry , but we are , " Ethel said . " I thought I might give you a lift down the road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk the short path through the woods . " " But perhaps I may have the pleasure and honor another time , " he said with a grandiloquent bow . And pulling his hat on sharply , he turned away towards his buggy . And then Dollis , Gertrude , and Milton came over and said they were going to eat Sunday dinner with the Petersons and could Ivy get along by herself . " Oh , then , " Ethel said , " you can eat dinner with me  --  and you , too , " she said , looking up at Alvin . " Father and mother have gone up beyond Angier for the day , and we three will cook eggs and ham and enjoy ourselves . How about it , Ivy ? " Ivy agreed it would be fine , and Alvin thought so , too . And they started off along the path that led through the woods . Where the bushes and trees stood close along the path they walked in single file , and then in the clearer places Alvin walked between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd you like the sermon , Alvin ? " Ivy asked . " Oh , fine ; I thought it was fine . Did n't you , Miss Ethel ? " Ethel stopped and planted herself in front of them . " Now look here , " she said . " We 'll settle it right now . Do n't call me Miss Ethel , and I 'll not call you Mr. Alvin or Mr. Barnes . It 's Ivy and Ethel and Alvin . " " Yes , that 's right , " he laughed . " We all agree . " " Thank you , Alvin . " And she gave him a look out of her deep gray eyes that sent a funny little feeling tickling in his breast . As they picked their way along the footlog that crossed the creek swamp , Ethel pointed off to a holly tree near by , filled with red berries . " Have you got a knife , Alvin ? " He gave her the pocket knife and she stepped from the plank to the ground . " Wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jumping off he fol/lowed after her , cut several sprays for her , while Ivy stood leaning against the arm-rail and waited . Soon they reached the Layton house and went in . Alvin was surprised at the transformation that had taken place . The floors , scrubbed and clean , were covered here and there with little rugs , and the walls and ceiling were whitewashed , and nice white curtainswere on the windows . In the kitchen everything was spick and span , even the wood cook-stove was clean and polished . While the two girls prepared the lunch , Alvin went out to the woodpile , split some lightwood splinters , and took an armful of oak wood into the room at the end of the house which had been fitted up as a sort of combination parlor and bedroom . There were several pictures on the wall , and an organ in the corner opposite the bed . " So she must be able to play , too , " he thought in pleased surprise as he put the wood down . And when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in his mind . In this house his grandfather had lived , and in this same room maybe he read his Bible and studied his books and practiced his singing . And now she lived in it , and then some day he would be staying here . The door opened and Ethel came in with the holly sprays . She stuck them up behind the pictures , and in a moment the room had taken on a touch of Christmas under her hand . " Dinner 's about ready , " she said . " Yeh , I can smell that ham a-frying , " he answered heartily . She finished putting up the holly , then stood a moment in the room , with a single leaf held between her fingers . After a moment she began touching each point in succession . And Alvin stared at her hands , so white and soft and strong . " You do n't work in the fields much , do you ? " he said . " No , I do n't , " she answered , looking abstractedly up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at my hands . " And then she dropped the holly leaf into the fire and watched it scorch to brownness . " What were you doing with that ? " " Oh , telling somebody 's fortune . " " Did it come out right ? " " I do n't know . Maybe it did . The last letter was M. ' You knowp239anybody whose name begins with M ' ? " And now again she looked at him with her gray , inquiring eyes . " No , no , ca n't say as I do , " he replied thoughtfully . " Well , that 's the name the holly leaf said . " And with that she turned and went out of the room , calling behind her , " Come on . It 's ready now . " After lunch they all sat in the parlor and cracked walnuts and popped popcorn , and Alvin wished the day would never end . He was bubbling with spirits and talked and laughed more than Ivy had ever heard before . He told Ethel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length his logging in the forest and experiences rafting timber down the river to Fayetteville . And of course he added little colorful touches of his own as befitted the occasion . But he made no mention of either Rosa or Spike Boy , the tough . And then Ethel would talk about her experiences up inGranville County  --  the hay-rides she used to go on up there , and the church picnics they had . Gradually , as the afternoon wore on , Ivy became more and more silent , and Alvin 's and Ethel 's remarks were addressed solely to each other . When the blue cold of the evening began to shadow the brown fields , Ivy said she had to go home . And Alvin , who had almost forgotten that she was present , was filled with sudden contrition and rose to go with her . Ethel went out on the porch with them and said , " You-all come again . " And both Ivy and Alvin said they would . And then she said she was planning to have s party sometime soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just let us know and we will , " laughed Alvin , and Ivy murmured , " Yes , let us know . " So they went down the cold frozen road together , and once , when Alvin looked hastily around , he saw that Ethel was still standing on the porch . " She 's wonderful , ai n't she ? " Ivy asked . " Who ? " " Her . Ethel . " " Oh , I do n't know , " he answered cunningly . " She 's right peart , anyhow . "  | " And pretty ! She 's the prettiest thing I ever saw . Everybody in the neighborhood is talking about her . " " I reckon she looks right well , maybe . " " Oh , Alvin , you know she 's pretty as a flower , " Ivy answered , and her voice trembled . " Well , if you say so , then she is . " And they walked on in silence , and Ivy was thinking mournfully to herself that perhaps if she had n't called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | A THE days went on Alvin continued working at his newgroundfour acres with apparently the same old savage energy . But it was more mechanical than vitalized by any driving urge , for now his mind was filled with the thoughts of Ethel Layton . And more often than he would ever have acknowledged to himself , his eyes were on the little house there among the blackjacks and china trees . And whenever he saw her come out to the well to draw water , or saw her out in the yard sweeping with the broom , or on the porch cleaning up , he stopped in his tracks and watched her . And often in the long hours of his labor his mind would run back on the times when he had thus watched for Cracie around Mr. Byrd 's great house . But he was a boy then , and now he was a man . There was all the difference in the world . Once more the old dream of a tasseled carriage and the two horses and the bowing Negroes came to him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then one day there she stood before him , and letting the axmain where it was sunk deep in a tree , he reached for his absent at and said good morning . And he could feel the color coming up II over his face as he looked at her . She wore a dark dress , a gray jacket , and had a bluish sort of scarf tied lightly about her neck . " I see you 're getting right along with your work , " she said in cr low throaty voice as she glanced out at him with her smilingcs . Alvin stood looking at her dumb as a post , and then , as before , c pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his sweaty hands . " I saw you down here , " she went on , " and I thought I 'd come and tell youthat I was going to have that party tomorrow night . I 've already Invited the folks . There wo n't be so many , because we have n't got much room . Can you come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually , though the blood was drumming in his ears.  | " Oh , about eight o'clock . I thought if you did n't mind you could help me out . " " I 'd be glad to do anything . " " Then you 'd better come a little early and help me with the refreshments . I thought I 'd get some mistletoe now to decorate with . You know where any of it grows ? " " Sure . Plenty of it  --  all around . There 's a big maple tree down there in the pasture with piles of it sprouting on it . " " Could you get it for me ? " " Yes , ma'am , I 'll go right now . " And he pulled the ax out of the pine tree where he 'd left it stuck . They set off through the woods , and when they arrived at the tree he looked it over and said , " That 's too purty a tree to cut down for mistletoe . I 'd better climb it . " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not me , " he laughed boldly . " I 'm same as a squirrel . " And throwing off his coat , he started up it . He would have climbed it somehow if it had been a greased pole , and presently he was picking his way carefully out on a big limb . " You 'd better catch it ! " he called down to her , " or it 'll smash all to pieces . " And so she stretched out her arms and caught the mistletoe as he broke it off and let it fall . In a few minutes he stood on the ground beside her again , and they made their way back to the field . " I better take it up to the house for you , had n't I ? " " No , I can carry it . " " Well , let me tie the stems of it together and then you can handle it better . " So , taking out his handkerchief , he fastened the stray pieces into one bundle and handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , " she said without looking at him . " I 'll see you tomorrow night at seven-thirty . " " I 'll be there , " he called as he watched her go off . Then seizing his ax , he set wildly to work , and the rest of the afternoon he brought tree after tree crashing to the ground . And up at the little house a pair of gray eyes looked out through the window panes and watched the young Hercules at his labors . " What you looking at ? " asked Dacie , Ethel 's sturdy little darkeyedmother , who had already borne her five children into thep243world , and yet after a day 's work in the fields could stand for hours at the ironing-board , as she was doing now . " I was just thinking that sunsets are purtier here than up in Granville County . " " Oh , I do n't know about that , " Mrs. Layton replied . Then a little later on , when she was frying the side meat at the stove , Ethel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store the other day , and he said Alvin Barnes once killed a bull with his bare fists . " " You mean the fellow you were looking out of the window at awhile ago ? " " Yes , Mother , with the red sunset behind him . " " Well , maybe he did . I du n no . Your pa says he 's already got a bunch of money out on interest . " The next evening Alvin spent as much time bathing and shaving and getting dressed as any Paris fop preparing for the conquest of a drawing-room and its mistress . At seven-thirty he showed up at  --  hel 's house , hair brushed , his face clean and shining , and every stitch on him as proper as any town gentleman . And the girl who met him at the door was a vision to take his breath away . Ethel was dressed in a long close-fitting green gown with puffy sleeves that spoke of silk with every movement she made , and around her shoulders she had a light lacy green scarf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great knot behind her head , and set off with a green sort of pin that reminded him of the ring Mary ' Belle wore . The room also was dressed up . A shaded lamp was burning on the center table , and near it two candles stood up tall nd straight , waiting to be lighted . Other candles were set alongc mantelpiece and on top of the bureau . The walls were hung with mistletoe , and a great bunch was lowered down from the center of the ceiling by a string . " Howdy , " Alvin said as his eyes took in both her and the scene . Then she led him down the back porch to the kitchen , and there he was introduced to Mrs. Layton . " Glad to meet you , Mr. Barnes , " she said , giving him her strong , energetic hand.  | " Glad to meet you , Mis ' Layton , " he replied with great good will . Ethel tied an apron around him and in a moment he felt fine and at home as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickles out of a jar , or make sandwiches . And then she poured out a little glass of wine and the four of them drank to one another 's health , and Ethel said , " We better go back to the parlor . They 'll be coming in a minute . " When they had left the room Mrs. Layton turned inquiringly to her husband . " Well , David ? " And he looked back at her and answered , " You know Ethel as well as I do and nobody can prophesy her actions . " " That 's right . She ai n't like our other girls . When they took to a fellow , they took . " " I 'll say so . " " Look at that Jameson boy up in Granville . He worshipped her from top to toe and she went around with him hot and heavy . Then all of a sudden , pop , and she could n't stand the sight of him . " " But he were n't no such fellow as this boy . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you were out of the way I might go for him myself . " " Uh-huh , now , " he answered , reaching out and pinching her hip . " Look here , Dave Layton , if you 're one of them Civil War pinchers , it 's too late to start it now . " And back at her cake again she went on , " Folks says he 's engaged to Ivy Chadbourne . " " Then I 'm sorry for Ivy , " he replied , " if Ethel takes a notion to him . " In the meantime back in the parlor Ethel had handed Alvin 's coat and hat to him . " Here , " she said , " you got to go down and bring Ivy . She 's expecting you . " " Goodness ! I 'd forgot about her , " he answered . " Yes , she 's coming . I do n't know how she 'll like it if we start dancing . " " And are you going to do that , too ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiddle and a banjo . " Alvin stopped , his arm halfway into his overcoat , and looked at her . " Is he coming ? "  | " I suppose so . I was down at his store buying some flavoring and things , and he asked me if I was fixing up for a party , and I told him I was , and then he ups and asks me if he could come , and I  --  well , I had to say yes , for he threw in a lot of things extra . " " I do n't like him , " Alvin replied sternly . " Oh , there 's no harm in him , " she laughed . " He thinks he 's the king rooster of the country and I 'd be glad some day to see somebodycut his comb . " " Maybe I 'll do that , too , if he messes with me , " he muttered . When Alvin arrived at Ivy 's house , she was ready and waiting . As he helped her on with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the vision he had just left . Ivy was dressed in her plain , demure style  --  as always  --  a dark simple worsted dress with a timid touch of white lace at the throat . Her hair was parted In the middle and pulled down in a little knot on her neck . Her shoulders were so thin and her body so light compared with Ethel 's ' minded curving form , that Alvin felt the old pity and gentleness for her . Returning to Ethel 's house , they found that most of the guests ad arrived . There was Russ Peterson and Winnie Wilder , Berben ge and Mildred Harrison , Pauline Blackwood and Stacy Rogers , Goat " Zollicoff and Jessie ' White , Reid Boykin and Betty Barksdale  --  allpretty well accepted courting couples in the countryside . r . Collins and his musicians had not yet shown up . For a whileeverybody sat around laughing and talking , and Ethel visited long them , chatting lightly about all sorts of nonsense and playingthe gracious hostess . Alvin found himself sitting over in a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes were nstantly on Ethel . And Ivy , with her handkerchief wadded in r hand , noticed this and shrank farther into silence . Presently Mr. Layton and Mrs. Layton came in , dressed in their nday clothes , and Ethel introduced them around . Then beckoning to Alvin to follow her , she went off to the kitchen . And he fetched back the pitcher of blackberry wine and glasses on a tray , d Ethel brought in the cake . He passed the wine around and Ethel helped to the cake . When he came to Ivy she looked up at n and shook her head.  | " No , no , thanky , " she murmured with a troubled look . " It 'll make you feel better , Ivy . " " Oh , I feel all right , " she said , and smiled wanly up at him . When they had eaten and drunk a bit , they began playing games , and in a little while everybody was livened up with " going a-fishing , " and " post-office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . And Mr. Layton , gay as any of them , chose Mrs. Layton . Alvin was dying to pick Ethel for his partner , but he took Ivy instead . Then a row of dodged chairs was placed in the center of the room , and Ethel sat down to the organ for the game of " going to Jerusalem . " And when gradually all the chairs were moved away to the last one , Alvin proved to be the winner . " No wonder , " said Winnie Wilder , " the way he pushes and scrouges . " And now Boyd Collins arrived with his musicians , and everybodysat around talking and laughing while the fiddle and the banjo tuned up . The sport introduced them as Mr. Messer and Mr. Adams , and Alvin remembered their names as famous musiciansof the countryside . And soon they were set and ready to go . Chairs were pushed back , and under the direction of Boyd Collins and Ethel the young people ranged themselves around the room . " All right . Let 's go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Tim Messer led off with one of the favorite pieces in the neighborhood , called " The Turkey-lope . " When Ivy realized they were going to dance , she drew back from the ring . " Come on , " Alvin begged . " It ai n't nothing but fun . " " No , no , " she whispered . " I ca n't do that . " So she returned to her seat in the corner . Mr. Layton went over and sat with her , and Alvin had Ethel 's mother for a partner . It seemed now he would never get a chance to be with Ethel , for since Boyd Collins had entered the room he stuck right by Ethel 's side wherever she went . And when they had danced for a quarter of an hour and the dew of sweat had come out on everybody , Tim Messer wound up with a high squeak . The dancers took their seats about the room , the ladies fanned themselves with their handkerchiefs , and the boysp247mopped their own faces and necks vigorously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beforeAlvin could move , Boyd Collins had sprung up . " Let me help you , Miss Layton , " and with that he followed her off to the kitchen . They were gone for a long time and Alvin kept watching the door . At last , when they returned , he thought Ethel 's cheeks were pinker than usual and he felt like rising and catching Boyd Collins y the seat of his breeches and throwing him out of the house . " Are you feeding us some more , Miss Ethel ? " Reid Boykincalled out brashly as he took a piece of potato pie . " Golly ! I 've et ore'n I can pull , as the steer said to the tarrypin . Haw-haw-haw . " " Be quiet , Reid , " his partner , Pauline Blackwood , murmured . Boyd Collins was over at the organ , talking to Ethel in a low ndertone . " Let 's bring ' em some more wine , Miss Ethel , " Alvin called as e reached over and seized the empty pitcher . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " Ethel said , her eyes coping by him . And rising , he went off to the kitchen . He did n't ow where the wine was kept and he waited for her to come in . Presently there was a rattle of the doorknob and there she was . He recd and went to fumbling in the pantry . " I 'll get it for you , " she said , and coming over she pushed by m into the pantry . He set the pitcher on the table and stood with arms hanging down . She was so close that her head almost ched his face and he breathed the perfume of her clothes and ir . A wild impulse came over him , and suddenly he pulled her him and kissed her . She stood still a moment , saying nothing , d then came out into the light with the jar of wine in her hand and her face scarlet . As she poured the wine into the pitcher he tired that her hand was trembling . " Why , why did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetest thing in all the world , " he stuttered . " Boyd Collins tried to kiss me a while ago in here , and I slapped face . " " Did he ? " he turned as if to go towards the parlor . She laid her hand on his arm . " I said I slapped his face and  --  d I did n't slap yours . " Then quickly picking up the pitcher , she led the way back to the parlor . And as they all sat around drinking and eating cakes and pies the two musicians entertained them with their music . They played all sorts of pieces , ranging from " Love among the Pines " to " Do n't You Tell My Gal , " and Alvin knew there had never been so much fun and joy in one evening since the world began . After the music they all sat around , telling ghost stories , and Boyd Collins , of course , told the most hair-raising one of all , about the iron-faced man who lived long ago down in the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in the corn-field , and opening a door in his stomach he would put them in to feed the fire of his blazing entrails . And then they played " weave the thimble , " and the boys and girls had a chance to get in sly squeezes between them . After that came " blindfold . " And when the poor helpless blind man caught one of the girls under the bunch of mistletoe he had the privilege of kissing her . And the fun and happy doings continued until the candles were burned halfway down and the clock on the mantel marked twelve . " It 's right at Sunday now , " Ivy said to Alvin . The clock began to boom through the room and the party was over . All the way back home , Alvin and Ivy walked side by side without a word between them . As they came into the yard , Alvin said , " Did n't you have a good time , Ivy ? " " Purty good , " she answered . " But  --  but  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Did you ? " " I never had such a good time in all my life . " " Yes , " she said . " Good night , " and she went quickly into the house . Unknown to Alvin , the days brought down upon Ivy 's slender form the dark nights of tragedy . For she had begun to realize that he was lost to her forever and Ethel had him in thrall . Of recent weeks he had taken to going to Sunday school , and she had the dreadful duty of standing up and teaching her class in which both he and Ethel sat . Once or twice she had dared ask him a question as to who Joab was or what relative Queen Esther was to Mordecai , as was her wont with the other students , but when hep249mumbled out that he had n't read the lesson , she knew he was not interested in Sunday school , but only in Ethel . She avoided him now as much as possible , and as soon as the benediction had been said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the path home alone . She would do this even though she and Ethel perhaps had walked over together . She knew Alvin would want to go back with them , and it was too much to endure his forbearance to herself and his absorption in Ethel . And as she went her solitary way home she knew that somewhere behind her the two of them were strolling along , chatting , pinching off twigs , and giving shy glances at each other now and then , and maybe stopping in the deep woods to gather flowers , or standing leaning over the railing of the footlog , looking in the waters of the creek below where their images were reflected close together . Yes , he was no longer hers , and why should she be the third unwanted party ? The philosophers of counselers and kings attribute the deeper nature of tragedy to those who walk in high places . But if the capacity to suffer remains any test , then Ivy was not so different from poor Butterfly or Marguerite or Ophelia , after all  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive . Withoutbenefit of psychiatry she never knew that she had had a nervous breakdown , and gradually she felt her way forward to victory over her heart . For she possessed something to lean upon in time of direst need  --  her religion . Unlike her sisters of the city , she was one of those people who live fast by the ways of nature and who draw their sustenance of spiritual strength from the wisdomof sun and rain , the plants and trees , as God revealed it to her . Taught by her father from earliest childhood to believe that an all-wise and beneficent Maker ruled the ways of heaven and earth , she had grown up straight and undeviating in that faith and she had a place of refuge when devastating storms should break about her head . With slight variation of Hegelian phrase , she was one of those who believed that all that is is rational and for a purpose , however hidden from man 's eye . If dry weather struck the crop , she never complained too much , for on second thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficent design in this act . And she never considered for a moment that there was anythingirrational or cruel in hog-killings , the slaughtering of beeves , or the cutting down of vegetables in the garden . For so it was ordainedthat man should have his food . The bitter wailings and loud complaints of certain modern thinkers over this necessary cruelty and mutual slaughter of living things would have seemed blasphemousand atheistic to her . The outlook of such literary charactersas Jude Fawley did not belong in her system of thought . For do not the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork ? And if the hail came or too early frost , or if spectacular summer storms shrieked and cannonaded and tore the sky to tatters , she observed it all with a quiet eye and found it but again an instance of that great Power who in the impenetrable depths beyond the stars ruled the wishes and wants of men . But victory over this , her heart 's last and deepest desire , was won only after long prayers and fasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her tear-stained pillow : " I ca n't give him up . I 'll die . " And yet deep down in her she knew there was something stronger than life or death , something that abided beyond all the turmoil and strains of human existence , and on that she must lean . Then one night the answer came to her . She heard a voice clearly in the darkness , dropping down from the sky through the roof of the house and infusing her soul with its blessing . " Be of good cheer , my child , " the voice said . " Grief is of little while and joy is long . Trust in me and I will lead you through the dark night . My ways are not your ways , and all is part of my great plan for the glory of Christ crucified and for thine own soul 's good . " " Amen ! " she whispered fervently . " Be of good cheer , my child , be of good cheer , " the voice sang , " for though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my son who died that thou and all thy kind mightest be saved . Lean thou upon mine everlasting arm and know no fear . " The voice died away and Ivy cried out in broken sobs , " Forgive my little faith . Forgive . " As the days whirled by , Alvin tore on with his work , and all the while his mind was full of Ethel 's sweet wonder . Since that kiss on the night of wine and gaiety he had not dared so much as to touchp251her hand . But every day and every hour his love of her increased . A few times he had accompanied her home from Sunday school and stayed for dinner , and afterwards she had played the organ while he sat and watched her nimble fingers flying over the keys . Sometimes she would sing to his entranced ears " The Curse of an Aching Heart , " or " In the Garden of Allah , " or the ballad of " Frankie and Albert . " And then they would parch popcorn or eat walnuts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been reading a book , " she said , " and it tells how in New York they 've got a building thirty stories high . " And Alvin would watch her eyes , her lighted face and red lips , and wish with all his heart he could kiss her . " Have you ever been to New York , Alvin ? " " Good Lord , no ! " he laughed , and then he would go over to his overcoat and pull out a package . " I 've got something for you . " She liked candy and often he would bring her some from the village . And they would sit close together on the sofa and open it , and she would feed him bits with her fingers , just the way Rosa had done with the chicken pie long ago . Then at ten o'clock he 'd go away , his heart vaguely aching for want of her . Ah , he could never come near such a wonder all the days of his life . Ethel had already become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards their sweethearts and would gather around her at church . But she obviously discouraged them . And by midsummer it was generally agreed that Alvin Barnes must be the lucky one . True , some of the neighbors had wen her once or twice sitting by Boyd Collins ' side as his two horses flew along the country roads . But of course that could mean nothing serious , seeing as how she and Alvin were going together hot and heavy . Ethel better watch her step , for Minnie Bryant had played around Boyd once too often and everybody knew what happened to her . ( The night in the parlor Alvin , after a long silence , turned to her and asked , " Was that you I saw today passing with Boyd Collins ? " " Yes , " she laughed , staring at him with innocent eyes . " I was down by the road , picking blackberries , when he came along . It was so hot and dusty he said he 'd bring me on home . But then he said why not drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so we did . You do n't mind , do you ? " she queried , laying her hand on his arm . " He 's got a bad character and I wish you would n't , Ethel . " " He 's harmless , Alvin . " " But you 've heard about Minnie Bryant ? " " Yes , he told about her himself . He asked if people had n't poisoned me against him and I said no . He said she was the craziest girl under the sun and he had never harmed a hair of her head , but the people got to talking . She talked a lot of foolishness herself , he said . But if you do n't want me to , I wo n't bother with him any more . " Then to change the subject , she asked him about his crop and how much money he expected to make the next year . " I hear you 're near about a rich man already , " she said with a laugh . " I wish to the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined . " And I will be , some day , I will . " " I believe you will , Alvin , " she answered , giving him a long look out of her gray eyes . The crop was only medium that year , but for his disappointment he had the thought of Ethel to console him . Already he 'd made up his mind as to what he would do . He would marry and settle down as soon as he was a little bit ahead . And the picture of him and Ethel living in his grandfather 's house almost took his breath away . In the fall when his tobacco was sold , Alvin had cleared five hundreddollars , besides he had three bales of cotton , which , with the seed , should bring him a hundred and fifty more . " Not so bad  --  ahem ! " said Mr. Turner as they settled their accountsone evening on the dining-room table . " Reckon I come out well as could be expected , " he replied . And then the landlord broached the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , I wanted to talk with you about that , Mr. Turner , " and then he hesitated . " Go ahead . Do n't tell me you still got your mind on that Clay Jones place . " " Yes , sir , that 's it . " " It 's going to be a wedding sure enough this time , is it ? " " Well , sir , I do n't know just yet . "  |p253After  a moment the old man went on , " I do n't know what Dave Layton is going to do next year . He has n't spoken to me about renting again , but of course I could move him out , though I had thought of another plan . If that works out , why I might talk about trading with you . You 've still got that note have you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , of course that could go along towards the first payment . " " That 's what I was hoping . " Alvin knew that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business had not been going so well . The stock had shrunk almost in half and few people came in to buy . So , after all , things might be working out the way he planned . But never a glint of satisfaction showed in his stolid countenance . " And how much do you think you could pay down in case we do trade ? " " Well , sir , that six hundred and maybe five hundred more  --  five hundred and fifty , which would bring it up to eleven hundred and fifty . " " You seem to be getting right ahead , Alvin , " Mr. Turner went on . " You work hard , but of course you 've been lucky . And let me tell you now , luck is a thing you ca n't count on in farming . " But Alvin thought to himself that luck was the least item of importance in his advancement . For one thing , when the tobacco market opened the price was good , and he had hired the Beasley children and rushed through the grading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of November his crop was disposed of . Already the market was flooded , the price had begun to decline , and the other farmers were grumbling . Sense and not luck was what brought success in this world . But he said nothing of that to Mr. ' rumen " Of course if we do n't come to an agreement about that place you would n't mind renewing the note , would you ? " the landlord concluded as he rose . And Alvin stood up also and looked at the floor a while without saying anything . " I 'd take care of the interest you know , " the little man went on nervously . " I 've been counting on getting me a place somewhere , " Alvin spoke up , and out of the corner of his eye he could see that Mr. Turner was disturbed . " You mean you 're thinking of buying some other place if I do n't sell ? " " Well , yes , sir , I reckon that 's so . I wanted to get started on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I see . Well , I 'll let you know in a few days . " One evening during the next week he came out to the barn where Alvin was milking the cow , and told him he thought the deal could be put through , and the price be five thousand dollars , with one-fourth of it down . Alvin gave the cow 's teats such a gripping that she kicked the bucket from between his knees . But Mr. Turner did n't seem to notice as he leaned against the gate and stared off across the field . " I do n't say for certain , you understand , but maybe we could work it . And then what about the payments after that ? " " What do you think , sir ? " Alvin asked , quietly resuming the milking . " Of course I 'd want you to pay it as quick as you could , but I 've got to be reasonable . Reckon you could pay for it in nine years ? " " Why , yes , sir , maybe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , my boy . We first mentioned five , but nine years to pay the balance would be over four hundred dollars , and then the interest the first year would be two-twenty-five . And remember you got a mule , and tools , and some furniture to buy . " " Yes , sir , that 's right . " " Of course I 'd have to have a mortgage on it , you understand , until the debt was paid off  --  ahem . You understand about that , I suppose . " " You mean that the land would n't really be mine until the last dollar was paid . " " That 's it exactly . " Then he went on hurriedly , " Of course if you fell behind in the payments we would n't fall out . " " No , sir , we would n't , " Alvin replied warmly , his heart full of thankfulness to the little man . " Yes , " he thought to himself , " Mr.p255Layton was right , there could n't be a better landlord than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ahem , " he coughed , " I wonder if maybe you might let me have the five hundred to-morrow . " " I reckon so , sir , " Alvin answered warily . " I 'll make it good as gold to you . I 'll give you a note and write in it that the thirty-acre tract down there is collateral . That means , " he laughed nervously , " that you 've got a mortgage on it until we settle the trade . " " All right , sir , I 'll give it to you after supper , " Alvin answered quickly . " And that reminds me , you have n't said who the girl is . " As Alvin made no reply , he went on , " Could n't by chance be Ivy , after all . " " No , sir , it 's not Ivy , " he finally mumbled . " I wish it was , " the little man replied curtly , and opening the lot gate he went back towards the house . Near the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farmers in the section had got out of the habit of having these communal gatherings of recent years , for in the rush of tobacco-grading and hard work they gathered their corn at odd moments and barned it in the husk . But Dave Layton kept to the old style . Friday evening Alvin did his chores early and , dressed in his second best suit , he went up the road to the corn-shucking . When he arrived at the lot fence he found quite a number of the neighbors already ringed around the horse-shoe pile , like people on their knees in prayer . The shucks were piling up behind them and the ears of corn were flying towards the barn like a homing flock of turtle doves sinking down to roost . He found an empty place beside Mr. Layton himself and , squatting down , tore into the hank of ears rising before him . " Howdy , Alvin . " " Howdy , Mr. Layton . " " Hi , Alvin ! " others called from around the bend . He noticed that Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That must mean music and good times after the corn was finished.  | Every now and then , as he pushed the shucks back behind him , he would glance towards the house beyond the road . He could sec the windows lighted there and shining out through the falling gloom , and the figures of the womenfolks were passing back and forth as they prepared the supper . One of them must be Ethel . And now Sam Adams lifted up his voice in song , " She 'll be coming'round the mountain , " but only a few others joined in with him , and soon they all died down to silence . Anyway , who ever heard of music being started up before the supper was served ? But then Sam Adams was always bubbling over with tunes , and ready to try his banjo or his voice any time of the night or day . Presently there was a soft " heigho " beyond the lot fence and , looking back , Alvin saw three or four girls standing there . " Come on to supper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old men would be served first , and , creeping up to a standing position , some dozen of them went off . The light had disappearedfrom the sky in the west , and the cold November moon began to rise behind the little barn , spilling its white light across the fields where the dried tobacco stalks stood straight and dead , and the shucking continued , unabated . After an ungodly wait the old men began creeping back , picking their teeth and chewing their tobacco vigorously . " I ai n't et so much since  --  since Mike was a pup , " old Eph Bethea was saying . " Yay-hoo ! " shouted old Jed Boykin . " Let 's git this corn un-dressed ! " Ethel 's voice called again from the road , " Some more of you-all come on to supper . " Ten or twelve young men sprang lightly to their feet , Alvin among them , and made their way hurriedly out of the lot and towards the kitchen . Dave Layton 's people knew how to spread a feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato custard , cake , several kinds of pickles , fried chicken , eggs , biscuits , and bread . And the young girls in their Sunday dresses stood about and waited on their lords . Dark-eyed Ada Parrish , Grissy Rand , Betty Barksdale , Mildred Harrison , and others of that set were there . But Alvin had earsp257and eyes only for Ethel , as she moved graciously around the table in her pink house dress , fetchingly set off by little turned-up cuffs . And such appetites ! In a little while slim Russ Peterson announced that he was being helped to his twelfth biscuit , and Sam Adams laughed scornfully and said , " I 'm five ahead of you . " And all the while the young girls kept pushing the food forward . Several times Ethel had come up behind Alvin and asked him to have something more . And when at last they had gorged themselves to the limit , they moved regretfully back to the corn pile . The disgruntled boys who already felt the rights and privileges of men brewing in them , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the shucking went furiously on . Mr. Layton had offered a prize of a dollar to the one who first shucked through the pile , and the ears of corn literally flew through Alvin 's hand . He would have that dollar , and an admiring look out of Ethel 's eyes . By this time the moon had swum up above the barn , and across its white disk some of the ears passed with a tail of shuck on them from an over-zealous slubbering hand . When the boys returned they were accompanied by the girls , who stood about in shucks up to their waist behind the row of men . There were little " Oos ! " and " Oh , me ! " and " Oh , my ! " as their eyes searched the moonlit scene for their respective beaux . And apparently without design or preferenceeach feminine form finally sank down at its appointed place . Alvin had already made room by his side for some one , and in a moment there she was . " Can I help you shuck some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman 's duty . " Yes , " Alvin answered , and his voice was slightly aloof , for the benefit of his near neighbors . The girls were all settled at last , and their little hardened , wiry hands pulled at the tough shucks , and every now and then one would say , " You break this off , Lloyd ; it 's too hard for me . " And Lloyd would oblige by squeezing her hand as he took the ear from her . " I got a red ear , " Reid Boykin shouted . And then after that red ears were found often , for each one meant the privilege of a kiss . And then there were little flurries and battles around the edge of the shucks as the forfeits were claimed . Alvin sat saying nothing ,  |p258but  his heart was thumping in his breast . He would never have nerve to be such a liar as that . " My ! you 're ahead of everybody else ! " Ethel said as she saw the big hole he had burrowed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great head and snatchinganother ear towards him . " I want that dollar . " Now and then his hand would touch hers as she fumbled among the ears . And in a little while she said , " I 've found one . " " Found what ? " he asked . " A red ear . " " Let me see it . " But she pushed the flap of the shuck back down and said , " No . I 'll keep that for good luck . " And then the moon , as if furthering all these wiles and ways , hid itself behind a cloud , and Alvin bent quickly and kissed her . And when it came out again he happened to notice the ear of corn she was shucking and he saw with great jubilancy that it was not red at all . And as everybody expected , he won Mr. Layton 's dollar . The girls retired to the house to make ready for the fun . And now the shucks must be cleaned up . The young men carried them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then spread themselves out in a row , arms clasped around each other , and kicked the scattered leavings in a growing wave before them towards the shelter . The corn-shucking was over . The old men stood about the pile and talked with Mr. Layton , estimating the number of barrels it made and examining the corn , praising it , and saying they would like to get seed from him for the coming year . The young men and boys had already brushed the corn silks from their clothes and gone eagerly towards the house . And there until late in the night Tim Messer and Sam Adams played their foot-itching music , and the couples whirled happily up and down . Several times Alvin 's arm was around Ethel 's waist and her hand was resting on his shoulder . And he breathed the perfume of her hair , and felt the warmth of her soft , energetic body . Once he thought of Ivy and wondered why she was n't there . And Ethel seemed to sense his thought , for a little later shep259said Ivy had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to stay for the evening . And then Mr. Layton came in with a pitcher of cider and served it around , and then awarded the silver dollar to Alvin . There was loud clapping of hands , and voices saying , " Hooray for Alvin Barnes . " Then the music set up again . " Golly ! " he said , his burning gaze upon Ethel 's cheeks and eyelashes as he swung her about , " this neighborhood was dead before you come . " And then the heavy lids lifted from the mysterious depths of her gray eyes . " And it was dead up in Granville County , too , " she murmured . And then changing the subject with the greatest of ease , she asked , " Are you going to the association Sunday ? " " What association ? " " Over at Williams ' Grove . I 'm a delegate . " " Let me take you . " " I hoped you would , " she said . " I 'll get a horse from Mr. Turner . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual high note , leaned over , and began putting his fiddle in the case . " Oh , Tim , Tim , come on ! " several of the young people begged , loosening their arms from around their partners and crowding towards him . " Nope , " Tim said . " It 's late . I got to work tomorrow . " The next Sunday Alvin drove Ethel over to Williams ' Grove , and through most of the journey he was silent as the grave . Heas involved in the endless process of building up his courage and feeling it ooze away . " Yes , " he was saying to himself , " when I get to that tree yonder , or when we pass over the rise there , I 'll ask her . " But stumps and trees and rises gradually went by and the question still trembled on his tongue . No , it would be better , he finally decided , to wait until they had started back home . And when finally the church business had been concluded down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey began . It was near night now , the weather had turned colder , and with the buggy robe pulled up high over their knees they gradually snuggledcloser and closer together from the icy wind that had begun to blow out of the north . And finally his free hand , which hadp26obeen kept under the robe for a purpose , found hers and held it . And now he would ask her . But suddenly she spoke up and said , " I 've got something to tell you . " He pressed her fingers and waited . " We 're going to move . " She felt his hand convulsively clutch hers , and , laughing , she went on , " But not far away . At least I reckon we 're going to move . Father 's talking about it . " " Where ? " " Last night Mr. Turner was down to the field and wants us to come live in his house . " " Oh ! " and Alvin breathed with obvious relief . " Yes , he said he had  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says we can take the east wing and have plenty of room , and still keep house there same as if we lived in a different dwelling from him . " " Yes , it 's a mighty big place . " " I wonder what he 's going to do with the place we live in ? " " Sell it to me , " Alvin answered briefly . " You ? " she turned and looked at him . " Yes , me . I 'm buying it . " " Good gracious ! I did n't know you had all that money . " " I 'm not paying for it all at once . But I 'm able to make a good start . " And then he took her by the shoulders and pulled her towards him . " You will  --  you will  --  come and live in it , wo n't you , Ethel ? " " Why , " she went on in the same surprised tone , " think of you  --  already buying a place ! Why father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dream began expanding before him . " Yes , and then I 'll buy more . Say , let me tell you something . People like Mr. Clem , they do n't know how to farm . They 're losing money every year . You watch him . Down there in the store his business is failing , too , and some day , some day he 's going to sell that big house . Watch and see if he do n't ! " " And you 'll be the one to buy it , wo n't you ? " she asked in a low voice , staring at him as if fascinated.  | " I 'm not saying , " he answered , but she could see what he had in his mind . And then she hugged his arm tightly across her bosom . " You 're going to be a big man , Alvin , I just know it . . . . No , no , you must n't , " and she pushed his eager face from her . Looking off presently , he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , and you 'll ride in a carriage . Two horses will be pulling it . It 'll have yellow tassels around the top and the niggers will come out of the hedge and take off their hats as we go driving past . " " Alvin , " she murmured , and snuggling up against him , she laid her head on his shoulder . As they jogged over the next rise he said : " It 's settled , ai n't it ? Say it is , Ethel ! " But she made no reply . And as they drove up in front of her father 's house he said again , " Then is settled between us . " " Maybe , maybe , " she answered . " But we must n't be too quick , Alvin . " " Please ! Please ! " he begged fiercely , pulling her back as she shade a move as if to get down out of the buggy . But she gave her head a little shake . " I 'm just eighteen and ou 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Last week I was . "  | D URING the winter days that followed he paid court to Ethel with all the devotion of his stubborn nature . He continued his work on the farm , however , digging around the large stumps that still remained on his cotton patch and cleaning up the hedgerows . But regularly on Wednesday night he was to be found sitting , all dressed up in her parlor , while she reclined on the sofa or played the organ and sang . And on Sunday he walked with her to Sunday school and afterwards back again and stayed for dinner , there to remain through the afternoon and into the night . Naturally , before such slavish worship her woman 's vanity began to show itself . Gradually she began to exact little morsels of toll from his altar offering . " Would you mind bringing me some water , Alvin ? " or : " You 'll have to go home early tonight . I 've got a headache , " or " Bring me a box of tooth-powder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any serenader of ancient days , he leaped to do these pleasures for the mistress of his heart . But still to his pressing statement that all was settled between them Ethel returned a vague and evasive reply . " Now that your folks are going to live up to Mr. Turner ' house , what 's to hinder us from making it almost the day right after that ? " And she would study the trim toe of her laced calfskin shoe an . say : " We 'll see , Alvin . Let 's wait and see . " " But , but , " he would hurry on , seizing her hand hungrily in both of his . " You do n't know  --  maybe you do n't know just how it i Looks like I ca n't stand it without you another day , Ethel . Lord I do n't think about a thing but you . When I 'm milking , cutting wood , digging  --  no matter what  --  it 's you that 's in my mind . An sometimes at night I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , I dream about you  --  yes , I do . " And then his powerful arm would go around her , holding IItightlyto him . " Look out , Alvin , " she would gasp . " You 're breakp263Dag my ribs . Oh , I got a new piece of sheet music come yesterday . Let me play it on the organ for you . " And slipping out of his rasp , she would twirl the stool around to the right height , sit down , and begin . " Sing me to sleep , the shadows fall , " her throaty voice called . And Alvin 's heavy hands would rest across his kneeshe sat staring at the back of her bright head , his heart suffocatingith yearning . One day he was in the drug store to get a box of stationery and bottle of lilac water for her . As Boyd Collins snapped the rubber nd around the package he looked over and said , " I bet I can css who these are for . " Alvin made no reply , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . It was being rumored about that Boyd Collins took dope now and then . " And w is the little lady now ? " the druggist went on blandly as he ndcd the package to Alvin . " Who ? " " I la-ha-ha ! Who 'm I talking about ? Why , Ivy Chadbourne , of arse , " he sneered . " Say , by the way , I hear you folks had a big ow-out at the corn-shucking a few weeks back . " " I I-m , " was all the answer Alvin made , as he tried to control his ing anger . Lord ! how he 'd like to knock the stuffing out of that low . " And I hear , " the sport continued with half-closed eyes , as he .1 ; ( xi up a hand mirror and began to finger his little dark mustache , " I hear that Brother Snipes had a lot to say about all this acing last Sunday . " " Well , they ai n't any harm in it , is there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joy  --  that 's me . But still , you t't go against the preacher , not in this neighborhood . I 've suggested to the little lady she better maybe go a bit easy on the ndigs . " " You have ? " " Why , I 'm her friend , you know , I 'm her friend , and I wish the best there is . " And his liquid brown eyes shot a hard Ice-look out at Alvin as he turned away . Whatever the effect of Boyd 's warning  --  if he did warn her  --  Brother Snipes 's tirades from the pulpit , Ethel gave no more parties . Of late she seemed to take more interest in the church than formerly , and with Ivy worked up the idea of having a Christmas tree . She sent off for some song-books , and at Sunday school she began to teach Christmas hymns to the young folks . Much to the chagrin of the regular organist , Molly O'Quinn , she sat at the organ and played and led them into " Silent Night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " 0 Little Town of Bethlehem . " For the first time in his life Alvin raised his voice in song or rather lowered it into the floundering mumbling bass of a great bumblebee . " Above thy deep and dreamless sleep , The silent stars go by . " On Christmas Eve morning he and Obie Beasley 's son , Walter , cut a holly tree in the woods at Ethel 's direction , and set it up in front of the pulpit . And then she and Ivy brought in boxes of decorations , and the four of them began dressing the tree up . They fastened little tallow candles on the limbs , draped the tinsel and spangles down from the top , and tied little glass trinkets here and there . At first Alvin was embarrassed by Ivy 's presence , but as the work went on he noticed that she seemed to be her old self again  --  the Ivy he had first known when he came to live in her father 's house . If she happened to speak to him it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former days . " Please cut me a piece of string , " or , " Hand me that glass ball there with the red stripes , Alvin , please . " And it seemed as if they were on their old footing again . Most of his attention and help were given over to Ethel , and that seemed satisfactory enough to stooping , sadfacedWalter Beasley , for he was constantly by Ivy 's side . Once when she pricked her finger with a holly leaf , he seemed terribly upset and wanted to go home for medicine to put on it . " You might ketch blood-poisoning or something , " he said , sorrowfully , as he gazed at the tiny drop of blood . " Why , it 's nothing at all , " Ivy laughed as she went on working . " So that 's the way it is , " Alvin thought to himself . " But , golly ! she 's worth a fieldful of such pitiful fellows as Walter . "  | " You know what , Ethel ? " Ivy suddenly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll be it , " Walter said . " We might get Mr. Fab Hutchins , or maybe Mr. Turner would do it , " Alvin spoke up . " No , we 've got to have old Saint Nick himself , " Ethel said , " and Mr. Collins  --  " " We do n't want him , " Alvin answered quickly and with the authority of an old church member and pillar of the congregation . " He told me yesterday , " Ethel began , and Alvin looked up , " when I went down there to buy these trinkets , he told me he 'd like to be the Sandy Claus . Said he had a suit all ready . " " Yes , he would have , or he 'd get one , " Alvin muttered . It was late afternoon now and the neighbors began arriving to tic their presents on the tree . Ethel said she had done all she could and would have to hurry home . Alvin went over to her side in the corner and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She hesitated a moment and then replied that she had an engagementfor the evening . " What ! " he exclaimed . And staring out of the window she told him that Boyd Collins was coming by to fetch her . " Look here , Ethel , " he said , taking her by the arm , " you ca n't do that . " " He 's bringing his Sandy Claus suit over there for me to helphim fix it up . I expect he 's already at the house , waiting . " " He ought to quit it , he ought to quit it , " Alvin growled . " Quit what ? " " Why , this messing around with folks ai n't his sort , that 's what . Why do n't he go on and associate with the McDonalds or the Atkinses or the McKays ? He do n't mean any good by all this flyingaround . Well , you know what I  --  " and his voice died out miserably . " I do n't think you ought to talk like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of people think it 's nice the way Boyd Collins takes interest in the church up here . " " It ai n't the church he takes interest in. "  | And now she laid her hand kindly on his arm as if to quiet his rising temper . " You stay here and help Ivy get everything straightened up , and then we 'll all be back at seven-thirty . " " I 've got to go , too , " said Walter , as he gazed longingly at the side of Ivy 's face . " Pa 's gone down to Linnyville and the wood 's to cut and the pigs to feed . " " You come on and walk home with me then , Walter ! " Ethel called , and the two of them went away together . Ivy and Alvin continued the little workings around the tree , sprinkling snow on the floor and helping the neighbors fasten their presents on . And now old Si Clement , the general factotum of the little church , arrivedand began lighting the swinging oil-lamps . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching for her little thin coat . Alvin helped her on with it , shuffled into his overcoat , and followed her out of the church . " It feels like snow , " he said as they stopped on the steps and looked out to the west , where a cold , murky gloom was spreading up the sky . " Would n't that be fine , " Ivy answered with quiet gaiety , " to have snow at Christmas ! " " I ai n't never seen snow at Christmas , " he said . " I have , once , when I was about ten years old , and we made a snow man out in the yard . We were living on General McClean 's land then and I can remember the McClean girls riding by our house in a buggy body . The wheels had been taken off and they 'd put some scantlings under it for runners . And all day they rode up and down on the road . " " They did n't take you for a ride , did they ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , that 's right , why should n't they ? " he replied curiously , as they set off down towards Ivy 's house together . " Reckon I 'd better go with you . It 's kinder dark , " he said ; so they walked in silence for a while , and Alvin was reminded of another night when he walked with her and talked like a fool . They went on without a word until they neared her house , and then Ivy asked , " Whenp67is it going to be , Alvin ? " and she dabbed her handkerchief with apparent firmness against her cold nose . " When what ? " " You and Ethel . We heard Mr. Layton and his wife are going to move up to Mr. Turner 's and you and  --  and her were going to live in the house down there . " " Who told you ? " " I do n't know . " And now they had reached the porch . Ivy turned and stuck out her hand . " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said quietly . " Thanky , Ivy , " he said , forgetting to shake her outstretched hand . When Alvin had finally finished his chores and dressed it was already eight o'clock , and he arrived at the church late . The con- gregation had already assembled . In the vestibule a dozen little oys and girls with unlighted tapers in their hands were milling about . And Ethel , dressed like a queen and with a twinkling clasp pin in her hair , was herding them into quiet . She glanced up and nodded at him as he stopped . " Go right in , " she said . " We 're getting ready to begin . " " Where is old Sandy Claus , " he asked with a little bite in his voice . " He 's coming  --  he 's coming tonight sure ' nuff , " some of the children cried out excitedly . Then Ivy came out into the vestibule , and Ethel turned the children over to her , for she had to go in and play the organ . Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he could help with passing out the presents if necessary . He carried a package in his pocket which he had meant to put on the Christmas tree , but now it was too late to do it . After all , perhaps that was best , for he 'd have a chance to give it to Ftlicl himself and Sandy Claus Collins would not handle it . Ethel stood up by the organ and announced in her cool voice that the exercises were ready to begin , and the light from the lamp hanging above and the little candles burning on the Christmastree set the pin in her hair sparkling . " She 's plumb purty as an angel , " a voice said to Alvin , and ,  |p268looking  down , he saw Aunt Margaret , the sanctified and holy woman of Little Bethel , sitting at his side . He said nothing in reply as he watched Ethel play the opening bars of " 0 Little Town of Bethlehem . " From the rear vestibule came Ivy 's voice , followed by the reedy treble notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little line of marchers came slowly down the aisle , holding . their lighted tapers in a row . As they came on forward the congregation twisted and looked on with surprise . Crossing in front of the pulpit , they ringed themselves around the Christmas tree , holding their tapers aloft . Then after a moment of silence the organ gave the cue and both the children and the congregation sang " Silent Night . " When that was ended , old Si Clements walked along in front of the children and blew out their candles . And Brother Snipes stood up then , led in a word of prayer , and talked a short while about the birth of Jesus and the wonders of that first Christmas night nineteen hundred years ago . He wound up by saying , " I know everybody 's anxious to get at his presents , so I bid Old Sandy Claus come in . " And then the door by the pulpit opened and Boyd Collins came in dressed in his red cap and white beard , and carrying a sack over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murmur rose among the audience . Brother Snipes rose and lifted his hands in gentle warning at the levity . Silence immediately came over the scene . And then Boyd Collins took charge . He made a little talk which amused everybody , telling about what a hard trip he had coming down from the North Pole and how deep the snow was in the wilds of Canada . His reindeer had become awful tired , he said , but , knowing that all these folks were waiting for his appearance , he had struggled on and on and finally got here . Old Si Clements and Mr. Snipes began to clip the presents from the tree and Sandy Claus read off the names in the best style of Fab Hutchins , who sat in lowly nonentity among the congregation . He passed out the gifts with appropriate remarks about this boy or that girl , and Alvin noticed that the name read out most often was Ethel Layton 's , though Sandy Claus made no references to her except to say once that she seemed very popular . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burn low and thep269last gift was distributed , Ethel seated herself at the organ again and everybody sang the last stanza of " Silent Night . " Brother Snipes delivered the benediction , and the audience rose from their seats . Immediately a clamor and bustle set up . Young people turned towards one another to see and examine their gifts . Alvin started up towards the Christmas tree , hoping to get a chance to speak with Ethel , when down in the crush of people about him he heard a little whimpering mouse-like voice . Looking over Aunt Margaret 's shoulder , he saw little Hiram Beasley , Obie 's baby boy , shaking with suppressed sobs . " Hey , what 's the matter , sonny ? " he asked . The little boy only shook his head and kept on whimpering . Alvin had bent his ear close down . " Tell Alvin what 's the trouble . " And little Hiram held up a man 's black bow tie , the kind the village undertaker wore . " I did n't want that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking for myself , " Alvin said . " Gim me here , " and he took it from him . " Yours must be up there under the tree right this minute . I 'll go see . " Making his way to the Christmas tree , he picked up a wad of discarded tissue paper , wrapped fifty cents in it , and turned back . " Look here , " he said , " I knowed your present was up there . " And when little Hiram unrolled the paper and saw the fifty cents he dived wildly off to find his father . Alvin looked around for Ethel , but she was nowhere to be seen , and gradually the people began going out of the church . Old Si Clements came over and asked him if he and Walter Beasley would help him clean up a bit on account of the danger of fire . " Yes , " said Alvin , " I 'll help you . " And so they blew the candles out on the tree , picked up the scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that Old Si said they 'd have to take the tree down because there 'd be preaching tomorrow and there would n't be room for the folks . By the time they 'd done this the last person and buggy had gone home . Alvin set off walking along the road , for it was too dark to travel the footpath through the woods . The weather had turned warmer , the promise of snow was one , and soon a light chilly rain began to fall . He still carriedEthel 's present in his pocket , and as he neared the Turner place he saw a light across the field in Ethel 's house . He said to himself , " Well , she 's still up and I 'll go over and give it to her now . " He did n't confess to himself that jealousy of Boyd Collins was what actuated him . Anyway , if Collins was still there , the present would give him an excuse for calling . He knew the fields perfectly , even in the darkness of night , and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This route brought him up behind the house , and as he drew near he could see a light in the parlor . As he passed the window , he looked in and saw Boyd Collins and Ethel standing in the middle of the room under the mistletoe . He had his arms about her and was bending down over her , but she had turned her face away and was shaking her head . Alvin whirled around the house and in a bound crossed the porch and flung open the door . They had heard him coming and now stood facing him . Collins looked at him , his mouth open and his face pale as if he had seen a ghost . And then , as Alvin stood there , his great hands closing and unclosing , Collins smiled a weak smile . " What 's the idea of breaking in on us like this , brother ? " " Get out ! Get out ! " Alvin hissed and moved towards him . The sport backed towards the side door , jerked it open , flew down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to hesitate a moment and then slowly swung shut after him . Ethel stood still , saying nothing , and then , as if suddenly about to collapse , she leaned sidewise towards the sofa and sat down heavily . In a moment he was beside her , holding her hands in his . " A wonder  --  wonder I did n't kill him , " he muttered . At last she raised her eyes to his . He could see her lips were trembling and her face was pale . " You  --  you scared me so , " she said . " I reckon I scared him , all right , " he muttered grimly . And then she began to weep softly and piteously , her face bowed in her hands . " He  --  he kept trying to kiss me , and I would n't let him , " she murmured brokenly . " Do n't cry . Do n't cry , " he said . " You could n't help that . " And then he noticed a little chain around her neck which let a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pain.  | " Where did you get that ? " he finally asked in as quiet a voice as he could command . " What ? " and she straightened up . And then instinctively her hand went to the locket . " It  --  it was one of the presents on the Christmas tree , " she answered timidly . " He  --  he give it to you , " and his eyes stared accusingly at her . " But there 's no harm in it , Alvin . Look , it opens , " and pulling it out of her bosom she started to open it . It was set in the middle by a little green jewel like the pin in her hair and in the light it Nvinked at him with its little demon 's eye . " Do n't open it . Take it off . " " But , Alvin  --  " " Take it off ! " he snarled . Then she sprang up and stood facing him , her eyes beginning to light up with anger . " You ca n't boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alvin 's hand was already raised to snatch the chain from around her neck , but now he lowered it . Seeing her advantage , she went on : " We 're not even engaged yet . And if you 're going to act like this we never will be  --  never ! " And now it was Alvin 's turn to be on the defensive . After all , a girl could n't help a man 's wanting to kiss her , and who alive would n't want to kiss Ethel ? And had n't he seen with his own eves that she had tried to push Boyd Collins off ? " I 'm sorry , " he said . She was moved and flattered by the fierce , reckless devotion and jealousy in her behalf , and finally she resumedher seat at his side . Any girl in Little Bethel would give her finger to be loved like this  --  and by Alvin Barnes , the handsomestyoung man for miles , the smartest and the strongest , and the one who was going farthest in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's nothing compared with you . " And suddenly , like a fleeting cloud , his black wrath had passed over and gone . He took off his overcoat , pulled a package from his pocket , opened it and showed her a glorious hand-woven shawl which he had bought for her . She uttered little exclamations of delight , draped it around her shoulders and posed for his benefit . And after that they sat close together , chatted and opened all the little presents which still lay on the bed . All kinds of cheap tokens of timid far-off worship sent by the young swains of the neighborhood  --  atwenty-five cent package of hairpins , a lace-bordered perfumed chamois skin , a ten-cent box of powder , a handkerchief , and a little silver slipper for a pin-tray . And then when she 'd thrown them carelessly aside he put his arm around her , and her head was on his shoulder . A dreamy sleepfulness seemed to enfold her , but Alvin 's mind was racing riotously ahead , for in his arms he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaping flames the visions of the future rose like vague palaces and towers of another world . Ah , nothing would be too hard for him now . There was nothing that he could n't accomplish ! With her in his house waiting for him to come home at night , clean and beautiful and loving , life and joy would be too much . Ah , thirty acres and a house , one mule and a wagon , a cow and three pigs , a little crib full of corn  --  what were they to offer a woman like her ! And in the rosy fire he saw a hundred acres , yes , two hundred acres , a big house on a hill , a great barn overflowing with hay and fodder and barrels of corn uncountable , great pens full of three-hundredpoundshoats , and a dozen great thick-shouldered mules , and horses , yes , two horses that fled along the road like swallows . " Honey ! Honey ! " he murmured , and bent to kiss her . But he saw the locket again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and tossed it onto the dresser . " And the pin , " he said . That too came out of her hair and was thrown down with a smile . And snuggling close to him , she laid her bright head with its heavy rich hair against his face . " When  --  when will it be ? " he stuttered . " Hush ! " she said . " Hush ! and let 's just look in the fire . " And now all his farthest vision shrank away and slept with her in peacefulness . An hour later , when he heard the old folks stirring in the next room , he rose to go . She was wide awake in an instant . " Good night , " she said . And then he pulled her to him . " Can we  --  can we make it next month ? " And once more that vague uncertain look came over her face . " It 's sweet , sweet , just like this . Oh , it 's sweet , Alvin ! "  | " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He fumbled helplessly . " I lush ! Hush ! " she said , laying her fingers on his lips . And he kissed them fervently . " Maybe in February ? " " Yes , maybe sometime soon . Now go along , honey . " A few nights later Mr. Turner came into his little room wherehe was preparing to go to bed and told him he was arranging fora deed to the thirty acres and the house . " Thanky , thanky , Mr.Turner . " The old man looked harassed and worn , and Alvin knewhe was sorely troubled over the condition of his business . " Would n't you like a mule too , Alvin ? " " Yes , sir , I got to get a mule . " " I can spare one of mine , I reckon . " " If you 'd sell me Maggie . " " Well , Maggie 's all right . But she 's a ' awful good mule . " " Yes , sir . That 's the kind I want . " " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Turner ? " " Two-fifty . " Alvin studied a moment and said , " Well , if you 'll trust me on time , I think  --  " " Sure , " Mr. Turner said . " Just give me your note for her . " What was a note now , what was any debt or hardship now ? Nothing , nothing at all in a world filled with the golden riches of Ethel 's love . " All right , sir . Any time you say . " " Dave Layton and his wife are going to live up here in the west wing . They 'll move in a few days . And Ethel , too , of course , unless  --  " and here he stopped and looked up . " That 'll be fine . They 'll be a lot of company to you , " Alvin spoke up hurriedly . " I 've got all the company I need down there at the storeahem  --  hah , " and he laughed his nervous little laugh . Alvin could see that it lacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be wanting to move down to your place yourself . " " Yes , sir , I will . "  | " Ahem  --  Ethel is a mighty pretty girl , mighty pretty . " Then he sighed again . " But it ai n't all settled betwixt us , " Alvin answered honestly . " Well , from the looks of things it soon will be , " and he looked up at Alvin sharply . " I hope you and her 'll be happy in that house down there . But , " and here he rose out of his chair , " I wish it was Ivy that was to live with you . " And with that he went away.  |p275FOR  the first time in his life Alvin had built a fire in a house thathe could call his own , and sitting down there before its cheerful he , his mind ran happily upon himself and the world in which he lived . He and Mr. Turner had come to an agreement about Maggie , and tonight , in her little stable across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new master . Mr. Layton had sold him enough corn and fodder on a credit to last until the next fall , and that day Alvin had borrowed one of the landlord 's wagons and driven over to Dunston for some furniture . He bought a bed , a washstand , a table , and three chairs , but even that made a hole in the money he had left after the first payment on his house and land . Mrs. Layton had lent him three quilts and a pair of sheets , and for the time being he was all snug and fixed . And a great elation was in his heart as he sat before the crackling fire , for the first step in his climb upward was achieved . Long ago  --  how long , he wondered  --  he had got the idea of some day owning the house in which his grandfather had lived so many years as a poor renter . And now it was a fact , or almost as good as a fact , for of course he 'd be able to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this very room old Clay Jones had sat night after night and read his books or tried out his music with his tuning-fork . And some day soon Ethel would be living here , and then the cup of his life would be running over , as the preacher said . And full of his own great success , his mind ran again by contrast on the story of his grandfather 's tragic life . Ambitious , a man of learning , but a failure ! There ought to have been something for him  --  some place in the world for one who tried so hard . He recollectedwhat his mother had told him about the old man 's interest in books . Many a time in the middle of the night , she said , the children would be waked up by some of them falling ker-blang on the floor . He would be sitting there by the fireplace studying until his eyes failed him and then he 'd fall to thinking of his problems , and the books would gradually slide off his lap to the floor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wonder it did n't kill him , sitting up all night like that ! And a wonder he did n't go blind , others would say . And perhaps it did shorten his life , Alvin thought , for he died about the time he was sixty , although he 'd always been a great power of a man  --  six feet one and straight as an arrow . He made a little pocket change now and then from teaching his singing schools around . He 'd go about in his buggy or walk when he had no buggy , giving his lessons here and there to the farmers ' children , and sometimes he 'd teach a couple of weeks of singing school in Little Bethel church . " And him worth the whole kit and caboodle of the proud landlords , " Alvin muttered aloud to himself . " Aye , he had grit , plenty of it , " he went on , as he recalled a typical incident in the old man 's life . One day the music professor from Little Bethel Academy came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner . During the meal the two of them got to talking about music , and forgetting their food they fell into a hot argument about some point dealing with the notes . And Clay Jones being the fiery fellow he was became so mad when the professor threw off on his learning that he ran him out of the house . Then he told his little wife Grandma Nancy to get his duds together . " Why ? " she said . " Because , " he said , " I 'm going off . " " Where ? " she asked . And then he said he was going up to the university for a while , and Nancy who had learned to know his whims and wishes by this time washed and ironed and got his clothes together that night . The next morning he hitched his mule to the buggy and rode off up the road  --  even though his crops needed ploughing the very day he drove away with the mule . He was gone all that summer . And Nancy , so Alvin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could and sent it to him . And she and the girls hoed in the fields trying to keep the grass out of the crops . They heard from him only once in a letter that said , " I was right and the professor wasp277wrong . " He worked so hard there that he had a heart attack , and Dr. Wilson , the university physician , had to send him home . He never got well from that spell . And soon after that he died . And there he lies tonight in Little Bethel churchyard with nothing to remember him by . " I 'll put a tombstone to his grave . I 'll do that very thing , " Alvin said with sudden grimness . And then as if addressing a living presence in the little room he murmured , " I know something of what you endured , Grandpa  --  I know . And I 'm gon na show ' em  --  show ' em . Land and money is what 'll do it  --  not books  --  " And drawing a stubby pencil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure on his crop for the coming year . Mr. Turner had said he could cure his tobacco in his barns until he had time to build himself a couple . Well , that would help a lot , for a good tobacco-barn cost two-hundred and fifty dollars . He had already spoken to Walter Beasley about working for hima hired hand , and Walter had accepted . He would need him to egin about the first of May , and at twenty dollars a month thatwould be eighty dollars out before he was able to sell any tobacco . That would leave him only twenty dollars in cash money , but he would arrange to do some hauling down in Linnyville on rainy days and maybe pick up a few dollars now and then . And as for his food , Mr. Turner had agreed to let him buy from the store on credit , and the fertilizer was always sold on time . Well , he was skimming mighty close to his last red cent , but somehow he would make it . As yet he had bought no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him use what he needed from the big house or sell him additional ones on a credit . Yes , there was no doubt about it , Mr. Turner had been fair and square . All the other landlords in the country might trick you or lie awake at night figuring how to chouse you out of your hard earnings , but not Mr. Turner . And Alvin felt comforted that one so powerful was his ally in his great struggle . During the week old Seth Cannady , a one-horse farmer up the river , died , and his daughter Liza advertised his personal property for sale . She was going back to Durham to live with her aunt . Alvin rode Maggie up to the sale and his heart was overcome with the bargains offered . Money was scarce in the neighborhood and there were few bidders on the property . Within two hours he found himself the possessor of a ramshackle Hackney buggy , a Cox cotton-planter , a Hickory wagon , a Ward siding-plow , a Boy-Dixie turning-plow , four quilts , five sheets , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match , and a small cook-stove , all for the price of sixty-seven dollars . He had a sinking feeling when he paid the money over , but deep down he knew that such bargains occurred only once in a lifetime , and as for Walter Beasley 's wages , he 'd have to figure out some other scheme . " Looks like you 're going into housekeeping sure enough , " Dollis Chadbourne laughed . He 'd bought a juniper washtub , a crate of geese , half a dozen chickens , and several home-made brooms himself . " You 're not doing so bad , either , " Alvin replied gleefully , and then he busied himself with collecting his purchases . He piled his belongings on the wagon , fastened the buggy behind , hitched Maggie between the shafts , and rode off . And now he really was fixed for housekeeping , and the only thing lacking was Ethel . He continued to go to see her as often as time would allow and she would permit . At first he was embarrassedthere in Mr. Turner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up tastefully enough and Ethel seemed to be entirely at home there in the big rooms with the paneling and carved work around the ceiling . One evening as he came walking up the road to sit with her a while he saw a two-horse buggy drive away . before him . " Was that Boyd Collins ? " he asked Ethel , a little later . She hesitated a moment and then said , " Yes , he came up to bring some things from the drug store . " " I did n't know he went around delivering stuff to folks , " he answered grouchily . " He do n't . I bought some things there yesterday , and forgot the package . He was nice enough to drive over with it . " And then she went on , " Have you heard the news about him ? " " No , what is it ? "  | " His father has opened a drug store over in Dunston , and Boyd is going over there tomorrow to take charge of it . " Alvin looked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Carl Stevens , you know , has been up to the university , studying pharmacy , and he 's going to run the store in Linnyville . And I 've got another surprise for you , " she continued gaily . " You have ? " " I 've got a job . I 'm going down to help Mr. Turner in his store . " " You mean clerk in it ? " " Well , just sort of help him out . He asked me last night . " Alvin gazed at the fire a while , saying nothing and then he turned to her firmly . " I wish you would n't . " " Why , my goodness ! why not ? " " I just wish you would n't . " " But I want to . It do n't pay much money , but still it helps alittle and it gives me something to do . Why do you object ? " " Because all kinds of fellows will be coming in to buy things . " " Well , I 'm not afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running forcounty treasurer and he has to be out campaigning a lot . " " Yeh , that 's just it , too , " he answered . " And anyway from the looks of things there wo n't be many people coming in there . His store is on the blink , if you ask me . Now do n't look so glum . Let me play you a new piece of music . " " Did Boyd Collins bring you that , too ? " " No , I ordered it , " she answered with some spirit . " I do n't believe I want to hear it . " And he reached for his hat . " I got to be going . " " Now , Alvin , " she said coaxingly , taking him by the arm , " sit down and let 's do n't fall out . " " I do n't like you clerking down there in that store , I tell you . " " But you would n't object if I got my hoe and went into thefield and worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she staredit him with a glint of hardness in her eyes . " No , I reckon not . " " Well , what 's the difference ? " " There 's a lot of difference . " " I do n't see it . It 's honest work and it gives me something to dop28o besides sit here and look out at the brown cotton-patch and watch the wind blowing in the cold elm trees . " " There 's always plenty to do around the house , Ethel . " " Now be a good boy and let me go , " she said . By this time he had learned enough of Ethel to know she would go anyway if she set her mind to it , but her sly acknowledgment of his hold upon her somewhat mollified his ill-humor . " All right , " he answered , " if you 'll promise one thing . Promise that in the fall when the crops are housed you and me will stand before the preacher . " " Now you 're asking me again , and you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's been a month , ai n't it ? " " No , last week . " " Then I take it back and ask you again . Is it a bargain ? " She looked at the fire a long while . " I 'd like to , Alvin , I 'd like to , " and she hugged his arms close against her bosom , " but you ought not to push me so . " " Push you ? Why , look how long it 's been . Oh , Ethel , Ethel , " he said with a rush of feeling in his voice , and putting his arms around her he pulled her head against his breast . " Please say it . " For a moment she was silent and then looked up . " Let 's put it this way , if everything is all right in the fall , we 'll stand before the preacher as you say . " " Oh , honey , honey ! " he murmured , as he held her more tightly and kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll take a trip , wo n't we ? " she asked presently . " Sure , sure we 'll take a trip . " " I mean a long one . There 'll be an excursion up to Washingto for the President 's inauguration and you 'll take me , wo n't you ? ' " But that must cost a lot . " " You can get a round-trip ticket for nine dollars . They 're already advertising ' em . " " Then that 's a bargain , too . We 'll go , " and he kissed her agai " And now you better go along , " she said . " It 's getting late an . I 've got to iron my dress for tomorrow . "  |p281And  so Ethel began working in Mr. Turner 's store . Every morning she would ride down to the village with the old man and return with him in the evening . And sometimes when Alvin went down to buy something she would wait on him cool and businesslikeas you please . " How do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fine , " she would answer , whipping the string deftly around the package of meat or pound of cheese . And then one day a few weeks later , when they were walking home from church , she replied to his inquiry about the store that she had quit . " What ? " " Yes , I 've stopped working there , stopped last night . " " I did n't think you 'd like it , " he said with gratification showing In his voice . " I liked it all right , but some things I could n't stand . " " Now what do you mean , Ethel ? " he asked , stopping . " You promise you wo n't tell ? " " Of course I wo n't . " " It was because of Mr. Turner . " " Did n't he like your work ? " " Yes , he liked it too well . " " Golly ! I do n't understand what you 're driving at . " " I said too well , that 's what . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doty or foolish . He tried to kiss me there in the store the other day . " " Good lord ! " " And that 's not all . He tried to put his hand all over me . Why , he must be crazy like poor Mis ' Addie . I guess I told him where to get off . He even went so far as to hint around that he 'd get a ivorce . And  --  " " Why , the old scoundrel ! " " Now do n't get all riled up , Alvin . Just the way I said , some Id men get foolish about young girls that way , " and she moved on . Alvin walked by her side in silence a moment . " Maybe you had n't ought to have told me that . It makes me feelp282bad . It 's because he 's had so much trouble , poor old fellow . Yes , I wish you had n't told me . " " Well , why should n't I ? You said you would n't mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you mention it to anybody else . Have you told your ma ? " " No , nobody but you . " " Then promise you wo n't . I got a sort of kind feeling for vlr . Turner and I reckon he did n't mean much by it . And , anyhow , I 'm glad you 've quit the store . " " I 'm not , " she replied . " I liked working there . Everything did n't seem so , well , so lonesome . " " Why , there 's nothing lonesome around here , Ethel ! You keep saying that . " " I wish there were n't , " she replied , staring out across the wide fields that stretched on either side . " I inquired around , but there was no other place where they needed anybody . " " Who 's helping him now ? " " Miss Marthy , I reckon . I heard him asking her about it . " " But I do n't see how you can keep on living in his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , we never see him , same as if we were in separate houses . We use that west porch , while he uses the front . Oh , let 's change the subject . How you getting along keeping house for yourself now ? " and reaching out she put her hand on his arm . " Not near as good as I will when fall comes , " he answered , pattingit . " Mrs. Beasley does my washing and ironing , and every once in a while she comes over and sort of cleans up the dishes and puts new sheets on the bed . " " Do n't it get lonesome there at night by yourself ? " " Aw , pshaw ! you keep talking about lonesomeness . I 'm always so tired at night I do n't have time to do nothing but go straight to bed and to sleep . " Suddenly he stopped stockstill and stood staring at the ground , gradually letting his arms drop to his side . " What 's the matter ? " But for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for ? "  | " Oh , oh , nothing much , " and taking her arm again he moved on . " You acted like somebody thinking a thousand miles off . " " Yes , I was . " " What ? " " Oh , just an old thought that came back to me . But I reckon its the way you said , Mr. Turner is sort of getting old and childish . " " What ? " " I was thinking I might not understand him , after all , the way I had been believing I had . You see , " he said presently , after they had gone a few hundred yards , " these people are always doing things you do n't expect . " " What things ? " " Just anything . You go along dealing with ' em , everything is fine , you understand what they say , they understand what you say , then all of a sudden they 'll do something you never dreamed of . Why , good gracious ! " And stopping again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had in mind . " " What , Alvin ? " " That 's it . No , he 's not old and doty ; he 's not so old , after all . Funnier things than that can happen . He 's still got pink flesh like a young man . And that 's what often happens . You read about it , hear about it . Older folks marry younger folks . And I bet that 's why he asked you-all to move up in his house , so he could get you close by him . " " You 're just dreaming a nice little dream , Alvin . " " No , I ai n't . " " Of course you are . Did n't you say yourself he needed money bad and that 's why he sold you his place down there . And when he sold you that he had to find a place for us . " " Yeh , and then he wanted you to work in his store . Sure that 's why he wanted you to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have got Miss Marthy to start with . Ah , you ca n't figger these folks out . " " First thing you know I 'll be saying you 're kind of doty or something , Alvin . " " Yeh , I might be , " he muttered , and then taking her firmly by the arm he strode on . " I better watch my step , yessir . He sold me 84 that place and the Maggie mule and all that , but  --  well , we 'll scc , we 'll see . I 'll figger , too . I 'll make enough and pay him , then when it 's writ down in the great book there in the court-house nothing can change it . Alvin Barnes owns this house and land and nobody can take it away from him . ' " " You 're walking too fast . " And as the weeks went by it seemed that he would make good his boast , for this year his crop outdid itself . Ten acres of as fine tobacco as one ever laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , too , frail as he was . Alvin made a deal with him whereby he 'd get one of the ten acres for his work instead of being paid a monthly salary . And besides his tobacco he had five acres of cotton and six of corn and a patch of potatoes . And every acre flourished under the loving care of his great hands . And like her master , Maggie did enough work for two . But Alvin saved her every strain he could . He would never drive her to church on Sunday . He fed her well and when possible let her rest during the weekdayswhen he and Walter hoed grass out of the crop . And when the winter came on and the crops were sold he had a profit to himself of seventeen hundred dollars . And , too , he had a crib full of corn , a hill full of potatoes , three stout shoats in the pen , and a young cow that he expected to be fresh in the spring . And now that he was a landowner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury , he put his money in the bank like other folks . Going over to Mr. Turner 's store , he told him he wanted to settle with him . And when the payment on the land and the interest and the bill for his supplies during the year were added up it amounted to a thousand and forty-nine dollars and fifty cents . " That 's right , " Alvin said , pulling a huge check-book out of his pocket . His manner was cool and business-like , like a man dealing with his equal . " Have you figured it out ? " Mr. Turner asked with some surprise . " Yes . I keep books for myself . " " And so it 's all in there , is it ? " " Yes , sir . " " No , you 've left out one thing  --  the mule . "  |p285Alvin  's face burned with shame . Of course he had been counting on that debt , too , but why it had slipped his mind he could n't tell . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke up stiffly . " I was coming to that . And if you 'll give me a pen I 'll write vim out a check . " " Oh , so you 've gone in for the check business , too ? Well , you certainly are coming along . " There was a touch of sharpness in the old man 's voice . Then he coughed nervously and went on somewhat kindly . " Luck 's with you , Alvin ; you been lucky . " " I 've done a lot of figgering at night , too , Mr. Turner , " he answered cryptically . " Well , that maybe does good , but all the figgering in the world wo n't save you when things go against you , Alvin . And you better take this to heart  --  listen to what I tell you now  --  you been lucky and you need n't expect to always be . You made a big crop and it happened that the price was high . Such things do n't come many times in a generation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he answered , smoothing the check-book out in his hand . " You can write me a check for a hundred and forty-nine dollars and a half ; that 's all you owe me . " Alvin blinked at him in surprise . " You owe the rest to the bank . They 've got your note over there , " and then he turned abruptly to wait on an old Negro woman who had crept in and was standing humbly before the counter . " What can I do for you , Aunty ? " Alvin heard him say . Then with one kind Mr. Turner pushed the bottle of ink and a pen sideways towards him . Alvin wrote the check out , laid it on the counter , and went over to the bank . The cashier , an affable , portly man , nodded to him kindly and in answer to his inquiry brought out a box of papers and got his note for the mule . Alvin paid the instalment on the land and the bill for Maggie , got the stamped note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would do the same with that mortgage.  | W HEN a countryside is flush with money the news travels fast among the salesmen , fakers , gold-brick artists and preachers . And hardly a day passed now that a man with some contrivance to sell did n't knock on the door of Alvin 's house . He was almost always out working in the field , but looking up towards the road he could see these callers . And they kept coming down and bothering him until he was ready to brain the next one with his hoe . " Good morning , " the nice fresh young man would say in a nice fresh voice . " Good morning , " Alvin would reply , hardly slowing the motion of his arm as he grubbed away . And finally the young man , after he 'd bragged on the land , the house , and upon the countryside in general , would get to the subject of a new-fangled floor-mop or a can-opener or a washing-machine . " I do n't need any of ' em , " Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean your house , or wash your clothes . " " I get it done . No , I 'm not interested in buying anything , " and finally the young man would have to retreat back to the road . And most often it was book salesmen . " We have here a combinationoffer  --  the most intelligent people in the neighborhood have  --  " " Then I 'm not intelligent , " Alvin would interrupt . " This is the greatest book of all the ages . Four million copies sold yearly . One dollar and a half , " and he would roll the gilt edges of the leather-backed Bible across his thumb . " I do n't want it . " " Have you a Bible in your house , sir ? " " No , I have not , sir . " " But surely you read  --  " " But I do n't want it . " Alvin would drive the butt of his mattock into the ground.  |p287And  then the traveling missionaries , collecting tithes as the Scriptures ordered  --  big portly men crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawn by a horse too scrawny to raise a sweat even with such a load . And as they followed him around the barn while he fed his stock or stood by the woodpile while his ax tore and splintered among the fat pine stumps , they would keep up a quiet persuasive roll of words about the awful conditions in China and India , and their low , husky , vibrating voices reminded him of Tam Wilkins . " I ai n't interested in the heathen , " he would say . " But if you will stop a minute , young man , and look at these pictures you will see here the spectacle of heart-rending suffering . Women and children , young men and old men , roaming the forest like wild beasts . Listen while I read . In the Province of Shantook an eye witness reports having seen more than a hundred children in the forest gnawing the bark off the trees in their famishedhunger . ' Think of that , young man , the suffering , the pity , the horror , the awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Alvin answered as he squatted on his haunches and began to pile the lightwood on his arm . " But in your mind you could hear them , hear them calling to you , begging for our help . " " I can hear something else crying . " " And what may that be , we ask you ? " " I can hear my chickens crying out there in the henhouse . " " Eigh ? " one of the Tartuffes asked in surprise . And as Alvin rose to his feet , the pile of lightwood clasped in front of him , he 'd say , " Do n't you know the old saying that when the preacher comes the chickens cry ? " And with that he walked by them into the house . He could hear the preachers mumbling angrily together outside , and then he looked through the window to see them climb disconsolately into the buggy , strike their poor emaciated horse , and roll off down the road . " The greasy devils , " he muttered , " going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeh , collecting for the heathen . I bet the heathen never see a cent of money they lay their fat paws on any more than that poor old horse ever sees a bundle of fodder . And yet there are folks like Pa and Ma and Dollis and Ivy that 'll sweat up their last cent and pay it over to them . " And then , as if apologeticto a gentle memory , he added , " Anyhow , Ivy ai n't to be blamed . " And then the stove and organ and furniture salesmen made their appearance . But to all and sundry he turned a deaf ear . And finally the stock salesmen representing a fertilizer factory down in Wilmington  --  two tall , suave , clean-shaven men about thirty years old , dressed in gray , with soft gray hats pulled down over their piercing eyes . They drove a trim , clean-stepping horse with brass-dotted blinders and a yellow open buggy that hummed over the ground . " A very special offer , " one of them was saying , " available only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never heard before . " A guaranteed earning , absolutely , of thirty-three and one third per cent the first year . " " You mean interest ? " " Yes , sir , interest it is . " " That 's big interest , " Alvin answered bluntly . " Yes , it 's a big proposition , " the second man in gray replied . " Yesterday we sold Mr. Dave Collins ten thousand dollars worth of stock . " " Well , I reckon he can afford to lose it , " and Alvin made the grains of corn pour from under the base of his palm as he sat in the barn , shelling it to take to the mill next day . " We have a fleet of twenty vessels sailing upon the sea , " the first gray-suited man continued . And pulling out a gold-stamped folded paper that crinkled in his hand , he caressed it as if it had been the entire fleet itself . " They catch the fish and bring them to the factory there in Wilmington , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fertilizer is then made available for those who hold stock in the company . The stockholders have the first call . They buy it cheaper than the public . " " But suppose a storm wrecked some of the ships , mister ? " " Oh , but , young man  --  Mr. Barnes , I should say  --  these ships are not sinkable. "  | " But suppose the fish do n't show up ? " " But the fish do show up , " the second man chinned in . " The waters are teeming with them . " " What ? " " The water 's full of them , I mean . " And then the first man popped the gold folded paper open and waved it in front of his face . " Every hundred dollars put in it is worth one-hundred and thirty-three and one-third . " " Looks like if it was such a good bargain all the people around Wilmington would snap it up , and you would n't have to come way off up here to sell it , " Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and went on shelling . " Yes , that 's just it , " the first man continued with gracious triumph . " This organization is formed especially for the farmers . We want all the farmers to share it . Now we have a list here of the most prominent people in the community . " " You mean people that have got a little money saved , " Alvin answered . " Where did you get that list ? Down at the bank ? " " We 've just come from talking with Mr. Turner . He recommendsit highly . " " Did he buy any ? " " He 's very much interested . " " Yes , but he wo n't buy any , ' cause he 's busted and you know it . And one of the things that helped bust him was messing with such stuff as this . I 've got a few hundred dollars saved up that I need to put in my crop . Yeh , all for the farmers . I 've heard that kind of talk before . Used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every year if crops were good there was always a horse like yours tied in front of his door . " And as Alvin rose angrily to his " he hurried on . " Looks like the whole world 's trying to feed on everybody else , cheat ' em out of everything they 've made . Look at you two fellows , come up here all dressed like dudes out of New York or somewhere , hands white and soft as a girl . You ai n't never done a honest day 's work in your life . Get out . " " Excuse us , Mr. Barnes . We 're sorry to have intruded . " " You 're damn right . I ai n't a sucker like the rest of the folksp290around here . I work for what I get and I mean to keep it when I get it . You 're crooks and you know it . When you come around telling me I can make thirty-three dollars interest a year I know it 's a lie , and I know if it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , sir , you would n't have to go around with all this oily talk and that piece of funny-looking paper in your pocket . " " Good day , Mr. er  --  Barnes . " " That 's right . You see that lot gate there . Well , the quicker you move on through it , crawl in your buggy , and drive away the better it 'll be for you . " And Alvin reached savagely down for an ear of corn . The suave gentlemen , now forgetful of all manners and courtly bearing , fled incontinently towards the road , and in a moment the hoofbeats of their horse died away around the bend . And Alvin stared after them , chuckling grimly to himself . God knows the devil seemed rising in him lately . And why should n't it when a gang of buzzards was after him day after day ? Was this the way things worked with people who had anything ? As soon as the news got out that a fellow was saving a little or getting along in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Well , let ' em swarm . As far as he was concerned they would go away empty . One day a stout workman-sort of fellow , wearing a cap and smoking a short pipe , waddled across the field towards him . He introduced himself and said he was representing a circus . Alvin turned away and said he did n't want to buy anything . " I ai n't selling anything , " the man answered , puffing away on his pipe and smiling genially . " I just want to stick up a big sign on your barn . " " What kind of sign ? " " And it wo n't cost you a cent . Good for your barn , too , protectsit from the weather . " " Is it one of them signs with a horse tearing down the racetrack , pulling a bicycle buggy ? I used to see ' em . " " That 's it exactly . " " Then you can stick it up , ' cause I always like to look at a purty horse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man said . " If you get time , come down . That 'll admit you into the big tent . " " Thank you , thank you , " Alvin replied . And later in the afternoon when the man drove away he could see the side of his barn adorned with a great poster of racing horses , tumbling acrobats , clowns , and elephants , and all set off with big letters announcing that Haas ' Circus would be in Dunston next week . " Ethel 'll sure like to go to that , " he said he walked up towards the barn to see the painted wonders . They left home early in the morning , driving Maggie to the buggy which Alvin had recently patched and painted up . They arrived in Dunston near the middle of the morning and for the rest of the day had the time of their lives . They sat on the high seats in the big tent , ate popcorn and crackerjacks and watched the clowns , the lion-tamer , the bareback riders , and Madame Riga 's death-defying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They saw the snake woman lying in a den of snakes and Ethel turned away her head with a shudder . " Ai n't it quare , " said Alvin , " what some folks will do to make a living ? " And then they went into another sideshow to see them feed the wild fanged giant from Borneo . They stood around in a milling crowd for more than an hour , listening to the loud spiel of a snaggle-toothed fellow who stood on top of a big boxed wagon and kept describing the terrors and destruction Borneo had suffered at the hands of the creature confined beneath his feet . Then another man came pushing forward with fifteen pounds of bloody meat hoisted on the prongs of a pitchfork . " Make way , ladies and gentlemen , make way ! " he was shouting . The crowd swirled about and gazed at the spectacle . The barker on the top of the wagon stuck the handle of the pitchfork into a holder and continued his harangue , with now and then dramatic gestures at the hunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascination . " Every day at five o'clock , " the barker was saying , " the wild man from Borneo consumes his fifteen pounds of raw and bloody flesh . This accounts for his superhuman strength . " And then he held up several bars of bent and twisted iron . " This is what he can do , ladies and gentlemen . Do you wonder that we keep him bound in chains and shut within the confines of this double-barred prison ? " And then suddenly the wagon began to shake and horriblemouthing growls sounded from inside the huge box . Two helpers ran up and held on to either side of the wagon . " Hey , you Pluto ! " The man on top stamped and shouted . " The red-hot iron ! The red-hot iron ! " And when Pluto had subsided he went on blandly to his ever-growing audience . " The only punishment that can tame him is a red-hot iron against his hairy skin . The lash he does not notice , clubs he snatches and breaks in two . Hoy , hoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Now and then punctuatinghis speech would come a roll on a drum or the high blast of a blood-curdling trumpet . " Pshaw ! " Alvin said finally . " They ai n't never going to feed him . Let 's go . " " No . Please wait a minute , " Ethel begged . The man kept up his rigmarole of talk awhile longer , always with his eye on the till at the front of the tent , and when at last it seemed that not another person could push his way in , he shouted for everyone to keep still as death , for they were about to feed the horrible creature . Then he came down from the top of the wagon and approached the rear end of the box , while his helper stood by with the meat poised on the fork . He slid the little door quickly up , the meat was shoved in , and the door slammed down again . And immediately a terrific growling and snarling and rendingwent on inside . " Oh , ladies and gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim who fell into his grasp , " the spieler sang as he made his way rapidly through the crowd , calling out , " This way , ladies and gentlemen ; this way , to the next show ! " And the foolish crowd pushed and jammed their way towards the side entrance to find themselves a moment later in the midway outside . " It 's a fake , a fake , " Alvin said hotly as he dragged Ethel along . " I did n't see anything , " she said . " Nobody else did . But I saw enough to know it was a fake.  |p293'Twere  n't nothing but a little old nigger with a pair of trace chains on his arms . " Then he saw the barker at a drink stand near by sucking a bottle of coca-cola , and started angrily toward him . But that gentleman spied his tall form plowing through the crowd , and dropping his bottle he dived off . And for a while after that Alvin was so angry he would n't visit another sideshow , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painted signs of freaks and wonders . But presently his vexation passed under Ethel 's light chatter and they rode on the merry-go-round , then on a new-fangled contraption called the whip . And after that Alvin must needs try his strength with a hammer . When he 'd rung the bell every time , much to the apparent disgruntlement of the concession-keeper who handed him over three cigars and a feathered monkey , they turned away and stopped in front of a gypsy woman who was sitting before a little table with a pack of greasy cards and a piece of canvas hung behind her on which the moon and stars and several constellations were painted . " Know the future and the past , " the young gypsy woman 's shrill voice called . As Alvin looked at her he seemed dimly to have seen her face before . " Why , I know you , " he said . " I saw you one night camped on the road . " The young woman darted a quick glance at him out of her dark eyes and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future and the past , " she shrilled again . " I want to try it , Alvin , " Ethel said . " Sure , " he went on buoyantly . " I 'll pay for it . " " But I do n't want you to hear it . Go over there and get me some ice-cream , wo n't you ? " And Alvin moved off , pushing his way through the crowd . Finally he secured an ice-cream cone and started back . Then over the heads of the crowd he saw a man standing at the gypsy 's table with Ethel . He could only see his side and the back of the head , but the figure looked like Boyd Collins . He hurried on , but when he came up to Ethel the gypsy was concluding her prognostications and Boyd Collins was not there.  | " Here 's your ice-cream . " And handing it to her he turned to the gypsy girl . " What do the moon and the stars say about her ? " " She tell you , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Ethel said vexatiously as she took the ice-cream and began to nibble it . " She tried to tell me I would be rich and never know it , and of course there 'd be more rainy days than fair in my life . " Alvin tossed fifty cents into the girl 's hand and they walked on . " I thought I saw somebody there with you , " he said presently . " It looked like Boyd Collins . Then when I got there he was gone . " " No , it was nobody . " And Alvin thought her answer was too swift , and he pushed her with the question again . At last she confessed that Boyd had spoken to her , but she had paid no mind to him . " Then why did you say he had n't been there ? " he questioned hotly . " But , darling , I knew you 'd be upset , and that 's why . " The endearmentof words and gesture were too much for him , and he softened towards her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think of me like that , but I wish you would n't say something did n't happen when it did , " he mumbled . " But , honey , when a girl tries to keep from hurting somebody she likes , I do n't think it 's wrong what she says . " " Likes , Ethel ? " " More than that , " she murmured in a low voice , and then went on cheerily , " Yes , loves , " and she squeezed his arm tightly . " Such a day ! " she murmured joyously . At last the sun began to go down beyond the fields at the edge of the town , and they started home , tired and filled to the brim with happy experiences . Snuggled close together in the buggy , they rode along under the twinkling stars , and Alvin would n't have cared if the night had lasted always . Her head lay restfully on his shoulder , and now and then he bent and kissed her , the while he kept a strong arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , " he groaned.  | " And you 're sweet , Alvin , " she whispered drowsily , and kissed him in return . " And I ai n't going to do without you much more ; no I 'm not , " he muttered fiercely . She was silent a long while and he felt her body leaning heavily against him . " When is it going to be , honey ? When is it ? " " I wish it was now , I do , " she murmured to his enraptured ear . " Then we 'll make it soon  --  right away  --  wo n't we ? " Again there was a long pause , and then finally her answer came in a muffled whisper , " Yes . " " Next week ? " And finally her still smaller voice came back , " Next week , then . " And pulling her close to him he said gently , " Rest then , and we 'll soon be home . " " You 've been wonderful to me today , wonderful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful days , wo n't there ? " " I hope so . " " Sure there will . " And then as she drowsed on his shoulder he went on talking in a steady low stream of words about his plans for the next year  --  how he 'd already arranged to plant a bigger crop , and they would have some real money when the next harvest-time came around . And keeping time to his words , Maggie 's hooves beat against the sandbed as they traveled towards the stars hanging in the west . The next day he was in a fever of impatience until he could get up to see her to confer about plans for the wedding . When he entered the house at the side portico , she was helping her mother take the ashes up from the hearth . But as always , no matter what job she was doing , she looked the same entrancing Ethel to Alvin , though this morning her face lacked some of its usual color . " I reckon you heard about us being engaged ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We been expecting it . I mean her pa and me , " she answered with some surprise . " Did you tell her , Ethel ? "  | " No , I been  --  well , I just did n't tell her  --  " " Yes , Mrs. Layton , " he went on buoyantly , " it 's all settled . Last night we come to an agreement for this week . " " This week ? " the elder woman asked . " Why , Ethel , you wo n't have time to get ready . " " I 'd rather have it quiet , have it all quiet , " Ethel answered , lookingout of the window . " But everybody would expect a church wedding . I mean expect you to have that kind , with a lot of people and music  --  " " No , no , " she replied hastily . " I 've thought about it . I 'd rather it 'd all be quiet . " " That suits me to a T , " Alvin said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel wanted . " And now it seemed that the color was coming back into her cheeks as she contemplated the event , and with a smile she concluded , " Must n't forget that excursion . " " What excursion ? " " The one to Washington . " " Oh , sure ! Why , yes , that 's a promise . " Then with a laugh he reached out possessively , drew her to him again , and gave her a smack on the cheek . " I 'll go right off now and begin to get everythingfixed up . What 's the day ? " But Ethel shook her head . " No , you name it , " she said . " Day after tomorrow . " She stared through the window a while and then nodded . " All right . It 's day after tomorrow . " When Alvin had gone Mrs. Layton turned to her . " Whatever in the world made you do it in such a hurry , Ethel ? Is there  --  is there some reason ? " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just if I do n't do it quick it wo n't be done , that 's all . " " Why , good gracious , child ! " " Did you love Pa better than anything in the world when you married him ? " she presently inquired . " I loved him enough , I reckon . " " And were you satisfied to settle down on a little farm with nothing ahead of you but work and work and children ? "  | " I guess I had thoughts like most young girls about big things that were going to happen , but I forgot ' em , for nothing big ever happened . " " Not even when  --  when the children  --  when I was born ? " " It all come along natural enough and I did n't make much to-do about it . Now look here , Ethel , you love Alvin Barnes , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . Sometimes I do . " For a while she was silent and then continued . " Like last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , but this morning it seems different . Like maybe I 'd been dreaming . " Her lips quivered and tears started sliding down her cheeks . " Now , honey , I know . You 're just excited and upset . You ca n't always feel the same . That 's the way things are , but I know you love Alvin and he loves you better than life itself . You both 'll be happy . Yes , you will . Now you stop crying and let 's get busy fixing up your clothes and things . Your Pall be mighty pleased ; he thinks a lot of Alvin . " And so the two set to work washing and ironing and making everything ready , and soon Ethel began to enter into the spirit of the occasion . " A long time ago , " she said , " I decided I 'd never marry a tenant farmer and go through with what the women I 've known had to suffer . And if I believed I had to do it now I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon he 'll have all the things he said he 's going to have ? " " He 's getting along mighty fast . " " Yes , he is . I 've never known a tenant farmer to set out and get as far as he has in so short a time . And he 'll go farther , too , " she continued pridefully . " I hope so , I do hope so . But still a lot of things can happen . And once a tenant always a tenant , they say . " A few days later The Linnyville News , a weekly newspaper published mainly for the benefit of the country politicians , carried an announcement among its columns of local news items , " Miss Ethel Layton , and Mr. Alvin Barnes were quietly married yesterday in the court-house by His Honor , June Waring . Mr. Barnes is one of Little Bethel 's most successful farmers and Miss Layton is the attractive daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Dave Layton , who live on the old Josiah Turner place . Their many friends wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were married at last . Friday morning Alvin had got up long before day , for he was too excited to sleep . The sky was gray-clouded and looked like snow . He built a huge roaring fire , cooked his breakfast , then washed everything up and fiddled about the barn and the woodpile until it was time to get dressed . At eleven o'clock he went up to the Laytons ' . Ethel , dressed in her dark-blue coat suit , seemed sweet enough to eat , though Alvin noticed during the dinner meal that she seemed more abstracted and silent than usual . But Mr. Layton was in fine spirits enough for all , and more than once partook of the blackberry wine sitting near his elbow . He told at length of his own wedding day and how scared both he and his bride had been . " Like Ethel now  --  ha-ha , " he said , and Ethel looked up , startled . " Pshaw ! Mr. Layton , " Alvin laughed . " What 's there to be afraid of ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mighty serious undertaking , just the same . " A knock came on the door and Mr. Turner entered , hurried and nervous . He had a package in his hand . " Do n't get up . Do n't get up , " he said as everybody started to rise . " I thought I 'd bring a little gift for the bride . Howdy , Alvin . " And setting the package down , he opened it and disclosed a cutglasssugar-bowl . " Thank you , thank you , Mr. Turner , " Ethel said with downcast eyes but blushing cheek . " Not much , not much of a gift . It 's a sugar-bowl to hold sweets and for the sweet bride . I wish you all happiness . " Coughing nervously , he made his way back the way he came . From the silence that fell upon the group , Alvin imagined the parents knew something of the old man 's previous attention to their daughter . " Mercy ! it 's almost three o'clock , " Mrs. Layton said , glancing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced around . " Ha-ha ! " said Mr. Layton . " Do n't tell me you ai n't getting upset . Why , goodness gracious ! it 's snowing out there ! "  |p299They  all rose and went to the different windows and stared out at the falling flakes like children . " Why , look , Ethel ! " Alvin cried genially as he stood by her side . " Christmas Eve and it 's snowing . That 's the first time I 've ever seen a real snow on Christmas Eve . It 's the same as if it 's done to please us  --  yes , same as to celebrate . " " There he comes , " said Mrs. Layton . And immediately there was stamping on the porch of the side portico , and in came Mr. June Waring , local magistrate and court-house busybody , referred to in print as " His Honor " and in fireside circles as " Hopping June . " " A white wedding and a white Christmas , " he announced briskly . Then when he 'd peeled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire he unfolded a document and said , " Is everybody present ? " " Yes , sir , " Alvin gulped . " Take your places , please , and we 'll proceed . " And so , standing side by side , they were married . Alvin gave the little man five dollars as he helped him on with his coat . And then His Honor turned around , raised his hand in a gesture of farewell , gave Alvin a piercing squint out of one of his eyes , " A happy life and a merry life to you , my friends , " and with grave juridical dignity opened the door and let himself out . " Well , it sure was a quiet wedding , " Mrs. Layton said a moment later as she dabbed her apron against her cheeks and feverishly swept the hearth with the broom-sedge broom . And then they all had a sip of wine to the bride and groom . After that the mother called Ethel and Alvin into a little side room and showed them four quilts , two pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hams in a sack , a fruit cake , and a counterpane . " That 's our wedding present , " she said proudly . " And over there in that box is a set of dishes and a silver spoon that belonged to my grand-mammy . " " Great goodness ! " Alvin cried out joyously . " You ca n't disfurnishyourself like that . " " Oh yes , I can , " she answered lightly . " And now that I 'm your mammy I can tell you when to keep your mouth shut . " And with that she raised herself up on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek . " You 'll make me jealous , Ma , " Ethel said brightly . And these were the first words she had spoken in her usual tone . " How does it feel to be married ? " Mr. Layton asked , standing in the door . " Feels fine , " Alvin mumbled . " Well , I hope it 'll feel that way five years from now . But if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now you just hush up , Dave Layton , " his wife exclaimed . " You know you get crazier about me every year that goes by . " " Yeh , I expect that 's so , " he said , pinching her back . " There you go with that feeling-hand disease . Stop it . And , oh , I forgot , " she went on . " There 's a gallon of blackberry wine , too . " " Look how the snow keeps coming down  --  like a world full of feathers , " Mr. Layton said . " I was just thinking , " Mrs. Layton continued , " that Alvin and  --  that they 'll need this covering tonight  --  down at the house , won'tye ? " " No suh  --  no ma'am . I reckon we can get along without it . " " Well , you better get it down there , and the sausage and the ham . Tell you what you do , Dave , you go out and hitch up the mule and take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me and Ethel 's got some things to talk about . " They hauled all the good things down to the little house and stored them away , and while he was there Alvin built a good fire , and then returned to Mr. Turner 's for Ethel . It was still snowing furiously , and the gloom of approaching twilight made the flakes look like a curtain of gray forever descending in front of his eyes . When they 'd bundled themselves up and Ethel had kissed her mother and father and Alvin had shaken hands with them both , they walked down the road and turned across the field to their house . Ethel 's cheeks and eyes were sparkling now , and the snow alighting on her little cap set her reddish hair off with little feathery white pieces of lace . Alvin 's eyes devoured her beauty with hungry worshiping eyes.  | " It 's wonderful ! " she said . " I feel I could just stay out and be covered up in it . " " Me too , " Alvin agreed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a somersault , wallowed in the snow like a mule , and then rose , shaking a dust of white powder from him . " Yee-hoo ! " he shouted , sending his voice smotheringly through the soft descendingfleece . " Why , you 're acting crazy , Alvin , " Ethel laughed . " Yeh , I feel crazy , honey , " he shouted . And when they approached the doorstep he swung her up into his arms and carried her over the threshold . " Why did you do that ? " she asked as he set her down andbegan flurriedly tending the fire , which had burned itself out . " There 's an old saying about that . Did n't you know it ? " " No , I did n't know it . " " If a man carries his wife into the house the first night the saying is she 'll never leave him . Ha-ha-ha ! that 's good , " he said , springing up and kissing her . Then they shook the snow from their clothes . Alvin sat down before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , honey , honey , " he said , staring at her , " we 're home now . " And pulling her head down on his shoulder , he began rocking back and forth and staring at the burning logs . Then suddenly he sprang up again , set her back in the chair , and began punching up the fire . That done , he walked about the room once or twice , and hung their coats on chairs to dry . Ethel sat rocking slightly , as if his motion had passed into her own , looking at him with half-closed eyes . " Darling , " she murmured , " you 're all in a swivet . Come and sit down again . " " Yes , I will , " he said . He went to the window and looked out . " Golly ! everything 's white as far as you can see . The ' tater-hill out there is all covered over , and the fences , too . Look , a lot of sparrows are squatting under that rose bush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be dark in a minute and freezing cold . " And he hurried into the kitchen . She went to the window and watched him throw crumbs to the birds who sat slothfully eyeing them and making no move . As he walked by the window towards the barn he stopped , came up outside , and put his lips against the pane , and she bent down and kissed at him . Then he snatched himself away and hurried off . For a long while she stood gazing through the window at the world outside , where a strange mixture of darkness and light had begun to sift through the falling flakes . The birds under the rose bush were now only little bleared dusky objects and the limb above them had bent slowly over as if to shelter them under its burden of snow . In the stillness the crackle of the fire sounded like whip pops behind her , and though this very room and the house itself were familiar enough to her , tonight they seemed somewhat like Alvin , a little strange . She was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have been hard put to it for an answer . Turning , she sat down by the fire and stretched out her trim ankles and well-rounded legs to the blaze . She held her hands out and looked at the flames through her fingers . All of these were his now to do what he pleased with , and a strange shiver , half of fear and delight passed over her . Suddenly she heard his voice out at the barn , calling , " Co-Sook ! co-Sook ! " and a little nervous shock went through her . Rising quickly , she went into the kitchen and began to cook a pan of sausage and make a pot of coffee . And presently he stamped up on the back porch , came in , kissed her , and they sat down to supper . But neither of them was hungry , and Alvin could hardly sit still . He poured himself a cup of coffee , then went to the wash-basin for a drink of water , then sat down again , then rose once more to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " she said . " Supper 's all cooked . " Then unable to contain himself any longer , he reached over and lifted her from the floor . Her fork dropped with a clatter on her plate behind her , and with his lips he brushed a little crumb from hers and kissed her hungrily . Then putting his hands under her arms he lifted her high up in front of him and stared in her face with a piercing gaze , shaking his head slowly from right to left . She put out her soft hand and caressed his cheeks . " You 're the strongest man in the world , I tell you , " she said . " I am now , " he murmured hoarsely . " I could tear up a stumpp303or push over a house . Yes , I could , let alone such a little hummingbirdas you , " and he lowered her gently to the floor . " I bet you ca n't lift me with one arm . " And holding his clenched fist out before him , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and thirty-six pounds . Last week I did . " " I can lift you with my finger , " he boasted . " But still that 's a mighty purty size for a woman . " Stretching his arms above his head , he suddenly yawned . " Golly ! I 'm sleepy , " he said . She turned quickly to the table and began clattering the dishes together , but he reached out and took her hand , " Come on , let 's go into the other room . The dishes can wait . " And he led her back to the fire . " Let 's just sit down awhile , " she coaxed softly as he began takingoff his coat . " I know . " And plumping herself down in the rocking-chair , she held out her arms . " What do you want ? " he asked as he settled his coat back with a twitch of his shoulder . " You sit in my lap now . " " Good gracious alive ! I 'll squash you to death ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pulled him down across her lap , folded him against her breast , and began singing in a teasing , crooning voice , " Bye-o , baby bunting , Daddy 's gone a-hunting . " " Golly ! you make me feel  --  feel funny , " he said , trying to sit up . But she pulled him back . " You 're not heavy . " " I weigh a hundred and ninety-eight pounds . " " Just nothing at all , " she said with a laugh . " But still , about the right size for a man . " And then she began to finger his hair . " It 's pretty , pretty too , " she said . " But not like yours . " " At church I used to hear the girls whispering about how they 'd like to run their hands through your hair . " " Now did you ? " he said shamefacedly , and shaking his shoulders ,  |p304he  pushed easily from her and stood up . " No , I ca n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And it makes me feel funny , too , " she agreed , rising . " I like it better the other way . " And pushing him down in the chair , she reseated herself in his lap . There he sat gently rocking away . Gradually the fire died down and the wan light of the snowy world outside began to show itself through the window . No need to talk now , for their two beating hearts spoke to each other through their bodies . A little mournful wind began singing snugly by the eaves , and an elm limb creaked gently as it eased itself of its load of snow , and the coals gave out sharp sighs now and then as a flake of snow descended the chimney . Suddenly , as if the sky had burst asunder over them , there came a terrific pandemonium of guano bugles , cow bells , tin pans , whistles , and shouts around them . They sprang up together and stood listening . " Well , plague take ' em , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serenading us , " Ethel said , running to the window and peering out between her cupped hands . And then the door was cracked slightly open and a rag doll baby came scurrying across the floor . And now the horns and bells and shouts rang out with intensified din . Alvin strode over , jerked open the door and shouted into the darkness . " Hey , you folks , come in , come in ! " And presently an outlandish and motley crew filed slowly into the room , bringing their instruments of noise with them . They were dressed in all kinds of fantastic costumes . Some of the girls wore boys ' clothes and the boys girls ' clothes , and several of them were disguised in masks , or " dough-faces , " as they were called , and others had beards or mustaches made of corn silk or rabbit tobacco , and still others were painted up in a most terrifying manner . " Hooray for the bride and groom ! " a tall , angular woman cried out , with her bonnet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugles blew a powerful blast which shook the walls , and a chorus of voices yelled , " Hooray for the bride and groom ! " Then a few of the muscular ladies and two or three of the youngp305men who still wore their rightful clothes hustled Alvin into the kitchen . And Alvin went laughingly along . " Now take off your coat , " a tall lady said . And Alvin obeyed . Then they seized him and tried to pull off his breeches . " Now look here , boys , " he said . " I 'm all for your fun , but that 's too far . And who are you all , anyhow ? " " Come on , we got to put ' em to bed , " another voice said behind a mask which Alvin recognized as belonging to " Goat " Zollicoff , one of the village loafers . He jerked loose from them , snatched his coat from a fellow with the corn-silk beard and put it on . Then he stepped back against the wall . " You better stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyed him uncertainly . And then he heard the giggles and screams of laughter in the other room , and turning he hurried in . The girls had Ethel partly undressed and were shoving her towards the bed . Alvin went over , pushed them from her , and handed her coat and shirtwaist back to her . " That 's enough , folks . " And then the bugles began to blow , bells to ring , whistles crying , and pans rattling . The noise suddenly stopped and a young fellow with a devil 's mask on led into a song , " Blow on the whistle , Rattle on the pan . He 's got a wifieAnd she 's got a man . " Chorus : " Tell old grandma about it , Tell her all what you see  --  " While the singing was going on Ethel had fled into the parlor to fix her clothes . Alvin noticed something familiar in the voice and gesture of the song-leader and striding over he snatched his mask off and Carl Stevens stood revealed . " What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just giving you a little serenade , " Carl began shamefacedly . Alvin glared about him at the queer , outlandish faces shining in the shadowy firelight . " So , some of Boyd Collins ' crowd is it ? Is Boyd Collins among you ? " Everybody was silent and a gradual movement began towards the door . " Well , he better not be . " Then he went on in a quieter voice . " Much obliged to you folks , anyhow , for coming around . But I reckon it 's getting late if you want to be moving . " In a moment they were all gone , and Ethel returned with her hair arranged nicely and her clothes all straightened . " Where are they ? " she asked . " They went on , " he said . " I thought maybe they 'd stay awhile and we 'd give ' em some wine and sit around and talk . Who were they ? " " Some of them roughnecks down there in Linnyville . I do n't appreciate it myself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , maybe not . " And gradually his slumbrous anger disappeared in a smile and he went over and gave her a great hug . " Now I 'm going out to the barn a minute , honey , and I 'll be right back . " And she stood looking up at him with her fringed gray eyes , saying nothing . He walked back through the yard and around the house , and then on out to the main road . Yes , they had gone , all of them . He could hear their voices coming back through the snow , which was still falling heavily and was now more than ankle deep . He went to the barn , hung a cotton sheet over the side of Maggie 's stall to protect her from the icy wind which had begun to blow . And then he piled a great armful of hay into Sook 's stable , and after that put more hay over his three shoats who were bedded close together under the pen shelter . Standing in the lee of the barn , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sook and Maggie sighed and grunted in the warmth of their stalls . For a long while he stood there listening to these sounds , and then he turned towards the road . There across the yard he could see the blinking red of the window and Ethel 's half-undressed figure crossing the firelight as she came over and pulled the curtains to . He stopped dead still in the road , his heart thumping wildly and the windy snow swirling about his head . " I did n't know there was so much in the world for one man to have , " he gasped . " Ah , honey , all these here fields and the earthp307and the sky and the falling snow and the little wind that blows round and about , it was all made for you ; I was made for you from the very beginning ; everything was . Seems like now tonight I see it all plain . There ahead of me you 've been waiting , waiting  --  way down at the end of the furrow , all shining there like the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " And moving slowly towards the waiting house he babbled foolishlyto himself the old folk-saying , " Deep snow in the hollow , Heavy crops will follow . "  | w ITHIN a few months Alvin had begun to act more like a solid married man and less like a bridegroom . Not that his love for Ethel had decreased one whit ; rather it had increased , had entered into the character and fiber of his being . Or again the raging sea of his passion had , as it were , pushed its way into the inner cavern of his heart , and there it beat and throbbed as one with him . But now that the fine frenzy of woman 's wonder had worn off a bit for him , he became less thoughtful in little politenoses . If he rose from the table and hurried immediately back to the field it was n't that he began to find Ethel 's presence less interestingthan of yore , but that in working his crop and pushing on to the harvest he was working for her and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder , would show a glimpse of criticism in a look or gesture for his devouring table manners or sweat-soured clothes , he would bring himself up short with an apology . And then , being Alvin Barnes and believing what he did was really right , he would follow it with an excuse , saying , " It looks like I 've got so much work to do I ca n't take time to eat hardly or wear the clothes a decent man ought to wear . " " But why are you pushing so hard , honey ? " she would say in the fine detached way which had begun to develop in her . " Golly ! Sugarbunch " ( as he loved to call her ) , " I 've got debts , debts , and all of this to pay for , " indicating the new sideboard and a piece of furniture in the other room . He still thought they 'd overdone it in the furniture business , though he never let Ethel know . A week after their marriage they had gone down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salesman , Ethel had cast her eyes upon a new bed , two chairs , a sofa , and a sideboardfor the kitchen . Alvin tried to demur , but the sly salesman , who had already seen the pretty girl 's consuming interest in the shiny pieces , gently scuttled Alvin by way of Ethel 's obvious desire . And so they had bought a wagon-load , paying a certain amount down and giving a note for the balance in the fall . And then , looking over at her across the table , he touched her gently on the shoulder and said , " There 's another reason , Sugar , why I got to make hay while the sun shines , " and he smiled at her proudly and at the same time inquiringly . " I do n't know what you mean , Alvin . " " Oh yes , you do . Come on now . " " Oh , that . " She looked down at her plate . " Yes , that , " he said , coming over and kissing the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that little fellow ought to be right much size next year this time , had n't he ? And you got to take care of yourselfand not overstrain , " he said , rising and going to the door . " When I think how Ma had to work like a dog , and all the other women around and about , and half the time carrying a child inside of ' em too heavy for their strength , let alone a bag of cotton on top of their shoulders , it makes me boil . Lord ! why do people have to work so ? " " Yes , and why do you ? " " Golly ! " he laughed , as he felt his great forearm . " I love to work , I can stand it . They ai n't nothing better than work . The more I got to do the better I like it , and seems like I never enjoyedit much as I do now . " " Some day you 'll overstrain if you do n't mind . " " Not me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be able to hire it done . You watch . " And then he strode off across the porch and down into the yard . " Have plenty of them good biscuits and ham when I get home tonight , " he called gleefully . As the neighbor women observed with some envy , Ethel did not overstrain herself . She kept the house and did the cooking and washed a few of her own things , but the heavy washing and soapmakingwas done by Obie Beasley 's wife and oldest girl , Missie . Once or twice when the grass grew rank and got ahead of Alvin in his tobacco and cotton , he hinted around to her that her help would be welcome in the field , but she never seemed to take notice of it and kept her own cool perfumed way in the house . She spent a great deal of time in the afternoons hunting through the mailordercatalogues . After the newspaper had printed an announce/mcnt of their wedding , Ethel said she thought they ought to subscribeto a paper and get a mail-box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and had the clerk paint in black letters on its side , " Alvin J. Barnes . " Fastening it on a post he set it up , clown where the little lane led from his place into the highway . To his surprise , they got more mail than he had expected . Once a week the newspaper came and Ethel received circulars and cataloguesregularly  --  " Mrs. Alvin J. Barnes . " And when Alvin first saw that name he felt a rush of pride . His wife , they were writing to his wife about something . He also subscribed to The Farmer and Mechanic , though he rarely read it now , for at night he was usually too tired for anything but sleep , and Ethel used it to start fires in the stove . As the weeks went by little clouds began to gather here and there in the sky of his great happiness . There was still no sign of young Alvin , and , too , the crop was not growing the way it should . He and Walter Beasley worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cold and dismal and they were late getting things planted . It looked as if the old saying about snow would not hold true . Also , Maggie had been ailing off and on . " A mule ca n't stand what you can , Alvin , " Walter had said as they worked together in the field . And he had tried to save her all the heavy work he could . He never drove her to church on Sunday , and when there was any chopping to hand , he let her rest in the stable as before , but she had recently lost her appetite and stood by the hour all drooped up . He got Dollis to come and drench her , but that seemed to do little good . " She 's got grubs of some sort , " Dollis said , " but I ca n't tell what kind they are . I reckon you 'll just have to hope she 'll get over it . " And another little pricking thing was Ethel 's requests now and then for spending-money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ask kindly , and she would tell him that today she had seen a bargain in a shirtwaistin Sears and Roebuck 's catalogue . " Seems like you keep orderinga lot of stuff from those fellows off yonder , " he said , repressing the feeling in his voice as much as he could.  | " But , Alvin , you do n't want me to get to looking sloppy lilac some of the women around here ? " " No , that I do n't , " he would reply , and then he 'd give her the money . After all , who could blame her for wanting a few extra little doodads now and then . Was n't she the prettiest woman in forty miles ? And smart with her hands and fingers , too . Nobody kept a nice house like her . Nobody had as clean window curtains and tablecloths and bedclothes , and when they went to church he noticed everybody envied him this prize of any woman that had ever walked in Little Bethel . But still , still , he wished  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried back to the fields and to his work . During early July the dreaded dry weather came down upon his crop and he lived again in an agony of suspense . As in that other year he watched the sky unceasingly and rose from his bed at night to see what the signs of the weather were . But now his care and apprehension were increased , for he was now a family man and loaded down with responsibility . His whole future depended upon that tobacco and cotton and corn growing out there . And sometimes at the table he would let loose his worry into words and Ethel would have few to comfort him with . " Oh , maybe it 'll rain , " she would say , without knowing what else to say . " Yeh , after everything 's burnt to a crisp , " he would mutter . Then he would stare through the door with his brows pulled down . " How in this world people can think there 's a God  --  a righteous Heavenly Father who looks after everything and brings things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see . " For some unknown reason he had suddenly thought of Ivy and remembered how she had eased his outburst in that other drought . " She 's a fool , too , " he said aloud , defending Ethel from a comparison that had crossed his mind . " Who , Alvin ? " " Why , Ivy . She believes that way . " There was one advantage in the dry weather for Alvin , however ; it gave him a chance to catch up with his plowing and hoeing . When it seemed the drought was really becoming serious , the rain came and the crops were saved . At least he thought so forp315a while . Then it rained again and the next day another rain and for two weeks the floods fell from any little wisp of cloud that passed . And now his apprehension and dismay increased to rage . " God ! what a mess ! " he would snarl as he hoed wildly among the crow's-foot and crab grass that seemed to come up as fast as he cut it down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't pray , " Walter tittered in his poor-white manner . " Yeh , that 's the same old stuff , " Alvin snapped . " What about Dollis Chadbourne over there . He 's losing his crop , ai n't he ? And I reckon he and Ivy pray every night , maybe sometime in the middle of the day for good measure . " And then the next week the rain let up . But the tobacco looked unhealthy , and the corn had grown up with long joints and gone to stalk and fodder . The same with cotton  --  huge stalks and massive limbs , but few bolls . And Alvin worked furiously to save what he could . He and Walter hoed the corn and tobacco through again and went about among his eight acres of cotton , pulling out the big bunches of grass . He worked from fourteen to eighteen hours a day , and often at night , now , when he 'd conic in late from the fields Ethel would have already eaten her supper and be sitting on the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising from the grass . Alvin would go in and devour his food in huge mouthfuls and with not much more than , " And how you feeling tonight , honey ? " he would be off to bed . And then he would rise long before dawn and , not caring to wake Ethel as she slept in his bed like a great big beautiful doll , he would cook his own breakfast , pile up the dishes , and go to the field . Without knowing it , he was working himself to death . And one day near noon when he and Walter were priming tobacco tinder a burning August sun , he felt giddy and had to go over to a ' simmon tree and sit down in the shade a moment . " What 's the matter ? " Walter called across to him . " I do n't know . A funny swimming in the head . Never had nothing like that before . " And fanning himself with his hat , he mopped his streaming face . But it seemed to do no good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him , " Why you 're pale as cotton , " he said . " Yeh , I better lie down here a minute , take it sort of easy . Reckon some of them collards I et or something  --  " Walter stared at him . " No , it ai n't collards , " he said , " it 's work . You 're killing yourself . " " Lord ! work never hurt me , " Alvin scoffed . " All right , you better let up . " And for a few days after that he did . That night Ethel told him a letter had come for him . " It 's in there on the bureau . " He started to rise , and then sat down again . " Bring it for me , Sugar . " She brought it in and he read slowly for a while , then sat looking before him . " Ma 's dead , " he finally said . " The funeral was today . " And then he looked at the date on the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world has this letter been ? " " You never would take me down to see your folks , Alvin , " Ethel finally spoke up . " No , that 's right , that 's right . I been so busy . We parted a long time ago ; did n't seem to get along together . But Ma , she was all right . She was all right according to her light . " And then he sat drumming on the table and looking ahead of him with grave face . " Do n't you reckon we ought to go down there , anyhow ? It 'd do you good to get off a little while and  --  " " Yell , I ought to go , " he interrupted , and then he went on , as if talking to himself : " Ma were n't old , just forty-six . A person ought to live longer than that , had n't they ? Aah , " he growled , " forty-six , and hard work killed her , and bad victuals and no house fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , I reckon . " He rose and began pacing the room . " And maybe I did n't do her right , either . I could have sent her a little money ; yeh , I did send her some Christmas before last  --  ten dollars . Yeh , we 'll hitch up in the morning and go down there . Maggie 's feeling better now and can stand the trip . " They inquired around in the village the next day , and finally found where Len Barnes lived . He and Thelma were at home , the latter swollen like a watermelon , for she had married the Lucas boy a few months before and was expecting a baby . The rest of " No , nothing , Sugarbunch , " and , climbing up beside her , he drove angrily off . " Whoo ! " she said , when they had gone a ways down the road . " Nobody would ever believe you were kin to them . " " Sometimes I do n't think I am , " he said . And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tobacco-harvesting came on , and Alvin and Walter Beasley cropped the leaves day after day . Dollis suggested that , since the other families had so many women-folks , they might work together , and so they did . And at the barn and the loopingshedAlvin began to see more of Ivy . She was the same patient worker as before . And sometimes when the work was heaviest and it seemed that tobacco was ripening ahead of them faster than they could gather it , he could n't help contrasting Ivy 's faithfulness and pluck with Ethel 's apparent unconcern where she sat there in the little house across the fields and read the catalogues or sewed on a new dress . " But Ethel 's right , " he would tell himself . " Ivy will be dead and in her grave before she 's thirty years old . Already she 's nothing but skin and bones . " And then he thought with a gush of pleasure how he 'd go home that night , take a bath and scrub himself clean of the tobacco stain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I would n't have her different , not for the world , " he said . A few times recently Alvin had been bothered with that swimming in the head . Once he came to the tobacco-shed and sat down in the shade to rest . Ivy came over and brought him a glass of water . " You look tired , Alvin , " she said . " Yeh , it seems like I 'm just getting no-'count lately again , " he answered , smiling up at her . " Drink just a swallow of this , and then later another swallow . " " Thanky , thanky , " he said . And then her eyes wavered from side to side as if searching some object to rest upon , and turning suddenly , she went back to her work . That evening when they all were going home she passed him at the end of the row.  | " How you feeling ? " " Oh , I 'm all right now . It 's cooler . " " Look here , Alvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " you 're working too hard . Get Ethel to make you some mullein-weed tonic . " " I never heard of that . " " It 'll help build you up . " " Golly ! I never took a dose of medicine in my life . Besides , Ethel would n't know how to make it . " " I 'll make it for you , then . " And a few days later she brought a large bottle full of brown syrupy stuff to the tobacco-barn . " I seasoned it with maple sugar , and it tastes good enough for a baby , " she said lightly . Handing it to him , she turned , as always , back to her work . " What 's that stuff you 're taking ? " Ethel asked , that evening , after supper . " Aw , something Ivy made up . Said it would do me good . I do n't believe in it , but I thought I 'd take it . It 's a tonic . " " I could have got you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you good . " " No , thank you , " he went on jokingly , " I 'd rather have this . A thing that comes out of the earth I reckon is not as liable to hurt you as what comes out of the drug store . " She was busy piling up the dishes now , and as she passed between him and the lighted lamp his eye ran over her form . As she came back to the table she glanced up . " What you looking at me so for ? " " Oh , I was just  --  just looking . " And then , setting the bottle down , he took her by the shoulders and pulled her towards him . " Say , honey , tell me something . " " Why , Alvin , you sound as sad as a funeral . " " Yes , I am sad , I reckon . " " What about ? " " You know what . Ai n't it going to happen ? " " You mean that ? " " Yes , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was hoping  --  well , you know how I feel . "  | " You 're ruining my clothes with your sweaty shirt , " she said , pushing from him and going on with her dish-washing . Then she called back over her shoulder , " We 'll have a baby when we 're able to support one , Alvin . " Ile came over and stood beside her . " What 'd you mean by that ? " " I mean just what I say , Alvin . I 'm not going to have a baby till we 're better fixed . " " You mean you 're keeping it from happening ? " he queried in blank astonishment . " And why should n't I ? I 've told you time and again that I 'm not going to be like the other women around here , broken down with raising children and living in dirt and poverty . " " Oh , " Alvin said shortly and stared at her . And then she lifted her wet hand above the dishpan , shook it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's sensible , honey ; you know it is . " " I do n't like it when you talk that way , " he said sternly . " What way , Alvin ? " " So careless-like about it . Already the folks in the field have begun joking me about not having a baby coming . " " Well , let ' em joke , " she said . " Poor-white trash that breed like rabbits . You would n't want that . You know it . You 're not their kind , Alvin , and I 'm not their kind . We 're different . That 's what 's brought us together . We 're going to be something in the world . " " Now I begin to understand it , " he said to himself abstractedly . " What ? " " Now when  --  when we 've been happy together  --  you know  --  you always  --  later  --  when you think I 'm asleep  --  you always get up and say you have to go to the kitchen for something . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do . Educated women and people out yonder in the big world away from Little Bethel . " And then she raised herself up on tiptoe to give him a pecking kiss on the cheek , but he pushed her off . And then she caught his arm and held to it firmly . " Listen to me , Alvin . You know I 'm right . " And once more she rehearsed vehemently to him the reasons why they should wait . And he could see the sensibleness of her argument , and at last he mumbled out that maybe she was right . But that evening after he had scrubbed himself and put on his clean sleeping-clothes he went to bed without a word . And she who seemed made for love and man delight soon put on her best lacy blue negligee and crept in beside him . But he lay still and heavy where he was , and when finally her soft arms hugged him tightly to her and she breathed softly into his ear , " Honey , " he made no move towards her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler weather , Alvin had no more dizzy spells in the field . And now the tobaccocuringwent on in dead earnest . He had his hands full looking after the two barns with which he took care of his crop . Before the third barnful had been taken out and packed away Walter Beasley had to give up his night watch . " I 'm just plumb whupped , doggone whupped , Alvin , " he said . " Well , you go to sleep . I can handle two as fast as one . And you need to be fresh for the fields . " " I ca n't stand up under it  --  working every day and then sitting up all night watching the thermometer , " Walter complained . " I can do it . It do n't take much sleep for me . You go on home now . " Walter went away , and for a week Alvin kept up the double task , watching the barns at night and then working between punchingthe fires in the daytime . Sometimes at night , out of sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tobacco-barns and sit with him till about eleven o'clock , and then when she began to get sleepy he would send her home . Alvin loved his work at night and he wished often that he was two men , one who could work in the day and another one at night . Hour after hour he sat alone , and when the fields grew quiet long after midnighthe would sit thinking his thoughts and planning . And sometimeshe would watch the stars and ponder on old Blake Dewar 's tragic life . And the best time of all was the early dawn . It always made him feel fresh and alert to see the great light from the east come spreading over the fields . And then when the sparkling sun peeped over the woods and the dew shone like diamonds in the grass and spider webs hung from the young tobacco sprouts that had started up from the old stalks , he felt like standing up andp323singing . But these long vigils by the furnace were sapping his strength away , and yet he would let no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and every care must be taken that the best curing possible was made . His eyes grew hollow and the skin stretched tightly over his cheek bones . Ethel noticed it at meal-time and kept begging him to let up . " I 've only got two more barns , " he said , " and then we 'll be through . And after that I can sleep for a week . " And Ivy also mentioned it . " Me and Milton 'll come up and watch for you a couple of nights , " she said . " No . Much obliged . It 'll be over in a few days , now . " " I do n't blame you much , " she said , " for you certainly have cured out a lot of nice tobacco . " " Yeh , I 've got good color in it , but it do n't weigh a thing . " " But I bet it 'll bring a good price  --  yours will , I mean , " she answered in her ever-optimistic way . And now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was running the heat up about a hundred and fifty degrees and had to keep a watchful eye for fear of fire . Sometimes if a leaf fell down on the flues inside the barn the whole thing was in a blaze inside of a minute and a Noah 's flood of water could never put it out . He had just examined the thermometer , punched up the fire , and sat down on a bench with his back against a post , when suddenly he heard a little elfin voice call from around behind the barn : " Alvin ! " He sat up and listened . " Who is it ? " he called , and his voice echoed hollowly in the darkness . He waited a long while and there was no reply . He got up and walked around the barn , but could find nobody . That was strange , for a voice certainly had called him . He sat down again in his accustomedseat and looked out to one of the great stars old man Dewar used to tell him about . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could n't remember . Like the names of the trees and the flowers  --  they 'd all passed from him . Lately it seemed he could n't remember things the way he used to . Then suddenly there it was again  --  that voice.  | " Alvin . " This time it was on the other side of the barn . Ile sprang up , stood listening , and then sank wearily down again . There was nobody there , nobody . And yet  --  where did that voice come from ? Now once more he heard it  --  but this time far off out in the fields . He turned his head and listened , and then he heard it across the fields behind him . " My Lord ! there 's something wrong , " he said as he rose to his feet and stood holding on to the shelter post . And as he listened , he heard a little low wooden tapping begin inside his skull . An icy chill smote floodingly over him like a cold wave . He wavered as he slid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter ? " he gasped thickly . And then the tapping in his head becamelouder , more metallic , like a carpenter 's mallet . " Toke-toketoke , " it went . And suddenly , as if a shutter had opened in front of his face , he saw a huge crooked forefinger fastened on the hands of a little boy knocking on the lintel of Mr. Byrd 's door . The knocking sound now jumped outside of his head and appeared to come from the knocking finger . Suddenly the vision was whisked away , darkness all around him , and the knocking had returned inside his head . But this time it was a voice  --  the voice of Mr. Byrd that struck him like a hammer with his name , " Alvin . " And then as the next pulse-beat hit , there came up out of the dim recesses of his memory the voice of his grandfather , " Alvin ! " And the next beat was his father calling , " Alvin , " and then rhythmicallyin the hammered tones Mr. Turner 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , and yet he recognized their voices . They were warning him of something , not pleading or begging or commanding , but warning . And then as quickly as they had come the voices and the knocking were gone and a sweet sootheful feeling came over him . " Why , it was nothing , nothing , " he murmured . " I must have been having one of these waking dreams . " The sense of restful sleepy peace increased , a weak warm watery sensation spread through every cell and molecule of his body . His joints , veins , muscles , and sinews , loosened into an oozy , flabby will-less mass and he saw his hand drop heavily down from the post , thuddingagainst the plank of his seat as if it had been a rotten limb dropping from a tree , and he felt himself falling backwards . A piercing wind whoomed up out of the fields , and whistled aroundp325his head and made the flames in the furnace bend and flicker like red ferns under a driving ground storm . And then out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a row came marching up towards the mouth of the furnace . And each of them carried a bag of gold on his back , and they all wore little buckled shoes , black stockings , and short breeches . But from their waist up t hey were different . The one in front stopped at the mouth of the furnace , peered in and then looked around at Alvin . " Grandpa ! " lie cried with a shriek . He had recognized him with his white heard , his preacher 's coat , his high smooth forehead . And suddenly Grandpa walked boldly into the fiery flame , and out of the bag on his back burst an agonized little face with staring eyes and widegapedmouth . It was he , Alvin Barnes , that was tied up in that sack . " Do n't you do it ! Do n't you do it ! " he screamed . And he could feel the heat and suffocation of the smoke and fire . As his grandfather disappeared with his burden into the furnace , Alvin clutched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the burning flues and finally up the chimney and into the air like smoke again . Now the second little man , wearing a black hat and specs pushed up on his forehead , stepped into the edge of the fire 's glow . And it was Mr. Byrd this time , and as he too disappeared into the furnace Alvin saw his own head and face burst wildly from the bag and call , " Do n't do it ! Do n't do it ! " Once more the same suffocation and smother of ashes and soot as he was swept through the pipe and out into the air again . And so it went . The third man was his father , his eyes like white marbles , his face that of a drowning man . And he , too , carried his little screaming victim into the smothering funnel . Next it was Mr. Turner , and then Boyd Collins , and now his grandfather again . Round and round the procession moved , disappearing into the furnace , flying out of the chimney again and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stop it ! Stop it ! " Alvin shrieked , staggering to his feet to come at them . And then like a heavy rock he felt himself plunge face downward towards the earth . And there they found him the next day lying chilled and senselesson the ground . And out of his babbling lips came a round of crazy words , " It 's money ; it ai n't me ! It 's money ; it ai n't me. "  |p325HEN  Ethel with the help of her father and Dollis Chadbournehad got him to the house , old Dr. John was sent for . He came jogging up in his buggy , thumped and listened and read Alvin 's fever . And all the while the sick man rolled his head wildly about and muttered his crazy speeches . " What does he mean by that ? " Ethel asked as she stood pale and horrified by the bed . " Oh , he 's just letting off steam , " Dr. John replied , looking up at her with his easy-going smile . " These ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , you know . " Then he looked at his thermometer and whistled . " Hum ! we got to do something to bring that down . " And rising quickly , he flung off his coat . " Bring me a pan of cold water and a cloth . And you  --  a  --  what 's your name ? Oh  --  Beasley.  --  And you , Beasley , take my horse and drive down to Linnyville and get ten pounds of ice if there 's any in town . " And for the next few hours there was frantic working around Alvin 's bedside . Near evening the doctor gave him a powerful opiate . His deliriousrigmarole died down and finally he slept . His fever had been lowered to a hundred and three , but Dr. John said he thought he 'd better spend the night there . Dollis , Mrs. Layton , and Mr. Layton all said they 'd be glad to sit up , too , but the old doctor said he would n't need them . He and Ethel could do all that was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door . Ethel opened it and Ivy was standing there . " I just thought  --  thought I 'd offer to do anything I could , " she faltered . " That 's nice of you , Ivy , nice . " And Ethel 's lips began to tremble as the dewy moisture of tears came into her eyes . " How is he now ? " she inquired as she gazed off into the night . " Better now , but the doctor 's worried about him . "  | " You want me to stay with you tonight ? " " Ma 's in there . She says she 's gon na stay , anyhow . " " It 's hard on you , Ethel . I thought  --  thought  --  Well , you call on us if we can help . " And with that she turned swiftly away . " Yes , I will , " Ethel said as she went in and closed the door . For a long while it seemed that nothing could save Alvin . He had suffered a complete breakdown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot around the tobacco furnaces and then lying about and cooling off in the night air . 1 ? very day he came , examined him , prescribed his medicine , and went away with a grave face . Alvin rallied for a while and seemed to get better , though he lay with dull eye and listless hand , gazing out of the window . As the days went by Ethel 's face grew pale and thin , her eyes were hollow , and the lightness of her step slowed clown . Mrs. Layton relieved her of nursing as often as she could , and now and then Ivy came up and sat in the living-room while 1 ? the lay down to rest for a while . One evening Alvin was obviouslyworse and had begun to mutter in delirium again . When t he doctor came in he spoke sternly to Ethel and said , " You 've got to get somebody to help you out . " Then he turned towards Ivy , " Could n't you ? " " I can do it , Doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crisis now , " he said in a low voice . " I know Ivy 's good with sick folks . She helped me with old man Cannady . Did n't you , Ivy ? " " Yes , sir . " " Though he died , poor fellow . And as Alvin 's attending physician , I 'm going to advise that you get Ivy to take a turn in watching by his bed . I 've got to go down to see that Ennis child now , but I 'll be back later in the evening . Now you go to bed , Ethel . And , Ivy , you stay with him . " For several hours while Ethel slept , Ivy sat by Alvin 's side , and every half-hour poured a few drops of medicine between his feverburnedlips . And each bubbling gasp that rose out of the phlegminfestedcaverns of his breast tore across her aching heart . And with bowed head she kept up her pleading agonizing with God . Ever since Alvin had been stricken she had continued to pray unceasingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn in everlasting fire weighed her down with its ghastliness . And as a Christian she cried to God to save his immortal soul , but as a woman she put a quiet hand on his forehead and murmured , " Take this , Alvin , this little bit of medicine . You 're going to be better in the morning ; yes , you are . In a little while you 're going to he sitting up and eating a big dinner , sound as a whistle and laughing and talking and all well again . Take this little bit of medicine , Alvin . " Sometime after midnight the doctor came back . And after he 'd listened to the sick man 's groaning and had tapped him with crossed fingers on the side , he shook his head and said : " I ca n't do any more . I 'm going back in the other room and lie down on the sofa . Call me , Ivy , if there 's any change . " Soon the old doctor 's snores were echoing through the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to pray as she 'd never prayed before . " Save him ! Save him ! You 've got to save him ! " she cried with her face buried in the bedcovers . " I 've believed in Thee all my life and served Thee . And now , for my sake , for the sake of all of us , save him ! " And in the agony of her grief not once did she think to say , " Thy will be done . " And the clock kept ticking and Ivy 's prayers went on unceasinglyand Alvin 's struggle for breath never stopped . Near daybreak he sat wildly up in bed . " No , you ai n't going to put me in that hole ; no you ai n't ! Stop it , Grandpa ! " " That he wo n't put you in it . Go way ! Go way ! " Ivy said loudly to the imaginary spectre . She bent over the bed and pushed his great emaciated shoulders down on the pillow . " Yes , he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Not on your life , " she soothed . And then hurrying to the door she closed it with obvious noise . " See , I 've run him out and locked the door . " She came back to the bed and laid her hand on his burning forehead . Reaching out his arms , he pulled her fiercely down on him and held her tightly against his breast . " That 's right , Sugarbunch , do n't let him get at me . Do n't you . " " No , he ca n't hurt you now , " she said . " I wo n't let him . " Andp329pulling her cheek against his bearded face , he still clung to her for protection . Her voice rose in a crooning murmur . " Rest , now  --  take your rest . Nothing in the world can bother you  --  nothingdeep  --  sleep  --  sleep . " And all the while her hand stroked his shoulder . And gradually his arms relaxed from around her , a sigh escaped through his lips , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , sleep , " she kept saying . And finally Alvin slept . Then she sat by the bed , holding his hand in hers , and the tears kept pouring from her eyes . When the sun shone in through the parlor window and lighted on the doctor 's face and waked him , he hurried to Alvin 's bedside , listened to the sick man 's breathing , and then stared down at Ivy . " I Ie 's better , ai n't he ? " he said brightly . Ivy only nodded and kept ( in stroking his hands . The doctor tiptoed softly from the room and closed the door behind him , and in the other room he was saying to Ethel , who had just got up : " Let him alone . He 's better . " It was several weeks before Alvin could leave his bed , for his unceasing worry about his tobacco held him back . It was now in the grading season , and with only Walter at work he knew he was falling farther behind each day . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollis Chadbourne and his family had helped some , though they had as much as they could do with their own crop . And at last in desperation he told Ethel she 'd just have to go out and help Walter . And without a word of complaint she did . At last in late fall he was able to get out to the barn with the aid of a stick . And as he took stock of the year 's work , a desolationovertook him . The cotton crop had been short , and with what he 'd had to pay out for picking , there was not much profit there . And the last barns of tobacco had been seriously hurt by the fire 's dying down the night he was taken sick . The rest of it , though of good color , was thin and light enough to be blown away by a puff of wind . Sick at heart , he turned wearily back to the house . " We 're in a pretty pickle now , " he muttered as he and Ethel sat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritable through her hardship and suffering of the year , replied , " I kept telling you not to work too hard . "  | " My God A'mighty , girl ! and I kept asking you to help me but you would n't . " " That 's not my sort of work and it never will be , " she answered . And then seeing him so white and shaken , she went over and patted him on the shoulder . " Do n't worry , honey . It 's good you 're well again . We 'll make it somehow . " " Yeh , and if it had n't been for somebody else , I 'd a-been dead , " he said , his anger and vexation making him unfair . " The doctor told me how she stuck by me . " And with swelling heart Ethel put her apron to her eyes and marched out of the room . Then he in turn was contrite , and followed weakly after her . He found her crying in the bedroom . " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But she shook herself free from him and walked on out in the yard . And he lay down on the bed , cursing himself for his weakness . When the crops were sold and the last penny counted up , he was forced to the bitter necessity of going down to see the man at the bank . " Looks like I ca n't pay that instalment on the land this year , " he said . The cashier sat drumming on the desk and looking before him . " How much can you pay ? " he asked . " The interest and a little bit of the principal , maybe . " " Then I 'll try to carry you another year , though I 'll have to talk it over with my committee . Could you come around tomorrow ? " " Yes , sir , " he replied . " But if you could  --  a  --  make it today  --  ? " " Well , suppose you come back in an hour or so . I 'm busy now . " And Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back room with some other men . He went down back of the court-house where he had Maggie hitched to a swinging limb . The excitement and strain of facing the banker had set the old pain gnawing in his head again . He finally went over to the drug store to get some tablets like those which Dr. John had prescribedfor his pain . " Well , I see you 're on your feet again , " said Carl Stevens as he handed out the medicine with a glass of water . " Yeh , I 'm getting about , " Alvin said . " How is everything with you ? " he asked idly.  | " If you mean how is farming  --  it ai n't nohow , " Alvin said snappishly . Paying for the medicine , he went out . He met Mr. Turner on the sidewalk and mumbled a good morning . The little man started by and then looked up . " Oh , hello , Alvin , " he said , and stopped . He had a ledger and some papers under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his bankrupt store business had passed into other hands . " Dr. John tells me you 've had a mighty close call , boy , " the little man said , clearing his throat with a nervous cough and peering at Alvin . " Yes , I been bad sick , but I 'm on the mend now , I think . " " That 's good  --  a-hem  --  that 's good . How 's the family ? I meanah  --  thewife ? " " All right . " " How are you and the bank getting on ? " " I 'm down here to see ' em ' bout the land just now . " " A-hem  --  well I hope you 'll keep your money in there . We need all the depositors possible . " " Yes , sir , what little I got 's in there . " " And are you planning a big crop next year ? " " Yes , sir , I 'm goin ' to tend all I can , but I 'm sort of put to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sorry to hear that , sorry  --  a-hem . But I wanted to speak to you on this identical matter . If you need another mule I 'll try to help you out . I been thinking of selling another one of mine . " " Well , that might come in handy , yes , sir , if Maggie do n't get better . " " Come to see me about it , then . " He started off and then stopped . " Oh , by the way , I reckon you heard that the Chadbournes are moving away next year . " " No , sir . " " They finally decided to try another place , hoping to make it better somewheres else . But I do n't reckon they will . Sorry to see ' cm go . Sorry to see ' em go . Dollis is a mighty hard worker , and you ca n't find one like Ivy in a million . " Here he darted a little look at Alvin .   " Yes , sir , they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news . " Yes , they 're going back up above Cokesbury where Gertrude comes from . Some of the other tenants are talking kind of chickenhearted , too . Well , you remember as I told you  --  a-hem  --  this farmingbusiness has its ups and downs , ups and downs . " And with a wave of his hand he turned off and went towards the courthouse . A little later Alvin went into the bank , and the prim , bespectacledMiss Morris said Mr. Stallings was still busy and she 'd wait on him . Then she explained that the cashier was willing to carry over his paper until the next year , but there 'd have to be a little financing charge . " What 's that ? " " You 'll have to give a note for the difference . " " Yeh , I 'll do that . " The young lady filled in a note and handed it to him for his signature . " But this is a hundred dollars too much , " Alvin said . " No , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing up the new papers . " " Good gracious ! You do n't mean it 's that much ? " " Yes , that 's right , " she answered , carelessly . " The bank could call for the whole amount you know . " A wave of anger swept over Alvin . " That 's not fair . " " Then you 'll have to settle it with Mr. Stallings , " she said , reaching for the slip of paper . And reluctantly Alvin signed it , pushed it back towards her , and left the bank . When he got back home he found Ethel flung down on the sofa , dissolved in tears . " What 's the matter ? " he asked anxiously as he hurried up to her , forgetful of his immediate hard luck . " Pa and Ma are going to move back to Granville County , " she sobbed . He drew away from her coldly . " Well , there ai n't nothing so bad in that . " And his voice was sore with sudden irritation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I heard about it down in the town . And I do n't see why you want to bawl your eyes out . "   " No , I do n't suppose you care , " she said , burying her face in the pillow . " Lord God ! Ethel , there 's a lot more things than that happening to you and me , " he said . " That 's what I 'm thinking of . " " Yes , your puny acres of land and a few dollars is all you study  --  all . " " Shut your mouth ! " he shouted . He stood and stared at her Ring there , his eyes taking in her trim feet , silk-stockinged legs , luxurious form , and all . But for once there was no response in his breast to her beauty . Rather in his mind he saw a spoiled woman full of whims and selfish fancies , one who perhaps was failing him all along the line . " You better get up from there and cook me some dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it here , I ca n't . They 're going up there to live with Gladys and Herbert . They always did like her better than me . " " What in the name o ' God , Ethel ! " he said . " Hush , I tell you ! " " I wo n't stand it , and I tell you . " " Stand what ? " " This lonesomeness . " " There you go again about lonesomeness . You better be studyingabout how to help me pay that drot'n bank what we owe ' em . " " Yeh , money , money ! Debts , debts ! " she replied angrily as she got up and flounced out of the room towards the kitchen . " Hey ! " he roared . But she went on , slamming the door behind her . He stood a moment , shaken with rage , and feeling suddenly weak he sat down on the sofa for a while and stared at the floor . " No , no , " he said to himself . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get worse and worse , I know . Ethel ! " he called . But she made no reply , and he could hear her clattering the pans as she got ready to prepare dinner . He got up and went into the kitchen and tried to reason with her , explaining about the extra hundred dollars at the bank , and saying worry over that had made him sharp with her . " Yes , I reckon you do feel bad about your folks leaving , " he continued . " You  --  I do n't know just how you feel ' cause I never cared much for my folks . Let 's do n't fall out , honey . " P334But she made no answer as she threw the sliced side meat into the pan and began moving it about with a fork . He turned and went heavily out to the barn to see how Maggie was getting along . There she stood in the stall , her head drooped down , her forelegs slightly crooked , and her rump raised , as if in the act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said wretchedly as he put his arm around her neck . " You got to get better . " But Maggie showed no responsein her lifeless eyes . He went off up the road and brought Dollis back . " She 's sick , all right , " Dollis said , " and I reckon we better drench her . " Fixing a rope-twist with a stick , they fastened it around her upper lip and finally gave her a good dose of linseed oil and turpentine . " If that do n't do her no good , nothing will , " Dollis said . " I remember two or three years ago she got like that and stood in the stable with her legs bent and her eyes dead and head hung down . " " What ? " Alvin exclaimed in astonishment . " Yeh , but she got over it . Maybe she will this time . " Alvin stood thoughtful a moment and then broke out in a raging cry , " Damn his crooked soul ! " he shouted . " Huh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule , but I reckon he wo n't . " " You talking about Mr. Turner ? " " Of course I 'm talking about Mr. Turner . So that 's why he sold Maggie , is it ? She 'd already been sick ! I 'm a good a mind to indict him for it , yes , I am . " " You could n't do that . She was all right when you bought her . ' Well , if she do n't get better before morning she 'll be dead , is all 1 can say . " With that Dollis went away . Several times during the night Alvin took his lantern and went out to see how she was . Around three o'clock in the morning he found her lying on the ground , her belly distended , and a kind of rhythmic , windy groaning coming from her mouth . With pitying helplessness he sat down on the door-sill and lifted her head against his knees . And for an hour he sat there while she died . And then he laid her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! rig down at her , his eyes filled with tears . " You were a mighty good mule , just the same , " he said , " and you worked hard , yeh , you show you did . " The hair on Maggie 's shoulders had turned white in places from long service under the collar , and a long streak on her side was worn bare from rubbing against the trace chains . The sun was coming up now , and the pigs , cow , and calf had to be fed . Some time later Ethel 's voice came calling from the porch across the road , " Breakfast 's ready , Alvin ! " " You go on and eat ! " he shouted . " I do n't want nothing ! " " How is your mule ? " " She 's dead ! " he yelled . That afternoon he went over and borrowed a team and the log wagon from Mr. Atlas McKay , and with Dollis 's help he tore out the side of the stable , hitched a log chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road towards the river , a wide scoured trail following behind in the sandbed . Turning off at a little-used logging-path , they pulled her deep into the woods and left her there to the keeping of the buzzards and the carrion crows . But after a sleepless night Alvin rose in the dawn , took his shovel and grubbing hoe , and going back to the woods set to work digging a grave for the faithful creature . For hours he toiled without thought of dinner , and in the afternoon , when it was finished , he got a pry-pole and rolled her body in . When he had covered her up he stuck the pole in the ground at her head and piled rails and pieces of rotted log over the spot to keep dogs from digging her up . " I reckon it 's better for the trees to have you than the buzzards , " he said mournfully . And he thought of how long ago the cotton roots had sucked Rassie 's strength into their stalks and bolls . The next week the Laytons moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and Ethel wept on her mother 's breast . " Never mind , never mind , " the older woman soothed . " You 'll be coming up to see us every once in a while . Wo n't you , Alvin ? " " Yeh , I 'll bring her up there some Sunday . " And so the Laytons drove off with a wagon-load of well-worn furniture , their faces just as worn , but now lighted hopefully .   That was a disconsolate Christmas for Ethel and Alvin . She took no interest in the occasion and went glumly about the house . " Good gracious , girl ! " he said in final exasperation . " We got our own house and land to look after . " " I wish we were moving away , I do . " " Well , we ai n't going to do that , I tell you , " he snapped . The next day he went down to Dunston , and after long bickeringand bargaining bought a mule from the Thompson Livery Stables for two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for what money he had in the bank would be needed for two new tobacco-barns , and so he had to give a note and a second mortgage on his land . But that was the best he could do , for he could n't farm without a mule , and a good one at that . " What 's his name ? " he asked . " We call him Mack . " " Well , Mack 's all right ; that 's a good name . " And Alvin led the powerful four-year-old out of the lot . And now the Chadbournes were ready to set out for their new home , and Alvin began to appreciate something of Ethel 's feeling . For these were the only friends he had in the world . He went down to the house to tell them goodby . Everything was already packed on the wagon , and Milton in a fever of excitement was sitting aloft on the load , anxious to be off . " I sure hate to see you go , " Alvin said as he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of hate to go , " Dollis agreed , " but , after all , a man 's got to try to look out for himself , and we ai n't a bit better off than the day we first moved down here . Are we , Gertrude ? " " No , not a bit , " she said . " Well , I hope it 's better up there . But I remember an old man used to tell me , The cows off yonder got long horns , ' and , Grass over in the other pasture looks greener than your own . ' " And then Dollis jerked his head toward Ivy coming out of the house , and said to Alvin in a low voice , " Between you and me , I did n't want to move , but Ivy 's been begging us to do it for the last two months . "   " Why , Ivy ! " Alvin said , turning to her . " I 'd a-thought you could n't leave your church work down here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cokesbury , " she repliedwithout looking up as she pushed several pillows into the back of the wagon . " Tell Ethel goodby for me , wo n't you ? " she said . " Yes , I 'll do that . She wanted to come down and see you off , but I reckon she 's busy about the house . " " Come on , let 's go , Pa , " Milton called . Dollis and Gertrude climbed up and took their places on the front seat . Alvin assisted Ivy up over the hub , and when she was settled on the roll of quilts he reached up and shook hands with her . " Goodby . " " Goodby , Alvin , " she answered in a voice so low he could hardly hear it . And then she looked down at him with her great , hollow , dark eyes . " There were n't nobody ever come into these fields that works like you , " he said with a show of jollity , though he felt a great loneliness over him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ai n't never thanked you for all you 've done for me , " he mumbled . " Doctor John says reckon I 'd a-died if you had n't been there to take care of me . " " Do n't you go working yourself to death again , either , " she smiled . " If I do , I 'll send for you , " he laughed . " And say , we 'll be comingup to see you-all some day . How 'll we find you ? " " Just ask for Mr. Senter 's place there near Cokesbury , " Dollis called . " All right . We 're ready to go . Get up . " And the wagon rolled out of the yard . A family of Negroes by the name of Jenkins moved in the next week to take the place of the Chadbournes , and Mr. Turner and Miss Marthy still occupied their big house alone . Obie Beasley , who had begun to ail somewhat , required Walter 's services on his crop , and Alvin had to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Negro family he found a boy about sixteen named Matt , and he hired him as a day laborer . KnowingP338Ethel 's attitude towards Negroes , he told him he 'd have to board at home , and a bargain was struck whereby Matt would receive an acre of tobacco for his own crop , the same arrangement Alvin had with Walter Beasley the year before . And once more the hopeful work of the new year 's farming began  --  the clearing and digging of a plant bed , the hauling of fertilizer , the spring breaking . It seemed that Alvin had got a bargainin the new mule , for day after day Mack merrily pulled the plow in front of the Negro boy . Alvin had to take his own work rather easily for a while . He had never regained his full strength , and after an hour 's digging with a hoe he would have to sit and rest for a few minutes . But as the warm spring weather came on and his interest in his crops increased , his old sickness disappeared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Saturday in March he had taken Ethel up to see her parents , and there he had got acquainted with the whole family . He was secretly pleased that none of the girls were as pretty as his Ethel , and the boys were no great shakes , either , for strength or good looks . They returned home on Sunday afternoon , and after that Ethel seemed to be better satisfied than before . And gradually Alvin found his life smoothing out around him . Once more his plans for the future began to grow and fill his mind . He planted ten acres of tobacco , seven of cotton , and five of corn . And besides , there was his garden , a potato-patch , a little cane patch , and several acres in pea-vine hay . " Drannys me ! " said the Negro boy Matt , who lisped somewhat like a child , " I never theen a man planth thuch a big one-horse crop ! " " Yeh , and maybe you ai n't seen such a man , " Alvin laughed as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like laughing now . Never had there been such a promising spring . Never had the sun and the seasons of rain been so fine . And there was a great pother about , not only among the farmers , but among the animals and birds of the fields and the leafy woods . The owls hooted from the damp hollows , the partridgesclucked in all the deep thickets where they congregated on their community nests . The kingbirds roamed the skies , merrilyP339chasing crows or buzzards to the farthest edges of the horizon . And the chimney swifts swept the air clean of insects in their morning and afternoon forays . And the sassy little hummingbirds twittered swift as an arrow by one 's face in their little pestering fights . And the tohees down in the reedy thickets near the pasture flirted and played about like young girls displaying their bright garments . The mourning doves called cow-ooh , a-ooh-a-ooh forours at a time . The woodpeckers drummed boastfully on any dead limbs or fence posts that they could find . And the sap-suckers drank juice from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiddler 's bitch . The countryside was full of billing and cooing , the building of nests , laying eggs , and whole teeming fertility of life . Baby rabbits began to appear in the hedgerows around the garden , and down in the deep woods the foxes , ' possums , and minks slunk about in search of food for their young . And standing on the back porch in the gloom of the evening , Alvin felt all this surge of life and wonder . With his arm around Ethel he looked out at the bounding crops and said , " Ai n't that a party sight ? " " Yes , it is , " she answered , leaning against him . " If things keep on the way we 've started , Sugarpie , " he continuedhappily , " there wo n't be no question about  --  a lot of things , will they ? " " No  --  maybe not . " " You know what . " " Yes , " she said . " And I been thinking we want to paint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch out there . " " That 'll be fine . " " And we 'll forget them little hard words , wo n't we , honey ? " " Yes , let 's forget ' em , Alvin . " And with his hand cupped around one of her full breasts , he stood there till the fields slowly dissolved away into darkness . Then lifting her up in his arms , he carried her in and laid her on the bed . A little later she got up and started into the kitchen . " Where you going ? " he cried . " I want a drink of water . "   " No , you do n't . Oh , Ethel ! " Catching her by the hands , he pulled her back to the bed and she sat down and buried her face shamefacedly in her hands . " What in the world , honey ? What is it ? " But she shook her head and said nothing . " Do n't worry . I 'll make it somehow and you 'd be happier if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you waiting for , anyhow ? Seems like you 're always waiting for something . " And then finally she began to talk , as quietly , gently as she could , trying to keep her voice steady . " I do n't know , Alvin , what it is . That 's right . Seems like I 'm waiting for something . I love you , Alvin . I do . I ca n't help it to save my life , but something always seems , always seems hanging over me . I look out of the window and across the fields and every day it 's the same . Something I want . I do n't know what it is , Alvin . " " Yeh , I know , I know . You do get lonesome . You 're different from other folks , that 's why . And you just wait . This fall we 'll go on that excursion to Washington . We just did n't have the money the other time . " " Oh , I 'm not thinking about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got something to tell you . You know when we got married , Ma was so surprised that I wanted it quiet . " " And I was too , honey . " " There was a reason for it . I hardly knew what that reason was , but now I do . I had a feeling deep down that maybe it would n't last . " " What would n't last , Ethel ? " " You got to listen to me , ' cause it 's bothered me to death . That 's right . I thought  --  maybe I thought if we did n't have such a big occasion in the church and all  --  I would n't feel so tied to you , and some day if it did n't work out right I could  --  well , we could  --  well , you could go your way and I could go mine . " " My way is your way , honey , like the Bible said . " " And I kept thinking , suppose'n I had a baby and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I do ? And then if something happened to you  --  and  --  well , you know last summer when you were so sick  --  I thought about it a heap and I was glad we did n't have a baby . " And then seeing his abstracted face , sheP341took his hand in both of hers . " Darling , let me wait , please , a little while longer . I want a baby , too , sometimes I do more than anything . But I know it would be a big mistake  --  unless  --  we 're sure we 're settled and sort of secure against the future . " " I told you I 'd take all the responsibility for that . " " Yes , I know , " she went on softly . " You are grand , Alvin . Yes , a great man , maybe , great like that land out there you love so well . And you would make it towards money and power if any farmer could .... " " And I will , I will , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she answered drearily . " And you 've been bothered about me . The people in the neighborhood have talked . And I want to help you , I do . But I do n't want to get out there in the fields and in two or three years be  --  be worn out , not fit for your  --  for your bed . I love pretty things just the way you love your crops and the land , and I hate the thought of being dirty and worn out and ugly before my time . But I promise I 'll try to help you in the fields this summer . And next fall maybe we can have him . For I want him too , I do . " And rising from under his listless hand , she went hurriedly into the kitchen . Presently he got up and followed her , but the door was thumbboltedand she said , " Wait a minute . " He turned and went down to look at his tobacco plants . And regularly through April and into May she would leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and work by his side . At first her movements were slow and awkward , but at last she began to get on to the knack of hoeing and worming and suckering tobacco . At night she would bathe her face and shoulders in buttermilk and rub her hands with glycerine . And Alvin , in gratitude for her help to him , loved her more wildly than ever . They seemed to grow closer together now and talked a great deal about their plans as they worked along . And then one day she did n't send the heavy washing over to Obie Beasley 's wife , but ( lid it herself . Then she learned to make soap in the washpot , and after that began to can beans and garden stuff . Not once did she complain , and the days went happily on into summer . Alvin was strengthened and fortified by her help and interest in his work .   This was double harness now , the way it ought to be . A man and his mate working for their hearth and home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on what their hands had begun . But Ethel saw with dismay these same hands of hers grow hard and swollen and the peach-pink of her cheeks disappear into a yellow , leathern tan . The pouring sunlight which filled the air in every direction seeped in under her bonnet , penetrated down the bosom of her dress , worked its way through her stockings and toughened her body all over . Before the mirror at night she could see that her gray fringed eyes had begun to take on a hollow look like Ivy 's , and her dark eyebrows had grown bleached . Her face had become thinner and her two big apple breasts were smaller and had lost something of their plump upstanding . As the tear of self-pity and regret slipped down her cheek , she murmured , " I 'll keep on till fall , anyhow . I 'll try to keep on till then . " One day the whole neighborhood was shocked to hear that Mr. Stallings , the bank cashier , had killed himself . He had gone into a back room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ethel had been down to the village for some coffee and sugar , and people were standing around on the streets in knots , talking about it . " Great goodness ! what 'd he want to do that for ? " Alvin said perplexedly at the supper table that night . " Something 's wrong at the bank I heard folks say . " " Why , what could be wrong ? " he asked , picking up The Linnyville News and looking at the advertisements . " Here it says every week over one hundred thousand dollars in cash money  --  My Lord ! " And he stood up uneasily as he thought of the three hundred dollars he kept down there towards building his tobaccobarnsnext month . " You reckon he done something with the money ? " " People said there must be something bad wrong is all I know , " she answered . He hurried from the supper table , hitched Mack to the buggy , and drove off down to the village . It was Saturday night and most of the stores were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sack of flour on his shoulder and a bag of sugar in his hand . " Hear about the bank , Mr. Obie ? " " Yeh , that 's all I have heard , Alvin . "   " What you heard ? " That Mr. Stallings killed hisself ' cause money in the bank is all gone . " " Say , put your flour and sugar in the buggy and I 'll take you back when I go . My mule 's hitched over there behind the hardwarestore . " And Alvin hurried over to the drug store to see Carl Stevens . " Can you tell me anything about it ? " he asked . " About what ? " " About the bank and Mr. Stallings killing himself . " " If you had any money in that bank you 've lost it , " Carl said with cool superior wisdom . " Yeh , but you could n't lose it , could you ? There 's Mr. Dave Collins and Mr. McKay and Mr. Turner  --  everybody had their money in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carl answered brightly . " You could nd a lot of other folks like you . " " What you mean by that ? " " If you 'd been old man Dave you 'd had your money out of there . Like a fool , I let mine stay . " " You mean he got his out ? " And Alvin turned out of the store , sick at heart . He spoke to several other people on the street , and they all told him the same thing . Then rage and bitterness sat upon him . " Yeh , " he muttered , ss he strode along . " It 's Mr. Barnes this , and Mr. Barnes that , and they 're mighty glad to have your money in , yeh !  --  If there 's any service we can render you ! ' Yes , and Mr. Turner he advised it . Now , by God ! they 've spent it , wasted , robbed me , robbed me , that 's what . Oh , but I 'll have it back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " And looking up he saw Mr. Stallings ' fine house in a grove across the street , all lighted from top to bottom . " Look at that , " he growled . " A fine house and servants and his wife riding around in a two-horse carriage , and his girl going ' way off to college , studying music . And it 's my money and other folks ' money like me that give ' em all this . " And stepping across the street , he stood before the gate . Yes , he was of a mind to go in there and tell them what he thought about it . As he pulled open the gate he noticed several people sitting about in the front parlor , and in the middle of the room there was something that looked like a coffin covered with flowers . From a window upstairs he heard the low sound of a woman 's sobbing . Mr. Turner came out of the hour and moved gravely down the walk . " What you standing here for ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mighty sad , mighty sad , " the old man said , shaking his head . " Stallings was a good boy . He would have made it right if he 'd lived . " " But what 's going to happen now , Mr. Turner ? " " Oh , you had a little money in there , did n't you ? " " All I had in the world was there . " " Too bad , too bad . " " Yeh , that 's what you say , " Alvin burst out hotly . " But did you lose any ? " The old man stopped and studied the ground a moment and then looked up . " The truth is  --  I did n't . " " That 's it  --  that 's it  --  " Alvin growled , his voice breaking with anger . " And Dave Collins , I bet he did n't , and Mr. Atlas McKay , and the rest of you . You all knew what was going to happen and got your money out . But we poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , Alvin , was I did n't have any to lose . " " I do n't believe it . " " Now look here , boy , " he said sternly . " It wo n't do you any good to go around talking like that . " " But what am I going to do , Mr. Turner ? Here I was planning to build my tobacco-barns . " " Well , I reckon you 'll have to use some of mine again . They 're getting in bad shape and I 'm not able to fix ' em up . " Then he went on a little more kindly : " I know how you feel . You 've been having a pretty hard time of it , and it looks like this is one blow too many . But that 's the way it is in this farming business  --  up and down . You got to expect bad luck once in a while . You remember I told you that . " " This ai n't luck , " Alvin spoke up angrily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " the old man sighed . " I suppose you 've heard about my trouble , too . " " No , sir . " " I 'm losing my place . I been struggling to carry it , but I 've had to keep it mortgaged pretty heavy , and what with sickness and the store and all the rest  --  the insurance company 's taking it over . " " I 'm  --  I 'm sorry to hear that . " " And the grand old Turner plantation is no more . Of course I 'm in charge of it and am going to go on farming for a while , hut  --  Well-a-hem  --  goodby . " And Alvin watched his bent figure go slowly down the street . The woman in the upstairs room was now sobbing more loudly , and Alvin hurried to get away from its sound . He met His Honor , I lopping June Waring . Now here was a man would know all about it . He understood law and was on to such things . Alvin asked his advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening star and said , " Well , let me think . " And presently he spoke up . " I can look into it for you . " " I wish you would , " Alvin answered eagerly . " ' Course there 'd be a lot of papers and things to examine and  --  Well , I 'll see what I can do . " " Yes , sir . " " You 'll hear from me . " " Thank you . " And Alvin went on towards his buggy feeling a little easier . Yes sir , other people might take a robbery like that lying down , but not he . He 'd fight back . They 'd hear from him , all right . He had a lawyer now , and when a lawyer got to looking into things , something happened . But the days passed by and he heard nothing from June . He later went down to see him and the little man said he was still looking into the matter , but it would take time . And Alvin returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once more that old haunting fear set up . The days were flying fast , and he was getting older all the time . And this year he had a heavier load than ever before . Of course Ethel was helping him , bless her soul , and that eased things somewhat , and Matt Jenkins was smart , too . Everything was pulling together , but when he satP346down at night with his pencil and paper and figured up the amount of debt ahead of him his heart sank . There was not only last year 's payment on the land , but this year 's too , and in addition the new mule . He could only hope that the tobacco and cotton would be a good price . And then , sitting there , he began thinking about the mystery of prices . Who controls such things , anyhow ? Why was n't it possible for the government or the people in charge of things to set prices so that a man would know what to gamble on , how to plan his life ? For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , then if he made a trade like buying land or a mule he would know pretty well whether he could afford it . Of course the weather was something you could never count on , but the weather never played half the havoc with man 's life that the ups and downs of prices did . Mr. Dewar had all these things figuredout in his book that was burned up long ago . Looks like some other man , some man with education and wisdom , would figure it out also , and the great body of men that stayed in Washingtonand made the laws and ran the country would take charge of the thing and fix it . And then he thought of the tobacco sales he 'd attended in past days , and how everything seemed to be in the hands of a few men whose business it was to pay as little as possible for the crop . Why , the handful of bosses behind those fellows could get together in a hotel room and decide to give the poor farmer , who works his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , ten cents a pound for his crop and not fifteen . And why should n't they , when they were out to make all the money they can ? It was just the way Mr. Dewar said . " There 's something wrong about it all , but I ca n't understand it , " he said , shaking his puzzled head . " But something ought to be done . " " What ought to be done , Alvin ? " Ethel asked , where she sat sewing lace into the neck of a blue nightgown . " Oh , I was just thinking of something . " " You 've got so you talk to yourself like an old man . " " Yeh , " he laughed . " I 've lived so much by myself I reckon , I 've  --  I kinder ca n't quit it . That 's a purty thing you 're making . " " Yes , it is . " P347Rising and coming over , he stroked her shoulder meaningly and d softly , " Do n't you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin , please . " " ' Tomorrow night , then ? " " Then tomorrow night  --  when it 's finished . " The next day a fiery meteor shot through the Little Bethel country . People ran out-of-doors to look at it go by and children nipped their hoes in the field and climbed up on the fence . Horses shied out of its path , and the slothful plow mules pricked up their rs , snorting viciously , and swerved about , breaking the tobaccod cotton down . And they were no more frightened than the y between the plow handles behind . For Boyd Collins was drivin-g through with an automobile , a trail of smoke behind and the noise of a continuous train of exploding firecrackers popping down c road . He stopped at Alvin 's house , and Ethel came out to see c horseless wonder . " How about riding in it ? " Boyd laughed sily . And forgetful of everything , she went in , primped herself bit , and drove off with him . " I got to be back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , " he chortled gleefully . An hour later she returned , and standing in front of her mirrore abstractedly put on her house dress preparatory to cookingpper . Her face was flushed beneath its tan , for in her ears the()tor of that strange buggy still throbbed and in her vision the  --  ces still went flying past . But above all were the words Boyd Collins had spoken to her . " Poor little girl , I 'm still thinking of nu , " and again , " Do n't lose your beauty , child , do n't lose it , for after that you 'll have nothing left . Seems like I see the wear andtear already beginning  --  and you just twenty-one . " And still again , " What about the half-dozen children I expected to find you mother of ? " To all of which she said nothing or mumbled at the most a noncommittal reply , as the car popped and sputtered and the horizon dipped or topped the trees . His tone had been light and bantering enough , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness . Yes , Boyd Collins really liked her . He always had . Maybe he 'd never cared for her in a serious way . How could he and he one of the rich Collinses and she nothing but a tenant girl ? And , too , she had liked him  --  in a way she had . In spite of everything she had always found his company pleasant . Suppose he had been serious the way Alvin had or with half the will power ? What would have happened ? And as if not wishing to know the result of her query , she wriggled her dress over her shoulders , went into the kitchen , and started a fire in the stove . Presently Alvin came in from the lot where he had been milking the cow . He set the bucket down on the table without a word , went out on the porch and started washing his face . The match trembled in Ethel 's fingers as she lighted the fat pitch-pine splinters . Well , there was no help for it . Alvin was mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel appeared in the door and she knew he was standing there wiping his big hands and looking at her with baleful eyes . " Supper 'll be ready in a minute , " she called with forced brightness . " I did n't think you 'd be back in time for that , " he sneered . And looking up she saw his face white and smoldering with rage . She stopped and stared at him and a little placating smile began to crinkle around her lips . " No , you need n't laugh , " he said , shaking his head . " That was something for you to be doing right out in the broad open daytime , and you a married woman ! " " What ? " " Hopping into that fellow 's new thingumajig and driving through the country for everybody to look at you ! " " I 'm not ashamed of it . " " Well , you ought to be , Ethel . Why in the hell does he come popping up here for ? " " He did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Reckon he thought ' cause he was riding in that crazy thing and everybody 's eyes sticking out in worship that he could come in here and just do as he pleased ! And you thought the same . " " He really came by to give me a message , Alvin . " " Oh , did he ? " " Yes , and it was for you , too . Cousin Molly 's invited us both down to Dunston for Fourth of July . " " What 's he got to do with Cousin Molly ? "  | " He said she traded at his store regularly and he had to be corn- " up to Linnyville on business and she asked him to give us a message . " " I 'd look like a pretty sight going off to Dunston with as much work as I 've got to do , would n't I ? " " But you ought to take a day off sometimes , Alvin . " " Yeh , and what  --  Suppose I tell that to the bank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " " But there 's Mr. Dave Collins and Mr. Atlas McKay . Almighty men of God . The paper says they 're going to settle everything up and you know drot'n well they ai n't going to give me anything . " " I want to go myself , " she said daringly . " Well , go and be damned ! " he shouted as he slammed his way out of the house . He walked down among his tobacco and seated himself on a dike with his head in his hands . The light had almost died out of the sky and the sweet-smelling dusk of evening enfoldedhis fields and woods to sleepfulness . On either handretched his acres of tobacco and cotton , but for once he found no pleasure in contemplating them . " What in the world 's got into Ethel ? " he queried of the soundlessair . " Here I 'm broke as a convict with hardly a red cent in the world , and enough work for three men , and she wants to go gallivanting off to barbecues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barneses sure enough , standing around a lemonade stand with nothing to buy a sip of water with . " And then as he sat there thinking , Ethel 's secret pervasive influencegradually began softening his thoughts . He remembered how once before they 'd been to Dunston and had a great time together , and he had said to her , " We 'll have lots of other wonderful times . " And she had snuggled up warm against him and loved him and he had loved her . " Oh , my God Almighty ! what 's the matter with us ! Deep down I want to do everything in the world I can to please her and make her happy , ' cause I love her better than anything . lint I ca n't go against my work , I ca n't . After this year , though , I 'll try to make it up to her . If we can save a little I 'll let her go tip and visit her folks more . Then she can visit Cousin Molly for a Week , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long trip we been talking about , for she 's tried to work hard this summer , yes , she has . " When he got back to the house he heard the sound of voices in the parlor . May McCrae , from one of the new tenant families recentlymoved on Mr. McKay 's land , was there . Sh was a tall , slender girl with a little head and freckled face set upon her slender shoulders . Her eyes were bright and bird-like , her mouth small and voluble . And as she talked she had a way of cocking her head on one side and peering at a person and laughing derisively . " Ethel and I have got it all fixed , " she said . " Howdy , May . What you got fixed ? " " She 's going with me down to Dunston on Friday , the Fourth . " " I thought Ethel had decided not to go , " he said harshly . " Of course she 's going , Alvin . She 's worked like a dog all summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ought to get out and have a little fun . " Alvin turned impolitely out of the room , and going down on the back porch he drew himself a tubful of water from the well , sat down , took off his shoes , and began washinghis feet . Presently May went away and Ethel came to the porch door . She was wearing the blue nightgown that she had promised to put on for him tonight . " I 'm going to sleep on the davenport , " she said coldly . " Suit yourself , " he replied without looking around . And as she was closing the door he called out , " What you going to do for money to spend ? " " I 've got two dollars from sending back that shirtwaist . " And the door clicked shut . Rising the next morning before day , he cooked his breakfast and hurried into the fields . There he hoed savagely among the late cotton , but every now and then he kept looking up , expecting to see Ethel come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally a quarter to twelve came around , and there was no sign of her . He went to the house to get his dinner , and there found a note on the kitchen table . " May sent over and said she was going today . I 've gone with her . You 'll find your clean shirt and a pair of drawers in the chest . "  |p351With  a smothered oath he crumpled the piece of paper in his hand and set about fixing his own dinner . So that 's the way she felt . " When I tell her I do n't want her to take even one day she takes two , " and a cruel perverse smile stole around his bitter lips . All right , he 'd see who was boss . In the fall when she wanted money she would n't get it . And there would n't be any trip offered . No , sic ! There would be only one person in his house to wear the britches , and his name was Alvin Barnes , Alvin J. Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the thought of seeing her sent little leaps of joy springing in him . " I 'm a complete fool about her , " he groaned . Yes , he 'd try to be a little kinder . He aright have been wrong , after all , about her riding with Boyd Collins . Who would n't have her head turned a bit when a fellow with an automobile asked her to take a ride , and especially one of the Collinses with all that power and glory of money ? And like as not Ethel might have had a chance to marry that fool if she had wanted to . She did n't want to . She tools him instead . Yes , he must never forget that , she chose him  --  Alvin Barnes . Then there was the sound of a buggy in the little lane , and looking out he saw Muss Peterson and May McCrae . Ethel was not with them , and his heart sank down like lead . May came tripping in , and after she had gushed a bit about the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance and said Ethel had decided to spend the night in Dunston . He could feel the tiny glint of malice in her shoe-button eyes . With impassive face he said , " Well , I reckon she 'll be back tomorrow . Glad you-all had a good time . " But tomorrow came and went and Ethel failed to return . And as Alvin ate his supper alone he communed wretchedly with himself , and anger against her smote him again . The next day a letter came which said , " Dear Alvin , I know you got a lot to do and I ought to be there helping you , but when I got down here I was so tired I just had to rest a while . Cousin Molly has been begging me to stay on a few days . She wants to have a party for us Saturday night , for you and me . Please come down , and then we 'll go back home together . Take care of yourself . Ethel . " " Yeh , yeh , so she 'll stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and flung it on the floor .   After a restless night he rose in the morning , picked the pieces of the letter up and put them away in the bottom of the chest . T16% was the first letter Ethel had written him . " Just the same , I wo n't go down there and get her , I wo n't , " he said to himself as he went back to work . " She can get home somehow . I did n't take her off and I wo n't bring her back . " And then the long slow hours of Thursday and Friday came on and his desire to have her back again was so great he could hardly endure it . " No , I wo n't go , " he kept saying doggedly to himself , mechanically pinching off the tobacco suckers . But as he sat over his cold Saturday dinner he finally gave up the struggle and went up the porch to get ready . While he was shaving he heard a voice in the yard that sent his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russ Peterson driving away , and Ethel tripping up on the porch with her suitcase in her hand . Dashing the lather from his face with a towel , he hurried out to meet her . " Honey , honey ! " he murmured as he held the sweet-scented being in his arms . Later when she was putting on her blue nightgown she told him that since Cousin Molly did n't hear whether he was coming or not , she decided not to have the party , and meeting Russ Peterson on the street she had come home with him as before . For a while after that their difficulties seemed smoothed out . They were kind to each other , and Ethel went back to helping him in the afternoons . But without his knowing it , a constant vision was lighted in her mind . She saw street lights , people laughing and talking , and nicely dressed girls and clean spick-and-span men , and drug stores and cafes where people gathered , talked , joked , told the news , and were happy . And a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins had said to her down there , " I 'm needing a nice up-to-date young lady in the drug store here , and if you ever get tired of the pleasures of farming , you 'll find a job waiting . "   ONE day in the fall a note came to Alvin through the mail , saying , " Dear Mr. Barnes , at your convenience the undersigned would be pleased to have you call at the bank . Sincerely yours , D. C. Collins , A. W. McKay .  --  Alvin immediately left the tobacco-grading , telling Matt and Ethel and the Beasleys to push right ahead while he was gone , and he hurried down to Linnyille . The same prim Miss Morris was standing behind the cage , and she showed him into a little back room where Mr. Collins and Mr. McKay were seated at either side of a big desk , going through all sorts of papers . Mr. Collins was a slender roan with a pasty , caked face , dark graying hair , and a black penetrating eye . Mr. McKay was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white mustache , and a peach-complexion face . Mr. Collins asked Alvin to be seated and then rummaged in a little wire basket , pulled out an envelope containing notes and mortgages , and in a serious but affable tone explained that something would have to be done about this . " What do you mean , sir ? " Alvin inquired warily . " We 've got to make a report on all these papers and we wanted t o talk it over with you , " he said in low words , so swift that Alvin had to think them through before he thoroughly heard them . " But they ai n't due till some time in December , are they ? " " No . But there 's quite a sum due at that time  --  most of last year 's payment and the next year , too . You also have a note for a mule down in Dunston , I understand . " " How did you know that ? " Alvin asked quickly . " Well , " and Mr. Collins smiled quietly but authoritatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . You see , Mr. Barnes , we wished to check on your assets . " " Yes , sir , " Alvin replied vacantly . " By that we mean how much crop you have , so that we can judge something of your ability to pay at the end of the year , " Mr. Collins went on . " I got ten acres of tobacco , eight acres of cotton , four acres of corn , some peas , potatoes , and a garden . " " According to the tax books your personal property is listed at one hundred dollars . " " Yes , sir , that 's what the man told me to put down . You see , I ai n't never been able to buy much of that sort of thing yet . " Alvin spoke as easily as he could , for there was something about these two powerful gentlemen that reminded him of the fish-factory salesmen . A man would have to watch his step ; yes , sir , better watch out . But , anyway , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for so it was written down in the big boot : at the court-house , and no man , however great , could go against what those books said . " Well , that 'll do , Mr. Barnes , " Mr. Collins said pleasantly . " We hope you 'll be able to pay up in the winter , " Mr. McKay said . " Quite a load to put on one crop , though . " " Yes , sir , I know it , " Alvin answered laconically . And when he had gone , these two keepers of the county 's weal gazed at each other and then looked out of the window at the same time . " He 's a kind of peppery fellow , " said Mr. McKay . " And a mighty hard worker , they say , " Mr. Collins replied . " Have you heard from the insurance company about Turner 's land ? " Mr. McKay inquired as they both drew their gaze from the window . " No , not yet , but I am sure they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding between us about our agreement ? " asked the long-mustached one . " None , " the thin face replied . " You get the hundred and fifty acres north of the house , and I get the rest adjoining mine , with the house . " " And this boy 's thirty acres will be a sort of island in the sea of your many acres ? " heavy jowls said . " That 's so , it will , " black eyes responded . And these two settled back to their harmonious work . At theP355tame hour in a mahogany-paneled office far away towards the North Star young Wet-behind-the-ears was saying to the company'ssenior partner , Pince-nez , " And here , sir , is account Al23479- " " Read it , " says Pince-nez as he looks through a window to-%%-ards a great river where a pennanted ocean liner with a cargo of plus fours , lorgnettes , derby hats , gold teeth , and playing cards is sliding quietly out to sea . " A certain parcel of land with houses and other encumbrances liereinafter described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . " Oh , I remember that , " says the elder with a sigh as he regretfullywithdraws his gaze from the window . " Two country hicks down there keep writing in about it , " says the young man . " Their names ? Let me see , Collins and McKay . Good old names , eh ? " " Shall we close with them , sir ? " " Yes , fix up the pepers . We waste too much time on these trifling matters . " " Still , there 's forty percent in it  --  a right good profit . " " Hell-hell-hell ! " laughs Pince-nez . " Is that the best you can figure for our stockholders ? " And Wet-behind-the-ears grovels in : ibject humility before the great man 's cunning , the while he wondcrswhich side of the boss man 's throat he 'd better cut first . When Alvin got back to the pack-house , Ethel asked him what they wanted , meaning by " they " the two powerful men who controlledthe destinies of so many people down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my assets , " he said sardonically . " Whath 's that , Mr. Alvin ? " the Negro boy Matt snickered . " It means everything that would bring a dollar , " Alvin replied as he set quickly to work grading the yellow leaves . A few days after that old Len descended upon them . He took his seat in the rocking-chair and began to sling himself weakly backwards and forwards . He had changed a great deal in the last few months and was now in truth an old man . All his teeth wereP356gone and his face seemed to be all lips . He took great delight in drawing them back in a wide smiling gap and showing his whirr boneless gum , the marks of his great suffering . " Yeh , " he said , " that tooth-dentist told me if I did n't get ' em pulled out I 'd be a dead man in less than a year . And so he did , and he put ' em one by one on the table in front of him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were an inch long . Seemed like it was just tearing the brains plumb outn nip  --  skull every time them pullikins would take hold . " " Well , maybe you 'll get you some new ones now , " Alvin said , trying to hide his disgust . " Nah-uh , " Len replied , suddenly adopting his sanctimoniousF , tone . " The children all advised me to  --  Thelma and Sary and the boys . They were going to pay for it . But I took it up with the Lord in prayer . Yes , sir , I took it to Old Moster in prayer . I said not my will , but thy will be done . " " And what did Old Moster say ? " Alvin inquired with obvious sarcasm . " Oh , I know you do n't believe in such and sundry . O Lord ! "  --  and sighing , old Len looked piteously at him . " But some day , as the Bible says , every knee shall bow and every tongue confess Him . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal soul and not so much about laying up money and gettingahold of land . Yeh , you had , for I got a witness of the spirit that testifieth the truth of these things unto me . And when I conic up here to visit ye , the Lord told me to try to bring your willful heart to repentance . Oh yes , he did , and I reckon I understand when the Lord speaks to me . I ort to , for I been serving my Maker these fifty year , yeh , fifty-five , ' cause I remember perfessingto him in Little Bethel church there when I was ten years old . " And then forgetful of his sanctimony , he grinned a toothless grin and his eyes crinkled and clouded with reminiscence . " Yeh , I remember that day same as yistiddy . Old man Baxter was praying and I was down at the mourner 's bench , a little shirt-tail shaver . The reverend was squatted down over near the door . A powerful big man he was . Had a foot looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Godless man like you , Alvin , and died withp357great sore on the back of his neck hollering and screaming ford Satan to get his pitchfork outn it .. . well , sir , he was always p to devilment , and pulling his carpenter 's rule out of his pocket , e measured old Brother Baxter 's foot . And I 've hearn him tell many a time that it was sixteen inches long in the shoe . " Then Alvin snorted indignantly . " That 's a fine way to get ligion , Pa . " And suddenly old Len 's face was swept with piety again . " Yes , air , I 've talked to the Lord about it , and the Lord told me not to ct any new teeth . Do n't walk about proud , but be humble , ' he . id , said it to me clear as the preacher at church , These newangledinventions and things is vexations of spirit . If I had meant or you to have another set of teeth I would have fixed it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two times . ' So he said , bless His Holy Name ! " And through the length of his visit Ethel had to cools mush and soft food for him . But not once did she complain . She was always kind , polite , and even gentle-tempered with the old man . It got so he followed her about the place like a dog . " You do n't mind if I look at you , do you ? " he would ask . " No , " Ethel would reply . " ' Cause you 're the purtiest piece of flesh I ever popped eyes on . Just make my mouth water like bananas . " And nearly every day he would say to Alvin , " I 'll declare you got the prize jewel of ' em all , Alvin , the keystone of the temple 's top . " As the second week of his visit came around and he showed no signs of leaving , Ethel began to rebel against the hardship of his presence . But still she never let on by word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonder and joy to her every minute of the day , though secretly she complained bitterly to Alvin . " You got to get him out of the house , " she would say . " I ca n't .1:111d him another minute . " " And I ca n't hardly , either , " Alvin would mutter . " I reckon the other children are plumb sick to death , too , having to support him . Golly ! " he would go on in a voice of self-reproach , " ai n't that a way for a man to talk about his own daddy ? " At the end of the second week Ethel told Alvin she was going to Dunston . Cousin Molly had written and invited her down again for Thanksgiving . " You ca n't do that , " he said . " Yes , but I can . Maybe if I leave for a while your pa will decide to go back to Irving . " " But I do n't want you to go , just the same . " " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't we head over heels grading our tobacco and getting it ready for the market ? " " But yesterday you said you 'd be through in another week or two . " " And then there 's the washing and the ironing and the cooking . " " Yes , I know , Alvin , " she replied , laying her hand on his arm . " I may seem quiet and easy to you , but sometimes I almost want to scream  --  want to run out there in the yard and just scream as loud as I can . " Why , what 's the matter ? " " Now you ask that . Let me go . " " I do n't want you to , " he returned doggedly . But just the same she went , as he deep down knew she would . And he was left alone with the old man on his hands . But in the rush of work ahead of him he had little time to bother with him . Len came out to the pack-house and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripped with the weals trembles , he could make no headway with a job too new for him . Finally , when he 'd suffered to the limit under Alvin 's botched cooking , he whimperingly announced that he was going back to Irving . And the next day he rode off as he had come , with the patient mailman . Ethel 's absence was not so hard to bear this time as formerly it had been , for nearly every other night Alvin was on the way to the tobacco market . The price was medium and as yet he had not dared add up the possible total of his earnings for the year . He was hoping that the abundance of his crop would more than make up for the lack in price . And he was busy night and day hurrying Matt and the Beasley children on like an Egyptian master of old . At the end of the week Ethel returned all dressed out in finery .   " Where 'd you get that ? " he said , his heart suddenly ablaze at her beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her things . She said she did n't peal ' em . " " Nell that was nice of her , " he grudgingly acknowledged . " Yes , it was . How 's everything been ? " she said , giving him a clang kiss and beginning to unfasten her hatpin . " We 're getting along well as common , honey , " he answered . ' lie price ai n't so good , but we 're making a lot of weight . " " " That 's fine , " she said as she gave a swift appraising look to herIce in the mirror . By the first week in December he had finished selling his crop , anal sitting by the fire at night he added up the results with dismal conclusions . Well , there was no help for it . And so the next day he went wearily down to the bank . Mr. Collins bored holes all through him with his eyes , and Mr. McKay said nine hundred dollars did n't seem to be enough . " No , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just have to make it a thousand before we can carry you for another year . " " But I do n't see how I can do it , " Alvin answered despairingly . " I 've got a mule to pay for . " " How much do you owe on her ? " " Two hundred and fifty dollars . " " Well , who do you owe it to ? " " Mr. Thompson in Dunston . " " Pay him part of it . " And then he went on kindly , " You 've got n few more days yet , see what you can do . " And when Alvin had gone with bent shoulders out of the bank , Mustaches said to Black Eyes , " I reckon we can give him another year . " " Yes , I suppose we can . " " For it 'll all be to the good , anyhow . " " Yes , that 's the pity of it . " " Hah-hah-hah ! the pity of it . " " Yes , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the next " And there wo n't be any island in your great sea of acres . " P36o " No , none at all , " said Black Eyes , as he called Miss Morris to come and take a letter to that insurance company . " " Them fellows are kind of cantankerous to deal with , up there in New York , " said Mustaches . " Yes , we use enough postage to pay the interest on a consider able sum . " " And , Lord ! what a whale of a refinancing fee they slapped on us . " " But we 'll have to pay it , " sighed Black Eyes . " All right , Miss Morris . Dear Sir : In reference to account Al23479 , we beg to say that we herewith inclose our check for --  " Alvin began the find-the-thimble game in his efforts to ferret out every nickel from any possible hiding-place . With a heavy heart he got up one morning and drove his young cow over to Mr. Ham Urquhart 's and delivered her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like losing one of the family , for how many nighty . had he leaned his forehead in her soft side and drained her flowing ' ' udder of two gallons of rich , creamy milk . And when he turned away she mooed softly after him . And then he brutally put the butcher knife to the throat of the six-months calf and hawked the tender meat around among the houses in Linnyville . After than when the first bitterly cold day came he rose before dawn , built a huge fire around the washpot , fixed up the scalding-barrel , and set about slaughtering his four shoats . And in the late blue of the ' afternoon he took the gleaming bodies down , wrapped them in clean paper , placed them in the wagon , and drove off to the market in the village . And next it was his dry cordwood , which he had hoped to use for tobacco-curing the coming year . Front house to house he went with the loads . " Good morning , ma'am . I 've got some mighty good oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be sold , he took the money down to the bank and laid it on the lip of the cashier 's window . And the quick blue-veined hand of Miss Morris came quickly out like a snake 's head and whipped it in . With a pitiful piece of paper in return which said , " Received of Alvin Barnes on account one thousand dollars , " he went back home . Ethel hadP361%N itched this stripping away of their lives in silence , for now in her mind a definite plan was shaping itself . But she said nothing to Alvin about it . That night as he sat before the fire , smoothing the crumpled bills on his knee and stacking up the bits of silver on the table to see how much he had left to pay on his mule , she sat sewing away and looking at the fire . " There 's a hundred and four dollars here , " he said . " God knows where I 'm going to get another dollar . " And then he sat clown to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " How do you spell dear , ' Ethel ? " " D e a r . " " Dear Mr. Tompson , Seems like I just ca n't pay you all for the Mack mule this year . I am only able to pay but a hundred dollars . "  --  " How do you spell hunderd ' Ethel ? " " Hundred . " " Say , you write it for me . " " But why do n't you go down there to see Mr. Thompson ? Fxplain it to him . Maybe he would carry you over . " " Hah ! " Alvin said with a grim laugh . " I 'm too slick for that . If I showed up down there with the mule , saying I were n't able to pay , why , what would he do ? Go out there boys , ' he 'd say , ' unhitch the mule and put her back to the stable . '  --  No sir , I 'm going to write to him . "  --  " I hope Mr. Tompson you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell Tompson ' ? " " T h o m p s o n . Why , he would n't do that , " she went on . " If he did it would be all to your advantage . Look , you 've had the mule for a year . Do you think he 'd take her back ? It would mean you 've had all that work out of her for nothing . " " Yeh , maybe that 's right , " Alvin answered , and the pencil Mopped in midair . " Yeh , you got more sense than I have about it . I le 'll sure take the hundred dollars and give me another year . I 'll drive down there in the morning and see him . " The next morning she was up early as he was , and soon had breakfast ready . " I thought I 'd go with you , " she said . " Well  --  " he hesitated . " There 's nothing here to look after , " she hurried on . " That 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cow 's gone , the calf 's gone , they ai n't no pigs to feed , I reckon the chickens can scratch for themselves . All right , come along . " Later when he had left her at Cousin Molly 's boarding-house he went over to see Mr. Thompson . Ethel was right . The liver'ystableman grouched a bit about having to accept such short paYment , but there was no help for it . " Anyhow , I 'll expect the full balance next year . " " And I 'll surely be able to take care of it , Mr. Thompson . " " I hear good things about you , young man , " he went on . " Everybody says you pay your debts . And let me tell you that 's a virtue in these days . " When he got back to Cousin Molly 's place , Ethel was standing in the front room before a mirror , and Cousin Molly was fitting a new dress around her with her plump beringed fingers . " Ai n't she the purtiest thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and admiring her handiwork . Ethel blushed and patted her hair with delicate , self-conscious gestures . " Hah-hah ! shows my good taste , " he laughed vacuously . Then he sat down in his chair and presently fell to brooding , filled with gnawing , unpleasant thoughts . Here was his own wife , a queen among women , having to get her clothes and things from somebodybesides her husband . How differently he had planned in the days back there when he was courting her . In his foolish mind he had imagined all sorts of riches and wonders that he would lavish upon her . And what had he brought to her ? Nothing but poverty and hard work . No , you could n't blame her for wanting to come down here to Cousin Molly where her beauty was apprcciatedand something could be done about it . And yet the sight of her being arrayed in fine garments , while his house and barn had been denuded to desolation and he himself went dressed in an old slick checkered suit that long ago should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . " I reckon we better go , Ethel , " he said , suddenly , trying to control the tremble in his voice . Then Cousin Molly turned her two hundred pounds swiftly upon him . " That reminds me , Alvin , I wanted to talk with you about something . Sit down , Ethel . " Ethel took her seat , folded her handsP363demurely in her lap , and Cousin Molly stood between them . " Now , children , I know you 're having a hard time . I know what hard times are ; I 've had ' em myself . Always have . Anybody that makes a living running a boarding-house do n't lie on no feather bed of joy . I say that to you , Alvin , because I want you to understand u hat I mean when I say I want Ethel to stay down here awhile . " And snapping her voice off with her strong slightly whiskered lips , she looked pleasantly at Alvin . " I do n't know what you mean , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , if she 'll take it . " " She has ? " And still his voice was under control . " Yes , I have , Alvin , " Ethel spoke up brightly , " and there 's good pay in it , too . " " That there is , " Cousin Molly adjured . " There 's fifty dollars between now and Christmas . She can board with me . It wo n't cost her a penny . Now do n't say she ca n't , Alvin , for I know you need money . " The reference to money settled it as far as Alvin was concerned . She was reproaching him again for his poverty , and by God ! that was none of her business . " No , she ca n't stay , " he said . " Now look here , Alvin  --  " the elder woman began kindly . " No ; she ca n't stay . " He shook his head in grim finality . " But I want to . I want to more than anything , " Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she childishly took refuge in the strength of the stout Cousin Molly . " But you ca n't do it , Ethel , " he argued , and now a vehement , harsh note was creeping into his voice . " I got to have somebody up there to help me out . There 's all kinds of things to do . In a few days now I 've got to begin to get the plant-beds ready for next year . " " But it wo n't be but a few weeks , Alvin . " " Yeh , a few weeks , a few weeks . If you added together all the weeks you 've been off the last year or two you 'd find it a considerableamount . " " I 'm not always wanting to get off , am I ? " " But it 's different , Alvin , " Cousin Molly said , still keeping her poise and determination . " You 're crazy about farming and Ethel'snot . " Yeh , that 's just it , " and his voice dropped a tone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of our business , she 'd get so she 'd like it . She did last summer awhile . " And now Cousin Molly was beginning to get her dander til ) . " That 's what you thought . She was brave and hard-working and tried her best to please you , and the more she did the more you exacted of her . If she did what you wanted her to do she 'd soon be nothing but a scarecrow , a thing of skin and bones , something you would n't look at . " " Come on , Ethel , " he said . " No , I want to stay . " And she sat in her chair , but now her quiet hands had begun to twist themselves nervously together . " Yeh ! " he snapped . " You do n't tell me who 's giving her that job . No , you do n't , but I know . It 's over there in Boyd Collins ' drug store . Well , if you two ai n't got no shame about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working around that fellow . Do you hear me ? " And suddenly flooded with his grandfather 's old temper , he strode over to Ethel and took her roughly by the shoulder . She jerked loose from him , and then , as if angered beyond endurance , he snatched the dress with a great tearing sound from her body , and she stood trembling in her shift before him . Cousin Molly stepped between them , her face flushed with anger . " You 're not going to treat her like that in my house . Hear me ? And you can just step out of that door right this minute . " " I 'm not going till she comes . " And now the deadly anger that shook in his frame gradually turned his lips white as a sick man 's . For a moment he stood so , and then , pushing Cousin Molly roughly out of the way , he grasped Ethel fiercely by the arm . " Come on , " he hissed . " No , no , " she cried , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh ! you 're breaking my arm , Alvin ! " she sobbed . Cousin Molly ran to the door . " Henry , Henry , " she called , and her puffy , sluggish husband came in from the other room where he had been sitting by the fire. 1f " What 's the trouble in here ? " he asked as he stretched his great pole-like arms above his head and yawned . " This is Alvin Barnes here  --  Ethel 's husband , " Cousin Molly said . " And he 's trying to play the wife-beater . She wants to stay and he 's going to pull her off , he says . But I reckon he 's not . I 've stood on my rights and ordered him to leave . " " Well , young man , if I 's you , I would n't cross Molly , " he yawned . " She 'd like as not have the police on you for creating a disturbance or something . " " I will that , " she snapped . " If he starts beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find himself peeping through the bars , and I 'll tell the world he 'll stay there till he learns how to behave himself . " " All right , all right , " Alvin snarled . And flinging Ethel from him , he started from the room . She tumbled , crashing over a chair , fell against the sofa , and lay there in a heap . " You 've killed her ! You 've killed her ! " Cousin Molly squealed as she ran forward and lumbered herself down on the floor beside IEthel . And now Alvin was down on his knees hugging Ethel in his arms and murmuring : " Honey , honey , I did n't mean to hurt you . lord a-mercy ! I would n't hurt you for nothing in the world . " And presently Ethel sat up and then began to laugh and cry hysterically . " Get on out of here . Leave her alone . You 'll run her crazy , " Cousin Molly shrilled . " Yeh , I 'm going , I 'm going , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dairen all of you , every one of you ! I 'm going . " And with that lie slammed his way out of the house , and the whole building shook and the window panes rattled in their frames . As he went through the yard gate , he flung it behind him with such force that one of the hinges broke and it hung sagging down . Hurrying up to the livery-stable , he hitched his mule to the buggy and drove wildly out of town towards the west . And now the goad of evil , bitter days came down upon him ,   hooking and harrowing him half to madness . There alone in lit , little house he cooked his meals , flung his clothes about , and arc out of the same dishes day after day , like any poor-white Barnes that ever lived . And out in the fields he tore through his work like a maniac , flailing down the brown cotton stalks and chopping the dead tobacco sprouts savagely with his hoe . And with his brier hook he reaped the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , bleary and cold as the senile face of an old man , stared mockingly at him from the south . And yet with all this flagellation of labor , the hunger for Ethel never died down . Rathcr it increased as the weeks went by . Sometimes at night he would hug the pillow against him , and the dream that it was her white body stretched against his woke him up to gnawing futile rage and he would beat the bed with his clenched fist . " I ca n't , I ca n't stand it , " he would groan . Then rising , he would tramp about the house , and often would dress himself and by the faint starlight seize his hoe and start working in the fields . And gradually that old gnawing wooden feeling appeared in the back of his head . he would heat the flat iron and try to sleep with his neck against it , but it never eased the pain . His eyes grew bloodshot and wide at the corners , and once or twice he was assailed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours he would lie through the night , seeing pictures of old man Dewar and hearing his talk . And now all the names of the trees and the flowers , and all the deep wise sayings of that dark prophet rose to the surface of his thought . His visit to Fayetteville , Spike Boy and Rosa , and now Gracie Byrd , and his pa and ma and all the children and the hound dog Dooshie , and Bull Cox and Rassie , and Mary Belle talking to him : " Keep your head up , Alvin , face towards the rising sun . Do n't let ' em sink you in the lonesome low "  --  all mixed and turmoiled in his mind . The next day he would drag himself exhausted from his bed , grub and plow for hours , getting his land ready for tobacco planting . And still his hunger for Ethel increased  --  hunger for woman , woman ! Like many a poor monk beset by visions of Aphrodite , Thais or Magdalene , Alvin 's imaginationrioted with a thousand unthinkable delights that lurked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afraid of what he might do  --  to some woman that passed in the lane  --  yes . Sometimes Matt 's Negro sisters worked out there in the fields , and if  --  Great ( god ! who knows , he might go out there some day and mount one of them like a bull . " I must be going crazy , " he groaned as he beat his head with his fists . Then he thought of Rosa and Fayetteville and the bottle of liquor . That was it . Liquor would help him  --  liquor . And going down to the dispensary in Linnyville , he bought a quart of liquor and brought it home . He drank half of it without taking his lips from the bottle and then lay down on the floor . A few minutes later he rose and drank again , and later still again. finally he flung the empty bottle crashing through the window . The sound of the breaking glass seemed to infuriate him . Whirling around the room , he snatched out drawers from the dresser , smashed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then sent his boot flying through the mirror . Springing on the bed , he broke it down , jerked the curtains from the wall , and staggering into the parlor , fell at full length on the floor . The next day the boy Matt and his father Purge came by to get some tools to work on the tobacco bed . They knocked and knocked , but nobody answered . Looking through the window , they saw Alvin lying stretched out like a dead man . They finally made their way in through the kitchen and lifted him up . And when they had washed his face with cold wet cloths they finally woke him , and got him onto the sofa , where he sat with his head bent over in his hands . " Mith-ta Alvin , Mith-ta Alvin , " Matt called anxiously . But Alvin made no reply . " He 'll be all right now , " said Purge wisely . " He must a-had a spell or something . No , leave him alone , Matt . " And the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa . It is Christmas Eve and the lights are shining bright in Cousin Molly 's house where a party is going on . Laughter and the chatter of young people 's voices come through the windows and scatter tip and down the street . Presently the noise dies down and the sound of a piano is heard . And now rising above it , Ethel 's fresli voice is heard singing : " Just a-wearying for you , All the time a-feeling blue  --  " Suddenly there is a loud crash at the front of the house . The young people in the parlor spring up , frightened . The door of the hall bursts open as Alvin , disheveled and bareheaded , his hair tangled by the wind and his coat off , comes striding into the room . With a swift glance around out of his bloodshot eyes , he hurries toward Ethel and with one arm sweeps her , white-faced , from the piano stool . " I reckon you 'll go home now , " he gasps . " I reckon I 'll carry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , no , " she calls frantically to her friends , who are standing by horror-stricken . " Boyd ! Boyd ! " she calls , and as if suddenly wakened to life Boyd Collins grabs the poker from the fireplace . Springing into the hall , he steps in front of Alvin . " You turn her loose , " he warns , his black eyes beginning to shine . " Get out of the way ! " Alvin snarls . And with that he drops Ethel and makes for Boyd , who strikes him a glancing blow witli the poker . Then Alvin chases him around into the dining-room and back into the hall again . The furniture is thrown crashing about , and the young people flee from the house with frightened cries . Cousin Molly leans out of the window and calls , " Help ! help ! " and her husband comes flip-flapping down the stairs in his carpet slippers and goes weaving up and down the hall , calling , " Stop it , Alvin , stop it . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a blow on the side of the face that knocks him down . Then bending over him he chokes him till he is blue as a huckleberry , and lifting his body , flings it crashing through the window . Then he turns back and stands at the foot of the steps . " Ethel ! Ethel ! " his voice bellows through the house . " Where  --  " But the sentence is unfinished , for the lead-loaded butt of a policeman'sbilly has come down on his head with a thud . And through his splintered mind he sees the approaching shadow of the world 's nightmare , vast and black as the enfolding wings of death itself . P369It WAS three o'clock in the morning and the cook 's alarm clockhad just sent its shrill clanging sound through the wire inclosure , in the center of which a circus-like tent was silhouetted against the stars . And then from within the huge tent came the first rattle of the chain , a cold , clammy , clanking sound . And now another rattle , and still a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually stirring its body in sections . Then from a little tent down near the road came a high call . " Guard Number One ! " From the lower corner of the wire inclosure a sleepy answer came back , " All right . " " Guard Number Two ! " " Okay , Cap'n . " " Guard Number Three . " " All well . " " Guard Number Four ! " " Yes , sir . " And then a light was struck in a little shack placed in the corner f the stockade , and presently the pungent smell of burning lightoodpervaded the night air . The door to the shack now swung pen and in the lighted interior two men could be seen as they went about the duties of cooking , one of them hacking off great labs of fat-back , the other one mixing corn dough in a great dishpan . Across the faint smooth gray light which was beginning 0 show in the east two men with guns on their shoulders couldseen entering a gate down at the left and approaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lantern swinging from ne of the ridge-poles lighted up the scene . Two rows of bunks , hree tiers deep , ran along either side of the tent , with an aisle in the center . And here and there from the bunks the faces of the- convicts , black and white , showed sleepy , haggard , and worn . And to the main chain which threaded the bunks on either side of the   aisle their feet were fastened by smaller chains . And the two guards went from bunk to bunk , unlocking the shackles with deft cool-clicking sounds . " All right , let 's get going , " they were saying . And now like kennel of chained dogs the convicts turned and wiggled themselves - about . The morning air suddenly became alive with the sounds iron against iron . As soon as they were unleashed , many of t convicts hurried to the middle of the aisle where a row of to had been placed for toilets and around which the mosquitoes , flies , and other insects had droned all night under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not busy sucking blood fro the stretched-out bodies in the bunks . And when the convicts had relieved themselves into the tub with loud and vulgar noises , th all were herded out of the tent and around a barrel placed near the wire fence . They dipped up water in their cupped hands a washed themselves in turn . One of the cooks suddenly stuck h head out of the shack and yelled into the darkness , " Greas greasy ! " And the group of ghostly figures shuffled avidly toward two big G. I. cans which had been wheeled out of the shack . " Line up ! Line up ! " said the guard , and the men moved forwa one by one . Receiving a pan and a spoon from the cook , the would hold it out for a dipper of grits , then pass on to the secon cook to receive a generous portion of fat-meat and a hunk of co bread . And immediately after they scattered around and squattdownon the ground in separate and hungry aloofness like do. , afraid they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as they devoured their food , the boss man ca from the direction of his tent and stood off to one side , talking the guard out of hearing of the convicts . And crammed down i the cuff of his leather boot was the hard snake-like form of Old , Jeff , as the convict lash was called . And Guard Number One was saying to the Captain , " There ' two of ' em this morning . " " Spike Boy ? " asked Guard Number Two . " Aha-a , Spike Boy , " said the Captain . " You said him , didn ' you ? " he asked the first guard . " Yeh , he could n't keep the dirt on his shovel yistidday . "   " 1 Ic thinks its a picnic , " the Captain said . " Yeh , a barbecue . " " It ai n't no barbecue , " said Guard Number One . " I fell ! it ai n't that at all , " said Guard Number Two. " 1 fe thinks he 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft  --  too pinch sap and water in him . " " Brass knucks and a corkscrew knife ai n't hard , " said Guard Number One with a low laugh . " Baby 's toys , " laughed the Captain. " lie 's a bad actor , all right , " said Guard Number Two . " Well , we 're going to try to make a good actor out of him , " id the Captain pleasantly as he went over to where the dark forms were squatted about on the ground , each one scraping the last of his food out of his pan . " Good morning , good morning , " the Captain said in the cheery manner of a schoolmaster addressing his pupils . " Good morning , Cap'n . " " Morning , Cap'n , " came the eager , subservient greetings of the scattered eaters . Stopping above one of the crouched-down men , he called out In his easy voice , " How goes it , Spike ? " Spike Boy 's face was suddenly tilted up and lighted by the approaching dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . " Me and the bedbugs put up an awful fight last night , Captain . " And at that a scattered staccato burst of crackling laughter fired off among the convicts . And then the stillness of death caught them and nothing was licard but the scrape , scrape , of the pewter spoons in the bottoms of the pan as the Captain said kindly , " Well , maybe we 'll be able to fix you up a private room some of these days , Spike . " And the smile died out on Spike Boy 's face and he was silent like the others , except for the scrape , scrape of his spoon . Even such a casual reference as this to the sweat-box struck horror to every man 's soul . " And how are you this morning , son ? " the Captain asked as he stopped by a little hundred-pound runt of a nigger squatted on his haunches . The Runt , as he was called , teetered back and forth lilac a rocking-horse as he struggled to make his tongue speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cap'n , " he finally stuttered . " Got anything to complain of ? " " No , suh , no , suh , Cap'n ; everything 's fine . " " Seem like yesterday your little Georgy buggy needed grcas. ing , huh ? " " I kept dat wheelbarrow rolling from sun to sun , Cap'n , fro sun to sun . " " Yeh , seemed like the wheel got stuck every once in a while an would n't turn , " the Captain continued blandly . " Please , suh , just watch me today , Boss , you just watch me , the Runt panted , dragging his grimy striped sleeve across 11 ' forehead where the sweat had begun popping out . " Yeh , guess we 'll have to grease it for you , son , the first thin you know , " and the Captain stood there looking down at him , half-affectionate smile on his swarthy face . The Captain was a worthy sample of his type  --  a roan about s ' feet tall , slightly inclining to stoutness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wanted to , but usually had the blood chilling quality of steel in it . He wore a well-trimmed , grayis military mustache , his nose was wide-nostriled , and his face s with two gray eyes , the pupils of which were usually half-hid b drooping lids . But when the Captain was angry or meant busine , these lids would snap back like the hinged flaps of a box , leavin two protruding eye-balls that gleamed forked devils at a man . The Runt climbed to his feet and started towards the cookhouse with his pan . But his trembling hands could n't hold it . It fell and rolled along the ground . The Captain whirled towards him , his. , eyes blazing . And his voice snapped in the air like the crack of fl , a whip . " Get that God-damned slobber-bowl out of the dirt ! " And the terrified Runt flung himself wildly upon it . Now the Captain blew his whistle , and the prisoners beganP373lining up . By now it was light enough to shoot , as the saying was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail was called off and three men accompanied by a guard went into the tent and began to haul the tubs of excrement nut to the edge of the stockade , where they emptied them into a hole which had been dug in the ground and which stood open day and night for the flies and insects to dabble in . And now the row of a hundred and twenty men stood stretched across the stockade  --  men of all shapes and sizes , young boys , young men , middle-aged men and one or two old fellows , morean half of whom were Negroes . And the Captain went slowly own the line , looking at them . When he came to Spike Boy he touched him on the shoulder and said , " Step out , son . " " No , no , Captain , " Spike Boy gasped , his face turning white as ash wood . " Yeh , step out , son , " the Captain insisted kindly . " But I been doing all right , Cap'n . They ai n't been any complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept my wheelbarrow turning , all the time turning , all the time turning . " " Step out , son . " Guard Number One came up and poked him in the side with the muzzle of his Springfield forty-five , and Spike Boy moved two paces forward and stood swaying like a tree about to fall . " That 's a good boy , " the Captain said . And then as he approached the Runt the little skinny Negro began trembling and the breath was sucked into his consumptive lungs with a whistling sound . The Captain stopped and looked at him , and a groan burst from the Negro 's blistered lips . " Cap'n , Cap'n , " he whispered . " You look like you need some medicine , son . " " Yessuh , I 's sick , sick , Cap'n , " and the whitish palm of his bony hand went up against his throat and fumbled desperately at his wide-open blouse . " And what about the man you killed , son , " the Captain said , " when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Lord a-mercy ! " the Runt murmured . Then , as the Captain moved on , a broken sigh of relief escaped him . He stag- gered and would have fallen if the tall giant of a young fellow had n't held him up  --  a young fellow with a drawn hard face and great hollow , burning eyes  --  Alvin J. Barnes , number 6250. ' 1 Captain went on down to the end of the line and then turn around , and pulling Old Jeff out of his boot top , doubled it 111 ) is his right hand as he came marching back . The Captain 's name w Huff , and according to the reports among the convicts he had one been a bad man himself . It was reported that he killed two Negro . somewhere farther south , and had been sentenced to be hangc  --  for a crime against a white woman , but he never had been . The last nigger he killed had put up a fierce battle , and during the sera had bitten the third and fourth fingers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now held the whip .

And then beckoning to a Negro murderer , a huge brute weig ing two hundred and fifty pounds , he told him to go over an help hold Spike Boy 's head on the ground . Then he called o another stout prisoner , " Hey you Pearly Gates , look to his feet . " Cap'n , Cap'n , " Spike Boy begged . " Do n't call on me , " the Captain snarled . " You better call o the Lord . " Then the steely notes chuckled through his lips . " Ye I bet I do make you call on the Lord . Unbutton your pants , so Do n't let me tell you thrice as the Son of God said to the rooster . And then with a wild and desperate look around at the eart , and sky , and with a sudden vague gesture toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the red daw Spike slowly began to undo his trousers . And then without a wore ' he lay down on the ground and put his face in the dirt . The bi : Negro crouched at his head , and Pearly Gates crouched at h ' heels . The Captain kept smoothing Old Jeff in his hand a while , and then rising suddenly on his toes brought it down with a whistling tearing sound across the white hillocks of Spike 's naked rump . The prone body bounded from the ground like a rubber ball , and the Negro and white man suddenly flung themselves on Spike and held him . At this first blow a gust of horror seemed toP375sweep the convicts and they wavered back and forth like fennelstalks harassed by a wind , and then stood still as death . Neither ate first blow nor the second did Spike Boy cry out , but when the third struck across the two already gaping bloody wounds , aild hysterical scream burst from his lips and the dry dust rose in little puffy clouds before his labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six ! " the Captain intoned . And blow after blow fell with their red-hot branding pain . Spike prayed , he called , he begged like a child , and from the fifteenth to the twentieth blow his sobs were low and whimpering , ke a baby crying itself to sleep . And then at twenty-one , twentyo , and twenty-three the animal screams tore from his body gain . And then twenty-four , twenty-five , twenty-six , twentyven , twenty-eight , twenty-nine , and the piteous , helpless , whimcringof the baby continued , rising now , then sinking , sinking as f to sleep . And all the while the great Negro murderer who held hike 's head down in the dirt stared at the tattered pieces of bloody buttocks with a sickened hypnotic gaze . And the white than who held his feet bit his lip until a little ooze of blood seeped  --  round the edges of his teeth . The twenty-nine blows prescribed by the sovereign laws of the state for unruly prisoners now being finished , the Captain folded his whip and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he turned to the terror-stricken Runt , who by this time had to be held by two extra guards , summoned with their rifles by the sound of the whipping . But the terrible Old Jeff suddenlyinspired Runt with demoniac strength , and breaking loose from the two guards he fled wildly about the inclosed stockade . One of the guards raised his gun to shoot , but the Captain gently advised him not to . When finally they had cornered the cowering Negro and handcuffed him , they brought him out to receive his due . And the Captain made a little talk to Runt . " According to statute number 3422 , section 8 , I 'm told , as duly passed and entered in the House of Representatives by a vote of ninety-six to four , said law having to do with what is known as Black Maria , otherwise the sweat-box , I am hereby authorized to fit you into it , Runt . " And then he smiled and continued , " I have tried to beatP317the family were at work in the mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin , and then wiped away his tears at the sight of Ethel . But when he began to tell Alvin about how Annie had suffered and wanted him there , he wept afresh . And Alvin sat feeling shamed and miserable and said nothing . Pretty soon the noon whistle blew and Rob Roy , Grangie , and Sarah , came in . They had changed greatly since Alvin had seen them . Sarah and Rob Roy had grown stoop-shouldered , and Grangie had developed the nervous habit of blinking his eyes . They all stood around whispering at Ethel 's beauty and clothes , and Alvin could tell from the snickers that rose from the corner where Rob Roy and Grangie sat , that they were thinking of Ethel in a way they should n't . Lie felt his old temper rising in him and wished he could get up and leave . But Ethel seemed to be enjoying herself . She was gracious and kind and talked to old Len as if she had a real interest in his welfare . " Yes , " Alvin heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidneys is plumb gone . Ai n't able to work no more  --  just set here by the fire , just set here and wait . And now the Lord has afflicted me with his merciful hands and I am brought down desolate in the loss of my helpmeet . " And once more he began to weep . " Yes , it 's bad , Mr. Barnes , " Ethel agreed kindly . " But you 're still a young man and the first thing you know you 'll be out walking around and enjoying the sunshine and the air again . " " No , no , " he whined . " I 'll be carried out of that door feet foremost . And I wo n't be feeling the sunshine and the air or nothing when it happens , neither . " " Aw , Pa , " Alvin said with some irritation , " you 'll live to be a hundred . " " Yeh , " the old man spoke up , " I remember you coming down there from Mr. Byrd 's house to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Well , where is she now ? Gone down into the Valley of the Shadow of Death . " It was on Alvin 's lips to say that he had helped send her there , but he beat back the words and kept silent . Then , as if suddenly forgetting his own woes , Len turned to Alvin and said , " I hear you bought you a place up there , and stepping right on up in the world . " And then he winked slyly . " You sure have stepped in one direction , " and with a jerk of his thumb he indicated Ethel 's bright form . At that Rob Roy and Grangie snickered , and , emboldened by their fun , Len mouthed from behind his palm , " The night work must be a little heavy on you , judging from your looks . " And now the two brothers guffawed out loud . " I reckon we better be going , Ethel , " Alvin said as he rose . " We got a long ways to travel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to speak to you on a private matter . " And his face set itself back into its poorhouse mould . " Yeh , I know what it is , Pa , and I brung you something , " and with that Alvin handed him a crumpled ten-dollar bill . " Thanky , thanky , Alvin , " and Len rose also , bent over like a question mark . Then with a squeal of pain he put his hands to his back and sank down again . " My back 's a-killing of me , " he groaned . Ethel went up to him and spoke kindly again and told him how sorry she was that he was sick and she hoped he 'd be better the next time they came , and she was sure he would be . " Do n't try to do any work ; just rest , " she said . " And you-all come to see us sometime , " she concluded . " Well , I 'm glad to hear that , " Len whined . " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of my children in covering my gray head . " This distasteful thought had occurred to Alvin before , but he showed nothing in his impassive face . " Well , we 'll see about it , Pa , when the time comes , " he said . " Take care of yourself , you-all , " and with that he took Ethel by the arm and they walked down to the buggy . As he helped her in he looked back and saw the whole family clustered in the doorway , and Rob Roy and Grangie were whispering ; and suddenly Alvin understood their impolite behavior . Ethel 's beauty had made them suspicious . " Great God ! " he muttered to himself as he untied Maggie from the post . " They think she 's like  --  like , well , one of them fast women just ' cause she 's purty to look at . Yeh , to think of them having such dirty thoughts and she so nice and fine to them , taking an interest in Pa 's bellyache and all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the buggy.
