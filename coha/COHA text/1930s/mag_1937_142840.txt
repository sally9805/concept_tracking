With another bathing-suit season at hand , local lawmakers are aiming their ordinances at males on the score of topless suits* rather than at underclad females . A five-year-old male bathing lawsuit came to trial last week in Chicago but an alleged lower exposure , not an upper , had started it . And though the fight was between two-lawyers , the only persons hurt were three policemen . <P> One Sunday in August 1932 , Lawyer Timothy D. Hurley was sunning himself in his swimsuit on a public beach on the Michigan lakefront in Evanston . Lawyer Lynn A. Williams , one of several property holders whose beach joined the public sands , was passing out little printed cards inviting people to move off the private onto the public part of the beach . He had just handed cards to two pretty young women when he noticed Lawyer Hurley . " I was shocked . I told him he could n't lie there like that . But he kept lying with his head on the sand looking at the sky . So I called the police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , booked him on charges of indecent exposure . He was acquitted . <P> Last week Lawyer Hurley , suing Lawyer Williams and the three policemen for $25,000 damages for his arrest , put on his 1932 bathing suit , sploshed water on it , sprawled on the floor in Judge William J. Lindsay 's Superior Courtroom in Chicago . The jury giggled and gaped , deliberated 95 minutes , decided in favor of Lawyer Williams but assessed $100 damages against the three policemen who had defaulted by not appearing . <P> *Police will arrest for topless suits in Atlantic City , St. Louis , Minneapolis , St. Paul , Syracuse , N. Y. , Toledo , Galveston , El Paso , Springfield , Mass. , Birmingham , Evansville , Ind. , Baltimore .
