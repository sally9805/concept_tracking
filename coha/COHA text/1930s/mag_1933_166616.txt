Some customers are always trying to cheat the insurance companies , complained delegates to the American Life Convention in Chicago last week . Some cheat by committing suicide , some by hiding disabilities from which they soon die . Insurance company doctors by keeping alert may detect many a disease-hiding applicant . As for suicides , which have steadily increased throughout the world , Frederick Ludwig Hoffman who has been studying the statistics for Prudential Insurance Co. last week suggested more preventive organizations like the National Save-a-Life League and Vienna 's Advisory Centre for Those Weary of Life ( TIME , Dec. 7 , 1931 ; June 13 , 1932 ) . Such organizations try to get jobs for would-be suicides , cheer up the wretched , cure the diseased . <P> In last week 's Spectator ( insurance tradepaper ) Dr. Hoffman presented his annual review of U. S. suicides . In 1932 , he estimated , 23,000 people killed themselves and another 33,000 tried to do so . Popular methods were illuminating gas ( most popular ) , jumping from buildings and bridges , hanging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 cities in 1932 was 21.3 per 100,000 population which has been surpassed in all U. S. history only by the 21.5 rate of 1908 , a post-panic year . Since 1923 , when the rate was 14.8 , there has been no remission in the incidence of U. S. suicides . The rate was 17.9 for 1928 ; 18.1 for 1929 ; 19.9 for 1930 ; 20.5 for 1931 . Davenport , Iowa , had the highest city rate ( 50.3 ) last year . Of the nation 's five largest cities , Los Angeles at 28.8 had the highest rate . Commented Dr. Hoffman : " Just as there is a concentration of homicide deaths in the South , there is apparently a concentration of suicide deaths on the Pacific Coast . Year after year the Pacific Coast cities show higher rates as to which no satisfactory explanation has yet been forthcoming . "
