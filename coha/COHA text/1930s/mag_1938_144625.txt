Prolific , 34-year-old Oliva Dionne , of Callander , Ont. , has long pouted over the fact that he has little control over the welfare and fortunes of his famed five daughters , Yvonne , Emilie , Annette , Marie and Cecile . The Ontario Provincial Government has never been seriously concerned over the other seven living Dionne young , but has kept the Quintuplets in separate , guarded quarters . Last month Papa Dionne demanded a general inquiry by the Ontario Government into the handling of the Quintuplets ' affairs by strong-willed Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe , Judge J. A. Valin and Percy D. Wilson , his fellow members on the board of guardians . Premier Mitchell F. Hepburn flatly turned down Papa Dionne 's demand , allowed Dr. Dafoe to continue to exercise supreme authority over the Quintuplets ' health , permitted the girls ' education to be placed under Ontario 's Department of Education . <P> Last week , however , Papa Dionne was appeased . After an all-day conference between him and other guardians , an agreement was reached . The main provision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Quintuplets , under which all the Dionnes will be reunited . Said jubilant Papa Dionne after the conference : " That 's the first time I was given any satisfaction ! "
