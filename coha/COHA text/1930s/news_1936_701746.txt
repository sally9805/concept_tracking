txt Preparations should be made now for a building boom of almost predepression proportions to replace the hundreds of thousands of family units and the thousands of industrial and commercial units destroyed and outmoded since 1929 , R. G. Wallace , vice president of The Masonite Corp . manufacturers of fabricated pressed wood products , told the lumber and building material dealers of Milwaukee at their annual convention . The fear of further extension of government activity into low cost housing under the Public Works Administration , he declared , had abated since the administration made clear its position on housing activities for 1936 , and new plans , he added , probably would include the drawing of a definite and new line between public and private financing . " A healthy increase in home building is ahead , " he said . " Some of it will be aided by the various government plans but the math part will be due to private enterprise . The government has been very helpful to the building industry and by being so to the citizenry at large . We understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present time , and that this plan will simplify housing policies " Mr. Wallace said that the United States is six years behind in construction and that a safe prediction of building for 1936 would include approximately 200,000 family units , an increase of more than 100% over 1935 . " This , however , is far below normal . " he added . ' Before the golden days of prosperity we considered 500,000 units as our norm , but the combination of a steady increase in population and the changing trend toward modern design in both houses and apartments would have added much ' to this figure if conditions of 1926 to 1929 had continued . Many authorities think 750,000 to 1,000,000 units per year could well be built in 1936-1937.1938 without overbuilding . " He said he would suggest a goal of about $3,000,000,000 as the amount to be spent on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings during the year , with 50% or more increase in 1937 and another increase in 1938.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
