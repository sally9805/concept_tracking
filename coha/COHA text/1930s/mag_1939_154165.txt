Modern clubs are little more than two centuries old . They really got going in Queen Anne 's London , where men- usually impelled by politics-met regularly in coffeehouses and taverns . At the Whigs ' Kit-Cat Club , Addison and Congreve fellowshipped with statesmen and lords ; at the Tories ' Scriblerus , Swift and his friends forgathered . Before the 18th Century went out , London swarmed with clubs that , like Dr. Johnson 's immortal one , produced great conversation , or like White 's , Boodle 's and Brooks 's , witnessed some of the steepest gambling in history . <P> White 's , Boodle 's , Brooks 's still exist ; London 's Athenaeum Club is 115 years old . Manhattan 's Union Club is 103 , its Union League 76 . Last week , as bells rang in another year , another Manhattan club turned a corner , looked back sentimentally at its first half-century of life . Lest memory fail , it incorporated that half-century in book form. * <P> For years the great Edwin Booth was fired with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the summer of 1887 , with fellow-members of a yachting party , he got down to serious planning . During the next year Booth purchased a Manhattan house at 16 Gramercy Park , engaged Stanford White to remodel it , collected 46 charter members , and on the last night of the year , as first president of The Players , handed over the deed of No. 16 to Augustin Daly , the first vice-president . Next day Booth moved in , and for the five remaining years of his life The Players was his home . <P> In its 50 years , The Players has become one of the great Bohemian clubs of the world . Besides artists , all sorts and conditions of men have gained admittance- ambassadors and auctioneers , ornithologists and explorers , magicians and Presidents of the U. S. Actors have always formed a powerful minority . Only dramatic critics are excluded by rule-to avoid the possible embarrassment of having them run into actors they have panned . The long list of celebrated members includes Grover Cleveland , Mark Twain , Sir Henry Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Singer Sargent ( whose Edwin Booth hangs in the club ) , George Bellows , John Philip Sousa , Richard Mansfield , and the club 's three Presidents who followed Booth-Joseph Jefferson , John Drew and Walter Hampden . <P> In 50 years , faces have come and gone , but the club itself has remained much the same : its air of worn brown leather , almost unused elevator , ancient chandeliers , cluttered rooms , classic busts and beery mugs , walls crowded with faded photographs and playbills-an " old uncle of a house , " as Booth Tarkington described it . Still kept just as he left it- except that the bedsheets are said to be changed occasionally-is the room where Booth lived &; died . In tall wall-safes lie carefully preserved costumes and relics of Booth and other actors . <P> Relics of the past , too , are ubiquitous quotations from the Bard . One in the lavatory reads : <P> Nature her custom holds , <P> Let shame say what it will . <P> Year after year the same special occasions are celebrated-a repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a courtly reception to wives &; daughters and friends on Ladies ' Day , the only time women are admitted. *
