maintained , and what is the best climax , and how shall you release the tension , and let your audience down from the peak of agony ? Will a Broadway crowd stand for a tragic ending , in these days when America has solved all the problems and banished all troublesfrom the world ? Roger was the haughty genius , who would scorn the rules about " practical plays , " and make the public eat out of his hand . When you wrote a poem , you just wrote it , and the publisher did the rest ; you had only to read the proofs , and attend your literary tea , and lead out the publisher 's wife to the dance . But when you had written a play , it appeared that you were only at the beginning of your labors . You had to select a manager , the one with the most prestige and the most money ; you had to go to the great man 's apartment one evening and read it to him , and hear him tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wow , " but the last act was wrong , no audience would ever stand for such a " hard luck story . " You had to argue and wrangle , and finally lay down the law , either the manager would produce the play you had written , or he would produce some other writer 's play . The tormented man would almost weep , and say it would land hint in bankruptcy , or in the Potter 's field ; but finally the would throw up his hands and say he would do it for Roger Chilcote , but not for any other man on earth , not even Bernard Shaw . Then , the drawing up of a contract ! Roger , a Southern gentleman , would have used his last dime to pay a poker debt , or to entertain a friend in proper style ; but he avowed that this Island of Manhattan was inhabited by hyenas , and he entered in a spirit of gay scorn into the task of showing a Broadway theatrical producerwhat a poet could do in the way of looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had formed an organization which is the wonder of all the labor unions of the world . Roger had to do the job with no help save from other playwrights who told what had happened to them . The contract had to be rewritten twice , because each time the manager slipped in something which was n't supposed to be there . Finally Roger had the copying done by his own secretary , and set it down with the order : " Sign , or quit ! " And then , the casting of the play ! The sessions with charming young actresses , each of whom saw fortune fluttering its wings above her permanent wave . Each thought this play was written for her , because she had a heart story ; she had lived in a goldenp151jail , and perhaps was doing so still . Roger would bring home portfoliosof photographs and newspaper cuttings , and discuss them with the learned Jerry . One or two eager ladies came to the house , and Kip had to interview them ; also a couple of the male dolls  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Roger would come upstairs tearing his golden hair , telling how one of these handsome monsters had attempted to read a speech from the play , and by God , it was like surgery done with a butcher 's cleaver ! It was springtime when the dramatization was finished ; and Roger spent that summer in New York , because the play was going into rehearsal , and there was no detail he was willing to overlook . If you knew one art , you knew them all , Roger would say with his quiet assurance ; taste was organic  --  and to Kip Tarleton that sounded tremendously incomprehensible . The young hotel-clerk went to a workshop and saw pretty little toy sets , and heard obscure words about perspectives and vanishing points and lines of direction and movements of things which remainedentirely still so far as he could note . Also there were problems of color , which , oddly enough , were never spoken of by eye-words but invariably by ear-words  --  tones and harmonies and intervals and so on . He listened to Roger and Jerry discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books were swept from the poet 's overloaded tables , and there appeared costly illustrated tomes , picturing late colonial interiors and exteriors , doorways and mantels , highboys and lowboys , and the differencebetween Sheraton and Windsor . It had to be settled whether scarlet or purple was the proper color for the background of adultery . It seemed to Kip uncertain whether the " decor " was being selected to match the leading lady , or the lady to match the " decor . " The rehearsals began , in an old loft not so far from the TarletonHouse . Kip was welcome to go at any hour when he was free , and sit in a broken-backed chair and watch half a dozen perspiringactors and actresses going through the strange motions of a passionate and terrible tragedy . The oddest thing imaginable , for the men were in their shirt-sleeves , and would chat casually about the most commonplace things , and walk through their parts with a manuscript in one hand and a cigarette in the other ; yet somehow , you would see , starting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had two years ago in New York , and which he had worked over into a story of two centuries earlier . Everything jumbled together  --  and Kip knew a lot more about it than he was free to speak of . The actress they had chosen to play the part of Anita was fragile and young , and appeared to Kip very much of New York ; but Roger and Jerry expressed the obscure opinion that real innocence could only be represented by sophistication . Lilian Ashton did not apparentlyfeel any need to convince them of her gifts ; she went through her role impassively , with only a flash of feeling now and then . The stage manager ordered her here and there , and the " juvenile " caught her in his arms and whispered words of abandon , and she stood quietly and let him rave . Kip noted that when Roger spoke , she was all attention , and when he was not watching her , she was watching him . In the hottest summer weather Roger 's friends would motor into town to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber-piles or whatever was at hand : fashionable ladies whom Kip had met at the literary teas or the dinner-parties ; brother and sister poets from Greenwich Village ; playwrights and critics , artistsand decorators and scene-painters , all kinds of " highbrows . " They watched attentively , and made wise comments in their mixed art lingo . Kip met here the brilliant young writer of " ad copy , " with whom Jerry Tyler had recently contracted what you might call a detachablealliance ; she was slender and foreign-looking , with olive skin , like a Gipsy ; she emphasized this effect by painting her cheeks and lips conspicuously and wearing jade ear-rings and red and green jewelry , which might or might not be real . She smoked cigarettes in a long , thin holder , and knew all the art people and their complicatedinterests . Kip was awed by this exotic Miss Follet , and felt a little wicked at meeting her . He told her humbly that these were his first rehearsals , and he was here to see and listen . She replied that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce , and much in 4emand . She invited him to come to her studio parties and listen , and he said he would be glad to . But straightway in his Puritan soul arose a problem . It was his custom to tell his mother about places where he went ; and what would he say about Miss Eleanor Follet , and her way of doing what she pleased and not trying to hide it ?  |p153Gradually  the production took shape , and the actors and actresses threw away their cigarettes , and you could see how the thing was going to be . The sets were ready , and mounted in the theatre and inspected . The costumes were ready , and there was a dress rehearsal , a magnificent event , to which the poet 's friends came by motor-car from Newport , the Adirondacks , even Canada . It was two or three o'clock in the morning before it was over , but that wade no difference , people stood around and discussed the play until daylight , and were all agreed that it was a wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the presence of worldshakingevents . He had had the fond idea that maybe Maggie May and her mother would be invited to New York to witness the first night . But when he asked Roger , the reply was that this play was not for ladies from the South , it was too much of New York . Kip understood ; he had " got " the comments of this smart crowd , and realized its unbelievable cynicism , its absorption in the two elements of sexual excitement and commercial gain . No , Roger 's new world would assuredly not blend with Pointe Chilcote ! The scenery and costumes were loaded onto motor-trucks , and transported to Trenton , New jersey , where the play was to undergo a process known as " trying it on the dog . " It was n't that Roger or his manager cared what anybody in Trenton , New jersey , thought about a masterpiece of poetical drama ; but it was necessary that the play should be acted before some audience , so that the actors might become perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford the luxury of travel , and contented himself with telegraphed accounts in the New York newspapers , and a postcard , representing the capital of the State of New Jersey , scrawled over by Jerry in capital letters : " IT 'S IT ! " Three or four days later he read another item in the papers , to the effect that the police of the capital of New Jersey had compelled the producer of " The Golden Jail " to tone down some the too-ardent love-passages . Kip had learned a lot about the world , but not all , and it never occurred to him that a wide-awake press agent might have paid the police to take this action , as a means of assuring attention to the play in New York.  |p154The  great night had come . Beginning at six o'clock the previous evening , and continuing until six in the morning , the author , the producer , the stage manager , the stage-hands and electricians , the press-agent , the property-boy , and the entire cast of " The Golden jail " had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything had gone wrong , and complete ruin for the undertaking was indicated . Everybody was living on coffee , cigarettes and liquor , nobody had slept for two nights , and Kip , whose first final rehearsalit was , believed every dire prophecy he heard people mutter or shout . He had no idea that it was always that way with every play preparing for its debut on Broadway . The demand for tickets on that opening night had run the price up to fifty dollars . Nevertheless , Roger , the Southern gentleman , had seen to it that the Tarleton family had their four orchestra seats , and they were there half an hour ahead of time , in the best their wardrobe contained . During the Tong wait , they feasted their eyes upon the luxury and fashion of the metropolis , which they had been reading about for so many years in the papers . The ladies who had sold themselves to elderly gentlemen had now come to see their life-story ; and they had put on their backs as much as possible of their price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diamonds and pearls . They descended from their shining chariots , escorted by their owners and masters ; they drew themselves erect , and put haughty stares on their faces , or perhaps seductive smiles , and came through the lobby and down the aisles , gazed at by the throngs , and pretending to be unaware of it  --  but in reality quaffing this publicity like wine from a golden cup . It was the reason one lived in New York . A year since the armistice , the country was still in the convulsionsof a war-boom . Everything was scarce , prices were mounting  --  andhere were the men who had both the money to buy and the goods to sell . They had gambled in what Wall Street gaily referred to as " war-babies " ; they had held the world in their tight fists for five years of agony . The nations had spent three hundred billions of dollars , but from the point of view of these men it had not been wasted  --  it was a debt which they meant to collect . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that seven hundred million dollars which the government had paid for battle-planes , not one of which had ever flown in battle . Across the aisle sat a shipbuilderP155from Philadelphia , who had burned twenty million feet of the best lumber , for the sake of the cost plus ten percent which the government was paying him . Behind him sat Richard E. Fessenden , the hanker , married to Maggie May 's cousin ; he was now speculating in German exchange , and expecting to make tens of millions . If you had known the insides of New York , you might have skipped from seat to seat and picked out a hundred such men , with their ladies  --  some of the latter having life contracts , and others having verbal understandings , but not one having failed to get her Paris models and jewel-studded slippers , her ermines and sables , her diamondsand pearls  --  and to bring them here to prove it ! Here , also , were the providers of pleasure for the rich . Here was the proprietor of a gambling palace , who paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here was the political chief to whose coffers came a stream of such tributes . Here was a lady who owned six elegantly equipped brothels , scattered over this theatredistrict ; and near her the polo-player who had inherited the land upon which these places were located . Here sat the chief of the brewing industry , and near him the little chief who ran a chain of dives and saloons which paid no tax to the government , because it was cheaper to pay Tammany . Here was the head of the dope-ring , and his lady , whom he was about to make into a musical comedy star . If you preferred the highbrow kinds of pleasure , you might have picked out the providers of these . You might have seen a stout gentleman who conducted a jazz-band all over the world , and a young man who had made a million dollars , writing songs for this hand to play . You might have seen painters of rich people 's portraits , and decorators of rich people 's homes ; dramatists who made plays about rich people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theme , and critics who had become famous by criticising such plays and novels , in newspapers which were owned by multi-millionaires , and used as part of their political apparatus . In short , it was the institution which governs the drama in America , the New York " first night audience . " This audience comes , and listens ; it says , " Live , " and the play runs for a year ; it says , " Die , " and the play is forgotten in a week . This audience judges , not merely for itself and for the people of Manhattan , but for the whole of America  --  because the play which has failed on Broadway can not even get a start on the road . It judges for the screen , be- cause the feature pictures are made out of Broadway successes . It determines not merely the entertainment of America , but its ideas . The masses go to see what they have read about ; they take their children to see it  --  and so the manners , morals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade . It was the post-war era , known to itself as the Jazz Age . It had lived through war and battle , and sudden wholesale death by land , sea , and air . If those present had not experienced it personally , they had read about it , and seen it hovering near . They had known the anxiety of conflict and the rapture of victory . They had heard the promise of a new world , and seen their mockery justified . Now they were caught in a wave of inflation and speculation ; millions were perishing at home and abroad , while they , the chosen few , became rich beyond dreaming . These people believed in money , and in the physical luxuries which money could buy , and in the imaginative excitements which money art could contrive . They were giving their suffrage , night after night , to dramas of violence and cynicism , murder and crime , gang-life , night-life , and every kind of sexual perversion and excess . These men and women were living such things in their private lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I f anyone objected to the spectacle , there was a trained corps of critics to make such persons ridiculous to the world . A part of this audience had come tonight because they had read Roger 's book , or had read about it in the smart gossip-papers ; they had heard the whispers , the twelve or more versions of the real Anita , and the poet 's hidden progeny . Others had come because they had read the press-agent 's skillfully contrived publicity , and especially the interview with the outraged chief of police of the capital of New Jersey . All had come expecting a sensation , and they were not defrauded . There was much that might have been said for Roger 's drama , as a plea for the rights of young love ; there was plenty of room for protest against the sale of love , and against marriage ideals based upon ignorance and superstition . But nobody was going to say these things among this " first night audience . " To them the play meant one thing , the right to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies who composed half the audience , it meantp157that , having eaten their cake , they might have it again ; while keepingtheir Paris models and jewel-studded slippers , their ermines and sables , their diamonds and pearls , they might have a young lover , and see themselves glorious and romantic while cheating on a business contract . They sat trembling and shaking , with tears running down their cheeks and ruining their expensive make-up . At the end of the second act , when Anita made her speech of defiance , they sprang to their feet and shouted ; some stood in their seats , to get a better view of the golden-haired genius-god in front of the curtain . There must have been elderly purchasers of pleasurewho shivered and had the creeps while listening to that outbreak of sex-Bolshevism ! Everybody in the audience found something to suit them . Purchasersof women 's flesh , who had become sated and difficult to please , here shared imaginary delights which brought hack their long-dead youthful ardor . Women who had put away true love as a thing economically unsound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professional art-people  --  managers , actors , playwrights , poets  --  recognized a masterly job , the sex-thrill brought to life upon the stage . The makers of money admired their kind of job  --  the thing they called " box-office " ; they visioned with admiring envy the golden floods that would pour in . In truth , it was an Arabian Nights ' entertainment , an Aladdin story made real in post-war America . A youth only twenty-five years of age had stolen a beautiful mistress , and made her into a best-selling book , and then into a magic carpet woven of love and romance , fortune and glory . No wonder they shouted to him , and made him come out before the curtain again and again , that they might feed their eyes upon his tall , aristocratic form . He was the golden-haired darling of every secretly unhappy woman in the audience ; the dream-lover of each and all . He was dashing and triumphant , yet at the same time pale and worn-looking  --  as well he might be , considering the tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . They shouted bravos at him , and drank in every word of his speech , and the critics went off and added to the eulogies they had prepared in advance . It happened that Kip Tarleton sat next to one of these important critics , andcard what he said to his woman companion : " He writes with the phallus . " It was the cachet of Broadway success.  | THE clays were getting shorter , and darkness was settling over the Island of Manhattan ; the sun was going away , never to return  --  so Roger Chilcote gravely declared . They must purchase crepe , and make ready by fasting and prayer for that dread sixteenthday of January , in the year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and twenty , after which there would be no more joy in America , and laughing out loud would be punished by a term in the county jail . In short , the Eighteenth Amendment was actually going into effect ; also the Volstead Act , the national legislation which was to carry out its terms ; also numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the legislatures . Men prepared themselves against this ( lark time iii various ways , according to their means . Roger , who received in his mail every Tuesday morning a large check , covering the previous week 's earningsof his play , would not fail to make provision against the comingdrought . It would not last long , he was convinced ; but good liquor would always be worth its price , and was to be considered as a sound investment . He made an arrangement with some dealer , who had a vault in which gentlemen were going to store their supplies , taking chances on their ability to move it when they needed it . His uncles had brought a small shipload of stuff from the Bahamas , unloading it and putting it away in the cellars of Pointe Chilcote . Roger had put up a share of the money  --  a form of life insurance , he called it . Never believe that any sheriff or constable or agent of wowsers would raid the homes of the Chilcote uncles ! And when Roger needed a supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps having it shipped up to New York in sacks of sugar . Up to the last day , it was legal to bring liquor into the city , and distribute it to the homes of those who could pay for it . Many of the guests of the Tarleton House were taking measures to protect themselves ; Taylor Tibbs carried up so many cases that it began to be a joke in the place , a question whether these old houses wouldp159stand the extra strain . There were bottles in the cupboards , and under the beds , and in trunks down in the store-rooms . Several of the boarders got new locks  --  for of course the weakness of the Rig Chief Pow was known . The old man 's position was the saddest of all , for he had no money to protect himself , and took the impending drought with mortal seriousness . Really , how was anyone going to exist ? Sandkuhl'swould close up , and the other bars where he was used to passing his days and nights . How could you imagine New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some said you 'd have to make the stuff at home ; so Pow bought for ten cents at a second-hand book-stall a ragged volume which gave the recipes . But then arose the problem of his fanatical wife and son , who would make his life a torment , if they caught him with even the smallest jar of home-brew . For the present , there was plenty of good stuff in the house , and few could deny they had it , and if you kept their thoughts upon it , they would realize how good a little nip would taste right now . Christmas was at hand , when everybody 's heart was mellowed , and mercy and loving kindness were in the air . This might prove to be the last real Christmas in America , so let us make the best of it , and open up a bottle of the real makings , and permit an old-style Virginia gentlemen , one of the last-surviving F. F. V. 's , to show us how his grandfather mixed it in the days when men were men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the toper 's progress when hospitality was not enough . He wanted more than anybody would give him , and he wandered about the Tarleton House , as restless as the proverbial bear with a sore back . A couple of days after the New Year 's celebration , his wife discovered him lugging in a tub which he had bought in a second-hand shop , intending to try an experiment with a mixture of molasses and raisins ; she made a scene , and delivered one of her tirades , and took the tub to set oily floor mops in . And that was the end ; the infuriated descendant of Pocahontas made up his mind that life was not worth living on so humiliating terms . He waited an hour or two , until his wife was down in the kitchen , and then he took a chisel and pried open the cupboard door in which she kept her clothes . He tumbled them out upon the floor , searching the pockets until he found her purse . It contained about seventy-five dollars , and the Big Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world a man , and master of his fate ,  | striding boldly , and hitting thumps on the pavement with his silverheadedcane . It was n't the first time he had done this , but he had been told by both his wife and son that it would be the last . So instead of going out to hunt for him , Kip announced that his father had gone to visit relatives , and dismissed him from mind . It was n't until eight or ten days later that Roger Chilcote became suspicious of this vague statement , and began asking questions ; exactly where had the Big Chief gone , and for how long ? When he got the story , he exclaimed , " Poor old devil ! We ca n't just let him drift , Kip ! " " That 's what we 're going to do , " replied the other . " I 've nursed him for the last time . " Wowsers and fanatics are like that ; people must do the way they do , or the milk of human kindness turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ; Roger knew what it was to be " on a tear , " and in desperate need o f help . 1 I is golden-brown eyes became soft with pity . " We ca n't leave that old man out on the streets in the middle of winter , son . " " But what else can we do ? We ca n't bring him to this house ; he 'll have the D. T. 's by now , and people would n't stand it . " " The poor old soldier ! We 've got to find him , kid ! " " I 'd have to send him to a private hospital ; and I 've told him many times that we have n't the money to throw away , and wo n't do it again . " " Well , I 've got so much money just now that it 's a crime , Kip  --  a strain upon my morals and conscience . " " We ca n't let you do it , Roger ! " " You ca n't keep me from doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can have some influence over him . I can get him to promise " He 'll promise anything in the world ; it does n't hurt him to promise , but you 'll find it means nothing . So long as he can get the stuff " Maybe he wo n't be able to get any more , Kip . The new law is coming in and it wo n't be so easy . " It was the first time Kip had ever heard Roger speak of prohibition as something that might possibly have some effect . " We 'll have to give him one more chance , son . "  |p161Under  the influence of this gentle warmth the hard curds of Puritan morality began to soften . Kip remembered that dream which had been haunting him , that perhaps , when liquor was no longer to be obtained , his father might again become the playmateof old days . If they got him straightened out this one more time , he might really be compelled to behave himself . Perhaps this friend , with his prestige as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hate to have you get mixed up in it , Roger . It 's like going down into hell . " " Well , son , you know Dante had Virgil escort him into hell . Even Jesus paid the place a visit , according to the creed I used to recite . Why should n't a modern poet go slumming ? It will add a new color to my palette  --  a touch of Rembrandt , if you know what I mean . " Kip 's acquaintance with Rembrandt was slight , but he knew that Roger would always find fancy words with which to describe anything he was doing . No matter how disagreeable the thing might be , Roger would be gay about it , and would identify it with literary precedents . The playwright insisted that he wanted to do this job himself , without help from any one , as a discipline and a penalty , for having failed to give the Big Chief enough good liquor to satisfy him and keep him at home . Kip understood this kind of upsidedownapology  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of riding on the water-wagon . Roger went first to Sandkuhl 's , and other places where Pow was known . They had not seen him there for a week ; he had spent most of his money , and moved on to cheaper neighborhoods . Either he had drifted uptown to what was known as " Hell 's Kitchen , " or he had moved over to the Bowery , with its mile long string of dives and " barrel-rooms . " Perhaps he had been picked up by the police , and lodged in the work-house , or even in the morgue . The poet dug out of his clothes closet an old suit and sweater which had been used for duck-hunting . It would n't do to wander about in these neighborhoods at night wearing a good overcoat ; but with jacket collar turned up about his neck , and an old hat pulled over his eyes , his shoulders hunched and hands stuffed into his pockets , he could pass as one of the lost men , the disinherited , whom it was hardly worth while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , half sleet and half rain , when Roger set out upon this descent into hell , this imitatio Christi on a slumming tour . There was an inch or two of slush upon the pavements of the Bowery , and the street lights had feeble rainbow rings about them . No one was out in such weather except those who had no place to stay in . The lost men shuffled along , drawn into themselves as much as possible , shivering , hesitating in front of a saloon doorway , wondering if they might halt there for a few minutes with safety . Inside would be the reek of alcohol and the steam of filthy bodies ; but no one heeded that on a winter night ; it was a question of saving the little spark of warmth which was their life , and all they had . In the centre of each place was a hot stove , and if one paid a nickel for a glass of beer , one had the right to huddle there for a period of time which left room for hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces were bowed ; sometimes the human wrecks sat before a table , sleeping with head in arms , and the seeker would have to go close and peer at them . Once or twice , when he saw a man who might be Pow , he would prod the sleeper to a grumbling wakefulness ; the poor devil would know what was meant , and would begin to stagger to his feet , not daring to protest , for fear of the " bouncer " and his hard fist . From each human bundle arose the odor of stale sweat and moldy garments ; in the faces that were raised to him the poet saw reminders of a volume of Dore which had lain on the drawingroomtable in his childhood . Years back an upstate " solon , " as the newspapers called the state legislators , had set out to please the rural sentiment by a law forbiddingthe serving of liquor on Sundays , except in connection with meals . This gave rise to much merriment in Manhattan , which can always outwit the rustic , whether by selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Raines law sandwiches . " The saloons of the city became " restaurants , " by virtue of a table or two , and a bartender who would bring your " meal " to the table . You ordered a sandwich and a glass of beer , for the price of the beer ; you did not touch the sandwich , but left it to be " sold " again , and thus it would do duty all Sunday long . Also , there came a more sinister development , the so-called " Raines law hotel . " What made it a " hotel " was several bedrooms upstairs , and women waiting , and a register in which you wroteP163a fictitious name . The rural senator and his law had long since been thrown into history 's scrap-heap , but the evil he had done lived after him , and so it happened that Roger would see the faces of women , some bloated and blowsy , some pale and crimson-painted , masks of death , peering from behind a swinging door . They would smile , and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain to a poet that they were equally as willing as the ladies of Broadway and those of Park Avenue . Roger went on , the whole night through  --  for it was not a job which could be divided into parts ; if he came back the next day , his quarry might have shifted to the district already inspected . At one o'clock in the morning the saloons all closed their front doors and made it necessary for Roger to go to the " Family Entrance , " an added inconvenience . There was a thing called " war-time prohibition , " supposed to be in force , and all these saloons were technically out of existence ; but here they were , still holding on , and getting rid of surplus stocks . The government appeared to be contentif they refrained from selling to soldiers and sailors . There were saloons on all the side-streets , and dives in the basements , damp and moldy cellars known as " barrel-rooms , " where bums and wastrels spent the night crouched in a corner for the price of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel of stale drink , collected from leavings in the bottoms of kegs . Sometimes it would be fortified with alcohol  --  a process called " spiking " it . Again it would be spoiled vinegar , or a concoction of Jamaica ginger , or even of wood alcohol ; there was no analysis of the " rotgut " these poor wretches imbibed . They would go crazy , and there would be fights and stabbings ; the papers seldom troubled to report such affairs , unless some one was killed . They would become delirious , and the patrol-wagon would come and haul them away . Next day they might go blind from the effects of the drink  --  the public hospitals had a stream of such cases . Mere also one found women ; frowsy hags , with skirts trailing in the filth , in the style of many years back ; bloated creatures with bleary eyes , and mouths pouring obscenities . No man so low that there was not some woman to be his mate , for a price that would buy her another drink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as male , and if it was a " fightingdrunk , " she was treated on a basis of equality , with a hickory club . The golden-haired poet who wanted to add a new color to his literarypalette , yielded to the blandishments of a grey-haired harridan so far as to buy her a " man-sized drink . " She poured it down , and they marched forth into the rain arm in arm , the woman singinga song which had been popular before Roger was born : " They do such things and they say such things on the Bowery , the Bowery  --  1 ' 11never go there any more ! " When finally the Big Chief was found , it was thanks to Taylor Tibbs , who , like a faithful dog , had a nose for his master . Taylor came to " Mista Roger , " reporting that he had found " Mista Pow " in the rear room of a saloon on Tenth Avenue ; he was " terrible bad , " said the Negro  --  and so Roger postponed an engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed a passing taxi-. cab . The descendant of the First Families of Virginia sat at a sloppy beer-table , with his head lying in his arms ; his hat was missing , and so , alas , was the silver-headed cane ; his clothing was filthy , as if he had been rolling in the gutter . When Roger spoke to him he was in a half stupor , and looked up , ( lazed , his face grey , matchinga two-weeks ' growth of beard ; his moustache and hair had grown out grey , producing a weird contrast with the top part dyed black . His hands were shaking , and he caught the other 's hand , and moaned : " Oh , Roger , my friend ! I am in hell ! " " Sure , I know , " said the poet . " I 've been there , old sport . " " Roger , they poisoned me ! They gave me knockout drops ! " " It can happen , " replied the other . He understood that this was the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pow had stolen his wife 's money and gone off on a spree ; no , it would be that he had been poisoned , which in turn would be because he had to live among these " damn Yankees "  --  which would be because General Lee had lost the battle of Gettysburg . " Believe me , Roger , I was getting along all right ; I was taking care of myself ; but they gave me knockout drops , and took all my money , and what could I do ? " " It 's all right now . I 'm going to help you . " " Roger , I 'm nearly crazy . If I do n't have a drink " Sure , you got to have a drink , " said the poet . " An old hand like you or me ca n't break off all at once . " To the bartender he commanded , " A good stiff whisky , and a lot of soda . " So Pow knew that he was in the hands of a Southern gentleman .. P165He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning throat ; after which he sighed , and a little life came back into his tortured eyes . " My God , Roger , if you only knew what I 've been through ! " " It 's all right , " said the other , cheerily . " We 're going to get you out of it . " " Roger , I ca n't go home ! Do n't take me there . They expect me to break off all at once , and I ca n't , I 'll go loony ! " A pitiful thing , to hear a man well into his fifties , with grey hair , beginning to whimper like a little cur dog ! " No , no , old scout ! " said Roger , taking him by the arm . " I 'm going to see that you get what you need . " " They 're a bunch of fanatics at home , Roger ; they 've driven me to this , because they do n't understand , they do n't make allow-ances . " " I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What will you do , Roger ? " He could not be put off with vague words in this matter of life and death . " I 'll take you to a good hospital . " " You 'll have to see that they treat me right , boy . If they shut clown on me , I 'll go clean off my head . " His two hands had got hold of the poet 's , and were going like electrical vibrators . " I 'm suffering the torments of the damned , Roger . I 've been poisoned  --  poisoned , I tell you  --  the damned villains wanted to rob me  --  it 's a racket they work . " " I 'll help you now . Come ahead . Have a little faith in me , old sport . " The poet put his soul into his commands . " Where are you going to take me ? " " To St. Stephen 's hospital . " " Oh , Christ no , Roger , not one of those religious places . They 'll put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strait-jacket  --  believe me , I know " " St. Stephen 's is a Catholic place , Pow . They understand what human beings are like . They do n't expect too much of us , like the Puritans . " " You 'll have to promise to come and see to it , Roger ! " " I 'll come without fail . " " You must tell them you 're coming , so they 'll know they ca n't tie me up ! " " Sure , I 'll tell them . I 'll come every day , and if they tie you tip , I 'll take a paddle to them . Come along now . " He got the trembling figure under the arm-pits , and lifted himp166to his feet . There was strength in Roger 's tall frame , and he half led and half carried the burly Pow out to the waiting taxi , and bundled him inside . When they came to the hospital , the driver helped him up the stairs  --  it was part of the recognized duties of a taxi-driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;666;TOOLONG , there looked down upon them a merciful Savior with a crown of thorns and a golden halo about his head ; also a blessed Virgin with a bleeding heart exposed on the outside of her dress , and with a dove sitting on it . There came a nun , in billowing black robes with white trimmings  --  an apparition at which Pow stared with frightened eyes ; but he was partly reassured when Roger specified that the unhappy victim of " knockout drops " was to be carefully " tapered off . " The nun , who heard the same story several times each day , smiled pleasantly , and said they always did that . Roger gave the patient 's name and address , age , birthplace , and marital status , also his own name and address ; with this gentle , rosy-checked saint he was safe from the embarrassment of being recognized as author of a Broadwayplay which had recently been denounced by the archbishop in St. Patrick 's Cathedral . Roger counted out five of the crisp tendollarbills which he had got from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern Manhattan , as in ancient Rome , the money had no smell . The handmaiden of Christ received it without repugnance , and two male attendants clad in white duck came and led the pitiful victim away  --  with Roger once more cautioningeverybody that the angle of the " tapering off " should be of the utmost possible acuity . Here was romance , as you lived it on the Island of Manhattan : to make such a pilgrimage through the Streets of Lost Men , with a visit to the alcoholic ward of a Catholic hospital , and then return to your home , and take a bath , and dress yourself according to the last word of fashion , in a pleated soft white shirt and a dinnercoattrimmed with satin braid , and step into a taxi and be driven to an address on Park Avenue , and have a liveried attendant carry you in a bronze car some thirty stories into the air , to what was known as a " pent-house , " a country villa on the roof of an apartment-building , complete even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you could pick your own strawberries andP167fresh mint for juleps , and a fish-pond in which you might catch mountain brook trout for the third or fourth course of your dinner . I n this retreat among the clouds lived people so rich that they had given up the effort to spend their money , and indeed had lost interestin it ; turning it over to the care of high-class administrators , who were forbidden to trouble the owners with financial statements oftener than once a quarter . When you were seated in a dining-room that had been boxed up and brought intact from a castle in Bohemia , and while silent uniformed servitors were bringing you rare dainties upon gold plate , what could be more outre and delightful than for a literary lion to invite those present to guess where and how he had been spending the last two days and nights ? Let them name the most bizarre occupations their fancy could suggest  --  flying with the airmail , or exploring the bottom of the sea in a diver 's suit , or lying in the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of her  --  no , they would never guess that Roger Chilcote had descendedinto hell , and the third day had risen again , and seen a vision of himself hanging in a frame on a white plastered wall , with a crown of thorns and a golden halo about his head ! So a poet played with his auditors , and kept them laughing over their own bewilderment . Had any of these elegant book-lovers ever sojourned in Italy , and did they remember Dante 's picture of the habitations of the lost ? This genius who knew all poetry in all languages , first treated them to the sonorous Italian , and then translated it for them : " Here signs , plaints , and voices of deepest woe resounded through the starless sky , for which I felt my tears begin to flow . Strange tongues , horrid cries , accents of grief and wrath , voices deep and hoarse , with hands smitten in despair , made up a tumult , which ever whirled through that air of timeless gloom , even as sand when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voices such as this could be heard within a mile or two of this villa on an artificial mountain-top ! Where was the place , and would Roger Chilcote take them to it ? When at last they understood that it was no more than a slummingtouron the Bowery , they realized what it meant to be a poet , and to weave a halo about the most obvious things . This was what you expected from a " lion " when you fed him , and was why you took M much trouble to snare him , and why your richest and most utterly bored friends took a chance on one more dinner-party . Of course , having got onto the subject of the Bowery , and its bums for whom nothing could be done because they spent everything they got on drink  --  then , of course , you talked about prohibition , and the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead act , which were due to go into effect in a couple of days . The thing which really interested you was not the bums , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you discussed what you were going to do about this lunatics ' law . Gentlemen who had never been inconvenienced told  --  in the strictest confidence , but with several waiters listening  --  what stocks they had purchased and where they had them stored . Ladies who made good their right to do whatever the men did , announced their theories of anarchism and direct action , and proceeded to put them into effect . They had just seen a vision of lost souls on the Bowery , and of victims of deliriumtremens tied up in strait-jackets ; but , if you expected this to cause any guest at a pent-house dinner-party to hesitate in draining the delicate , wide , champagne glasses or the tiny narrow liqueur glasses  --  you would be showing yourself a crude person , wholly out of tone with the easy self-possession prevailing among the cultured wealthy . Came the Day , as the movie titles used to say : that Day about which everybody had been talking for the past twelve months in America  --  after which it would be illegal to manufacture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than one-half of one per cent . It seemed strange that a Day on which the expectations of a hundred and ten million people had been concentratedfor a year should come and go , and seem like any other day , with no earthquake or eclipse , no bombs bursting in air , nor firecrackers exploding on the ground . The bar-rooms looked empty and the bartenders sad ; the customers came with baby-carriages and children 's express-wagons , and bought the last bottles at bargain prices , and carried them home . In the lobster-palaces the proprietors gave away the last champagne to their customers . One imaginative host had his place equipped with black table-cloths , and a coffin filled with black bottles , and a chorus of weeping bacchante . The guests added their tears to the free champagne , and sat for hours discussingthe problem : where are we going to get ours tomorrow ? and where are we going to get it next week ? The prospects looked unpromising . The newpapers announcedP169that a hundred Federal agents would start promptly on the stroke of midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city to aid them . All liquor stocks found after that moment would be put under bond , and any that were sold or transportedwould be confiscated . On the following Sunday all wowsers and bluenoses were going to church , to give thanks for the new dispensation , and promise good conduct . One prohibition leader estimated that the law could be enforced for five million dollars a year . But there were false notes in the sweet chorus . The governor of New Jersey issued a proclamation in defense of state 's rights ; the people of his state were not bound by the amendment , and he would protect them in the exercise of their right to make liquor of not more than twenty-five percent alcoholic content . Apparentlythis " dripping wet " governor had not heard that the Civil War had been won by the North . He did n't know the past , nor did he know the future  --  he could not see himself ten years later , a victim of alcoholism , blowing out his own brains ! The United States Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey was bound by the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court would decide a host of other questions bearing upon the law and its enforcement . When Federalagents smelled the sickish odor from a secret still , did they have the right to go in and get the law-breakers , or did they have to apply for a search-warrant , and give a chance for the law-breakersto be " tipped off " ? And what about the practice of the restaurantsof furnishing " set-ups " to their patrons  --  glasses and ice and the " mixings , " while the patron brought his alcohol in a hip-pocket flask ? Also that grave constitutional question , raised by the newspapersat the very outset  --  should the government confiscate a pair of trousers which had been used for the transportation of liquor ? The Big Chief was brought home in a taxi-cab ; his cheeks grey in color , his hands trembling , his spirit subdued . He retired to his private quarters in back of the office , where he stayed , growling like an old bear in a cave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph , and then get up and begin to pace about , muttering to himself . He went out but rarely , for the weather was bad , and all his places of refuge were closed . Sandkuhl had quit , and all the saloons up Sixth Avenue had signs in front , announcing that they were being remodeled , and would reopen as ice cream parlors or delicatessen shops . The principal occupation of the Big Chief came to be playing cards with himself . He would set his books and tobacco things onto the floor , and spread the cards on the table in front of him , and sit and shift them about for hours ; at a crisis , he would steal a glance about to make sure he was alone , and then he would cheat himself . So he always won , and it was the nearest he got to the good old days . If somebody came to visit him , he would brighten up , and be the sporting man and Cavalier . But there was no longer any " hospitality " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he would point to the liquor cabinet , stuffed with old magazines , and shake his head sadly , saying that the wowsers and bluenoses had licked him . Kip was kind to the prisoner , and patient with his impatience . They would play a game of cards now and then , and Kip would joke , and try to help the old man over this difficult period of getting used to prohibition . The son could afford to be patient , since he was having his way  --  the thing he had longed for all through his boyhood . The corner saloon was gone , and the Big Chief had to behave , willy-nilly . Also , Kip had another reason for being pleased with life , and genial to all the world . For the first time in years , he was looking forward to a vacation ; he had received an invitation to visit Pointe Chilcote  --  a regular invitation , written by the mistress of the household , none the less valid because the handwriting was primitive . It had been reinforced by Maggie May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth to represent him at home . To visit the " Teche country " at the loveliest time of the year , the early Southern spring , when the fields of young cane were starting their growth , and the mocking-birds were singing their lovemusic ! Kip 's mother and aunt eagerly discussed a problem between them . Was it just that the Chilcotes were being polite to friends of Roger ? Or could it be that the lovely Miss Maggie May was taking an interest in an especially well brought-up hotel-clerk ? The time for the visit was near , and Kip 's clothes were in order , and he had learned by heart his mother 's lessons as to what he was to wear on this occasion and that ; also he had imagined in his secret heart what he was going to say to Miss Maggie May on this occasion and that . But suddenly fell a blow of fate which laid all his dreams in ruins . Taylor Tibbs entered " Mista Pow 's " room with the cus-P171tomary cup of morning coffee , and stopped short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying flat on his back , with-blood running from a cut on his head . He was moaning , and the Negro ran out , shouting for Mrs. Tarleton , and Kip , and Miss Sue ; the place was in an uproar , with frightened servants crowding the doorway , and someone telephoning for the doctor , and Taylor Tibbs coming with a flask of whisky from the repository under Mr. Gwathmey 's bed . Alas , poor Pow  --  beyond the help of even the best Kentucky Bourbon ! He was hardly able to speak , and could not lift himself . Soon the doctor gave his verdict  --  it was a paralytic stroke ; the patient 's entire right side was helpless , and would stay so for a long time , perhaps forever . The old man was laid in his bed , and there were no vacations for his son , nor for any of his relatives or servants . One of Pow 's faculties which had been spared by the stroke was the demanding one , and another was the complaining one . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially with its nursing department . His pipe had gone out , and there was nobody to light it ; when he pressed the electric button , how could he know if the bell was ringing or not , when nobody had paid attention for at least five minutes ? Nobody wanted to talk with him , nobody came to read the paper to him , nobody had gratitude , or even common humanity . Poor old wreck of a man , with all his pride and eagerness for life , baffled , but still raging inside him ! His right eyelid hung limp , and the right side of his mouth was motionless , giving a ghastly twist which the best-dyed mustache could not hide ; but even so , let anybody mention the pride and glory of the old South , and there would be a flash in the one well eye , and a whispered pronouncementthat it was impossible to find decent cooking north of Maryland . Let anybody mention the wowsers , and the havoc they had made of the good life in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow and hurl his defiance . If it was one of his o1 ( 1 cronies who had come visiting , he would beg : " Just a little nip , Judge "  --  or maybe : " A little snifter , Colonel . You know I 'm safe now  --  I 'll never run wild any more . " So Kip had to write to Mrs. Chilcote , expressing his regrets ; all his spare time was needed to help take care of the invalid . Mrs. Chilcote said : " What a dear boy , so dutiful ! "  --  an old-fashioned word for an old-fashioned virtue . She told Maggie May to write and say how sorry they all were ; and Maggie May told how Lee was learning to ride a horse , and wished that Kip might be learning also . The new crop was in the ground , and she was listening to the mocking-birds while reading about snow-storms in New York . But there was no time for the head-clerk of the Tarleton House to spend in repining . He had never been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas , and the post-war prosperity , the like of which Manhattan had never known . The men who had made millions selling things to the government now made more millions buying them back . They sold to the war-devastated nationsthe means of rebuilding  --  having first loaned them at high interest rates the money to finance the deal . With these paper profits they made trips to New York , with their wives or ladyloves ; and of course on the first night of their visit they wanted to go to the theatre . What would they choose , if not that sensationalmelodrama of illegitimate passion , " The Golden Jail " ? So the flood of wealth poured into Roger 's lap , and he entrusted it to a lively young stockbroker of his fashionable world , who turned it over again and again , into sums beyond imagining . Jerry Tyler also was sharing in this post-war glory . The smart magazine for which he worked had raised his salary twice , and he spent his time rushing about in taxicabs from a swanky teapartyto a brilliant opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gilded cabaret . From all over the world the intellectualelite poured in , to claim their share of the prosperity of New York . The handsome and popular editor picked up gossip about them , what they looked like , what they were writing , or singing , or ( lancing , what salaries or fees they received , what ladies they brought to the dazzling supper-parties . Jerry also had met the fashionable young stockbroker , and was being " carried " for " blocks " of this or that . To listen to the gossip between Jerry and Roger was to be borne aloft on golden wings , to the topmost pinnacles of this Olympus of the Machine Age . But Kip missed the greater number of these conversations , becauseRoger came less often to the Tarleton House . He still made the place his headquarters , but he would send a messenger for his mail , and not show up for several days . Roger was tied up in another " romance " ; and , as had happened in the case of " Anita , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story until it was all over . P173This time it was Lilian Ashton , star of " The Golden Jail " ; that fragile brunette beauty who had embodied Roger 's Anita to the Island of Manhattan . " Love 's ecstasy and agony made flesh "  --  so one of the critics had hailed her on the opening night ; and apparently a woman could not enact such a role , and become a symbol of it to the Island of Manhattan ; without seeking to make it real to herself . Kip remembered how , in the days of the rehearsals , she had fed her eyes upon the golden-haired creator of all that was most important to her  --  the glory and the dream , as well as the contract At twelve hundred per week . The time came when these two moved to each other as the river to the sea . When she was in the poet 's arms , then panic seized her , and she drew back , crying , " No , Roger ! I am not worthy of you ! I have soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm no springchickenmyself , kid . Forget it ! " Such was romance made real ; and now there was a passionate love-affair going on  --  the two could hardly bear to be apart , and when other ladies came swarming , making their eyes at the golden-haired poet-god , Lilian would have clawed their eyes out  --  except that Roger helped her to laugh at them . It was a love-story exactly to the taste of the intellectuals of Manhattan . All the world knew about it , and imagined it when they saw Anita clinging in frenzy to her young surveyor , and when she shouted her defiance across the foot-lights . All women envied this first among stars , and all men envied this poet-laureate of passion . But to Kip , who saw it from the point of view of a hotel-clerk , it had its deplorable aspects . For one thing , it destroyed all chance of Roger 's returning to the simple life ; it sealed his brotherhood to the owls and the bats . Except on matinee days , the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the maid brought her coffee and toast , and newspapers , in which she read the gossip about the theatrical world , and those smart persons whom she considered of importance . After that she bathed and dressed , and went with her poet to a literary tea , or a reception given by the rich who condescended to play with art . The young couple would flit from one to another of these affairs , the cynosure of all critical eyes ; then , at seven-thirty sharp , Lilian would be at the theatre , to " make up , " and rest until the time for her appearance upon the stage.  |p174That  left her lover free to attend dinner-parties . But always at eleven he was at the theatre . They would have an engagement for one of the dazzling suppers in a private dining-room in some showy restaurant , or else in a cabaret , with a huge sea-shell of gold and scarlet and purple covering the ceiling , and a jazz-orchestra blaring , and a dancing floor so crowded that the couples could only stand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning before this party broke up . The worst aspect of this " night life " was the drinking . At the tea-parties , you seldom found tea in the cups , but generally cocktails . At the receptions there would be iced punch , and it had to be strong , for what New Yorkers wanted was the " kick , " and they wanted it without delay ; if you did n't provide it , they would pull it from their own hip-pockets . The dinner-parties were a continuouslibation , while the suppers were a flood . How else could you justify yourself for sitting at a cabaret table for five hours , interrupted only by dancing ? There was a new phrase coming in , " making whoopee " ; it meant shouting , singing , upsetting bottles and glassware , dancing on the table-tops , with promiscuous embracing all over the place . Sandkuhl 's might close , and the other saloons up Sixth Avenue ; but it quickly became apparent that nothing was going to happen in Manhattan to bar the rich from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hesitation , while the town waited to see what the hundred prohibition agents were going to do , and while an arrangement was worked out with the fifteen thousand Tammanypolicemen . Cocktails took to tea-cups , and bottles became flat in size , and curved so as to fit to buttocks . On this basis the " night life " was resumed ; from one source or another the " real stuff " flowed freely , and if it were doubled or tripled in price , that was an advantage , because people had so much money they did n't know what to do with it , and to pay a high price for something was the only way to get a sense of distinction . The " booze arts , " as Roger called them , became more refined and exclusive . Winter was followed by spring , and spring by summer , and " The Golden Jail " was still drawing crowds , and Roger was still basking in glory , though badly worn , and showing it in his face and the trembling of his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refuse the contents of tea-cups , saying that she had to " cut it out " on account of her work . Both of them longed for the country , they said ; but it looked as if the play was going to run all summer . However , fate had other plans . There were forces working in America which were beyond the ken of night-club butterflies , and were destined to knock off the golden dust from the pretty wings . The masters of Wall Street discovered that the well-spring of profits was drying up , and they met in their secret places to decide what should be done . Somebody had to be " deflated , " and the choice fell upon the least organized and most helpless class in America , the farmers . One fine day the Federal Reserve Board issued to its branches in the wheat country a suggestion to raise the discount rates to country banks which made farm loans ; and so , before that sun had set , there began a collapse in prices , which did not stop until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half , and in the Northwest there were counties in which every single farm had been " sold for taxes . " Then , too late , the masters of Wall Street realized that when farmers have no money to buy goods , the manufacturers of goods have no customers . There came a panic in Wall Street , and all those paper profits which had been sustaining the cabarets and night clubs were blown away in a storm of terror . Roger Chilcote spent two days among the lunatics and suicides in the board-room of his stockbroker ; he spent two nights pacing the floor , cursing everything in the universe but his own folly . Then suddenly , in the midst of the uproar , he stopped , and reminded himself that he was a great poet , and also a Southern gentleman ; he put an airy smile upon his haggard face , and washed his hands in those drops of moisture which two days ago had been a golden soap-bubble . He announced that the purpose for which he was in the world was to experiment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting atmosphere for his next poetical drama . He went to bed and slept for twenty-four hours , and when he woke up he was the same old Roger , unchastened and unsubdued . He still had his play , and Lilian had her twelve hundred a week  --  or so they thought . But alas , the golden butterflies stopped going to the theatre , except on passes ; the country customers who had been planning a trip to New York suddenly decided to wait . The manager of " The Golden Jail " assembled the members of the cast , and informed them that he could keep going , provided they agreed to cut their salaries in half . Two weeks later he assembled them again , and told them that even on half-pay he was " in the red , " and would close the show for the summer , hoping to reopen in the fall , when good times would surely return . Thereupon an imaginative poet pronounced his curses upon a civilization which identified men and women with the owls and the hats , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethyl alcohol . Roger had a new play he wanted to write , and he wanted a new environment to write it in ; he recalled the picturesquethings he had read about villas tucked away in the vinecladhills of southern France , and one day he announced that he had purchased a steamer ticket . So once more the light was going out from the Tarleton House ; this time for good , because Roger could n't afford to keep his room unused , and had to pack up his things and store them in the basement . Kip and Jerry went to the pier to see him off  --  and there Kip made the discovery that the slender brunette beauty whom he had watched upon the stage was traveling on the same steamer . That was how Jerry came to tell the story : he and Kip went home discussing the young couple and their " romance , " which had started in the glare of the footlights and the nightlights of Broadway , and was now to be subjected to the strain of the " simple life " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one vacant room in the Tarleton House ; it was no easy task to keep a family hotel going through that crisis . In the ( lays of the boom and the rise in prices , Kip and his mother had hated to go to their old guests and tell them that it would be necessary to raise the rates ; but now these same guests seemed to have no hesitation in coming to Kip or his mother , and declaring that they found themselves unable to pay , and that unless their rates were reduced they would have to move to a cheaper place . Worse yet , some of the boarders would run up bills , and hang on , pleading hard times , and begging for mercy , the women weeping in their rooms , and asking where would they go , what would they do ? The rates had to be reduced , and also the standards of the establishment : a source of humiliation to Kip and his mother and aunt . To have to buy cheaper foods in the market , those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of prime ribs ofP177beef , a device called " pot roast , " which was made by boiling tough beef , and then baking it in the oven ; to follow this with stewed prunes , instead of " floating island , " or the other delicacies which Aunt Sue knew how to prepare with an abundance of eggs and cream ! What would become of one 's talk about the superiority of Southern cooking , and of all the gastronomic conversation which went on at the dinner-tables ? Those boarders who were able to pay the old rates resented the change of standards ; so , strangely enough , did those who were n't able to pay the old rates  --  and even those who were n't able to pay anything ! No one scolded and fussed more than the bed-ridden Pow , who talked about fried chicken with mush , Maryland style , and had to eat a piece of old boiled lien , served with a lump of dough called a " dumpling " ! Room after room became empty , and it became necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployment crisis . Kip and his mother and his aunt had to dor part of the work which the servants had done ; and so they parted with more of their dignity . Such a mass of misery , of petty cares harassing human beings ; and no one knowing what caused it , all of them with a sense of bewilderment , as if some evil spell had been put upon the world ! The newspapers , upon which they relied for their daily store of ideas , had no help to give . The editors had but two things to say , over and over , day after day : first , there was n't anything the matter ; and second , whatever it was , it would soon get better . The only comfort was , that everybody you knew was in the same fix . In letters from Maggie May came a picture of what had happened to the sugar-planters . Lee had borrowed large sums from the bank , and financed a crop ; he had been attentive and competent , and had raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it a price which would not cover his notes at the bank . Worse yet , c and his uncles had bought more land at boom prices , and now it was n't worth the amount of the mortgage , and they would have been glad to let it go at that price  --  only the seller of the land would n't take it back , but would sue them on their notes and take some of their other land ! It did n't seem to make any difference what you did ; whether ou gambled " on margin " like Roger and Jerry , or whether youorked soberly and productively like Lee and Kip  --  the devil of ' hard times " got you just the same . Kip did n't know what was wrong , and had no idea how to find out , and there was only one learn of comfort he could find in the whole thing  --  the fact that as the Chilcotes became less wealthy , they became less remote from him ! He was ashamed of the idea , which seemed like treachery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind , that i f Maggie May and her mother would lose all of their land and income , they might stop at the Tarleton House on their next visit to the metropolis , and it might even become possible for the clerk of the establishment to aspire to the role of suitor ! " You know the doctor said it would n't do me any harm to have a bracer now and then ! You know it 's not the same with me as with you  --  I 've been used to it all my life . For God 's sake , Kip , have a little sense ! " Thus Pow , pleading for mercy , in his chained and prisoned state . He would start an argument almost every day , and Kip would go on attending to whatever had to be done , cold and pitiless . " You know I have no liquor , father , and no way to get any . Do you expect me to break the law for you ?

" The Big Chief raised himself on his one good elbow , and shouted  --  it was really not much more than a whisper , seeming to be stifled under the black mustaches . But it had the intensity of a shout , and was rather ghastly to listen to . " You 've got me helpless here , and you torture me , and laugh at me behind my back !

You wowsers have made my whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned puritanical notions . " Kip went on straightening up the room . It did no harm to let Pow grumble and storm , one could learn not to hear it . Kip went out of the room , carrying a tray of soiled dishes ; and when he returned , the old man was lying back upon his pillow , motionless , P179with his jaw hanging down . He had had another stroke  --  and this time it had taken both sides of him . Having known that it might come at any moment , Kip was not too greatly shocked ; and yet , it was his father , and one 's father ( lies but once . The features were still set in discontent  --  that tormentof body-cells which have been poisoned by narcotics , until they are no longer able to function normally . Kip found himself suddenly weak in the knees , and had to take a chair by the bedside . l le sat for a while , with the puzzled frown across his forehead . He thought about that dream which he had cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law went into effect , Pow might come once more to be a father he could respect ; he compared that dream with his father 's last cry of fury  --  " You are killing me with your damned puritanical notions ! " The Big Chief 's parting message to his son  --  and the message of all drinkers to all sober men ! It was coming to be the message of drinking America on the subject of the prohibitionlaws . All the evils of the country were caused by the fact that sober men were interfering with the right of drinkers to get ' drunk and to stay drunk !  | ROGER CHILCOTE 'S play was reopened in October , and Lilian Ashton came back to take tip her role . But Roger did not come with her , because he was half way through the writing of a new play , and was going to move down to the Riviera for the winter . As in the case of " Anita , " art took precedence over affection , and the poet who wrote about leaving all for love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the simple life in a villa of the French countrysidehad not proved successful . There had been a good deal of rain and mud , and the plumbing had been unsatisfactory , and also the domestic service . Roger writing a play was not at all the charming creature of literary teas and cabarets ; he was solitary , moody , and open to the charge of selfishness . He had no considerationfor his companion in exile , no sense of responsibility as to how an ambitious young actress , the darling of Broadway , was to manage to pass her time . When she wanted him to go visiting in the villas of rich Americans , he said they were a horde of Hottentots , and for her to go alone . He was not to be tempted even by opportunities to meet the elite of the French aristocracy , the most haughty and aloof of mortals ; he said their women were frumps and their men were subnormal . There was a fundamental difference between Roger and his darlingof Broadway . She had been born and raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wanted to elevate herself ; whereas Roger had been born at the apex of the social pyramid , and looked with quiet disdain upon considerations of worldly place . If there was anybody he wanted to meet in France , it was half a dozen long-haired and hollow-cheeked poets in the cafes of Montmartre . He explained his point of view to Lilian with insufficient consideration for her feelings . He told her that she was in her ideas a perfect little bourgeoise , and she brooded over that in the tiresome hours while the poet was shut up in his study . When heP181emerged , she had it figured out ; so long as she was enacting his Anita , enlarging his personality and enhancing his glory , he was interested in her ; but the moment she presumed to be herself , he made her a target for insults . Jerry , telling Kip about all this , showed how much better he and his girl worked it . Eleanor Follet and he were living in the same world and preying upon the same celebrities  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he gave them publicity in the " Gothamite . " The two jobs fitted together , and the jobbers would scheme to get " openings " and introductions , each for the other . But never would they dream of going off into a hole by themselves , away from their world and its excitement . When they went for a week-end to the country , they found themselves spending Sunday afternoon figuring the best way to get back to town . Roger sent the first act of his play , " The New Man , " and Jerry and Kip read and discussed it ; or rather Jerry discussed , and Kip listened , as usual . It was another story of a " triangle " ; but this time the scene was in Manhattan , and the people were the wealthy sophisticates with whom Roger had been associating . Jerry said the lay was all right , but it would n't make a sensation like " The Golden ail , " for the reason that so many plays were written on this subect ; all the playwrights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been to so many places , and seen so much , should have chosen such a locale . Jerry said it was new to Roger ; it was new to each playwright in turn . It was the easiest thing to write shout , and in the long run the safest . There was no use expecting Roger Chilcote , who had had money all his life , to be content with an empty purse . So here was this haughty genius writing for the market , and making no bones about it ! Gone were the fine phrases about art , and the rights of young love ; Roger was dealing with gilded adultery , because that was the way to please the audiences of gilded adulterers . Kip , in turn , must hold his tongue , because he got his ' living from a family hotel , of which Roger might again become atron , and in which Jerry was now the star boarder and literary girt ! Roger came back about Christmas time , but did not patronize the Tarleton House ; he explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the haunts of his fashionable friends . The truth was ,  | as Kip found out , he and Lilian had got lonesome for each other , and were setting up housekeeping in an apartment hotel , which was honored by having a leading playwright and a leading lady , without requiring them to exhibit a marriage license . Roger 's books and other belongings were transported to his new home , and for a while Kip got news of him from Jerry , or from the papers . " The Golden Jail " had finished its run , and was about to be put on the road ; another actress was to take the part , while the exquisite Lilian was to star in " The New Man . " The season was dull , on account of hard times , but even so , Roger got an advance , and his purse was full again , and the night life as lively as ever . The new play went into rehearsal , and Kip visited another vacant loft , and watched the rehearsal of a dinner-party in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of that function to which Roger had taken him  --  the one at which the playwright had discoursedso learnedly upon the serving of wines and liqueurs . Kip even thought he recognized the hostess in one of the characters , and wondered if the lady would recognize herself , and if so , what would she think . Of course , a playwright had to use the things he saw ; maybe that was why he went to fashionable dinner-partiesandmaybe that was why he was invited ! In due course there was another tryout , this time in Bridgeport , Connecticut , and Kip read about it in the papers , and received a postcard from Jerry . Two weeks later came the New York opening , and the Tarleton family received their orchestra seats  --  only three this time , alas ; poor Pow would never again be heard to boast of his intimacy with a successful playwright . Kip saw " smart " life as it is lived in the pent-houses , where Gerald Cameron , the suave and polished husband , keeps a watch upon his unfaithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor even to divorce her , but because he wants the affair to be handled in a dignified way . It was a sort of companion-piece to " The Golden Jail , " showing how much better we manage matters in these modern days , and the audience got the idea and chuckled merrily  --  nobody more so than the pent-house hostess whom Kip recognized , and who recognized herself as the heroine of this ultra-modern adventure . The critics were cordial next morning , but they could n't keep from intimating that " The New Man " was lacking in the intensity and splendor of " The Golden Jail , " and for Roger Chilcote it must be taken as an interlude.  |p183After  that Kip did not see his famous friend for a couple of oaths , but had to get his news from Jerry , as in the old days . hen finally they met again , the circumstances were painful ; Roger as not able to walk straight , nor to talk straight , and was in evelugclothes at three o'clock in the afternoon , having obviously been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a taxicab , yoking for Jerry , and Kip had to pay the fare because Roger 's ckets had been picked . Jerry , of course , was not at home , so ip took charge , and got the poet upstairs to Jerry 's room , and to Jerry 's bed . On the way and during the process he heard a tailed story of Roger 's troubles . " In vino veritas , " the ancients oted  --  with the implication that the " veritas " will be of an unpleasant character . The poet had had a second " bust-up " with his lady-love . He accused , her of being too much interested in a young millionaire horn she had met on the steamer from France ; while she in turn cused him of being too much interested in half the Park Avenue stesses who were interested in him . She refused to heed the obvious fact that a playwright has to have local color . " What the 1l 'm I goin ' write about ? " demanded Roger , tripping over his tongue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue hostesses for posterity . Anyhow , neither Roger nor ilian were behaving in modern fashion ; Roger made note of at  --  even while he was tripping over his own tongue , and over s own feet . He stopped on the stairs , and put his hand on Kip 's milder , and said : " By God , I ai n't so much like Gerald Cameron , I , kid ? Never do act like my heroes , do I ? " Said Kip : " I 've often wondered why you do n't write about people they really are . " " My God , that 's a hot one ! " chuckled the poet , and sat right down the stairway of the Tarleton House , to settle this problem in terary ethics . " I 'll tell you the God 's own truth , kid , I 'm such cutter that if I put myself into a play , they 'd hiss me out of the .. tre . " Whereupon Roger turned for a while into a " weeping nk , " and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to all kinds of drunks , and an expert in handling . He got Roger to the room , and rang for Taylor Tibbs , noan expert . They got the poet undressed and into Jerry 's bed ; . Roger was grateful as always , but embarrassed because his purse was gone , and he had no tip for the Negro . Both Taylor and Kip insisted that it would he all right to pay him later , but Roger would n't hear to that  --  no , by God , in the morning he 'd be sober , and stingy , and he must write a check for this bob-tailed monkey before he went to sleep . So Kip had to get a blank check from Jerry 's desk , and a pen , and stand by while the check was written with uncertain fingers . Roger wanted to make it a hundred dollars , because Taylor Tibbs was helping to save many dramatic masterpieces for posterity ; but Kip insisted that ten dollars was all the service was worth , and Taylor backed him up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never the hundred ! It happened that Jerry spent that night in Eleanor 's apartment , so it was Kip who had to get up in the middle of the night and make hot coffee and administer bromo seltzer , and rout out Taylor and send him for Hunyadi water ; also it was Kip who sat by Roger 's bedside for a couple of hours and heard about the insides of a poet 's soul . All these years Roger had teased Kip , saying every clever thing he could think of . But in his heart he respected the younger man 's steadfastness , and paid him the tribute of not telling him too much . But now , in the hours of " katzenjammer , " Roger talked ; he gave his frank opinion of the life he was leading  --  which opinion was that it was a rotten life , and that he was a fraud and a swindler , a parasite upon parasites . He stated what he thought of the fashionablecrowd for whom he catered , and it was that they were a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural level of racing touts and their harlots . " I 'll tell you the God 's own truth , " said the celebrated poet , between wrenches of nausea . " If I had to live the life of this New York crowd , I 'd rather be raised in a Methodist Sunday school and turn into a shouting evangelist . " These were , of course , the worst things that Roger 's imagination could conceive , and the confession was the most extreme that a New York sophisticate could make . Of course , Kip must n't say , " I told you so . " He must n't say , " I 've done everything I could to keep you from drinking . " Ile must be tactful , and affectionate , and above all hopeful  --  since leadingplaywrights have been known to shoot their heads off or chew cyanide of potassium in crises such as these . Said he : " You don'tp185have to live this life , Roger . You can break loose , and write about her kinds of people . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have n't got the guts to and unpopularity . I have to please the critics , and be the life f the literary party . " " You only think that 's true , Roger . You 've got something better you . " " I know , you 've got to save my soul , God bless you . But as ion as I get over this headache I 'll be laughing at you again . do n't waste your time on me , Kip , I 'm bound for the garbage-can . ' II even go back to that little slut that drove me to this . " So then the playwright told what he really thought about that delicate brunette beauty who had embodied his two heroines to half million theatre-goers . She drew the soul out of him with her isses , but all the same , she was a little slut , and her mentality was at of a street-rat . She learned manners and charm like a shedonkey , and literature like a she-parrot . The one thing she really understood was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; r final ambition was to transfer herself from the theatrical col- to the society columns , where real ladies were reported . Roger kept hoping against hope that he might teach her something , it could n't be done , because it was an offense to point out to the nature of the tinsel and paste she treasured . Either she would sulk , or she would fly into a rage and reveal the street-rat . Kip got his friend to sleep again , and in the morning he teleonedJerry , who came over and helped at the job of nursing and sheering up . Incidentally , for the first time in his life , Kip spokemind to the self-satisfied and successful editor . Through the rs of their acquaintance , the editor had encouraged Roger 's cyn-1 side , and helped to pour ridicule on Kip , " the little moral demon . " t hat 's all very well for you , Jerry , " said Kip . " You 're hardFled , and you think about yourself , and take care of yourself , and ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's big-heartedgives everything he 's got . " " Thanks for your frankness , " said Jerry , dryly . " That 's all right , you know that what I 'm saying is true . Roger different from you , and needs your help . He was your friend before he was mine , and he 'd never have been in this mess ou 'd done your duty by him . " erry gathered his dark eyebrows into a forbidding frown , a of his worldly stock in trade . But in his heart he knew '  | that Kip was speaking the truth , and in the end he decided to " take it . " Of course , he would n't say that he wanted to be raised in a Methodist Sunday school and turn into a shouting evangelist ; but he said that the time had come to pull Roger loose from thi , smart crowd which was n't worthy to shine his shoes , and that hJerry , would help boost him onto the water-wagon for a while . So was brought to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insides of Kip for more than a year : that duel between fiend. and conscience , first revealed in the soul of Shakespeare 's Launcelot " Budge , ' says the fiend . Budge not , ' says my conscience . Con science , ' say I , you counsel well ' ; Fiend , ' say I , you couns. well . ' " Should Kip , or should he not , write to Maggie May an , give her some hint as to what was happening to her brother ? W. he , or was he not , deceiving himself , pretending that he was doin for his friend 's sake something which might be so greatly toown advantage ? Kip sent to Maggie May a letter which had been written an , revised and torn up and written again several times . In its fin version it did not go into particulars about the night life of Ma hattan , and the tendency of successful dramatists to fall in lo with their leading ladies . No , it could not bring itself to hint . things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teche country . " It was a missive reserved but solemn in ton . and perhaps more alarming for what it failed to say . It inform- , Miss Maggie May that New York was a city of many temptation and that men of genius were emotional , and Roger in particula was too generous ; now he needed help , and there was no one wh. could give it quite so well as his sister . At least , that was how it seemed to Kip , and he hoped that Mis Maggie May would excuse him for his boldness ; also he hoped tha she would never tell Roger what he had done , because Roger r sented interference with his affairs , and if the visit were to do an good , Miss Maggie May would have to think up some reasons o her own for coming . The letter added , very humbly , . that of course , Kip would he glad to see her again , and to do anything he could to make things easy for her  --  no , that last was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally cut out entirely ,  |p187because  of the possibility that it might sound like the shadow of a nit that the Tarleton House had vacant rooms ! Maggie May answered promptly . She understood the meaning hip 's warnings , and thanked him for his kindness . It was very ; but perhaps the trouble was hereditary , and they should not me poor Roger too severely . She would come , and do the best u could . Her cousin , Mrs. Fessenden , had invited her several Imes to pay a visit , and that would be the easiest way to arrange at tors . Maggie May was writing to Mrs. Fessenden at once , and would let Kip know of the arrangements . Certainly she would %'cr mention to anyone but her mother Kip 's part in the matter ; thanked him again , and looked forward with pleasure to see him . She wrote again in a week or so . She was coming to New York a few days . Kip was in a fine glow of excitement , with many problems to occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet . iggie May ? Or would her relatives , those rich and important perms , think he was " butting in ? " And what would Roger do about ilian Ashton ? Roger had never told his people that he had quit e Tarleton House : his mail from home still came there . How could he explain to his sister the address in the apartment hotel ? ml what excuse would he give for never inviting her there ? Kip put the problem up to Jerry , who laughed and said that sooner later Maggie May was going to have to wake up to the realities the world about her  --  and probably it would be sooner . Sisters were n't such dubs nowadays . But Kip insisted that Maggie Mayas different from any and all other girls . Jerry said , how old as she  --  must be twenty now . Kip said twenty-one , and Jerry Wed . " You keep track of her birthdays , do you ? What you ter do , kid , is get busy this trip , and not let her wither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not fail to think of this problem Lilian Ashton . It was presently made known that he was more d of her than ever , and had decided to go out and stay with Fessendens for a while . He would occupy that cottage which cousin had offered him , and spend his time thinking out a new y . It was springtime , and the country would be pleasant , and would take long walks , and renew old times with his sister . Kip 0 a thrill over this ; how delightful to a born reformer to play role of guardian angel , and guide men 's destinies without their ing the least idea of it !  | The afternoon came , and Kip was invited by Roger to join the welcome . He put on his best suit of clothes , which Tayl . Tibbs had brought back from the cleaner 's , and from which mother and aunt picked the last scrap of lint . He had a ne Fedora hat and a pair of gloves to match , his mother having acco , panied him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and v  --  much fussed up and elated , he met Roger at the Pennsylvania s tion , and Roger , by some magic known to celebrities , obtain permission to go clown to the tracks where the train came in . Th. was Maggie May descending from a car , in a blue silk dress , . a little straw hat for springtime , with a bunch of blue-bells on it Kip saw everything in a flash , and would love blue-bells and bl dresses forever and forever after . She was a grown young lady now , very sedate , yet happy , . so glad to see them . She came hurrying , and gave Roger a hug ; she went on hugging him , until the tears came into her ey She shook both of Kip 's hands , and stood looking the two men ovfirstone and then the other . " Oh , Roger , you are pale and thi You have been overworking ! " It was the tact of a girl who w used to managing men . To say , " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " overworking " was dignified . To Kip s said : " You do n't look a day older ! "  --  and that was not so goo , because Kip was tired of being the " kid , " and having Jerry t , him he would never grow up till he cut loose from his mothe apron-strings . He was almost twenty-four now , but stood the as much rattled as a schoolboy . Maggie May told them scraps of news from home , and what s  --  of a trip she had had , and how glad she was again , and the msagesLee , ; lad sent them , and how he had planted another crop , spite of the fact that he did n't know if there would be any mark : The red-caps had gathered up her bags , and they were in the el vator , on their way to the Fessenden auto . Roger 's suitcases we already on the front seat , and Maggie May 's were piled in . S. asked , " Where are we going ? " and Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to say good-bye ; but Maggie May sai " Oh , no , I want to have a chat with you . Ca n't we have tea som where ? " So , of course , Kip was in the seventh heaven , where t  --  lovely blue angels dwell , wearing blue-bells in their new spring ha . Roger told the chauffeur to drive them over towards Fifth A , and they went into one of those fancy places conducted by tty Marie , or perhaps by the Countess Galupsky , who was the tar 's first cousin , and had her toes frostbitten while fleeing to changed from the Bolsheviks ; you feel you are in Holy Russia , ause there are shining brass samovars , and the sandwiches have 1 caviare in them , and the serving maids all wear droshkysisit kulaks ? Anyhow , there are little tables where young men d women can sit and look at each other by the light of pink lampshades , and say over and over again how glad they are , and change the news about their relatives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Sister Lelia 's new baby is doing , and but Mama 's neuralgia , and what the hard times have done to the war-planters , and " Oh , Roger , I 'm just dying to see the new play ! " Said Roger : " I 'm not at all proud of it . It 's one of these smartings , that you have to write to please the idle rich . " " Oh , but Roger , Cousin Jenny wrote that everybody was talking nit it ! " " Just a measure of the emptiness in their heads , " said Roger . Maggie May looked at Kip , with a frown on her face . " What 's happened to him , Mr. Tarleton ? I never knew him to be humble ore . " Said Kip : " It 's the hard times , Miss Maggie May . These people New York thought the world belonged to them , but now they 've to go to work for a few months . " Maggie May would now take up with her brother the job she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would behethe driver of a water-wagon , the conductor , guide , and funcarywho speaks through a megaphone and keeps the passengers rtained ; she would be the bumpers , front and rear , the shock absorbers , the cushioned springs  --  everything about a water-wagonh may conduce to the comfort of a passenger and tempt himay on board . It was going to be a harder job this time . Maggie May could n't by playing seven-up , for Roger declared that card-games had contrived by and for morons . She could n't do it by calling company , " for Roger declared that " company " drove him to . She could n't read to him , because his idea of reading was a book and skim through page after page , and after a scoreP190of pages , throw it down with a cry of " Tripe ! " or " Slush ! " " Swill ! " The reason Roger wrote books  --  so he declared  --  w because most other people 's stuff was so " lousy . " No , the only thing Maggie May could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must learn to understand his strange prejudices , a the set of code words he used : why it was so dreadful to be " Philistine , " and what it meant to be " bourgeois " - not overlookit the fact that if you were a woman you were " bourgeoise , " while if it was a group , it was the " bourgeoisie . " Prominent among t members of this despised class was the " epicier , " or " grocer , " term applied to writers who sold their stuff to the ordinary mah zines . Sometimes Roger shifted from French to German , at called the stuff " Kitsch , " and the writers " Hottentots . " Such ter of scorn had special meaning , and the only sure way to avoid havi them applied to yourself was to learn to apply them to others . Maggie May needed help at this job ; and the person she look to was Kip . He had timidly suggested that when she was in t city , she might let him take her to lunch ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone  --  she was coming in to a matinee , a would he meet her at the Countess Galupsky 's at a quarter p five ? Needless to say , he would , and he did . She came alone ; when they had got seated , and had given their order to one of the members of the Russian aristocracy , Maggie May fixed her gentle and observant brown eyes on Kip , and said " I have just been to see The New Man . ' " " Oh ! " said Kip , his conversational powers failing him . " I did n't tell Roger I was going , " added the girl . " In fact , did n't tell anybody . I just bought a ticket and went in . " " A strange play , " he ventured . " I feel as if I had just waked up from a dream . I ca n't realize that my brother has written such a play ; or that there are people who go to see it , and laugh at it  --  enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think Roger wanted you to see it , Miss Maggie May . ' " I have to understand him , Mr. Tarleton ; the world he lives in and the people he meets . It 's no use for me to stay in the Tech . country , nor to bring the Teche country up here . I want you t. give me some advice . "  | " I 'll do the best I can , certainly . " " Well , the first thing I have to know about is that Miss Ashton . " A sudden feeling of warmth began to take rise in Kip ; starting arently at the heart , and spreading upwards through the neck , cheeks , the forehead with the ' queer horizontal wrinkles of perxity . " Yes , Miss Maggie May , " he said , weakly . " I want to know what sort of person she is ; and I want to know tit her relations with my brother . " " Yes , Miss Maggie May "  --  still more weakly . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But seems there are people concerned to keep you informed about pleasant things . Somebody took the trouble to cut little pieces  --  m the papers and mail them to me . They did the same for Mama , d each of us kept the secret from the other for quite a while . " Kip was thinking , as quickly as his wits could work . He knew t Maggie May was doing something which , according to her  --  e , was revolutionary ; he knew that it was taking a lot of moral effort , and it was his duty to meet her half-way . But there was t accursed hot flush stealing all over his face ! Presently she  --  would notice it , and she too would begin to grow red . She was cing herself to look straight into his eyes , the big , earnest blue-y eyes which she trusted ; she was keeping her voice casual and matter-of-fact , and he must manage to do the same  --  just as if it e the custom for young ladies of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea and discuss their  --  hers ' mistresses ! ' Is it really true , Mr. Tarleton , that she and Roger are living together ? " ' Yes , it is true . " ' For how long a time ? " Ever since the play started , I 'm told . " ' They were in France together ? " ' Yes "  --  and somewhere in the deeps of Kip the voice of Jerry r was saying : " You see , I was right ! The girls are different allays ! " ' ell me what sort of person she is , Mr. Tarleton . " Well , you saw her on the stage  --  " he 's attractive in many ways , and seems quite refined . I wouldshe was a lady if I met her . But the part she was playing so strange to me , I could n't separate her from it , and so I 'm Infusion . You have met her ? "  | " A number of times . " " What do you think of her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I like people i I can . " " How does she get along with Roger ? " " At first they did very well , but in France they quarreled som - and now they quarrel a lot . " " Please tell me about it . " He hesitated . " It 's not easy , Miss Maggie May . " " But I have to know , or I 'm helpless . Has Roger talked t. you about her ? " " Once he did . " " And ca n't you tell me about it ? " " Well , you see , it was when he had been drinking . " " You must really help me , Mr. Tarleton ! It 's no use trying t. get along according to home standards up here . I 've got to meRoger'sfriends , and learn to talk like them . " ( " God forbid , Miss Maggie May ! " Kip found himself about to say ; but he kept a bridle on his tongue . ) The sister went on with her cross-examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got the painful story of the ro between Roger and Lilian  --  all but some of the offensive name - which the playwright had applied to his flame . Kip felt the need of pointing out the mitigating circumstances  --  that Lilian and Roge both worked very hard , overworked , in fact , and were frequent ( under a heavy strain . Also , one had to remember the world the lived in , its different customs and points of view . " People do wh. - they please up here , Miss Maggie May . " " Yes , " said she , " and I do n't blame them for that . I blame the for what they please . " She gave Kip a moment or two to digest this , and then we on : " I 've had a lot of time to think over this problem . I kno Roger does n't believe in any religion , so I would n't blame hi because he did n't consider it necessary to say marriage vows befor. a clergyman . What I ca n't understand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really love and respect . " " Well , I 've no doubt he thought he did , in the beginning , Miss Maggie May . "  | " I suppose the trouble is , he did n't take long enough to make his mind . " Again there was a pause . " I have this problem decide : I must n't seem too straight-laced , or I 'll just irritate ) ger ; on the other hand , if I make too many concessions , I 'll loseself-respect , and maybe his : What I wanted to find out is , ether I ought to try to separate him from that woman , or whether ought to meet her , and be friendly to her , and try to get her to 1p me . " " She 'd be suspicious of you , Miss Maggie May . Roger has n't red her the bitter knowledge that he thinks her his social inferior . " " I do n't want to be a snob , " said the girl . " I do n't look down her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , ca n't pretend that I like the way she earns it . " ' , Chat would seem very snobbish to her , " replied Kip , with a tile . " She thinks it 's a good way . And besides , when you have  --  earn your living really , you ca n't afford to be so particular . I n speak for those who have been poor ; I know how uncomfortable can be . " So Maggie May became humble towards a Broadway theatrical r , and asked all sorts of questions about her life and work . She n asked the embarrassing question , whether Roger was the first n Lilian had loved . Kip answered that he was pretty sure he s n't . That would make it seem less cruel to separate them , added aggie May . Thus they sat , plotting Roger 's future , and Kip could n't help smiling again . How furious Roger would be if he would hear them ! Or would he burst into laughter , and tell them go ahead and do their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May . They are n't suited each other , and Lilian 's life is n't the right one for Roger . She inks , and keeps him with a drinking crowd , and that 's the thing t really counts . " " Yes , I suppose nothing else would matter so much , if people did n't drink . It 's the same way out at Cousin Jenny 's ; they do n't drunk there , but they serve liquor all the time , and it 's forever der Roger 's nose . It seems to be the same wherever you go . " " I hoped it was going to be better when we had prohibition , " sighed Kip . " So did I ; but it has n't seemed to make any difference at all  --  least not with people of our sort . Mr. Fessenden has a big stock his cellar , and he 's bitter against prohibition , and makes it a point honor to go on exactly the same as before . "  | " Well , I suppose his stock will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They talked prohibition for a while  --  like everybody else in the tea-room . The new law was in its second year now , and there w a new president to enforce it ; a Republican president , that form . senator named Harding , who had been selected by the " wets " t put a kink into the war prohibition measure , three or four yea back . But neither Kip nor Maggie May remembered the record this senator from Ohio . All they knew was that he was a fin looking man , who made noble speeches to the effect that it was t duty of every good citizen to obey the law . He had appointed attorney-general , the official charged with prosecuting law-viol tions , a friend of his from Ohio , a certain Mr. Daugherty ; and th ' gentleman also made speeches , saying that the law must be obeyed . and that those who broke it would be sternly dealt with . So K ' and Maggie May felt hopeful , and waited for signs of the dryin up of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes of the Island of Manhattan  --  wherever the well-to-d. gathered to display their well-to-do-ness . " If only Roger could n't get anything to drink ! " sighed Maggie May . " Then all our troubles would be over ! " It was exactly wh Kip had been sighing over his father , for the twenty-three yea , of his life , less three or four before he had known what was t matter . There must have been a half million children in th Island of Manhattan who had said it all their lives  --  or would ha said it if they had known what was the matter . The discussions of prohibition on the Island of Manhattan ha . never been hotter than they were at this time . There was an organ ization calling itself the " American Liberties League , " which ha . set out to organize a mass demonstration against the law . It laid . plans for a gigantic parade up Fifth Avenue , to take place on tFourth of July ; with the help of much publicity from the new papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signatures of 202,671 men and women who promised to march . His Honor , the Mayo and numerous city officials agreed to review the demonstratio which was to be an " early morning till late night " affair . As it happened , there had been , in the course of a couple of years many violations of " American liberties , " which the editors of Newp195York newspapers had known all about . Only a fortnight before the ohibition amendment went into effect , agents of the Department Justice had carried out a series of raids in a hundred cities and towns of America , upon those working-class leaders who ventured protest against a private war which President Wilson was carry --  on against the people of Russia , using the money and arms and es of the American people without warrant of Congress . Some nisands of men , women , and children had been herded into jails , der shocking conditions of crowding and deprivation ; they were Id for months without warrant or trial , and nine-tenths of them ere finally turned loose without compensation for their sufferings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these events while they were happening , but no one of them had considered it  --  essary to turn out and march up Fifth Avenue in defence of American liberties . " If discontented workingmen had attempted ell a march , they would have been charged by mounted officers , ebbed insensible , and flung into jail wholesale ; but when it was question of influential gentlemen defending the liquor traffic , from ich the police had been accustomed to derive tens of millions ofrs income , the police would escort the marchers , and His Honor , Mayor , would wave a beer-bottle at them . This Wet Parade passed within a block of the Tarleton House , of course Kip turned out to see it . It was n't the enormous affairhad been promised ; the Anti-Saloon League had a tabulating Hine to check up on its enemies , and certified the number of searchers at 14,922 , including everyone who walked or rode , even bandsmen and the cops  --  and one New York publisher who , in excess of his ardor , managed to walk past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers apologized for the II attendance , explaining that it had been hot , and that most of e who signed pledges had preferred to spend their holiday at the Iles . It was a coatless and not very handsome procession , with and white banners , proclaiming : " We Want Our Beer ! " andWant Wine With Our Meals ! " A group of veterans saidsay to Congress : " You Care for Our Crippled Soldiers  --  Our als Will Care for Themselves ! " A forty-foot sign , borne by en men , declared an insurrection : " The Volstead Act Must Go ! I told the Eighteenth Amendment to be Unconstitutional ! IfBe Treason , Make the Most of It ! " A waggish person who doubtless been looking at the cartoons in the newspapers , hadred a sign , reading : " Only a Mother Could Love a Prohi- bitionist 's Face . " To him the prohibitionists shouted back : " Who loves a drinker 's face ? " There was a literary delegation , and Kip saw his friend Jerry tall , erect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " La Supper , " mounted on a pole . Another crusading editor carried painting of the " Marriage of Cana "  --  the point being that on t latter occasion Jesus had turned water into wine , and on the form he had turned wine into his own blood . These protestants march solemnly , as became religious crusaders , paying no attentioneither cheers or hisses . Kip could not help wondering what Jesus had to do with th booze parade . He knew positively that Jerry Tyler had no tra of belief in any Savior ; in fact he had heard the clever editor a vance two hypotheses  --  first , that Jesus had been insane , and secon that he had never existed . Kip felt sure that not one of the edito of the " Gothamite " paid heed to the ideas of a long-dead Jewi messiah in regulating his personal conduct ; whether as to looki upon a woman to lust after her , or turning the other cheek to man who struck him , or selling all his goods and giving to t poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next month ' salary-check . But here suddenly these ultimate moderns discover that the commercial exploitation of ethyl alcohol depended up what Jesus had taught about it ! In the memory of Kip that bedraggled Wet Parade lived as symbol of all the parades of drinkers he had been watchi throughout his life : the parades of revellers staggering into t Tarleton House ; the Saturday night parades from Sandkuhl 's a from the " lobster-palaces " ; the parades of bacchantes celebrati election victories ; the parades of " intellectuals " romping down t ball-rooms of fashionable hotels ; the parades of taxicabs bearing poets and playwrights home from pent-house dinner-partie American life had been a Wet Parade , ever since the first hour t Kip had opened his eyes upon it ! Maggie May brought from her cousin an invitation for Kip spend a week-end at the estate on Long Island ; and Kip was i something of a panic over it . He had never been to such a plac and was quite sure he could n't be really wanted by the great lady of " Broadhaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nonp197Ionise ; he was as good as anybody in the world , and if Mrs. Chilcote ad been willing to invite him to her hone , Mrs. Fessenden would understood that it was proper , and even expected , that she should Invite him to hers . They helped Kip to pack his suit-case , and gave iii detailed information as to the habits of the wealthy and fashionable . How ladies in moderate circumstances come to know bout such things is a mystery , but they always do . So on Saturday morning Kip took the train to a station far out n Long Island , and Maggie May met him in a shiny sportcar , and drove him to the Fessenden place : You turned off the highway to a gravelled drive , and went past a mile or so of fields and meadows , and then a pine forest ; you came to a ridge , and trough the trees you saw a two-story mansion of red brick , in w Georgian fashion . You made a sweep around it , and stopped t a porte-cochere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of little harbor with a pier and several boats . A man came out and took Kip 's bag , and he went into an entrance hall which was like museum or such public institution . Kip 's heart went down into s hoots  --  not so much because of fear that he would n't know whatdo here , but because he saw that the dream of his heart was hopeless . Never , never could it happen that Maggie May would come down to his social level ! When he went to his room  --  one of those bedrooms which had a an Dyck hanging in it  --  he found that his flannel suit for the let-noon had been laid out on the bed . When he went again , hisning clothes were ready , with buttons and studs and sleevelinks in place in his shirt . If there was anything he did n't know , Mrs. senden 's servants would teach him ! They even had his knivesforks and spoons arranged in proper order beside his plate , so t he had only to take those which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , and he had only to bow to the ladies , and e hands with the gentlemen , and say , " I am pleased to meet "  --  and then get them to talking about themselves , and show in- in what they said , and thus his social success would be red . It was Maggie May 's formula , which she had revealed to in a moment of mischief . He tried it , and it was magic. luncheon was served in the dining-room , upon the table h had been plundered from a fifteenth century French abbey . the head of this aged and much scarred board sat the hostess , looking older than when he met her last , Kip thought , and even sadder . She was a very kindly person , underneath the stately manner which she wore as a sort of protective disguise . She had a son , about twelve years old , rather pale and fretful ; there was a governess for this youngster  --  and Kip noticed that " Master Bobbie " always objected to whatever he was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was another lady of uncertain age apparently a sort of companion to Mrs. Fessenden , and anothe quite old lady , who , as Kip learned later , had once held this posi tion , and was now a pensioner . There were a number of d pendents living at Broadhaven ; Maggie May explained that it wa the penalty of having a great deal of money , plus a kind heart . Th social status of these dependents was uncertain ; they appeared a some meals and not at others , according to whether company wpresent , and how important the company was considered . After the lunch , Maggie May took Kip for a walk over t place , and showed him the rose-gardens and greenhouses , and th aviary full of strange birds , and the stables with the saddle-horse and little Shetland ponies  --  there was no one to ride them an more , but they were kept for sentimental reasons , like the old ladies in the house . Maggie May explained that there were two older children , a boy and a girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a safe distance  --  the cottage i the pine-trees where Roger was staying , and explained that Roger never came to lunch , and frequently not in the evening , if he wa writing . She took him down to the pier , and the boatman got out a little cat-boat . Maggie May knew all about boats  --  they were part ( 1 ) 7 the life at home . She sailed about the little private harbor , pro tected by stone breakwaters , and showed him the light-houses , on . ' on each side of the entrance , the lights being turned on and W. from the shore . Mr. Fessenden had a yacht , and often came bac and forth to New York in this , and when he was coming at night , he would telephone , and the lights would be turned on . Otherwise the harbor was ( lark , so that no one might use it . There were ex citing stories about dope-smugglers in speed-boats , and recently . rum-runner had sneaked in one stormy night , all unobserved , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and footprints of men in the sand of the beach . So they talked about prohibition  --  like everybody else on Long Island . Because the well-to-do would not give up their pleasure ,  |p199ere  had developed with great suddenness a surreptitious and nocrealsystem , which caused the highways of Long Island to echo 1 night with the rumble of heavy trucks . Signal lights flashedd bonfires flared , and speed-boats came sneaking into coves and rhors , both on the ocean and on the sound . Outside , beyond the al three-mile limit , lay vessels from Halifax , loaded with the ell-known Canadian rye , and from Britain loaded with the wellownIrish and Scotch , and from Cuba and the Bahamas with t Bacardi rum which was indispensable to parties both on Macdougal street and Park Avenue . Whatever you had money to pay  --  r , you could get in America . Said Maggie May , sadly , it would some time yet before Roger could be compelled to behave . They talked about Roger , and the basis upon which he was prodingat present . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no , his pride did not permit that , it would make him too conspic  --  us , and he would be bored to death by comments upon it . He s going to show that he could drink " like a gentleman , " and not lice a stock-broker at a whoopee party . " Maggie May had seen  --  much drinking of " gentlemen " at home , that she did not find is formula consoling ; it was pitiful , she said , the way drinking people devised programs and schedules for themselves , and forgot m as quickly as New Year 's resolutions . Kip told sad stories but his father , and Maggie May did something she had never done therto  --  she talked about the elder Roger , and the many sorrowful rs she had spent with him . " You and I have had our lesson , " she said . " It seems a dreadful thing , that fathers have to destroy themselves , in order to teach children how to live ; and even then , some do n't learn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay . The bright blue eyes slapped against the boat , and the sun made little rainbows inspray ; all over the place was dancing and sparkling , and in thethe sky the clouds were great white billows . Maggie May , dressed a white outing-suit , sat holding the tiller with one firm brown Id , knowing exactly what to do at every puff of the breeze and of the boat . Everything was lovely , everything young and gay ; they could n't be happy , they could n't think of themselves , nor the dancing world  --  they had to come back to the problem of a t , shut in a brick cottage back there in the pine-trees , wrestling th a doom , like a demigod in a Greek tragedy . There 's something fundamentally wrong in Roger 's life , " said Maggie May ; " something he ought to deal with . "  | " He 's too exacting , " said Kip . " He expects too much of people ! " " I was talking with him last night . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life is passing , and he 's a failure . " " l31 t good heavens , Miss Maggie May , he 's only twenty-six , and he 's made himself a great name ! He 's written a book of poems and a play that all the critics called masterpieces ! " " Yes , but he says that 's only a beginning ; he expected to do s. much better . The truth is , Mr. Tarleton , he 's vexed because there was another play that had more success than his this season . H says New York is a nine-day-town , ' and The Golden Jail ' is for gotten already . He ca n't bear to be a back number . " " Do all writers have to wear themselves out trying to beat each other ? " Kip would never cease to wonder about the ways of writers . " Roger is fretting because he wants to write something great , . and it does n't come the way it used to . He 's irritable , and blames every little thing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expecting him to dinner , or because somebody expect him yesterday . And of course when he 's trying to cut down . on his drinking , he blames his difficulties on that . He says h. always drank all he wanted when he was writing ; nobody can stay on the water-wagon and have any real inspiration . Do you think that is true , Mr. Tarleton ? " And so they had yet another problem to solve ! Back at the house , they sat on the loggia , chatting with Mr Fessenden and a couple of her old ladies . Presently there arrive . two house-guests , a young polo-player , sun-tanned and handsome and his sister , a blonde beauty at the peaches and cream stage . The old ladies disappeared , and the young people talked about sports , until they all went upstairs to dress for dinner . When Kip canto down again , he sat and read the evening paper until Maggie Ma appeared ; then he got up to meet her , and his head went sort of light , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servan had offered him . He had never seen Maggie May in evening dress before , and it seemed that such loveliness ought not to be sprung on a man all at once . She wore a gown of pale blue  --  Kip did n't know the names for all these filmy things , nor for the perfumes that go with them . Her arms ana shoulders and bosom  --  hep201could n't endure to look at them , so instead they went out and looked t the sunset , and inhaled the odors of honeysuckle , wafted to them in the dying breeze . There was a new moon in the sky , and a right , still planet , and to Kip it was like something in a dream . Across the lawn came Roger strolling . He was coming to dinerout of courtesy to his friend the hotel-clerk ; Maggie May said t was a courtesy he had recently refused to a countess . Roger isposed his tall form in a lawn-chair , and they talked about the news from New York ; among other things the announcement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was engaged tomarried to the well-known " ad-writer , " Eleanor Follet . " Why have n't I ever met her ? " asked Maggie May , innocently ; and Kip wondered , did this decision of Eleanor 's have any connection with the possibility that , as a duly established young matron , she might someday be invited to spend the week-end at Broadhaven ? The old ladies were not at the dinner-table . Besides the poloayerand his lovely sister , there came another young couple of shion , and an Italian singer from New York . This latter was irty or so , the son of a noble family , who had sung in the Metropolitan Opera House , and more important yet , in the Ziegfeld ollies , and received as much as a thousand dollars a night for concert work . He had raven black hair , straight as an Indian 's , and smooth as silk ; he had the smile of a winsome angel , and muscles e a prize-fighter . He was so happy , he said , he was going to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like myself exactly this ay , " he declared , in elegant Oxford English . He sang everything nn baritone to tenor , every language from Choctaw to Arabic , d every style from church canon to the Memphis blues . In all his songs that evening , he wooed the gentle brown Maggie ay with the angel smile . He sang love songs , and every word s directed to her ; at least , so it seemed to Kip , who never tookeyes from the singer , and listened with fainting heart . Ofrse the Signor Diabolo would fall in love with Maggie May  --  ho could fail to ? And how could she fail to be fascinated by such marvellous being ? He had been brought there for that purpose ; 1 sorts of men would be brought , who came under the classification I " eligible " : young men of fashion , heirs of millions , carefully  --  . en by a Southern lady of the old school of match-makers ; per 's friends , the shining literary lights , the trained drawing- " lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanceId there be for a poor clerk of a family hotel , now sinking rapidly from second class to third or fourth ? No , Kip had only been invited as an act of charity ; he could hear the discussion which must have taken place between Maggie May and her cousin . " Mama thinks a great deal of him , because he 's been so helpful to Roger ; he does n't drink , Cousin Jenny , and so he 's really a very good influence for my brother . " Thus , Kip , while Signor Diabolo told Maggie May that his heart opened at her voice . His own voice thundered to a mighty cres cendo , then died to a melancholy whisper , and Kip thought : " It ' all over ! They 'll be engaged before morning ! " But presently h found himself alongside Maggie May , and she said : " He has a extraordinary range , do n't you think ? " Kip replied , quite truly that he had never heard anything like it . In order that no on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a fascinating per son . " Said Maggie May : " Do you find him so ? Somehow , I ' always afraid of these dark men . I imagine that if they lost thei temper , they might do something dreadful to you . " So after tha Kip enjoyed the party ! Roger was enjoying it also . The young lady of peaches an cream had had the tact to ask him about his theories of pol rhythmic verse forms ; so there was a critical authority explainin Paul Fort  --  that while his structures were irregular , his metre wa really quite orthodox . Roger became lighted up , as always ha pened when he was on his favorite subject ; he was so absorbed tha he let the footman with the brandy pass him by . He had had one cocktail before dinner , and three kinds of wine during it , and small glass of liqueur with his coffee ; but that was n't much for a man of his capacity , and if he let the evening go without any more , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . So long as he was rapt in the ecstasy of poetry , his own or some other man 's , all was well . But not even the most cultured could stand a whole evening of the modern French masters ; presently the young society people were talking about the costume ball at the nearby country club -- and there was Roger , bored and restless , struggling to keep his eyes off the bottle of " Three Star Brandy , " which stood on a nearby serving-table , along with a supply of carbonated water and ginger ale . Kip knew all the signs of drinker 's misery ; every glance of the eyes , every straying of the restless fingers . He knew also thep203behavior of the women of the family , those who shepherd the drinkingmen : the anxious watching , the hasty efforts to make conversation , the meaning glances at one another . The footman came on his next round , and Roger watched him out of the corner of his eye. , Roger clenched his hands and let him get by ; but then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually , and strolled to another part of the room , putting himself where the man would have to pass him again . This time he took one of the little squat glasses from the silver tray . Then with what superb casualness he chatted with the peaches and cream lady , looking down from his lofty height upon the creamy shoulders , and the two little silken straps holding up the filmy dress ! How entirely absorbed he was in a problem of esthetics , and how unaware he managed to be of the glass he was holding in his hand ! Also , how careful not to let his eyes turn in the direction of his sister , or of kip Tarleton , " the little moral demon ! " The whole tragedy of a poet 's life was in that episode ; all the pity and terror of the lost soul , the galley-slave chained to the oar of John Barleycorn ! Chained , seeing his chains , and feeling them  --  but fooling himself by a hundred devices , a hundred elaborate schemes of liberation ! Planning excursions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it  --  yet all the time chained to the oar ! Ashamed of himself , yet pretending to be proud , spurningall aid , and quarreling irritably with those who sought to bring him aid ! Doomed to spend the rest of his days in torment , no less whether he was rebelling against his master , or serving him , and striving to enjoy the service ! A pitiful thing when this happened to an ordinary man , but how much more so when it happened to a man of intellect and genius ! For then you had not merely personal sufferings , poisoned nervecellsand a cirrhotic liver ; then you had poisoned poetry and a cirrhotic soul ! You had a whole society narcotized ; you had drunkards ' fiction , drunkards ' drama , drunkards ' art ; you had drunkards ' newspapers and editorial pages , drunkards ' clubs and propagandasocieties , drunkards ' college presidents and statesmen  --  and two drunkards ' political parties ! In all the activities of these individualsand organizations , you observed the same phenomena of restlessness and irritability , baffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of hepatic tissue indurated and contracted , and stained yellow with bile pigments in the ductrminations !   THE marriage of Jerry Tyler had important consequences for the Tarleton family . Once more they lost their " star boarder " ; for Jerry was going to stay permanently in Eleanor 's apartment , where he would n't have to pay rent ; marriage was a wonderful institution , declared the associate editor of the " Gothamite , " in the mood of gay cynicism affected by that publication . This set Kip to considering the problem of the Tarleton House , what it meant to himself and his mother and his aunt . They worked hard from morning till night , and carried many burdens for other persons ; at the end of the month , when they reckoned up , they had less than nothing , and had to pay board to themselves . This had been the case ever since the business slump ; and apparently the slump was going to last quite a while . What was the use of it , Kip wanted to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were " ahead , " if they had the sense to quit in time . As for Kip , he could find some sort of job , and if he worked as hard at it as at being a hotel-clerk , he could certainly earn his keep . The lease of the three dwellings which composed the Tarleton House was soon to expire , and the landlord had not made himself agreeable ; let him take the job of finding anothertenant , said Kip . The " good will " of the establishment was nothing but a deceptive name in times like these ; it meant the obligation to " carry " people , and acquire a lot of promissory notes which it would be unpleasant and perhaps impossible to collect . Why not sell the lease , or , if that could not be done , take what furniture they needed , sell the rest , and move into a little apart-ment ? These revolutionary suggestions at first threw the ladies into a panic . The Tarleton Ilouse had been home to them for sixteen years , a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned to take its cares and troubles as part of the natural order . But Kip pointed out , they no longer had a child to raise , and noP205longer had a " drinking man " to fear . Nevermore would Pow leave them stranded , unable to pay their board-bill . After sixteen years of working for other people , why not work for themselves ? Night after night they debated the pros and cons ; they dug out their old account-books , and priced apartments , and reckoned expensesthis way and that . Aunt Sue wanted to keep one of the houses , and reduce the scale of the establishment , and keep only the best of their boarders , and their cook , who had grown old in their service , and Taylor Tibbs , for whom they felt a moral responsibility . For such a small establishment , no clerk would be needed , and Kip could get an outside job . They argued this back and forth , through the hot summer months , when trade always got worse , and while the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightful famine in Russia , while the farmers of America were feeding their grain to the pigs , or saving it up to use for fuel in the winter . Only the very rich were sure of their incomes ; the troubles of boarders continued to multiply . Even Mr. Marin , the importer of cheeses , whom they had thought of as the Rock of Gibraltar , made the mistake of putting money into foreign exchange ; and now there were attempts at revolution in several countries , and foreign exchange was dropping , and Mr. Marin was forced to take one of the cheaper bed-rooms , a third floor rear . At last Kip had his way ; one evening at dinner , he made the announcementto the boarders  --  a regular little speech , telling how sorry they were , but it was impossible for the Tarleton House to continue in the face of so many difficulties . " Some of you will understand what I mean , " said Kip , and there was satisfaction in saying this in the hearing of persons who had demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cash . The estabishmentwould close one week from date ; to those who had beentheir faithful friends for so many years he expressed his regrets , nd his hope that they would find comfortable quarters elsewhere , and would not fail to see one another now and then . Several of the old stand-bys made speeches in return , and it was quite a sentimentaloccasion ; some ladies had tears in their eyes  --  and perhaps some wished they had been more prompt in paying what they owed . One painful aspect of this decision , which had been entirely over-looked  --  what was to happen to the precious stock of " prewar goods , " which reposed in the clothes closets and under the beds of Mr. Gwathmey of Kentucky , Mr. Fortescue of South Carolina , and the other Southern gentlemen of the old school ? They had laid in a supply which was to them a form of life insurance ; they had assumed the permanence of the Tarleton House , as they would of a savings bank or trust company  --  and here they were betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them , had failed to take thought about the matter , and were embarrassed when confronted with it : these old friends and stand-bys , faithful customers who had paid their bills regularly every Saturday night , would suddenly be forced into the position of criminals , liable to a thousand dollars fine , and a year in a Federal penitentiary ! Yes , such was the threat of that abominable Eighteenth Amendment , and the still more abominable Volstead act which supported , it and gave it effect ! The law forbade the " transportation " or " delivery " of alcoholic beverages ; paying no attention to the fact that perfectly respectable old gentlemen from Kentucky and South ; Carolina , who had never broken a law in their lives  --  unless it was playing poker for money  --  might be suddenly turned out of their boarding-place , and thus compelled to " transport " and " deliver " their priceless stock of the water of life . Unless , perchance , they were willing to leave it in their clothes closets , or on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this problem , the more troubles you faced . From the moment these liquid treasures were carried onto , the street , they would be outlawed , and the persons carrying them would be felons . Any servant might betray them , for a reward ; any prohibition fanatic might do it , for the love of Carry Nation or Billy Sunday ! The truck-driver might decide to deliver the preciouscargo to himself , and if he did , the owners would have no redress . It was becoming a common thing to help yourself to alcoholicgoods in transit  --  there were terrible stories about baggagemenon trains , applying stethoscopes to trunks in order to hear the gurgle ! Or even supposing you found an honest carrier , he might himself be held up ; that , too , was growing into an established industry , known as " hijacking " ; you read in the newspapers about 1 regular battles fought in the streets . In a crisis such as this men realize their common humanity , and I come together for mutual protection . Messrs . Gwathmey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a conference behind locked doors . Various plans of campaign were proposed ,  |p207And  finally it was decided that Francisco X. Marin , Spanish importerof cheeses , should be appointed generalissimo in charge of field operations . He was the owner Q f a truck , and boss of a truckmanaccustomed to handling cheese-boxes , which , providentially , are of convenient size for the carrying of whisky-bottles . Arrangementswere made , with the secrecy which is so important in military . operations . " Surprise is ninety per cent of victory , " said GeneralissimoMarin  --  that sturdy and rosy , dependable if somewhat vulgar addict to fancy waistcoats and diamond stickpins . So , on the last morning but one of the Tarleton House , there appeared before the establishment a truck loaded with empty cheeseboxes , with a commanding officer sitting alongside the driver . The carrying in of cheese-boxes began ; and what passing policeman . r Federal agent could make objection to that  --  especially when itas known that the Tarleton House proprietor was " right with the . organization , " having recently purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A supply of boxes was delivered o the third floor front in number 39 , occupied by Braxton Bragg wathmey , and a supply to the second floor back in number 37 , ocpiedby Beauregard Fortescue  --  and so on down the list . Each f these gentlemen was waiting , and each got down on hands andknees in his clothes closet or beside his bed , and fell to " transportg " bottles into cheese-boxes . So presently there was the truckman , aided by Taylor Tibbs , rrying loaded boxes downstairs , followed by the anxious injunconsof elderly Southern gentlemen . " Be careful ! Do n't stumle ! " The boxes were loaded into the truck  --  and what passing policeman or Federal agent could object to that ? The vehicle set out with Generalissimo Marin as a stern and vigilant bodyguard . Meanwhile , the Southern gentlemen distributed themselves by taxi-. b , each to his new home ; and so in due course the contents ofcheese-boxes were safely stowed in new clothes closets and undernew beds , and there was no scandal in the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina have tond his declining years in a Federal penitentiary . When the last guest had taken his departure , how strange seemed three houses in their silence ! So many rooms , each eloquent of departed friends or enemies ; each piece of furniture with its sepa- rate story , now brought to a finis . The office , the parlor , the dining-room , the kitchen  --  Kip had spent practically his whole life here , and ghosts walked by day and night . Here was where the Big Chief had lived ; in this room he had played poker , in that he had got drunk ; here in back of the office he had been sobered up , and on this spot he had fallen , and in this bed he had lain until he died . Now the Jews who bought second-hand furniture were coming to inspect things , and the fact that one 's father had died in a certain bed neither added to nor detracted from its value . The family was staying on , in several downstairs rooms , with Taylor Tibbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Taylor  --  he would stay even without salary . They could n't imagine what they would do with him in a New York apartment , but meanwhile , here he was , having carried the last trunk downstairs , and collected his last tip , and shed his last tear over tippers . His race loves excitement , things happening , white folks in a stir ; this past week had . been as if Gabriel had blown his trumpet and the universe had retiredfrom business . Kip joined the army of the unemployed , and began scanning the advertising columns of newspapers . " State qualifications , " " previousexperience required "  --  and Kip had many qualifications and much experience . It must have been mildly amusing to advertisers to open a letter and read : " I shall be twenty-four years old next month , and have assisted in the management of a family hotel for the past seventeen years ! " Also Kip went to make personal application , and let advertisers have the benefit of a practiced hotel-clerk 's smile . But no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and twenty more lining up behind . It was " hard times " in the Island of Manhattan , and Kip realized with sinking heart that employees have troubles as well as employers . At this juncture Maggie May came back from the Adirondacks , where she and Roger had been visiting friends . Kip met her in town and took her to lunch ; she was sunburned , a picture of health , and full of stories about mountain-climbing , a form of recreation unknown in Louisiana . Kip , in return , told of the demise of the Tarleton House , and the unpleasantness of interviewing office-boys . " Oh , but I know the very thing ! " exclaimed Maggie May . " My cousin mentioned that they had discharged their assistant superintendent . I 'll ask her to give you the place . " " But I 'm not competent for a thing like that ! " exclaimed Kip.  | " Do n't admit it , " said Maggie May , out of her vast experience . " You must be competent for anything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know much about the position , but I do n't see why you could n't learn . It has to do with managing employees , and seeing that they do their work , and keeping accounts and so on ; it seems to me it 's much the same sort of thing you did at the Tarleton Huse . There 's a superintendent , and he 'd tell you . " " Of course , I 'd be very glad to try , Miss Maggie May . " " Cousin Jenny said the main trouble was , they could n't find men who were honest . I could tell her you 'd be that . " " Yes , I 'd be that , " admitted the modest young man . Maggie May promised to speak to her cousin at once ; and sure enough , next morning came a telephone call with a strong Scotch brogue , such a rolling of the r 's that it made the receiver rattle . " This is McCallum , superintendent of Broadhaven ; wull ye be comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , and he was . Alexander McCallum was a stumpy little native of a town which he called " Glesghy " ; he had bright blue eyes , bristly hair of a reddish tinge , and a bristly temper . " Meester Tarleton ? " he enquired , and then looked Kip over from top to toe , with the practiced eye of a hirer and firer . " Young man , the fust thing I want to know , are ye one of them that will be tackin ' commeessions ? " " Commeessions ? " repeated Kip : not meaning to correct the superintendent 's Scotch , but really not understanding . " When ye send a feller to buy a lawnmower or a bushel of worrms to feed to the birrds , he has to have a ten precent commeessionfrom the merchant . " " Do you mean I am supposed to get that , or  --  " " I mean that ye are not supposed to . " The superintendent snapped the words out of Kip 's mouth . " Yell have a salary to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer vegetables and fruits , and no more . " " Very well , then , " said the young man ; " I 'll do whatever I agree to do , you can count on that . " ( In this matter of " commeessions , " what Kip found was that McCallum did n't want anybody else to get them , because he reservedthem for himself . When the assistant discovered this , he agonized over it for weeks , and finally told Maggie May , who passed the word on to Mrs. Fessenden . She sent back the message that all rich men 's employees took commissions ; it was impossible to eradicate the practice , and the master of the place did n't want to be bothered to know about it . So that was that . ) The interview continued : " They tell me ye 're supposed to have had something to do with a hotel . What did ye do ? " " I slid a little bit of everything . It was only a small place , about fifty guests , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts and carried up ice water and kept everybody satisfied . Since my father died , and my mother was n't very well , I tended to everything but the meals , and sometimes to those . " " Humph ! " said McCallum . " Ye 're a versateel lad ! And what would ye be expectin ' ? " " I do n't know , " said Kip . " I have never worked for wages . If you 'll pay me what you paid the last man , I 'll do my best to do his job . " " I paid him a hundred and twenty-five for the fust six months , and a hundred and fifty after that . There 's a five-room cottage , with gas and eleetreecity , and there 's the fruits and vegetables in season , and we might let ye have a hit of milk each day if ye keep up the production of the dairy . " " That 's all right with me , " said Kip . " I never had anything to do with a dairy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember . " " Yell have a lot of rememberin ' , my lad , " said McCallum . " We have a dairy and a chicken-ranch , and a stud farm , and an orchard , and a vegetable-garden , and an aviary , and a garage , and a carpenter-shop , and a smithy , and a boat-business , and a port  --  a leetle bit of everything , and whatever it is we have n't got , we 're liable to be havin ' it tomorrow . Ye have the men 's time to keep , and the payrolls to make out , and a lot of buyin ' to do , and the bills to check , and a hundred things that ye never know till they happen , when somebody breaks something , or one of the young people wants to keep a pet panther or learn to run a flyin ' machine . Yell have a car of yer own , and mind ye , ' t is fer business , and not fer tackin ' out the gurrls . " " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand : they tell me ye 're a friend to some of the people up yonder "  --  the superintendent stuck his thumb in the direction of the mansion . " Yes , in a way . "  | " Ye have been a guest there , I hear ? " " Only once , " said Kip , apologetically . " Weel , of course , that 's yer private affair . If ye can stand that sort of life , I have nowt to do with yer off hours . But I have this to say about beesiness hours , yell be on the job and doin ' yer worrk , and if ye do n't , ye may go on to be a friend of the family , but t'e 'll not be employed by Alexander McCallum . " " Of course , I understand that . " " Meself , I 'm no believer in the mixin ' of society and beesiness , Meester Tarleton , and I said it to the mistress when , she spoke about ye . Said I : If I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend to the family , then it 's good-bye to the effeeciency of this estate , ma'am . ' " " You do n't have to think about that , " said Kip , quietly . " I 'm asking no favors . " " Weel , ye say that , and ye mean it , I 'm no doubtin ' , " said the superintendent , grimly ; " but ye may forget it in time . There is them that worrrk , and them that play , and the least they have to do with one another , the better in my opeenion . " Kip and his mother and his aunt moved out to the little cottage , taking the best black walnut furniture from the old home . There were two bedrooms downstairs for the ladies , and above was a bit of attic which was not counted as a room , but was made into a " den " for Kip . The fruits and vegetables were abundant , and so was the gas and electricity ; the milk was of the best and presently was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even that of Taylor Tibbs . When Roger heard that this friend to drinking gentlemen was out of a job , he put the case before his cousin Jenny , and Taylor was installed at the bottom of that large social pyramid , the Fessenden household . Once or twice a week thereafter he would drop in on the Tarleton ladies , and stand and grin , and ask if there was any hard work to be done ; if there was , and he got a quarter for it , he always showed the same benevolentsurprise . Kip had no trouble with this job . He was exactly the earnest and conscientious soul that was required ; full of copybook maxims about making his employer 's interests his own . He quite understood that it was necessary to be up early in the morning , to make sure that the road laborers kept their time schedule . He understood that the potato-digging machine must not be left out in the rain to rust away . Ile realized that it was necessary to check the load of lumber brought to the carpenter-shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lumber-yard . In short , lie took toward the Fessenden estate the same attitude which he had taken to the Tarleton House ; he worked tirelessly to increase its productivity , and keep clown its expenses , and his attitude to the problem was untroubled by any question as to what use the Fessenden family might be making of the money he saved for them . Kip worked on the place for a week or two before he saw the owner of it . The banker spent most of his days in town , in this time of grave strain in the financial world . He had an apartment on top of the Fessenden Trust Building , and his little yacht would lie for a week or two unused in the " millionaires ' basin . " Then , one Saturday , Kip was getting some instructions from McCallum about the painting of the fence of the rose-gardens ; and here came strolling a dapper little gentleman of sixty or so , with scanty gray hair and a much-lined face . " It 's the boss , " whispered McCallum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , McCallum , what 's the gardener trying to do to the asparagusbed this time of year ? And when are they going to get that boat out of the water ? " So it went , one thing after another . When there came a lull , the superintendent said : " Mr. Fessenden , this is Tarleton , my new asseesstant . " The banker gave a nod of the head , and a motion of one finger instead of a handshake . " Hello , Tarleton . " Then he began talking about the need of a culvert at one place where the road into the estate had a tendency to wash . Evidently , there was n't going to be any nonsense about social relationshipswith employees . Or possibly the great man had never been told that his new assistant superintendent had once been a week-end guest at his home . Anyhow , Kip had become a cog in the machine ; a system reproducingin all its essentials the feudalism of six hundred years back . Richard E. Fessenden III had inherited this estate from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather , and so as far back as local memories went . Most of the employees had been born on the estate , or in the village of Seaview , on the railroad ; to the oldest grannie , the name of Fessenden had been a name of power , and to get a lob at Broadhaven was the goal of life . If you talkedp213with any worker on the estate , you would learn that he was a free American , as good as any man , and perhaps better ; but if it happened that Mr. Fessenden came along you would see the worker touch his hat and lower his tone . Each person took his assignedposition in the social pyramid , and if there was one inclined to self-assertion  --  well , New York was only a couple of hours away , and he could go there and become a taxi-driver , or a gangster , as he preferred . Kip took his position among these employees , near the top , with only Mr. and Mrs. McCallum for his social superiors . His position on the estate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in one of the guest-rooms of the mansion , and had his outing-clothesand dinner-costume laid out by one of the servants . This revolutionary fact made the Tarleton family the object of a devouring curiosity . Instead of being taken at once into the fellowshipof gossip , they would be held at arm 's length and inspected , and discussed behind their backs , as to the possibility that they might be spying upon the other employees , and carrying tales to the master or mistress . Mrs. McCallum came calling as soon as the family was settled . She was a lean , angular Scotch Presbyterian , with brick-red complexion , strict moral ideas , and a stern disapproval of life among the idle rich . But this feeling she dared to voice only to intimates of her own way of thinking ; for the most part , her rage was bottled up , and escaped in snorts and gleams of the eye . She came to look the Tarleton ladies over ; they , of course , returned the call , and had tea with scones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the housekeeper from the mansion , and one of the lady pensioners of the lower ranks . After the Tarleton ladies had departed , the others stayed to discussthem . It was obvious that they were gentlewomen , in spite o f the fact that they had kept a boarding-house . They had been polite , and there was no serious fault to be found with them . It was just an accident that Mr. Chilcote had happened to stay at their hoarding-house , and so had got to know them . They did not boast about it , but only answered questions . The son was a moral young man , in spite of knowing that terrible dissipated playwriter , who had been living openly with an actress in the city . Miss Chil- cote had come and had tea with them , and had taken the young man driving in one of the family cars , late in the afternoon ; and of course that was all right , if Mrs. Fessenden chose to sanction it ; it was coining to be the custom for young women to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure the McCallum daughters were never going to do it . It is impossible for ladies to live entirely without gossip ; especiallythose who , like Miss Dimmock , Kip 's aunt , have never been married , and have no children to occupy their time and thoughts . A chirrupy , lively old lady , who had formerly had charge of eight or ten chambermaids and waitresses , and had made the fancy dessertsfor fifty or sixty boarders  --  and now she had only a five-room cottage ! Inevitably she would know what was going on ! PresentlyAunt Sue was repeating to Kip 's mother the terrible stories of Mrs. Haskins , the housekeeper , about how the maids were behaving with the gardener 's assistants and the young fellows at the boathouse . There were perfectly scandalous conditions prevailing in the dormitories where the men laborers were housed ; and some time back , when Mr. McCallum had discharged the garage-man because he had kept one of the maids out all night , the master had interfered , and said it was none of the superintendent 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Broadhaven was n't a Presbyterian Sunday school . Of course , said Mrs. Haskins , what could you expect , when the master of the place lived as Mr. Fessendendid ? Miss Dimmock asked with awe , was Mr. Fessenden a bad man ? The housekeeper said it was n't her business to talk , but anybody who kept their ears open on the place would get them full . So Aunt Sue and Kip's. mother talked in whispers about these rumors , and how unhappy Mrs. Fessenden looked  --  they could see her from their front windows , cutting big chrysanthemums in one of her gardens . Of course neither Kip 's aunt nor his mother would talk to him about scandals ; but they would tell him about the reputation of this employee or that for slacking on the job , or for selling produce , or for taking cars , out for his own purposes . There were a thousand forms of petty graft to be discovered , and Kip would take his discoveriesto McCallum , and generally the superintendent would say that the situation was hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Scotchman was extremely pessimistic about the state of American morals . Something had happened to workingmensince the war ; they had lost all pride in their jobs , and eachp215one was thinking of getting himself decked out in a silk shirt and socks , and getting hold of an automobile , and taking out a girl and a jug of whisky for the night . Kip , being sensitive , and unaccustomed to feudalism , fell to worrying about his relations to Maggie May , and how they would be affected by his enlistment on the Fessenden payroll . He saw that all the others kept their places in this social pyramid ; so , when she invited him to " come up to lunch today , " he said , with no little embarrassment , " Miss Maggie May , I do n't think your cousin will want me there now . " " For goodness sake , why not ? " " Well , you see , none of the other employees ever visits the house , and I do n't want to seem to be forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarleton ! You are being invited . " " I know ; but I might be embarrassing Mrs. Fessenden , and she might be too polite to say so . They have a sort of discipline here . Naturally , they could n't have their employees calling socially . " " But Cousin jenny is from the South , and does n't feel that way about things . " " She 's living in the North now , and perhaps ca n't have her own way . I know that Mr. Fessenden does n't want to break clown the bars , because , when I was introduced to him the other day , he barely nodded to me . " " I do n't think he knew about you , Mr. Tarleton . You must remember , he 's very busy , having a lot of trouble , just as we are down home . The first chance I get , I 'll tell him about you , and I know he 'll be cordial ; he 's really a very charming person when he warms up . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . If you do n't mention it any more , I wo n't have my feelings hurt . " All right , " said she , " if that 's your idea . But I know it 's quite absurd . " Maggie May telephoned that evening ; she had spoken to " Cousin Jenny , " and Kip was invited to lunch the following day . So he went  --  after notifying the sternly disapproving McCallum , and promising not to overstay his allotted hour . He was received with cordiality , Mrs. Fessenden saying that she had been meaning to call upon his mother and aunt , but had not been very well . She would have a clue in the next few days.  | Of course Kip reported this at home , and so the little cottage was in apple-pie order ; the tea-things set out every afternoon , with a supply of Aunt Sue 's special cookies , and both those old ladies dressed up  --  not too fancy , but the right compromise between oldfashioneddignity and modern enterprise . These were the days when spinsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to show a bit of their ankles , if they had any . The great lady of the domain came strolling over , wearing the grey linen duster and gauntlets she wore when playing in her garden , and carrying a present of chrysanthemums with great long stems . She was tall , rather dark , and must be over forty , with dark rings and the beginning of pouches under her eyes . She had the serene manner of those who get what they want from other people , and do not have to be fussy or eager . She was kind to the two gentlewomen in distress  --  for no Southerner ever forgets how the Yankees once came in and freed all their slaves , and reduced ladies to doing their own work . No , it is the final test of gentility , to judge people by their ancestors , rather than by their purses . Being persons of true delicacy , Mrs. Tarleton and Miss Dimmock did not return this call . They waited ; and after the passage of a couple of months , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses from the greenhouse . Nothing was said about their failure to call , and so , with perfect tact , a social compromise was worked out . Kip would have lunch at the Fessenden home when Maggie May invited him , which was once in a week or two ; but he was not invited to dinner , nor when there was any chance of his having to encounter the banker in his home . So Kip understoodthat he was ranked with the old lady pensioners of the middle order . There was only one flaw in the compromise ; which was the attitudeof the Fessenden children . Children are conservative , and ' when they have been brought up on the apex of a pyramid , they do not relish having strangers shoving in around their feet . There were three children : Richard E. Fessenden IV , known as " Master Dick " ; " Miss Evelyn " ; and " Master Bobbie , " the young one whom Kip had met on his first visit to Broadhaven . All three were tall , taking after their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were impolite , might be called " weedy " ; all three were aris/tocratically pale , and their health was uncertain . Mrs. Haskins , the housekeeper , whispered dire hints to Aunt Sue ; there was " bad blood " in these old families , they had been intermarried too much in the old days . Aunt Sue said , for her part , she thought there was plenty of reason for their ill health in the hours they kept , and the fact that the older boy and the . girl had a cigarette in their . mouths or fingers every time you saw them . Master Dick and Miss Evelyn went to fashionable boardingschools , and in the summer they went motoring to visit friends at Newport or Bar Harbor or the Adirondacks . Now and then , when they honored Broadhaven with their presence , you observed the " younger set " at close range . They were perfect reproductions of the old people , except that they selected for cultivation the faults , and were bored by the better qualities , They sipped their drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy gestures , and tossed them away after a few puffs ; they got their clothes from the right haberdasher , and changed them for every occasion ; they knew who was who in every line of sport , and made it a point to attend every event that was fashionable , no matter how far away . When they met Kip anywhere on the place , they knew exactly the motion of the finger whereby their father had put him in his place . " Hello , Tarleton , " they would say , and then , unless they had an order to give , his presence was forgotten . It was Master Bobbie who was the special torment of Kip 's life . Master Bobbie was always on the place , and into everything . He had a passion for driving motor-cars , the bigger and more expensivethe better ; he was forbidden to drive them outside the estate , but inside he would go dashing about the roads , honking , and exctingroad-scrapers and herds of cows to clear the way for him . Ke liked to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave them tied to the pier , to have the paint knocked off when abreeze sprang up in the night . He liked to get a stick and poke the ! ogs through the pen , and keep them in an uproar of squealing . In hort , he liked to do everything that made trouble , and brought him into conflict with an assistant manager . The carpenter was building a store-house , and putting " bats "  --  n the outside , and Master Bobbie wanted some of these long sticks o play with , so he carried them off . Then he wanted the cartiter'splane , and when the carpenter refused to let him have it , picked it up and ran off with it . It happened that Kip was witness to the event ; and having been told to protect the property ofp218the estate , and see that the men did their work efficiently , he stopped the youngster and blocked his path . Bobbie stood there in a fury , with the tool behind his back , raging and storming at Kip ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to obey anybody but his father , and he took it extremely hard . When he tried to break by , Kip held him by the arms ; his hair fell into his eyes , and when lie opened his mouth to yell , Kip looked into a large red cavern . When he began kicking Kip 's ankles  --  well , he was thirteen now , and tall for his age , so the assistant superintendent had to throw him down and take the plane away from him , and afterwards dodge the stones he threw . In the end the boy rushed off , beside himself , declaring that he would have Kip put off the place at once . As it happened , it was a day when Kip was invited to lunch . He was in the drawing-room when the youngster spied him . " What are you doing here ? You know we do n't allow the outsideservants in the house ! Get out of here ! " " Oh , you sweet young thing , " thought Kip ; but he said not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to read  --  wondering if the youngster would throw an inkwell or an ashtray at him . The boy went off , saying he would tell his mother . He did not appear at lunch , nor did the governess , and Kip could imagine what had happened ; Master Bobbie had refused to come to the table if that " outside servant " was allowed to remain . After the lunch , Kip spoke to Mrs. Fessenden , who said , pitifully : " I do n't know what I am going to do with Bobbie . Nobody can handle him but his father , and he is so seldom here . " " Well , " said Kip , " I suppose I am to do what Mr. McCallum tells me , and take care of the property . " " I suppose so , Mr. Tarleton ; I have every confidence in you . But do be careful and do n't hurt him . " Kip , whose ankles were covered with black and blue marks , promised that he would not hurt Master Bobbie . Roger Chilcote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the little cottage among the pine-trees , and was writing another play . He had managed somehow to work out the problem of visitorsand social obligations ; after all , he would have that problem wherever he went , for there would always be fools pushing in top219have a look at a famous writer , and to bore him with compliments . Roger was n't happy , he would never be that ; but after he had mooned around for a couple of weeks , and grumbled at everything , and cursed a universe of fortuitous electrons , rapidly disintegrating under the second law of thermodynamics  --  then unexpectedly he would turn up at breakfast-time , pale , with golden hair unbrushed , saying : " Well , I got that damned passage written just now . " He would drink three cups of coffee , and say : " I 'm going to sleep , and then I 'll be all right . Cousin Jenny , you can invite that moron of sours , Miss Manchester , or whatever her name is , tomorrow ; but I warn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with any moron , do you 're wasting your schemes . " Mrs. Fessenden , a woman disappointed in both husband and children , had entered into a conspiracy with Maggie May ; they would , between them , find some " nice girl " for Roger to take an interest in . They tried every kind they could think of : quiet , domestic ones , brilliant , vivacious ones , rich and haughty ones , poor and humble ones , blonde ones , dark ones , slender ones , and . those who were reducing . They would invite these as house-guests , or to tea , or to theatre-parties  --  any girl would come anywhere , of course , on chance of meeting Roger Chilcote ; in fact , they would offer themselves . " Oh , Mrs. Fessenden , they tell me Roger Chilcote is stayingwith you . Wo n't you be good and let me meet him ? " They would come ; and maybe Roger would be there and maybe not . If he was , he might start reciting poetry , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennyson , who encountered a worshipfulAmerican admirer at a dinner-party , and uttered only five words : 1 ' 1 like my mutton bloody . " Whatever Roger did , you could be sure he would never ask to meet the young lady again , and often he would n't get her name straight . Miss Sibyl Massingham , graduate of Vassar , and heiress to a good part of the State of Wyoming , would be referred to as " that moron of yours , Miss Manchester . " Roger was following his program of " drinking like a gentlean " : which meant that he never let his sister see him drunk. very now and then he would disappear for two or three days , and  --  0 me back like an old tom-cat from a foray . Was there a woman ine case ? Roger did not tell , and Maggie May did not venture to . It could n't be Lilian Ashton , because she was on the road withnew play . The sister had to be content with the fact that Roger as always gentle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life.  | Maggie May would come now and then to Mrs. Fessenden , a say : " I really must be going back home , Cousin Jenny ; Manta is lonely , and they need me . " The other would reply : " But , M ag May , what will Roger do without you ? " The girl would argue " But Cousin Jenny , I ca n't stay on forever ! Surely , I 'll be wea ing out my welcome . " The response would be : " Do n't talk no sense , child . Ca n't you see that Roger is the brightest jewel in in crown ? All sorts of interesting people come out here , who would n't ever look at me if I had no lion on the place . " So then Maggie Ma would write home that she could n't get away yet . It is a custom in the South to go visiting ; there was a cousin of Maggie May 's Pointe Chilcote , and also an elderly aunt  --  each of whom had col to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their second year . Besides the match-making secret which Mrs. Fessenden shay. with Maggie May , she had another which she shared with old Mr Wendel , the favorite among her pensioners : the fact that she w. going to find a husband for Maggie May . It was a shame for su a lovely girl to be buried alive in that country of malaria and mo quitoes . So , along with heiresses to lure the author of " Th Golden Jail , " there came heirs to meet his quiet and gentle siste Maggie May would receive these " eligible " men , knowing perfect ! well what they were . She would apply to each candidate her fo mula  --  to find out what he was doing , and get him talking about i as quickly as possible . She would say : " Oh , how interesting ! D. you really do that ? And how do you do it , and what do you thin will happen ? "  --  and so on . Maggie May would make jokes about this key to social success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of me in the North . She wondered about a captain of a polo-team -- game which looked frightfully reckless ! Or about a man who w building a boat in the shape of a flat dish , which was going to ski . over the water faster than any dish in human history ! Or one wh. had been close to the South pole , and had to live on walrus-meat Or a professor of mathematical physics , who understood bewilder ing formulas ! Or one who knew about the wheat-pit , and how i worked , and was able to make a million dollars while all the farmers were being ruined ! It sounded cruel , but when she told him so , he explained that there was no way to help it , and if he had n't won ,  |p221somebody  else would have . When she accepted this , he decided that she was a highly intelligent girl , and invited her and her aunt to a theatre-party . Watching this social life , as it were through a window , was Kip Tarleton , the " outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that it was absurd for him to think of Maggie May ; yet he thought of her all the time , and each new millionaire or celebrity caused him another fit of despair . One time he went to lunch , and there was the visiting son of a British cabinet minister ; an insufferableperson who gave lectures  --  only twenty-two years old , yet with the air of a prime minister , and apparently all ready to step into his father 's shoes . He had come to point out to Americans the perils of Bolshevism , and to advocate an international union to put it down . That was all right , so far as Kip could see ; but he could not forgive the insolence of a youth who knew everything about every subject , and told it to a couple of thousand people with an air which said : " Of course you understand , I belong to the claahss which is meant to rule the world . " It must be that he had his eye on Maggie May , why did he keep coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lectures , unless she was figuring o be the cousin of the wife of the future Prime Minister of theWorld ? Poor Kip had a hundred and fifty dollars a month , and a five-m cottage with gas and electricity , fruit and vegetables , milk and titter  --  and eggs , now , as reward for efficiency ! Ile was imagin-g himself with a wife  --  and no place to put her ! " Peter , Peter , Pumpkin-eater , had a wife and could n't keep her  --  put her in a mpkin-shell  --  ! " Would Kip expect his mother and aunt to , eve out of their five-room pumpkin-shell , and rent rooms in the village ? Or would the kind-hearted Mrs. Fessenden make another addition to the list of her pensioners ? No , it was absurd for Kip go mooning around with such an idea in his head . There came news from Pointe Chilcote , and Maggie May told Kip about it . The uncles and brothers had raised another crop of gar-cane , and sold it below cost ; the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes any longer . The First National Bank of Acadia , in which Lee Chilcote was a heavy stockholder , had forced him to put up some of his land as securitynotes which he could n't meet ; and then , right after it , the bankturned round and failed , and under the Federal banking laws , was stuck for double the par value of his stock , having to make that amount good to the depositors . So he was going to have t sell another piece of land , the family heritage  --  at a time whe nouody in the Teche country had money to buy anything . Ordinarily , this would have been pleasant news to Kip . Maggie May was on her way down to his financial level ! But it happened that on this same day , she was going into the city with her cousin to hear the future Prime Minister of the World discuss the subjew. of " Modern Science and the Renewal of Faith . " So Kip got littl comfort ; no , it was manifest that the Fessenden 's would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social scale . IZather , they would renew their efforts to find her a suitable hus band ; and Maggie May would realize that she could no longer hesitate , and " wither up into an old maid . " Pretty soon she would ba telling him that she was engaged to the future Prime Minister , or , perhaps to the polo-player , or to the new " wheat king . " She would owe it to her family to do this  --  and whatever Maggie May owed to , her family , she would surely do . The sensible thing for Kip was to wish her happiness , and stop tormenting himself with vain and futile dreams . But all the same , he was glad when he heard that the precocious young Englishman had started off on a lecture tour to California ; via Manitoba . One winter day Kip went into New York on shopping errands for McCallum ; and since he had to have lunch somewhere , he called up the office of the " Gothamite , " and made an appointment with the cheery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding which had busted up the Tarleton House . Marriage seemed to be agreeing with him ; his tall form was filling out , and his cheeks were round , and his eyes laughing with the joy of life ' in Manhattan . What a time they had , swapping gossip , and putting Kip up to date with the insides of literature ! Roger Chilcote had kept his affairs from his sister , and from the " little moral demon , " but he had revealed them to an editor of , , flippancy and fashion . Jerry told how " Bodge " had had a final row with Lilian , and she had taken up with the leading man in her companyon the road . " Bodge " was now deeply impressed by a " pastel blonde " whom he had met at Jerry 's home some time back , the young wife of an extra-heavy manufacturer of ball-bearings andp223machine-tools . Jerry did n't know just how far things had gone , hit he knew that the lady was in Reno ; and surely there was only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter ! They discussed the progress of Roger 's new play . The poet had gone back to the revolutionary war , and taken a story grim and terrible enough to satisfy the most exacting esthete . Ignoring the comforts of a millionaire estate , Roger tormented himself to attain the mood of a young Tory officer who had to turn loose his Indian allies upon a village in which his former sweetheart was sleeping . The heroine of this tragedy was not an innocent maiden  --  that would have made the story insufferable , mere " movie stuff " ; no , she was the unhappy wife of a merchant of wool and hides . They had no ball-bearings and machine-tools in those backward days , so Jerry explained , but anyone who read the manuscript would be able to pick the wife of the ball-bearing and machine-tool manufacturer . Roger was again being frugal , like a Renaissance painter , using his mistress for a model ! Also , there was gossip about other friends and acquaintances . Come to the editor of the " Gothamite " if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that stuff in the tabs about your boss ? " inquired Jerry ; and Kip said no , he did n't have time for literature . " ' They say Fessenden 's in a jam , " said the editor . " Tie 's got in over his head in German marks . " It appeared that American speculatorshad bought huge quantities of German money , in effect bettingthat Germany would " come back " ; but apparently the German government had determined to shed its old obligations , for the mark took a new plunge every day . Said Jerry : " The master of Broadhavenmay have to cut out some of his fancy pleasures . " This gave Kip a chance to clear up the mystery about his ern -- doyen " What does Mr. Fessenden do that 's so bad , Jerry ? " " Has n't he invited you over to his apartment on Christie Street ? hey say he owns a tenement over there , and has it fixed up inImitation of an Eastern harem . There was a fellow in our office cently , a discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff about our leading social lights ; he offered to take us the place , but we did n't bite . " " Mr. Fessenden does n't look like that sort of man , " said Kip . " If you examine him closely , you 'll see he has a wild eye . Aprentlyhe 's one of those old fellows who have to have ' em young ; ey ca n't get any thrill , unless it 's the first time . And of course it makes it expensive . "  | " Dangerous , too , " said Kip , striving to keep his comments in the proper casual tone . " Nothing is dangerous , if you have the money , " replied the editor of the " Gothamite . " " If blackmailers get after you , you pay them  --  or pay the police . " So Kip had something new to think about , as the train took him back the hundred mile length of Long Island . By golly , you learned something new about the Island of Manhattan every time you went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surroundingcountry ! Feudalism was the word ; or else royalty . Kip , in the course of half a year , had come to realize that he was living in one of those courts about which he had read in ancient days . There was a king , and a queen , and princes of the royal blood , and a swarm of courtiers dancing attendance , and servants and retainers ministeringto their pleasures . And all the attention of the community cen tered upon those at the top ; the rulers living in the limelight , in a. blaze of glory ; tied in a network of intrigue , subtle and yet powerful as fate ; surrounded by a murmur of gossip , multitudinous as the wind in forest trees . We are royalty , and your lives depend upon our whims ! All that you have to do in life is to understand us , and all you think about is to flatter us with your words  --  an , stab us with your secret , deadly hates ! Yes , it was all in the history books ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept secret ; also his cares of state  --  " uneasy lie the head that wears a crown ! " The queen was unhappy , eating ou her heart with grief . The members of the royal line , the heirs o glory  --  they were weaklings , as had happened to princes an . princesses all down the ages . Apparently frail children 's natur can not stand the strain of intrigue and flattery and self-indulgence of wealth unearned and power without capacity . Now , as through out history , the stairway echoed with the sounds of wooden shoe climbing up , and of satin slippers coming down ! Kip thought of that ; he thought , with sudden flashes of illumination , of workingmen who took commissions , and stole time , and ? carried off produce . He understood the demoralization spreading through Broadhaven , and why the sternest of Scotch Presbyterian superintendents had given up trying to check it , and taken to col lecting his share of graft . Why should anybody deprive himself o the price of movie tickets for himself and his girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ' em young , " and be able to pay off blackmailers and police ? And then a thought , most traitorous of all ! If the price of Germanmarks should follow the price of sugar-cane  --  if Richard E. Fessenden III should follow Lee Chilcote down the stairway of history  --  thenat last there might be a chance of Maggie May 's coming to live in a five-room cottage !  | IT was springtime , the busy season of the year for farmers , includingthose on " gentlemen 's estates . " Many more workingmen have to be kept busy , and a conscientious manager will be on the go from morning till night , having little time for social engagements , or for gossip , or for worrying about whom the young lady guests at the mansion are going to marry , or how the master of the estate is enjoying himself . It was a time of bright sunshine , and warm rains falling on crumbly brown earth , and green things comingup , a thousand different kinds , each obedient to its own mysteriousinner laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans ; they know what they want to do , and you can depend upon them ; if you treat them decently , they behave themselves , and do not go wandering off , developing strange and terrifying vices . At long intervals Kip would get a glimpse of his employer strollingabout inspecting his acres , according to the country gentleman tradition . If Maggie May had ever spoken to him about his assistantsuperintendent , he gave no sign , but continued to keep his employeesin their places . Now and then Kip would steal a glance a him , looking for signs of that " wild eye " of which Jerry ha . spoken . He saw a stern and obstinate but rather worried-lookin old man , about whom it was difficult to imagine the dreadful thing which Jerry had told him . It was always hard for Kip to imagine evil ; he took the world at its face value , and was impressed by it dignities and proprieties . He continued to hear rumors about financial difficulties , and looked for signs of these . Every Saturday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to pay the men ? On the last ' day of each month , he wondered about his own check . But he alwaysgot it , and the bank always accepted it , and gradually he was confirmed in his idea that money troubles did n't mean the same thing to the great ones of the earth as they had meant to his mother and father . When you had the Fessenden Trust and the Fessendenp227National behind you , you could always manage to get money , no matter what might happen to German marks . It was the same way at Pointe Chilcote , Kip gathered . Lee had had to sell some land , but there was plenty left , and he had planted another crop of cane . There was nothing else to do in the Teche country ; you had to feed your Negroes , or what would become of them ? If you left the land idle for a season , it would grow up in such thickets that the cost of clearing it would be worse than a price slump . Sugar was bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was everybody 's patriotic duty to say that it would , and to borrow money on his faith . Kip supervised the planting of fields of wheat and rye and corn , of beans and potatoes and celery and lettuce . He saw pale , yellowishthumbs come sticking out of the ground from well-nourished asparagusroots ; he saw rhubarb spreading large green leaves from thick red stems , and bright pinkish spots appearing under the shelter of strawberry plants . He went with his mother and aunt every Sunday morning , and besought the Lord to preserve to their use the kindly fruits of the earth , and the answer to his prayer came in the form of large bundles of produce , brought by one of the gardeners of Broadhaven . His mother was in better health , not having to work so hard , or to worry so much . His aunt was as cheerful and chipper as a sparrow , growing younger every day , she declared . Life wore a pleasant aspect to Kip Tarleton . Springtime was so beautiful at Broadhaven , it was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners . Master Dick and Miss Evelyn came home for their Easter holidays , and for a week there fluttered about Kip 's head the wings of golden butterflies . The weather being warm and dry , the tennis courtsere rolled and marked , and young people came in white flannels nd chiffons , and there was gaiety and laughter , and evidence of the ree spending of money . Dick was a lanky prep-school youth , with pimples on his face and a gold-tipped cigarette between his fingers. velyn was suddenly a young lady , with the airs of a princess , and rightly painted cheeks , and a double scarlet streak across her face . They went back to school  --  and Kip went on overseeing theloughing of orchards , and the scraping and caulking of boats. ntil one night , the telephone routed him from sleep . Mrs. Fes- senden was calling . The chauffeurs had been let off duty , and she had to go to New York by the late train ; would Kip be so good as to drive her to the station ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the door with a car . By the light of the portecocherehe got a glimpse of the face of his passenger , deeply distressed , and on the drive he heard her catch her breath in a sob . " Is there anything I can do , Mrs. Fessenden ? " he asked . " No , " she replied . " Thank you , Mr. Tarleton . " " Would you like me to go to town with you ? " " No , I 'll be met in town . " Then , after a moment , she added : " Do n't say anything about my going . " Of course he promised , and kept the promise ; it was from other sources , perhaps in New York , that the story " leaked . " Along in the middle of the afternoon , the superintendent 's wife came rushing in to Aunt Sue  --  they were now on cordial gossiping terms  --  and opened up : " Oh , Miss Dimmock , have you heard the news ? " Miss Dimmock had n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pollock , the druggist 's wife , just phoned from Seaview ; the papers have come in , and the Evening Star ' says that Miss Evelyn has disappeared from boarding-school ! " Kip 's mother ran in from the kitchen . Impossible for elderly ladies to fail to thrill to such words ! " Oh , Mrs. McCallum ! Oh , you do n't say so ! " " The Star ' has got it all over the front page ! She went to a matinee yesterday afternoon , and evaded her chaperone , and no one has seen her since , and a private detective agency has been asked to find her . " " Did you ever hear of such a thing ! And in the papers already ! " " It 's all over town , Mrs. Pollock says . She wanted to know if I knew anything about it ; of course I do n't , but I 've always said  --  " " Do you suppose she 's been kidnapped , Mrs. McCallum ? " " No , indeed I do n't ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent 's wife glanced at the open windows , and droppedher voice to a delightful whisper  --  " I 've always said that a girl brought up like that , allowed to form such habits  --  you know what I mean , Miss Dimmock  --  drinking cocktails and smoking cigarettes all over the place  --  and with a father setting such an example  --  " " Do you suppose she knows about her father ? " " You ca n't keep anything from the young people nowadays , with these moving pictures , and newspapers full of crimes and sensation . Now she 's following in her father 's footsteps  | " Oh , you really think that ? " " Mark my words , that 's what you 'll find out about it . The paper 'll prove it , never doubt . Mrs. Pollock says they 've got a picture of Miss Evelyn that is n't her at all , and they 've got a headlineall the way across the page : HEIRESS MISSING : SCANDAL FEARED . " On the evening of that earthquake day , there drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village , and out of it stepped a young lady in fashionable short skirt and silken hose indistinguishablefrom skin . " Mrs. Tarleton ? " said she . " I 'm Miss Allison  --  youdo n't remember me , of course , but I was at the Tarleton House once , visiting Mrs. Gwathmey . I-happened to be in Seaview , and I promised the Gwathmeys I 'd be sure to call on you . " So of course Mrs. Tarleton was delighted ; she did n't remember this dashingyoung lady , but she could n't be expected to remember everybody who had visited the Tarleton House in the course of so many years . She and Aunt Sue vied with each other in making themselves agreeable . They talked about how the Gwathmeys were getting on , and how the Tarletons were getting on , and how Kip liked his job  --  Kip happened to be out during this visit , but his mother and aunt told all about his work . Presently the young lady said : " Is n't that a strange thing about Miss Evelyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarleton ladies said they did n't know , and Miss Allison said she was told that the picture in the " Evening Star " as n't Miss Evelyn at all ; what did she really look like ? Aunt Sue told what she looked like , and Miss Allison said : " You never can 11 what is going to happen to girls now-a-days ; I think it 's dreadul , the way they 're allowed to run around with men , and nobody to haperone them , or even know when they come in at night . " Neither Mrs. Tarleton nor Miss Dimmock would have gossiped bout Evelyn Fessenden with a stranger . But when the lady herselfcored to know about the situation , and when all they had to do as to say , " Yes , it 's terrible , " or , " No , I do n't think girls oughtbe allowed to "  --  well , they said it , and in the course of an hour'sat they had said a great deal . They had given the names ofseveral fashionable young men who frequented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told about the cocktail parties of the seventeen-year-old heiress , and admitted that she had been carried into the home several times , and that there had been complaintsfrom the boarding-school about her going off without permission . They even mentioned her fondness for scarlet scarfs and stockings . In short , they gave a detailed picture of the life of a millionaire flapper , in these postwar days when all flappers bobbed their hair , and cut their skirts off so that their garters were as obvious as the vaccination marks on their bare arms . Miss Allison had tea and cake , and then drove away in her taxicab ; and next afternoon the stiff and stern Mrs. McCallum came running , more breathless than the first time . " Oh , Mrs. Tarleton , what do you think  --  Mrs. Pollock says the afternoon papers are in , and the Star ' has got a whole page about Miss Evelyn ! Why Girls Leave Palaces ! ' it 's called ; A Wild Bird Flies from the Nest ! ' They have managed to find out everything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stockings ! " " Good heavens ! " exclaimed Mrs. Tarleton and Aunt Sue in chorus . " How in the world do you suppose they managed to get all that ? " " I 'm sure I 've no idea , " said the chorus . " Those tabloid newspapers are perfectly ghastly ! Mrs. Pollock read me nearly all of it , and it 's the most awful picture of depravity  --  you 'd think we were running a bad house here , Miss Dimmock ! " Such was the Tarleton family 's introduction to tabloid journalism . They kept a terrified silence , and no one ever found out their part in the betrayal of Broadhaven . How the fashionable Miss Allison had managed her trick became evident that same evening , when Taylor Tibbs dropped in for a visit , and said , " Did you see that young lady that knows Missis Gwathmey ? " Taylor went on to narrate how he had gone to the drug-store in the village of Seaviewand this grand-looking lady had come up smiling , and said , " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was n't Joe , it was Taylor . The lady replied with a laugh that she had a bad memory for names , but he had waited on her somewhere , she was sure ; where had he worked before he came to Broadhaven ? So Taylor had said he worked at the Tarleton House in New York ; and the young lady 's face lighted up , and she said that was where she had met him . It was a fixed idea with Taylor Tibbs that anybody who had ever been in the Tarleton House was a superior person ; so he told this young lady how the Tarleton family was getting along , and wherep231they were living , and about the various guests and what had become of them , so far as he had heard . " Who was that old gentleman  --  the one that liked the good whisky ? " asked the young lady , searching her memory ; and Taylor 's face lighted up  --  oh , that Tarleton House whisky , and the days of glory that would never return ! " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the young lady meant Mista Gwathmey , and very quickly she collected information about the Gwathmeys  --  enough to serve her evil purpose . For a period of four days the mystery of the missing heiress was the sensation of the newspapers of Manhattan . They published many pictures of her , all genuine and no two alike ; they published pictures of the mansion in which she had been brought up , and of the boarding-school from which she had disappeared ; they published pictures of her mother and father , and of several young men who were said to be her intimates . They published . statements of police officials as to clues , and statements of leading clergymen as to why girls leave home . They published the history of the Fessenden family , recalling that Evelyn 's father had formerly been the husbandof Gloria Fanchon of the Bouncing Babies Sextet , and how she had led him a dance up and down the Great White Way . Evelyn 's mother had been picked out by " Dickie 's " parents , who had commanded him to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talbot , famous beauty of Mobile , and her cousin was Roger Chilcote , the playwright , who was a guest on the estate , but refused to be interviewed about the disappearance of the heiress . The people of Broadhaven lived in the glare of the limelight , and faced it with mingled emotions . Those who came from the South shuddered with horror ; others , tougher of skin , were thrilled , and wondered if the glare was going to be turned upon them . There were men taking pictures all over the place , and reporters asking questions , to say nothing of police officials and detectives . Everybodyyou met wanted to talk about it , and it was hard to get work done . You got the papers morning and evening , especially the " tabs , " and followed the story from page one to the inside pages , where it ran alongside the department entitled " How Long ShouldGirl 's Legs Be " ( with illustrations ) ; or the other feature : " Should She Tell Him All : With True Stories by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious ; his ivory tower had been invaded by a horde of obscene baboons . He would have liked to take his sister and flee from the pestilence ; but Maggie May pointed out that they had accepted Cousin Jenny 's hospitality in a time of prosperity , and now must stand by her in trouble . So Roger put his work aside , and went up to New York to consult with Jerry Tyler , who had heard a lot of gossip about Evelyn . When the poet came back to Broadhaven , he told Maggie May the news , and Maggie May told Kip and his mother and aunt . It was a time when Southerners drew together , to defend themselves against the baboons . Then , in the midst of it all , the prodigal suddenly drove up in an automobile , and strolled in quite casually , announcing herself as Evelyn , Countess Ensenada ; her husband was out in the car , and presently she brought him in , a dandy little man of thirty or so , with sharp waxed mustaches and a monocle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashionable hotels , and had instantly realized that here was " romance "  --  mainly because he looked like a foreign nobleman she had seen in the movies . She had slipped away from her chaperone , and for four days had cruised about the states of New England in a hired automobile , with stops for meals now and then , and one stop for marriage . What a story that made in the " tabs " ! Especially since it took them less than three hours to uncover the fact that " Count Ensenada " had been born in a tenement on Beeckman Street , on the lower west side of the Island of Manhattan , and had begun his career as a waiter at Mouquin 's , from there being promoted to gigolo in a dancing club on West 44th Street . It took Mr. Richard Fessenden less than three minutes to kick him out of the house ; and there was Evelyn , Countess Ensenada , shut up in her room , guarded by detectives day and night , and the count very much wanted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of newspapers , and the sales thermometer of the tabloids breaking the glass ! Broadhaven was a jail , with a prisoner of state inside , and an army of besiegers with pencils in their hands and copy paper stuffing their pockets . They arrived before breakfast , and did not leave before midnight , unless they were individually escorted to the boundary of the estate . Kip Tarleton had to drop his other work , and devote himself to detecting newspapermen disguised as messengerboys and tax-assessors and salesmen of flower-seeds and magazinesubscriptions  --  " Will you help a young man to get through college ? " Would you believe it , the dashing Miss Allison actually had the nerve to call on the Tarleton ladies again ! She admittedp233that she was a reporter , but insisted that she was truly a friend of the Gwathmeys , and to prove it she brought messages from them , and many details as to where and how they were living , and what they looked like , even to the pictures they had on their walls . It turned out afterwards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a friend of the Tarletons , so that she could come back to the Tarletons and tell them she was a friend of the Gwathmeys ! The " Countess Ensenada " sat in her boudoir and wept ; whereupon the tabloids published a picture of the mansion , with an arrow marking the windows of the weeping-room . Then came the news that a leading firm of lawyers was taking steps to have the marriage annulled , on the ground that the bride was under legal age , and that duress had been used by the bogus count . The State of New York proceeds in this matter according to the practice of the Roman Catholic Church ; proclaiming the wickedness of divorce , and accomplishingthe same purpose by annulling the marriage for those who have sufficient money and social influence . So here was the " Countess Ensenada "  --  the name now in quotes  --  appearing in court , and photographs of her , with a fan held in front of her face . The sob-sisters described her sobbing as she testified how the bogus " count " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the husband was safe in the Argentine , having received several thousand dollars from the family as the price of his absence . Anyhow , the marriage was declared non-existent , and plain Evelyn Fessenden was back in Broadhaven , with no more detectives , but with her parents taking the trouble to know where she went at night . Here was a job for Maggie May . Such a good example she was , for mothers to point to ! A girl of the old-fashioned sort , who did not get into the tabloids , and bring her parents to the verge of nervous breakdown ! " Why do n't you be like Maggie May ? " Mrs. Fessenden would demand ; and so of course Evelyn found it hard to love Maggie May . But she was afraid of her , for Evelyn 's spirit had been broken by the scandal , and the horror of her friends , and it was a long time before she wanted to go anywhere or see anybody . To be kind to her , and try to amuse her  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained , and Maggie May had had experience with a father and a brother . She could not decline the duty , because one can not accept favors , and then refuse to return them in case of need . So Maggie May stayed through another summer , entirely different from the last . Nobody was invited , and only intimate friends came . Roger was working on his play , Master Dick sought his pleasures in homes unclouded by scandal , and Mr. Fessenden remained in the city , betting that the German mark would come back  --  and seeing it drop from four thousand to the dollar to forty thousand ! There was Cousin Jenny trimming the roses in her garden , and Maggie May playing tennis with Evelyn , or trying to get her inter- ' ested in a book . It was a delightful time for Kip , because there were no more Italian singers , or prime ministers of the world , or polo-players , or millionaire wheat-plungers . Every now and then the young ladies would call on him to drive them , or even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . Kip would come to McCallum and say that he was wanted up at the mansion , and the grim Scotchman would growl : " Weel , I suppose if you can keep her from runnin ' away again , ' t is more important than growin ' potatoes . " So little by little Kip was promoted to a part-time job as companion , or what in fashionable hotels is known as a " Gertrude . " Evelyn was polite to him , and even Master Bobbie got accustomed to the presence of an " outside servant " at the family luncheon-table . An odd thing , this living near the rich  --  with them , and at the same time apart from them ; you had to divide yourself into two beings , with quite contradictory psychologies . In the presence of these favorites of fortune , there must never be any hint of care , of limitation or deficiency ; everything must be free , elegant , and abundant . If , for example , a game of cards was being played , Evelyn would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cards a long time . " It would be proper for Kip to rise and ring the bell , and summon a servant , and say , " Please bring another deck of cards . " Somewhere in the mansion was a storehouse of abundance , from which all possible requirements were supplied . And Kip himself must be equipped and outfitted according to these standards of ease and plenty . Never would it do for him to appear at the card-table with a smudge on his cuffs or a trace of a frayed thread in his collar . Never must there be dirt under his fingernails  --  not even the good soil of Broadhaven , got by giving help to the gardener in moving a heavy plant ! No , among the richp235everything was immaculate and perfect , and everyone in the world was free from care . But also , Kip must be able to leave their presence , and become instantly the poor man ! He must save his pennies and live on his income , and be rigid in remembering the difference between theirs and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to them , they would be swift and merciless in their judgment . Even if they offered him a gift , it would be safer to decline , lest he might have seemed to admire the object , or to gaze at it with longing . For one who had a double status like this youth , there were a thousand complications and entanglements , a thousand traps into which his foot might slip . The rich , who seemed so free , so bountiful , were in reality acutely conscious of their property , and all their rights thereto . What else was the basis of their greatness ? Of all their forms of property , the most precious were their women ! All those graces and elegancies , those charms and seductionswhich were the finest flowers of privilege  --  let him who had a double status beware how he set down his foot in that region of entanglements and traps ! Let him not seem to admire excessively , nor to gaze with longing ! Let him never cease to remember the difference between theirs and his ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversity . He had a high sense of honor , and a burning pride . Not for anything on earth would he have taken a penny of the Fessenden 's property , nor hinted for the gift of a book , or a box of candy , or even of a rose to take home to his mother . But when it came to the most precious of Fessenden treasures  --  to one especial woman  --  his armor was of straw . He followed Maggie May about with his glances , he hung upon her words , he carried her about with him in his fancy all day , and through long hours of the night . With his Letter reason , he knew his " place " ; but his dreams forgot it , all through that summer of bliss and torment . It was the duel between fiend and conscience reported by Shakespeare'sLauncelot . Said the fiend : " She will never be any lower than she is now ! Never any nearer to you ! " The fiend would cry : " Wake up , man ! If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German mark will come back , and Mr. Fessenden will be rich again ; the price of sugar will go up , and Lee will pay off the mort- gages ; Roger will finish his play , and it 'll be a success ! Now is your chance ! " " ' Budge ! ' says the fiend ; Budge not ! ' says my conscience . " Kip 's conscience said : " You 're crazy ! You 're plumb off the handle ! A girl like that marry you ? Where would you put her ? What could you suggest to her , that would n't be the proposition of a lunatic ? No ; she would say you 're a fortune-hunter , the cheapest thing in the world ! She 'd have to hurt your feelings , and your friendship would be all over . Be sensible , and forget it . " " Conscience , ' say I , you counsel well ; Fiend , ' say I , you counsel well ! ' " Said the fiend : " But why does n't the girl marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been every sort , and surely some of them must have asked her ! Yet she stays single , and withers up into an old maid . " " Do you notice any withering ? " jeered conscience . " Did you ever see a girl blooming more ? " " That 's all right , " countered the fiend , " but the fact is , she 's twenty-three , and she 's the marrying sort ; she must have some reason . " " Oho ! " said conscience . " She 's sitting around waiting for you to pop the question ! To offer her half your magnificent salary , and half the attic in your cottage ! " " There must be some reason she keeps coming down to that cottage , and sits and has tea with two old ladies , and makes them so happy ! " " She 's the sort of girl who likes to make old ladies happy . She 's all the time doing things for other people . " " There 's lots of other old ladies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you really think , if she wanted you , she could n't find some way to tip you off ? Just a bit of pressure of the hand , or a look from those expressive brown eyes ? " " That shows what a dolt you are ! " said the proper and modest fiend . " You know she 's not that sort of girl . No , she 's waiting for you to wake up and show a little gumption . " " What she 's doing is being kind to a poor boy . She 's paying the debt she owes , because you took an interest in Roger , and tried to help him . But now you 'll be a jackass and spoil it all . " " You say that , because you have n't the courage to ask for what you want , and are trying to justify your cowardice ! You hangp237round , and let your chances slip . Wake up , man ! Budge ! " says the fiend . " Budge not ! " says my conscience . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager took it for fall production . Then Roger wanted a rest , and went off for a month 's motor-tour ; he was indefinite about it , and one did n't have to be cynical to guess that he was not going alone . When he came back , he looked rested and refreshed , and said he had to move up to New York , to give his time to the productionof the play . He had a serious talk with his sister , which Kip learned of in the customary round-about way  --  Roger telling Jerry , and Jerry telling Kip . Roger had considered that Maggie May was old enough to know what was going on in the world about her , and would have to understand her brother , if she wanted to help him . he did n't believe in marriage , a thing quite out of the question for an artist , who was always growing and changing , and needed new influences in his life . That was why Roger had never had any interest in all those young females whom Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them so obviously seeking to take to herself the name and career of a well-known playwright . The sort of woman Roger was interested in was one who took chances with life , and did n't have to have a contract signed in a church register . The poet went on to tell about his exquisite pastel blonde , the divorced wife of the manufacturer of ball-bearings and machinetools ; her name was Eileen Pinchon , and she was going in for " concert work . " She and Roger were lovers , and had been away together . Maggie May would have to know the situation , because Eileen would be with him in New York , and Maggie May would have to meet her and be polite to her , and there was n't any sense trying to conceal from one 's sister what was known to all the rest of the city . It was n't fair to Eileen , because it put a stigma upon their relationship . So there was a show-down , and a modern playwright learned about the point of view of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't believe in religion , and that if he did n't ant to be registered in a church , that was his affair ; but she didn'thow any woman could be happy with a man unless she thought he was going to stay with her . Any woman who pretended to feel differently was just fooling the man , and perhaps herself . They argued about that ; Roger had stories to tell of women who had been the ones to assert their rights , and refuse to tie themselves . All Maggie May could say was , that kind of woman was beyond her understanding . She said that of course she would be polite to this Miss  --  or was it Mrs.  --  Pinchon , when she met her ; if she was the woman who could make Roger happy , Maggie May would be glad . She hoped that Roger had n't chosen another one who drank , and would keep him out all night . Then Roger got on his dignity , as he always did when his weakness was referred to ; he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to worry . He did n't mind adding , for the comfort of his sister , that Eileen did n't drink nearly so much as Lilian Ashton . As a matter of fact , Roger could n't stand a woman who drank more than she could carry . It was the devil , the way they were learning to souse themselves ; it was the fault of this fool prohibition  --  since it was human nature to do what you were forbidden to do . Maggie May concluded by hoping that Roger would n't think she was " high-hatting " Eileen , or their affair , but here was the fact  --  she had been away from home more than a year , and Mama missed her terribly . If Roger had found some one he was happy with , and was going to be busy with the play , then Maggie May might as well go back to Pointe Chilcote . Roger said that was all right , of course ; she had helped him over a time of depression , for which he would always be grateful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that she 'd want to meet Eileen before she went ; she wanted to know her brother 's friends , and understand their point of view . So ended this quite modern conversation ; the sister felt that she was coming on , and with a little practice could manage to achieve perfectly the tone of the New York intelligentsia . When Kip heard this news , the duel between fiend and conscience took on a character of desperation . It became one of those battles in the World War , which were fought all day and night , and lasted for weeks . Maggie May was going away ! He would not see her again for a long time  --  perhaps never ! Was he going to let her go without a word , a hint ?  |p239They  were sitting out on the loggia an evening after dinner ; a quiet affair , en famille , to which Kip had been invited . Cousin Jenny had a headache , and had gone to her room ; Evelyn and Bobbie were inside , fooling with a new device which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a " radio , " whereby you could hear music and speeches all the way from New York . It did n't work very well , and was liable to break into howls and squeaks ; but every now and then you really heard a voice , and it was quite exciting , and young people , and old ones too , would sit at the dials for hours on end , and argue as to who should do the twisting . At least that was the way it was with Evelyn and Bobbie so Kip and Maggie May had the loggia to themselves , with a big gold harvest moon coming up , and scents from the garden providing a form of intoxication not prohibited by the Volstead Act . Maggie May wore a pearl-grey evening gown , and there were those white shoulders and arms which were so perilous to hip . Never had she been lovelier , and never had his confusion been greater . " We 're going to miss you so much , " he said  --  the " editorial we , " in the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , Mr. Tarleton . " " I do n't suppose you 'll be coming back for a long time , Miss Maggie May . " The mournfulness could not be kept out of his tone . " You must come down to Pointe Chilcote . " " I wish I could , but you know how the work is here . " " You must have a vacation ; surely , you 've earned one ! " " Nothing has ever been said about a vacation , Miss Maggie May . " " Well , you should ask for it . I 'll speak to Cousin Jenny . Would n't Christmas be a good time to come ? " " There 's a lot of work right at Christmas , on account of guests . Nit afterwards there 's not so much . " " Well , come in January . Mama and Lee would be delighted to have you . " " Oh , I 'd love to , Miss Maggie May ! " And there the conversation came to a halt . Kip looked at theAden moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank in large quantities of the legal intoxicating odors , and whispered in agony of soul to himself : " No ! No ! I 'd be spoiling it all ! " " Budge ! " says the fiend . " Budge not ! " says my conscience.  | It was Maggie May speaking ; her voice low , and sounding a little queer , somehow . " Mr. Tarleton , what do you really think of me ? " " Why , Miss Maggie May ! " stammered Kip , in bewilderment . " You must know , really ! " " No , I do n't know , really . " " Why , Miss Maggie May , I think you are the loveliest person  --  the most wonderful that I ever knew in all my life ! " " But then  --  why do n't you say so ? " " Oh , but  --  how could I ? " " But why not ? " " Because  --  surely you know what I  --  what my position is ! " " You mean , because you are employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't anything  --  and you have so much . I ca n't presume  --  " then he stopped , because he could n't presume to put into words how great his presumption would have been if he had presumed . After a pause there came her voice again , queerer than ever . " From what I hear , I have n't so much property . But even if I had , would it make me happy ? Did it make my father happy ? And Roger ? Has Cousin Jenny 's money made her happy ? And Evelyn 's ? " " I know , Miss Maggie May ; but that 's different . I have really nothing . " " You have character . And you 're not so old yet . You might make a career somehow . " " Of course , Miss Maggie May , and I hope to ; but I ca n't figure ' out just how to start ; and meantime , here I am , in this restricted ' position "  --  such polite Southern phrases he had learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and best tradition ; but just now his hands were trembling , and perspiration was breaking out on his forehead . " You know , Mr. Tarleton "  --  a psychologist would have detected a note of desperation in the girl 's voice  --  " you know , nowadays it 's not unknown for a woman to earn some money . " " Yes , of course . " " Women do it even after they 're married . " " Yes , but that is n't fair , Miss Maggie May ! A man ought to be ashamed  | " Jerry Tyler is n't ashamed . His wife works , and they get along very well , it seems . " " Yes , but --  " " I 've often thought I would do it . I have something in mind , something I think would be interesting . " " What , Miss Maggie May ? " " Well , it 's a long story . You might n't approve of it . In fact , I 'm not sure if you 'd approve of many things about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Miss Maggie May , I assure you that could n't be so ! I  --  I think , truly , that you are the best , and the kindest " " I know , everybody thinks that ; I 'm so unselfish , and I like to be that way  --  God made me so ! But the plain truth is , I might want to do what I want , and people would think it was terrible . " " Oh , surely , I could n't possibly ! Whatever you wanted  --  it could n't be anything but good . " " For example , I might not want to marry any of the men that Mama picks out for me , or that Cousin Jenny picks out . I might not want to live in a house that looks like a hotel , and manage twenty or thirty servants , and eat my heart out with grief all my days . Would that shock you so much ? " " Why , no , Miss Maggie May ! Why , no  --  I  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhere between the tongue and the brain , that he could find no words at all . " The truth is , I hoped you would n't marry any of these men , but I could n't figure out why you should n't . " " Well , the reason was simple . I did n't happen to love any of hem . I am selfish , and I wo n't marry except for love . " " Of course , Miss Maggie May ! " " Then , when I meet a man that I do love , why  --  then I have to find out if he loves me . Because , naturally , I could n't let myself eve a man who did n't love me . " " Of course  --  certainly  --  I know  --  " Kip stumbled around , to figure out what he knew ; and meantime , something with the intensity of a steam-siren was shrieking into his ear : " You fool , ou 're making the girl propose to you ! " Then it said , even louder , fter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " His ' fusion became worse than ever . " Miss Maggie May , do you mean  --  I mean , I wish I could know if it was that  --  that if I was n't so poor , and if I had a right to ask you --  "  | " I mean that your being poor has n't the first thing in the world to do with it . Let 's talk about us , and not about money and houses . " " But  --  you see , I have n't dared . " " I 'm giving you permission , right now . I have asked you to tell me what you think about me . " " Oh , Miss Maggie May , of course I 'd be the happiest man  --  if I only thought it was right " Then you really do care for me ? " " I just have n't any words to say it  --  I have n't let myself think " You are sure ? There is n't any doubt about it in your mind ? " " How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the first moment I saw you . " She put out her hand to him , and he caught it , and began to stammer out his bewilderment , and his shocked sense of propriety . Then suddenly she stood up , saying , " Come . " Still keeping hi hand , she led him across the loggia , and down some steps into th  --  garden ; and as soon as they were lost in the shadows of a rose arbor , she stopped , and faced him , and without a moment 's warning put herself into his arms . " I love you , " she said . The steam-siren changed to trumpets , a whole battery of the lined up in the back of the stage in a grand opera , splitting you , ears , announcing the entrance of a king or a queen . Maggie Ma held up her lips for him to kiss , and he understood that she belonged , to him , and he was dizzy with the shock of it ; he kissed her lips , an . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her cheeks , and he eyes . He had that adored person in his arms ; she was pledging : herself to him ! He had never felt such an emotion in his life , an , tears began to run down his cheeks . Then he discovered that Maggie May was sobbing also . Th. ' were a very emotional pair . " I 'm so happy ! " she explained . " I ' so relieved ! " And suddenly she buried her face in his shoulder an . exclaimed : " Oh , Kip , you made me propose ! " They stood , taking alternate sips out of a cup of rapture ; tint Maggie May said : " We may be missed . " So they climbed th stairs , and sat decorously on the loggia again . " I do n't want m cousins to know about it , " said she . " I want to tell Mama first . "  | " What will your mother say ? " he asked  --  ready to be in a panic again . " Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell her about you . She wants me to be happy ; that 's the first thing with her . " " Is it going to shock Mrs. Fessenden ? " " I do n't think it will ; she thinks a great deal of you . But I don'twant to put the responsibility on her  --  you know how it is . " " Yes , " said Kip , the naive one . " She 's had scandals enough . " " I want you to come down home and meet everybody ; we can bemarried there  --  I mean , that is , if you want to marry me . Youknow , you have n't asked me yet . " " Oh , if you will , please marry me ! " " You 're sure you do n't feel like these New York intellectuals ? You are n't afraid of tying yourself up for life ? " " Oh , Maggie May , I 'll be so happy  --  I ca n't bring myself to believe it 's true ! What on earth will we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find a way , as other young couples have done . Your mother and aunt said they 'd move into the village and let us have the cottage . " " What ? " said Kip  --  thinking that somehow he had n't heard the words straight . " I hope you did n't mind my asking them , " said the girl , with not the slightest trace of mischief in her tone . " Why , no . But  --  did you tell them you were going to  --  to --  " " To propose to you ? Yes , of course . How else could I have up the courage ? " " You mean  --  what did they say ? " " Well , they said they thought you would accept me . It would have been dreadful if they 'd been mistaken . " Kip 's head was somewhat addled , with all these strange things happening . When he thought it over , he realized that there had n something queer in the looks of his mother and his aunt when bade them goodbye that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , imagining what was happening , and waitinghim to bring the news ! You could see how helpless a man was the face of a conspiracy of women ; the old ones contributing it cunning and experience , and the young ones their dimples and tics and wavy brown hair and gentle brown eyes and gleaming to shoulders , and soft tender throats to be kissed !  | The golden moon climbed higher , and turned to silver . The radio howled and made noises like a frying-pan on a hot stove , and now and then a fragment of music or a voice : " Good evening , friends of radioland ! " A breeze sprang up from over the water , and Kip got Maggie May 's wrap for her , and they sat discussing the state of their hearts , and the strange bewilderment that had afflicted them . Now that it was over , Maggie May said it had been silly of them not to find out long ago ; but Kip said , how could he have dreamed that Maggie May would think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were so many brilliant and entertaining men all around her . Why had she ever turned them down ? She thought it over , and replied : " I used to watch them , and try to make up my mind  --  because of course Cousin Jenny kept telling me their good points . One thing , I waited to see one of them refuse a drink of liquor , and I did n't see it . " " You would n't marry a man that drinks even a little bit , Maggie May ? " " Would you expect me to , with the experiences I 've had ? " Later on , when Kip told this to Jerry Tyler , the bright young man of Manhattan chuckled gaily , and sang an old refrain , to the effect that " The lips that touch liquor shall never touch mine ! " A song which had inspired our grandmothers , he said ; but Maggie May had never heard it . Kip asked his future wife , with no little curiosity , what it was she had in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a failure as a money-maker . At first Maggie May would n't tell him ; she said he would laugh at her  --  and sure enough he did , serious-minded young man though he was . Such an odd notion for a girl to take up ! Maggie May said she would like to be a temperancelecturer ! She told him how this idea had come to her . Walking one afternoonthrough a cross-street in New York , on her way to keep an engagement with her cousin , she had come upon a church , of some evangelical sort , with a sign in front saying that a man was giving a temperance lecture inside . Being early for her engagement , she had gone in to hear what it was like ; and so the idea had taken root . " You liked it so well ? " asked Kip . " I liked it so little , " she replied . " There was a feeble old man , and fifteen or twenty old women . He talked about the Bible andp245the love of God , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about the Constitution , and reverence for law  --  and we can see how that counts . People want what they want , and the law be hanged . " " So you wanted to improve the lecture ? " " A girl does n't have the sort of experiences I 've had without being made to think . For ten years or so I watched my father ; and now there 's an uncle down home , and several friends of the family . Up here there 's Roger , and Evelyn , and Dick . So I keep asking myself : Why do people drink ? And what can you say to them ? What 's the right way to go at it ? " " What is the right way ? " " The first thing is to begin when they 're young . It 's no good talking to grown people . If they 're not drinkers , they do n't need it , and if they are drinkers they laugh at you . " " Are n't Evelyn and Dick young enough ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Somebody ought to have said to them : Look , this is what drinking does to you . " " If I say that , " said Kip , " people point out the ones it has n't seemed to hurt . Each one thinks he 'll escape . " " You see a dozen people drinking , and out of the dozen , one will die a drunkard . Maybe it 'll be you , and maybe the next one . You throw dice with death . " " Yes , but people want to gamble . That 's their idea of a good tine . " " They would n't , if you could bring it home to them . You 've got to say : This is the kind of fool you look like ; this is the kind you talk like . " Said Kip : " I only know this New York bunch , of course . They do n't care what they look like , and they know that no one is listening to the way they talk . You try to separate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wise-cracks . " " Well , people like that have to go on till they 've had enough . Sooner or later , you know , every drunkard wants to stop . My father could n't , but he would warn others . I can hardly bring myself to think about him , and the things I went through , up to the very end ; yet I believe I could stand on a platform and tell a group of school children everything about it . I 'd say : This is what I saw , ith my own eyes . This is what liquor did to my father . They'dinterested in that , do n't you think ? "  | Kip said , no longer smiling : " You tell them about your father , and I 'll tell them about mine . " Two or three days later Maggie May set out on her journey . Her cousin drove her to the station , and Roger would meet her in New York . Kip did n't even come to the house to see her off ; they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better so , because they might shed tears , or look too much disturbed . They kissed a few more times , and plighted their troth ; they would think about nothing but each other , until the time came for Kip to come to Pointe Chilcote for their wedding . He was in a panic every time he contemplated the future ; because , how could he expect Maggie May to come and live in a little brick cottage , as the wife of an employee ? But Maggie May would n't hear that nonsense any more ; she told him that if he mention edit again she would think he did n't love her , and was trying to get out of it . So there was nothing for Kip to do but turn the management of his life over to a stronger will . It was amazing , what you found out about these women , who seemed so gentle and submissive ; underneath , they were made of steel ; and when they got going , they had the drive of hundred-ton locomotives ! Every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would write one in the morning , and one in the evening , so that he 'd get one each day , in spite of the train ! And then a telegram fro Acadia , Louisiana , addressed , very decorously , to Mrs. Powhata Tarleton : " Safe at home . All well . Greetings to our friends . ' Roger also had a telegram , and Mrs. Fessenden , so there was noth ing to excite the suspicions of Mrs. Pollock , wife of the villag. druggist , who got reports of all Broadhaven telegrams from he . maid , who " went out " with the village telegraph operator . In due course came a letter from Pointe Chilcote , which Ki , read with dizziness in the head . Maggie May had got home , and encountered all the glories which were hers by birthright  --  and still she was determined to come and experiment with " love in a cottage " ! She had broken the news to her mother . Of course , all mothers were sorry when their daughters did n't " marry money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teche country , and so much in Wall Street . But Maggie May had put up to her mother the proposition , would she rather have a son-in-law who was poorp247but dry , or one who was rich but wet ? On the basis of this grim alternative , Kip Tarleton was the bridegroom-elect ! Of course Maggie May wrote to his mother also ; and what could portray the happiness of two old ladies , who have concentrated their attention upon one darling boy , and who , after years of hoping , see him carried off by exactly the right girl ? There was a Christmas atmosphere in the little brick cottage , two months ahead of time . And then a telephone call from Roger , who had received the news , and called up right away , so that an old friend would know he was n't snobbish . " It 's all right , kid , " he said . " Of course there 's nobody in the world good enough for Maggie May , but you 're the nearest good enough  --  and she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course she 'd have to marry a teetotaler ; and you are the only young one left in America ! " Then came Mrs. Fessenden for a visit : just before supper-time , when she knew Kip would be home . " Maggie May has written me the news , " she said . " Of course I was n't so much surprised , becausewe women have eyes , and young people do n't hide as much from us as they think . You 're very well suited to her , Kip " actually , actually , she was calling him Kip !  --  " and I believe you 'll both be happy . Certainly you have our best wishes . " " Thank you very much , Mrs. Fessenden , " said Kip , blushing all over . " You 'll have to call me Cousin Jenny , " she said , " since you 're going to be a member of the family . " Yes , he was to be a member of the family , and he could n't get over his awe at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the old Southern traditions have a hard time standing up to it ! " I 've been figuring what to do with you , " continued " Cousin Jenny . " " Of course that 's all nonsense about the ladies moving into he village . I 'll put you in that cottage of Roger 's  --  he wo n't use it , d there 's room enough there , I think . " So Kip saw what it meant to be taken under the sheltering wing of privilege ! They would live in that lovely house , which had sevenrooms , and was in the part of the estate reserved to the guests ! hey began stammering their appreciation , mixed with embarrassent ; Kip felt it his duty to say : " You know , Mrs.  --  Cousin JennyT did n't intend this to happen . I would n't have felt it was right ask for it . " " I know , " said Mrs. Fessenden , with a smile . " Maggie May tells me she had to propose to you , so your position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be another scandal , then ! The mistress of Broadhaven would n't let it be ! She would take up this honorable young man , and make it plain to all their friends that it was no mesalliance , but a romance in the style of the Old South . " You 'll have to have a vacation , " she said . " You 'll want to spend a little time at Pointe Chilcote , and then you 'll want a honeymoon trip . I 'll tell McCallum you 're to have the month of January . " So that was that . And Kip thought to himself , how he wished he might be on hand , to see the superintendent 's face when the news was broken to him !   IT WAS the end of the year 1922 , and the senator from Ohio who had tried to play tricks upon the prohibition amendment had been president of the United States for nearly two years . He had brought with him to Washington a group of politicians known as the " Ohio gang , " and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was full of rumors of bribery and racketeering . Senators were charging that the oil men had bought the government and stolen the oil reserves of the navy . You read one day that it was so , and the next day that it was a slander , and the ordinary man hardly knew what to believe . Stories about two hundred thousand dollars worth of liberty bonds in a little black satchel winded more like moving picture scenarios than like history lessons . Kip Tarleton , who was going to get the thing he wanted mostall the world , found it especially hard to believe anything bad bout his country . To be sure , he was a Democrat by inheritance , d inclined to assume the worst about Republican politicians ; but he did n't think about them very much , because he was getting a lot of work done before he went on his honeymoon . He would n't haveid that he would attend to his own affairs and let the country lookt for itself  --  no , that would have been unpatriotic . But like mostAmericans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look outr his employer 's interests , earn his monthly check by honest work , d graft , crime , and scandal would pass him by . But then , three days before Christmas , came the burglary of roadhaven . The first news Kip had of it was a telephone call inearly hours of the morning . It was the butler at the mansion. r . McCallum says please to come up right away . The house has n robbed . " " Robbed ? " " Somebody broke in during the night and carried off a lot of Mr. Fessenden 's liquor . " Kip slipped into his overcoat , and ran out . It was before day --  , light ; the ground was frozen hard , and an icy wind was blow in off the water ; the stars were beginning to pale in the sky , and h could see his breath as he ran . Up at the mansion there were flash lights on the gravelled drive , and a group of men examining marks , which told a plain story : a heavy truck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so of the house where it had stopped , and four men had pushed it the rest of the way , so as not to make a sound . It had been backed up to one o the side entrances of the mansion , and this door had been jimmied . " The burglars had known where to go , evidently , for the had worked on the wall of the liquor cellar , and no other place " This is an inside job , " said McCallum . There was a night-watchman , supposed to be on duty , an of fellow who had been a gardener on the place . He was nowhere in sight  --  until Kip finally discovered him , sound asleep in the servant dining-room , with his head bowed over the table . Some one have doped him , he declared ; something had been put into the coffeehe had drunk during the night . This might be true , or he might have been in league with the gang  --  who could say ? Anyhow , the burglars had drilled the plaster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was space for a man , crawl through , and for a liquor case to be passed out . How man had been taken one could not say without a careful checking , but tcellar had an empty look , and McCallum said this stuff ran to mon nowadays  --  some of it was worth two or three hundred dollars case . Probably they had loaded the truck , and if so , they had g  --  away with fifty or a hundred thousand dollars . To Kip , the nai one , it sounded like a fairy tale ; he would n't have supposed the was that much liquor on the whole of Long Island . Two constables came from Seaview , and later on several mfromthe sheriff 's office , who made elaborate studies of the ground and notes of the tire-treads , and took finger prints from the doe and lock . They made a great show of questioning everybodythe place , and the superintendent and his assistant sat in at lo conferences , telling what they knew about this employee and tha and having everything taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over , by this official and that ; even t guests were not above suspicion by the gimlet-eyed sleuths  --  th could tell of more than one " inside job " that had been done by t help of " friends of the family . " Kip was uncomfortably awa that he was n't exempted , even by the fact that he was going tP251Parry a cousin of Mrs. Fessenden 's . The sleuths were delving into his past and his present , and he felt like a criminal every time he saw them . Mr. Fessenden came out from New York , and with the butler hecked the contents of the cellar , according to a record in the antler 's pantry , in which every case and bottle of this and that was itered like a library catalog . Would you believe it  --  Mr. Fessen-. en looked up " Chambery " or " Moet and Charulon " the way other en looked up " Don Quixote " or " Troilus and Cressida " ; every line the butler took out a bottle he had to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks which represented bottles in stock . Down n the cellar , everything was ranged upon racks , and there was an alphabetical system which had won a prize offered by the Liquor Dealers ' Association for the best model of a gentleman 's cellar . Some time back when the banker had had a banquet tendered to him y his cronies , some one had recited a jingle which declaredHis house on a hill Is built on a still. hat story got into the newspapers , and one of the wags called colyumists " wrote a new version , readingHis house on a hillWas built on a still , But burglars came and he did n't see ' um , And now it 's a mausoleum . Of course there was excitement in all the newspapers . The Evening Star " did not fail to mention that this was the mansion tom which Evelyn , Countess Ensenada , had eloped earlier in the ar . Another paper looked up the article about the " gentleman 's wine-cellar , " and quoted from it . The general agreement was that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Christasseason which was responsible for the daring crime . Genuine ported liquor was hardly to be had at any price , and it was a problem how demands for the New Year 's celebration were to beI . The dealers would soon be offering " Banker Fessenden 's iIf " all over New York ; but nobody should be fooled by that ,  | because the liquor would be " cut " again and again before it reached the throats of consumers . " Banker Fessenden " was in such a towering rage , for a day c two it looked as if he was going to be his own " sleuth " ; he sat in I the questioning of his employees , and when Kip 's turn came , l pressed the youth to tell him of any suspicious characters who ha been seen about the place . Kip thought it would be better to talk I Mr. Fessenden privately about this matter . So , after the other " sleuths " had gone , he told the banker that his older son , Dick , ha been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to t11 butler by his parents , denying him access to the cellar and its cot tents . This bootlegger had come to the house at Thanksgiving timl looking for " Master Dick , " and Kip had made note of the content of his car . So " Banker Fessenden " set out to " grill " this undesirable citizen of the village , an Italian barber who was making gin in the bathtub of his home , and paying small tips to the villap constables ; poor Toni Galluppi was hounded to such an extent that he had to give up his bathtub industry , and go into the serious bull ness of running liquor-trucks into New York . Also , there was Taylor Tibbs . Kip and his mother and aunt 1 to tell everything they knew about Taylor from the day of his bir Kip knew the Negro 's weakness for liquor , good or bad , and kn that he would do petty stealing , but insisted that it was impossible could have made a deal with real criminals . The police and det tives frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance from him . Afterwards , at the banker 's suggestion , had a quiet talk with the man , and got bits of information whi might or might not have significance . There were always peo trying to get access to Broadhaven , or information about it , a more than one had questioned Taylor about this or that . Th might have been newspaper reporters , or agents trying to get tra  --  who could say ? Anyhow , the sleuths would run them down a cross-question them . There was a new night-watchman now ; no superannuated g dener , but a wide-awake ex-service man , carrying a shotgun havi a magazine chamber loaded with eight buckshot shells . There w still some precious stuff in the cellar , and more was coming , s Banker Fessenden . In these times one could n't depend upon pot . ' authorities , but had to look out for one 's self . Kip , seeing tl soldier pacing the driveway all night , got a new sense of the meaning of property , and the attitude of men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National had vaults with walls composed of twenty layers of the hardest steel , with charged electric wires buried in them , and also chambers of poison gas . Inside these walls was a corridor through which a man might walk , and an arrangement of mirrors so that a watchman could see all the way round from every spot . This watchman was locked in all night , and had to press a button every five minutes , to show he was awake . I f he failed to press it , an alarm was rung in a private detective agency , and the watchman was immediately called on the telephone . That was the way rich people in New York felt about property ! Kip left for the South , and forgot the troubles of Broadhaven . The train speeding over the rails sang a song of rapture to him ; every mile was one nearer to Maggie May , and he trembled , because t seemed impossible that fate could intend to let anybody stay so happy . To leave the chill winds and dirty slush of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with roses in bloom  --  thatas an experience which the rich had discovered , and a midwinter acation had become part of American plutocratic life . But notany of these heliotropic travellers had a girl like Maggie May aiting for him at the end of the journey ! Lee Chilcote met Kip in New Orleans , and drove him the hundred miles over the new paved road of which everybody was so proud . would talk about the road , and about the price of sugar , and about the oil scandals , and that rotten bunch of Republican poliAmericansin Washington , a favorite topic for Southern Democrats. t Kip noticed that Lee would never say a word about the war , nor Alt his health , unless he was directly asked had heard so much about Pointe Chilcote , from Roger and ry and Maggie May , that really it was like coming home . Thec oaks covered with Spanish moss , and magnolias soon coming iu bud , and bare fields soon to be green with young sugar cane , the swamps , and the thickets grown ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes , so that you had to live behind ens  --  he knew them all ; likewise the house , of which a picturestood on Roger 's mantel . On the " gallery , " as they called it , Maggie May was waiting , and her mother , and a visiting cousin , and aunt , and servants coming on the run , so as not to miss any the excitement of the white folks . Mrs. Chilcote kissed Kip or &;  | both his cheeks  --  he was going to be her adopted son now ; then the tears started to flow , because he had come to take the last of her children away from her . Kip 's good fortune was almost enough to turn his head . Nod longer was he a hotel-clerk , tied down to a desk ; no longer was he an " outside servant , " subject to a superintendent who begrudged every minute 's time . No , he was the bridegroom-elect , and all the time was his , and Maggie May had nothing to think about but him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go sailing on the gulf ; they could drive , and see the country , and picnic all day ; they could sit on the gallery half the night , and listen to the strange liquid music of the mocking-birds . They were dissolved in a mist of happiness ; the whole world smiled upon them , and lived over with them the dream of young love . Then one morning they all put on stiff and proper clothing , an motored to the little private chapel on the estate . All the member of the big family were there , and the Reverend Mr. Cobbein in ful canonicals , and the young couple stood up and promised to " love honor , and obey . " Maggie May , the old-fashioned girl , made n public fuss about the " obey "  --  but doubtless she made the usu mental reservations . Sister Lelia , the fashionable Mrs. Pakenha of New Orleans , sang a song in French , and they went back to t house and had a merry wedding breakfast , after which Maggie Ma and Kip went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowed in a little sport-car which was a present from Lee . They were going to motor to Florida , and then up to New York taking their time and seeing the sights . But first there had to long partings , with all the ladies shedding tears , and leaving mes sages , and promising to write . When they climbed in , they wer covered with showers of rice , and old slippers  --  nobody knew wh they threw rice and old slippers at bridal couples , but it was done and the first task of the pair , as soon as they had got away , was t get out and cut the cow-bell from the rear bumper , and thro slippers and shoes from the baggage , and brush the last grain of rice from their clothing , so that their secret might not be betrayed t bellboys and clerks at the hotels where they stopped . Three weeks later they were back in Broadhaven , settled in tha wonderful seven-room cottage , on the side of the estate reserved tiP255the guests . The two old ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home  --  and what perfectly enraptured old ladies they were , with two darlings to watch over instead of one ! Such marvellous housekeepers , preparing good Southern meals with hot bread every day , and keeping the place so that a speck of ( lust was not to be discovered with a magnifying glass ! They would leave nothing for Maggie May to do  --  she must go up to the mansion and be the lady as before , so as not to feel any loss of social status through having married an employee . They fussed over that lovely bride and cherishedher as if she had been a piece of Dresden china . One of the first things Kip learned when he gut home was that the burglars had been caught . Mr. Fessenden , distrusting the local police , had employed a detective agency in New York , and provided them with funds for the paying of informers . They had found several bottles of the bankers ' best cognac being offered for sale to one of the fashionable " speakeasies " in New York , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious cargo ; three men were in jail in New York , and one more in the county jail . It had been an " inside job , " as McCallum had said . The man in the county jail was the butler 's assistant , the " first footman , " as he was technically known ; an ordinary young fellow , born and raised in the neighborhood , the son of an old servant  --  it gave you a start o realize that such a man would sell you out , and admit New Yorkngsters into your home ! He did n't look like a criminal ; he had rank-appearing blue eyes and carroty hair , and had worked in your home and taken your orders patiently , every day for nearly five ears ; and now here he was behind bars , admitting all that he had one . A girl had got hold of him , and to get money for her he had listened to the whispers of crooks from the city . Just such a story s you saw in the movies , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned ugly , and insisted thate was no worse than the people he had conspired to rob ! They ere breaking the law all the time , and why should he obey it ? Mr. essenden had ordered a lot of brandy off one of the ships that lay ut at sea , and had had it brought into his own harbor  --  the " first outman " knew , because he had helped to unload the stuff , and to talog it in the prize card-system ! When the master wanted a casef liquor for his parties in New York , he did n't think a thing of fling his servants to carry it down to the yacht , or to stow it in the nk behind his limousine . Master Dick bought stuff from boothers , and carried it all over the island to petting parties , and " whoopees " he had with his friends . The rich expected the ' servants to see all that , and go on obeying orders , and living li monks ! No , said Joe Ferris  --  that was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to Sing Sing for a burglary job . Th police had him , and they might keep him a while , and beat him ue he charged that they had already done so ; but they could n't kill him and sooner or later he 'd have his day in court , and he 'd tell the newspapers all he knew about the law-breaking rich of Long Island . More than that , he 'd tell about the police . He had n't lived here a his life for nothing . He knew how much Toni Galluppi , the barb who made bathtub gin , had paid to the local constables , and he knew half a dozen others who were in the business , and where you could get the stuff  --  and like as not you 'd find the police magistrate havin a bracer after a hard day in court , sending poor men to jail . J. Ferris knew that the sheriff was getting chunks of money from the trucks that were loading up with liquor every night , in all the cow - and harbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians were i the graft , and by God , he was n't to be the goat . To protect himself he had already written out what he knew , and turned it over to local preacher who was threatening trouble for the liquor-ring . So there was a pretty kettle of mash ; or , as you might say , bathtub full of gin and bitters , fermenting and brewing trouble fo a great banker . Mr. Fessenden , whom Kip discovered to be bot irritable and obstinate , was bound that the scoundrel should 0 punished to the limit ; but the constables and sheriff and count attorney were rumored to be far from happy over the prospec Broadhaven and the village buzzed with gossip about the situation young Ferris was known to everybody , his family lived there , hi brother was on the war-path because of the alleged " beating up . ' Strange as it might seem , there was no little sympathy for the prisoner ; there was a sort of embryo peasant revolt against th landlord , and there were even a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a bad banker . Ferris 's moth was a churchwoman , and diligently spread the idea that the boy ' fall was due to the bad example set by his master ; many of the church crowd took up that notion , and it worried the politician even if it did n't worry the master . P257This incident was a source of much education for Kip Tarleton . He had taken it for granted that criminals were what they were because there was something inherently bad in them ; he thought of them as sinister beings , remote , dangerous , and different from himself ; certainly not as fellows with frank-appearing blue eyes and carroty hair , who had waited on him for years , and spoken to him pleasantly . But here Joe Ferris stood to get several years in the state penitentiary  --  and were there many more like him " up the river " ? You wondered about all sorts of things connected with crime , and the causes of it , and the grades and degrees of men 's responsibility . What were you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law ? What were you to think about your own position , as employee of such a master , and about your honeymoon cottage , and your monthly salary , recently increased , and your social position , about which you tried not to be proud ? You might tell yourself that you earned your money by honest work ; lint were you sure the man who paid you had done the same ? And how many stages from corruption did money have to go before it became purified ? Also , there was the problem of your duty as a citizen , con fronted with the presence of law-breaking and graft all about you . Was it enough to stuff cotton in your ears when you went to bed , and refuse to hear the rumble of the liquor-trucks on their way to New York ? When you went for a stroll with your bride on a still evening in early spring , should you pretend not to see the signals of the nn-runners , winking here and there out on the water  --  or should pretend that you thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself it was none of his affair , what would the end of it , and how far off would the end be ? Kip andMaggie May discussed this problem on many a spring evening when cy might have been making love ; some of the things they said could have been taken for disloyalty to their job , and to that kind cousin Jenny who had taken such pains to make them comfortable . The affair of the burglary hung fire for two or three months , ring which Joe Ferris stayed in jail , and the tongues of rumor gged busily . Kip and Maggie May got the village gossip through rs . McCallum and her cronies , and the gossip of the mansion from Mrs. Fessenden and Evelyn , and from Roger Chilcote , who , came out a couple of times for a week-end , and met the smart crow at the country club , and told Kip amusing stories . There had been regular deputations of frightened politicians and merchants , appealing to Richard Fessenden to let the matter drop ; the neighborhood could n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court case - having to do with liquor . A few miles offshore lay the ships which composed " Rum Row " ; and if Long Island was climbing out of the " hard times , " it was mainly on the basis of the tribute levied on smuggled " wet goods "  --  a sort of local and super-legal excise tax , such as the barons of the middle ages had laid upon merchant caravans passing through their territory . " Did you know . that 's how the Kaiser 's family got their name ? " said Roger , with his chuckle of mischief . " Hohenzollern means high-taxers . ' " The time came when Banker Fessenden 's golf cronies were tacklinghim on the course , pointing out the danger of letting out facts that would stir up the " church element . " This had come to be a term of extreme opprobrium with the business men at the country club ; they were beginning to realize what a menace to the country was offered by persons who went to church on Sunday mornings instead of playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties instead of gin and bitters . At all hazards one must avoid " stirring them up , " and it was a patriotic duty that Fessenden owed , to give his consent to the dropping of the case against Ferris . As for the three crooks from New York , of course that was different ; the police had other things on them , and they could be sent up for another crime . So finally the stubborn banker gave way , and his friends slapped him on the back and told him he was a good fellow , and offered him a share of something special which they had in their locker , so fresh off the boat that you could see the stains of sea-water on the label . There was another aspect of this burglary which gave enormous , . glee to Roger Chilcote ; the fact that the government would n't let Richard Fessenden have his stolen liquor back ! The Federal authoritieshad got hold of the precious cache , and were preparing to issue a permit for the transporting of it back to its original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals had been removed and the liquor " cut . " So , under the regulations , it was no longer the same liquor , and would not be returned to its former owner , but would be destroyed ! This affair served both Roger and Jerry as a text for many ser-P259mons upon the absurdity of prohibition . This was what you got when you passed a law attempting to regulate men 's morals ! Such a law was really no law , but usurpation and tyranny ; it could not be enforced , and the officials charged with enforcing it were the first to break it . Indeed , it was every citizen 's duty to break such a law as much as possible , because the sooner it was discredited , the sooner it would be repealed . Roger and Jerry labored heroically at this social duty ; also , they applied their trained wits to the task of pouring ridicule upon the law , among themselves , and in all that they wrote for the public . Kip was the only man they knew who was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated fire of a battery of heavy guns , and was blasted and blown up and pulverized as many Mmes as one of the forts at Verdun . Any choice anecdote that Roger came upon , illustrating the breakdown of the Volstead act , he would treasure up and unload the next time he met his brotherin-law . If it was proposed to take a sail , he would say : " Let 's go out and have a look at the rum fleet . " If it was proposed to go driving , he would say : " No , the traffic is too heavy  --  too many cars of bootleggers . " Kip took this good-naturedly , and without much argument in reply . He knew his brother-in-law from of old ; Roger would make jokes about Kip 's refusal to drink , but it would not do for Kip to make jokes about Roger 's drinking . It was all right for a famous poet to declare that it was the aim of his life to get his proper young brother-in-law properly " stewed , " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squiffy " ; and to tell Kip the glorious sensations he was missing , by refusing to join the Wet Parade . But it would not do for Kip to mention the evidence of inglorious sensations which Roger had given him on various occasions : for example , the time at a studio arty when Roger had experienced the sensations of a " bow-wow , " and had crawled around on his hands and knees and barked ; or the lime in the Tarleton House when Roger had wept for an hour because nobody loved him ; or the time , just recently , when he had taken a bootlegger 's word for a case of gin , and had had to send a hurry call for a physician with a stomach-pump . Roger 's play had gone into rehearsal the previous autumn , and run into a hitch ; the leading lady had broken down in the midst of affairs , declaring that she could n't play such a part , it was too horrible . Even the hard-boiled manager had got what he called " cold feet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roger had stood by his artistic formula , according to which the greatness of an art-work was measured by its painfulness ; the production had been stopped , and the playwright had hunted up another manager , and signed another contract for the following fall . In the meantime , he was going to spend the summer " doing ' Europe with Eileen Pinchon . The young intellectuals of America were making a practical protest against " Volsteadism " by spending all their spare time and money abroad . Roger and Eileen motored out one evening , and had dinner in the seven-room cottage which for a year or so had been Roger 's home . The two old ladies prepared a meal with fried spring chicken an " beaten biscuits " and other Southern delicacies ; they were greatly excited by the occasion , and politely pretended to have no idea o any improper relationship between the poet and his lovely companio This delicate pastel blonde who appeared to have tripped o of a French water-color , evidently adored Roger more than w good for him , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women have ways of finding out about each other and Maggie May told Kip , after this visit , that it was exactly she had expected  --  Eileen was hoping that Roger would marry her but afraid to drop any hint , because of the poet 's impatience o " chains . " The couple went away to Europe ; and Roger 's war on " Volstead ism " took the form of a series of picture postcards from the sho places of the world . He would choose pictures of wine-cellars pile with huge casks , and bier stubes with rows of steins , and paintin of fat monks drinking , and every sort of Bacchic and unpurit scene . " The product of these vineyards will appear off the coa of Long Island next Christmas , " he would write . Or : " The instruments of torture were devised for wowsers . " Or perhaps " We have entered a contest with the topers of this town , and Eilee is ahead by three gallons . " Now and then his ebullitions wool require more space than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an established contact with the real thing in beer . All his life Roge had been hearing about it , but the actuality was beyond imaginin and brought forth a prose poem " In Sligo the Irish whiskey made me sick . In Dublin the famo Guinness Stout turned me queasy . In London the brandy and sodp261left me indifferent . The wine-cellars of Paris were ransacked for bottles of the comet year to tempt my jaded palate . Even the farfamedLacrima Christi which I guzzled on its native Vesuvian slopes left my temperature quite unsquizzled . All were mere trifles , compared with this brown and moist perfection , a kind of mother 's milk drawn from some benignant deity who knows what is good for us ! As you know , I abhor eloquence , but my tongue babbles on this subject of Munich beer . I would my dishes could be scrubbed in it , my bathtubs filled with it , yea , verily , that the heavens could rain brown beer upon the flowers , and flood the city gutters with its translucent fluid . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work  --  pour it in ! ' " There was a " little stranger " on the way to the Tarleton family ; and what a fluttering in that dovecote when the news became known ! Kip was shoved to one side ; his part was ( lone now , and it was a woman 's affair . Maggie May was tended and cherished , and delicacies were prepared for her to eat with a double purpose . The arrival was expected in the winter-time , so a great deal ofnothing would be necessary ; for reasons known to ladies , it was necessary for each and every garment to be embroidered with roses of pink silk , or perhaps with violets of violet silk . While such ' fancy work " was being done , the ladies sat about and exchangedreminiscences , and oddly enough Aunt Sue was just as much an authority as Kip 's mother . The barriers which difference of station had set up between the Tarleton and Fessenden families were now pretty well broken down . he old lady pensioners came over at all hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and invited the Tarleton dies to a tea-party at the mansion , at which there was no end of tiering , and talk about intimate affairs . It was only when Mr. . Fessenden was expected that the Tarleton ladies kept out of the y ; the pensioners did the same  --  for the master was irritable , resented his wife 's habit of cluttering up the place with superflurouspeople . They were all trying to get her money , he insisted , and t now money was scarce , and he threatened a house-cleaning . Twenty-two years ago Genevieve Talbot , of Mobile , Alabama , been a pupil at a " finishing school " in New York , being trained the ways of expensive elegance . One of the features of school life had been afternoon tea-parties to which " eligible " men were invited ; the expected happened now and then , and each time it was an advertisement for the school , and a reason for parents with daughters to pay the high prices charged . So Genevieve had met the heir of Broadhaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was twenty years older than she made no difference ; the fact that he had a string of scandals attached to his name , came to her merely as a rumor . His family was anxious to find a proper wife for him , and " Jenny 's " parents were concerned about four younger sisters coming on ; so there were negotiations behind the scenes , and the girl was pushed into the affair before she had time to make up her own mind . Now here she was , an unhappy woman , in spite of the fact that she had a palace , and a thousand acres , and a dozen motor-cars , and the resources of a trust company and a national bank behind her . Her love-life had been over and done with quickly ; nor had she been brought up in the aristocratic tradition , which allows a woman to marry for reasons of state , and then find diversion in what is called " romance . " She had tried to live her life in her children , but had made a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless to stand out against the pressure of her environment . Children brought up in a home with many servants rarely learn to do things for themselves , and are apt to be fastidious and exacting . Here were the young Fessendens , all three discontented , wrangling with each other , and hating their father , whose attempts at discipline failed because he was selfish , and never troubled to understand them or their needs . Kip was brought into relations with these young people , because the mother in her desperation turned to anybody who was at hand . Dick , the eldest , had his mother 's good heart , but also her inability to say no to people . His companions were youths whose parents were playing at the country club , and thought they had done their duty when they turned them over to servants and tutors , or sent them to expensive boarding-schools . The young people had their own cars , and were racing about at all hours of the day and night ; they had access to their parents ' liquor-cellars , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults . They were growing up in an afmosphere of postwar cynicism  --  the intellectual heirs of Jerry Tyler and Roger Chilcote , and a swarm of writers who made mockery of every idea of self-control . So it became Kip 's duty , not as assistant superintendent of theP263estate , but as distant relative and confidential friend , to be awakenedat two o'clock of a summer 's morning , and asked to dress in a hurry and dash off to a hospital where Dick was lying with a nose split open , from having been hurled through the windshield of his car ; he had been drunk , and had hit another car , and it was necessary to pay a sum to keep him from being prosecuted . Not long afterwards Kip had to be called again , this time to a road-house , where Dick had been lured into a bedroom with a girl who was another man 's wife , or claimed to be , and was being held prisoner by an irate husband . It was an old game , but hip had to remember , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story ; he paid out the five hundred dollars which Mrs. Fessenden had entrustedto him . Afterwards it was his job to brace the boy up , and help him face his parents . Kip did n't actually sec the elder Fessendenkick his son out of the room , but he heard the son tell about it , with many details concerning his father 's way of life , and what the hell right did he have to make a fuss ? Also , Evelyn , who did a few months ' penance for her sins , and then got restless and returned to the country club life . Of course she was notorious now , and people pointed her out , referring to her mockingly as " Countess . " She knew it , and became outwardly defiant , and secretly anxious to find a husband . Her mother tried to help her by inviting young people to the house and entertaining them . But it was difficult , because so few of the younger set would come unless liquor was provided , and then they would assume no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed out " completely before dinner , and had to be carried upstairs and put to bed . Nor was that supposed to be a matter for anything but Laughter ; you were n't expected to stop inviting her to your home , nor should you even speak to her parents about it . There were men willing to marry a millionaire 's daughter , and finally Evelyn settled upon a promising young stockbroker by the name of Ralston , a good-looking and aggressive product of football and fraternity life , able to take care of himself in a hard-boiled world . He and his wife made a team , and Kip got an inside view of a new " racket . " The " market " was coming back , and a stockroker " worked " his friends for orders ; he gave them " tips , " and if they made money they allowed him a share  --  while if they lost , hey suspected him of having double-crossed them . In this world of the rich , and of parasites and grafters swarming about the rich , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny broke down in the presence of Kip 's mother , and wept , saying that she could n't stand this life , and wished she had gone into a convent . When things like these happened , Kip and Maggie May would draw back into their well-sheltered little nest . They could not heal the sorrows of the world , nor the weaknesses of human beings which caused them ; they could only see to it that in their own corner there was kindness and consideration . Never would they fall prey to greed , and wreck the happiness of themselves and others , trying to pile up a fortune . When they had their child , they would teach it hard work and self-control , and not let it grow up into a torment to itself and its parents . They had love in their home , a magic talisman to protect them from the evils that raged outside . So they told themselves : until one day the superintendent came into the little office where the books and letter-files were kept , and carefully shut the door behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some orders from the boss . " " Yes , sir ? " said Kip . " There is to be some work done here at night , and you and I have nowt to do with it . There 'll be a night superintendent , as ye might say , and that is Wallins , the watchman . " " What is the work ? " Kip asked . " I was not told , and I got the impression that the less I asked , the better it would be for me . " " I suppose Mr. Fessenden intends to bring in some more liquor , " ventured Kip . " I was told to tell ye to mind yer own affairs , and no more than that . " " All right , " said Kip , " I 'm a good sleeper . " " Ye 're in luck , " said McCallum , dryly . There was a twinkle in his bright blue eyes . Kip told his wife about it , and the little household went to sleep at its usual moral hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the rest of Broadhaven would not have it so ; somebody must have been spying , for in the course of two or three days the place was like a hornets ' nest with gossip . It was all over the village , the greatest scandal in the memory of the oldest inhabitant : " Old Master Dick , " as the earlier generation called him ,  --  had gone into the rum-running business ! P265What else could you make of it ? Every night a motor-launch stole into the little harbor of the estate , and at the same hour a big truck came speeding into the place , and stopped at the pier , and loaded up , and sped away again . You could hear the rumble of it , coming and going ; every morning , so said the gossips , you could see the tracks of it in the gravelled drive . You could also pick up such things as bits of gunny-sack , a piece broken from a liquor case , and once a broken bottle . The boatman had had to clean this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Please leave a full bottle ! " The runners had granted the request  --  but Wallins , the night-watchman , had taken possession of the gift , and shared it with a girl in the village . Could you imagine such goings on ? It happened that Roger Chilcote came home from Europe about that time , and came out to lunch at Broadhaven , and told his numerousadventures . Kip found a chance to take him for a stroll , and revealed his perplexity and dismay . Roger thought it was the funniestthing he had ever run across ; he laughed so that he had to lean on Kip . Of all persons in the world  --  this pious and proper young wowser  --  to find himself assistant superintendent of a smugglingenterprise ! Some mischievous person must have planned it , said Roger ; impossible to attribute such a sense of humor to Provi-dence ! " Do n't forget , Roger , " said Kip , " your sister is in it , too . " So the playwright had to become serious . " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and passed this silly law , and now you expect people to take it seriously , and they just wo n't , that 's all . " " But to use one 's home for such a purpose , Roger ! " " Well , that 's a question of taste , and the Fessendens have never been long on that quality . Their progenitor was a butcher , and I appose he handed down his manners , along with the estate . " " But , joking aside , Roger , how can you explain the thing ? " The other thought it over . " I suppose it 's a measure of how hard up Fessenden is . I heard a rumor , before I left New York , at the trust company was nearly on the rocks ; I did n't mention it , because it 's not the sort of thing to be talked about . But you know how it is , Kip , these big fellows have ways to lend themselves money in their own banks ; it 's against the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right until the bank gets into trouble ; then it makes a deuce of a mess . I suppose the death of the German mark has put Fessenden up against it , and he 's looking for a way out . " " Is there so much money in this smuggling business , Roger ? " " Never anything like it , I 'm told . It takes one of these rum-ships about six weeks to make a round trip , and the profit is several hundredpercent . Where else can an investor find such a snap ? " " I knew that bootleggers were in it , and gangsters ; but I did n't suppose that a gentleman  --  a banker like Mr. Fessenden , with a reputation " Forget it , kid ! " said Roger . " It 's time you moralists waked up , and learned something about the world you live in . You have outlawedone of America 's big industries , and it 's not a matter for bootleggers and gangsters , but for capital . Out there "  --  the speaker waved his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dozen ships ; if you took a speed-boat and went down the line from Cape Cod to the Chesapeake , you 'd see two or three hundred . I suppose , going and coming , there are a thousand vessels in the trade ; and all these operations have to be financed , the ships have to be rented , the crews paid , and the cargoes purchased . Our biggest bankers are in it , and they 're cleaning up millions every week . " " And using their homes for landing-places ? " " Well , Fessenden happens to have a harbor all made to order , and I suppose the temptation is too great . Several launches have gone ashore recently , and the government men got the stuff . ProbablyFessenden met some losses , and could n't stand it . " " It 's pretty hard on his family , " ventured Kip . " Not so hard as if the Fessenden Trust and the Fessenden Nationalwere to go on the rocks , and the president were sent up the river for embezzlement , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always ready to spend the old man 's money , so they 'll have to keep their mouth shut while he makes it . " Roger was too polite to say that Kip and Maggie May were also spending the old man 's money , and would have to keep their mouth shut while he made it . But that was the aspect of the matter which the young couple could not get out of their minds . A cruel jest for fate to play upon two self-righteous and self-satisfied young wowsers , living in their little love-nest , sheltered and comfortable  --  and now suddenly discovering that their monthly pay-check carneP267out of the profits of rum-running ! Their living depended upon their skill in shutting their eyes to smuggling operations ! What if they should happen to open their eyes some night , and see the lights of the big truck flashing against the drawn shades ? What if they were wakened by the rumble of trucks at forty miles an hour past their door ? What if a broken bottle should be found upon their neatly kept front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals of a fashionable family ? What was the duty of a citizen when he had knowledge of the commission of crime ? He was supposed to report it to the police , was n't he ? But how if the police already knew it , as well as , or better than the citizen ? When the police were abetting the crime , and sharing in the profits of it  --  what then ? Was it the duty of the citizen to compel the police to enforce the law ? And how did that duty weigh against his duty to an employer who paid him a good salary at the end of each month , and furnished him with a seven-room brick cottage , and gas and electricity , and fruit and vegetables , and milk and butter and eggs ? To say nothing of his duty to an employer 's wife who was a relative by marriage , and furnished him and his wife with tea-parties , and social equality , and kindness , and a heaped-up basket at Christmas , and numerous other favors not nominated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Episcopal church in Seaview , an institution of refinement and good breeding ; the rector was no wowser , but a man of the world , who did n't mind having a wee drop or two when he went calling on his parishoners of the country club set . But it was otherwise with the McCallums , who belonged to the Presbyterian church , many of whose members wore the white ribbon of the temperance enthusiasts . Here was an ethical problem indeed , and a social problem ! Could a woman belong to the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union while her husbandgot his salary for superintending a rum-smugglers ' rendezvous ? Could her daughters belong to the Christian Endeavor , and face the sneers of the other children , and questions about the gangstersfrom New York who visited their home at night ? The village was torn to pieces over this issue . The " church element " swarmed like angry hornets , and never had they been so dangerous . Anonymous letters were written to the village constable , and to the sheriff 's office , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were secret meetings of righteous conspirators in various homes . There was a certain Mrs. Doaks , who was of the Methodist persuasion , and a perfect picture of a " wowser , " according to the caricatures in the New York papers : lean , stringy , shrill of voice , and wholly devoid of feminine charms . Her husband was a railroad engineer , so she was one of those in the village who were not dependent upon favors from Broadhaven . She could afford to speak out , and to scold the others for cowardice and subservience ; she did so , and made herself the leader of a new peasant revolt , in the name of law and order , as well as of the Lord and His Commandments . Before long there was a deputation of these church people , calling upon the county officials  --  who placed their hands upon their hearts , and solemnly swore that the law and the Constitution were sacred things to them . They had earnestly sought evidence of law-breaking , but in vain . If valid evidence were brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " church element " went away , discussing the question of how they could get " valid " evidence . It was difficult to figure out , for the reason that Broadhaven was private property , and it was well known that Wallins carried a repeating shotgun , and had been ordered to use it . When the trucks came off the property onto the state highway , they were traveling at high speed , and were guarded by three or four men , who were expecting " hijackers , " and might fail to recognize the credentials of servants of the Lord . It so happened that at this time the legislature of the great Empire State was in process of repealing the prohibition enforcement act , thus leaving the problem up to the Federal government alone . So the deputation betook themselves to New York City , and interviewed an official of the " Prohibition Unit , " as the Federal enforcement service was called . This official passed them on to the customs authorities  --  it being a case of smuggling . The customs official passed them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rum Row . " The enforcement of the law was thus convenientlydivided up , so that each of several departments might " pass the buck . " The church people finally got a promise that an effort would be made to obtain evidence of illegal proceedings at Broadhaven . When they came back a month later , they were told that efforts had been made , but that on the nights when Federal agents had watched the place , no law-breaking had been apparent . Did the members of the deputation have evidence themselves ? They replied that it was common knowledge ; but to this the polite official replied that unfor-P269tunately common knowledge was not evidence in a court of law . To make a case under the Volstead act , it would be necessary for some one to testify that he had seen the liquor being " transported , " and that he had sampled it , and ascertained that it really was liquor , and not , say , ginger ale , or beer of less than one-half of one percent alcoholic content . Kip heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . When he happened to be in the city , and had lunch with Jerry Tyler , he learned still more : The smart and cynical editor explained that the non-enforcement of the Volstead act had become one of the principal sources of revenue of the " Ohio gang , " which still controlled in Washington , in spite of all scandals and exposures . When you wanted to set up in bootlegging and rum-running on a large scale , you paid a visit to the national capital , and interviewed a certain friend of the Attorney-General , who had an office in a government building , though he did no government work . You told him what you wanted , and the price was named . But you did n't pay him money  --  oh , no , they were not so naive as that . You made a secret visit to a " little green house on K Street , " which was rigged up like a fortress in the world war , and there you gave a password , and were admitted to a room which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table a glass bowl such as gold-fish are kept in . Into that bowl you dropped your thousand dollar bills , one at a time , while an eye watched you through a small hole in a curtain . There were millions of dollars ' worth of liberty bonds buried in the basement of that little green house on K Street ; the property of members of the gang , which included more than one cabinet member . It was even said that several hundred thousand dollars of these bonds had been placed in a safe deposit box for President I larding , though he was n't supposed to know where they came from ; he was an old booze-fighter , and a poker-expert  --  according to the editor of the " Gothamite "  --  and had a young girl mistress , who had borne him a child , and came to visit him now and then in a little room in the basement of the White House . Of course Kip would n't believe anything like that ; Kip was a good , patriotic American , and knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang . When he hinted something like that , Jerry smiled patronizingly and said : " I suppose I couldn't even get you to believe that Richard Fessenden was a heavy contributor to the campaign fund which elected President Harding ! " " I might believe that , " admitted Kip . " Why not ? " " And what do you suppose he put it up for ? Because Harding looks like a Roman senator , and makes speeches like a nigger preacher ? " No , said Jerry , at the time of the nomination of the senator from Ohio , everybody had known that the prohibition amendment was going into effect , and the Republican politicians had known who was going into the business of rum-running , and who was going to put up the capital . They had chosen for President a man who knew good liquor when he tasted it , and knew his friends and backers , and stood by them . So now the master of Broadhaven was immune to interference , or to punishment for anything he might do , up to and including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well go out and spit against a hurricane , as try to stop the movement of liquor into New York . " It 's what I told you from the beginning , Kip ; it 's an idiot 's law , and nobody but an idiot would expect it to be enforced . If you really enforced it , you 'd cause a revolution ; the business men would turn out a government that interfered with them to such an extent . " " There 's a lot of business men backing the law , Jerry . " " I know ; they find it convenient to have their workingmen turn up sober on Monday morning . They figure they can pay the price for their own liquor , while their workers have to do without . That 's an aspect of prohibition that the people must understand  --  it 's class legislation , affecting the poor , and sparing the rich . " The editor 's heavy , dark eyebrows frowned with sudden and unaccustomed moral indignation over this . " We have a lot of that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was never so plain as in this case . " " Well , I 'll tell you , " said the younger man . " If you fix it tip so that the rich get drunk while the poor stay sober , you may have another kind of revolution in this country  --  one that the business men wo n't like so well . " Kip would take these arguments home to his wife , and they would go over them , and pick them to pieces , and discuss them from every point of view . It was all so different from what they had expected , P271in the days when they had imagined prohibition . It was extremely depressing , and called for moral efforts on the part of two young wowsers . There was a curious difference of temperament between Kip and Maggie May in these matters . Kip was diffident and given to wonderingabout his own rightness . It was hard for him to differ with two such brilliant men as Jerry Tyler and Roger Chilcote , and he would come away from his arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was wrong in his idea of banning liquor from the world ? Could it be that there was anything good about it ; that it was necessary , say to poets and geniuses , and people like that , whom Kip did n't understand very well ? Could it be that when you forbadepeople to do something , they forthwith fell into a rage of determination , and did that thing harder than ever ? It troubled Kip to be different from people ; he liked to like his friends , and to have them like him ; he had always been intensely uncomfortable when refusing to be sociable . He observed those who drank , and those who refused to drink , and was puzzled because so often he preferred the former . For example , when he went to New York , he wanted to have lunch with Jerry or Roger ; but when he went to Seaview , it never occurred to him to have lunch with Mrs. Doaks , the leader of the temperance forces . He did n't like being scolded himself , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally unpleasant about the business of telling other people how to live ! Yet , what were you going to do ? If you saw a man about to put his foot into a bear-trap , you would warn him ; you would n't stop to think about personal charm , or even politeness , in such an emergency . But it was supposed to be the social convention that you must watch people putting their foot into the trap of alcoholism , and act as if you had no idea of the consequences ; as if you had never seen a man make a fool of himself , and then , later on , a slave of himself , a physical , mental , and moral ruin . Kip would comply with the law of good manners to the extent of holding his tongue , but he could n't hold his face , and people would see his face , and be irritated by it , and then Kip would go away and be irritated by himself . Yes , he was a Puritan and a bluenose , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Jerry ! Maggie May would note this weakness , and scold him for it . This was the difference between them  --  not at all what you would expect from a Southern girl , who seemed so gentle , quiet , and sub- missive . When you got to know her , you discovered that there was a volcano inside her , and now and then it would burst forth with a roar and a glare of flames . Maggie May was a sure-enough wowser , and not even the example of the lean and shrewish Mrs. Doaks could frighten her from her destiny . She had come to loathe drinking , and drinking people , and had taken to saying so , in a way that was scarcely " ladylike . " She held Jerry Tyler in part to blame for her brother 's drinking , and told him this , with such emphasis as to spoil the pleasure of Jerry and his brilliant and worldly wife on their first visit to Broadhaven . She even argued with Cousin Jenny about permitting liquor to be served in her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maggie May had got acquainted with Mrs. Doaks and the rest of the " church element " in the village , and had brought home several pamphlets dealing with the liquor problem . A queer sort of reading matter for an expectant young mother ! Here were the assembled old ladies begging her to keep her mind cheerful  --  and she absorbed in a treatise on the physiological effects of ethyl alcohol ! She even got from the public library a history of the prohibition movement , and would be studying that when she was supposed to be taking a nap ! Kip would protest , and she would tell him that the way for her to find peace of mind was to know how to answer Jerry and Roger , and the other convivial persons of her acquaintance . Was it true that , as they were so fond of asserting , the cause of temperancehad been steadily prospering in the United States , until the fool prohibition law had ruined it all ? No , it was about as far from the truth as any convivial person could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per capita consumption of alcohol had been increasing right along , every year in the entire history of the United States , until the war and war-prohibition ! You needed to know things like that , in order to be sure of your faith , and to defend it against enemies . The movement for liquor control was more than a century old in our country , and in those years men had learned a great deal , and it was a shame to be ignorantof it . You would hear people arguing that the way to temperancewas by education  --  individual reform as opposed to state action and the outlawry of liquor . Well , here were our great-grandmothers , starting crusades , conducting revival meetings , and getting people to sign pledges ; that was individual reform , was n't it ? And yet the per capita consumption of alcohol had continued to increase ! By kneeling in the streets in front of saloons , they would succeed inP273closing all the saloons in a town  --  and then , in a year or two , there would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of having the government go into the liquor business , which was the program of " wets " who said they did n't want the saloon back . It was a fact that this plan had been tried out in South Carolina , and proved worse than no plan at all . Or " local option , " the idea of having each state regulate its own affairs ; that sounded liberal , and the New York " liberals " were strong for it  --  mostly because of their comfortable certainty that their own state would vote wet . Men who declared that national prohibition could n't be enforced , because the United States had so many thousandmiles of coast-line to guard , would propose as their remedy to divide wet states from dry  --  and thus multiply by ten or twenty the boundaries to be guarded ! They would imagine Nevada wet and California dry , and the latter state patroling a six hundred mile border , with a guard at every desert trail and mountain pass . They would imagine Illinois wet and Missouri dry , with speedboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was their bright idea of how to bring bootlegging to an end ! Kip would see his wife wrinkling her forehead over problems such as this , and making memoranda in a note-book , and he would look puzzled , and say : " What are you going to do with all that stuff ? " She would n't tell him definitely : she would just say : Jerry and Roger were not going to have their way in the world without somebody answering back !   MAGGIE MAY went away to a maternity hospital . It was a big , impressive place , and cost more than Kip had been able to save out of his salary . He made the discovery that it is convenientto have a wife with an income of her own ; he wondered what young couples did when the wife was not so fortunate . Perhaps that was why so many couples of the middle-class world did n't have babies  --  or stopped when they discovered the expensiveness of the first one . Kip and the two old ladies visited that institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smelling of disinfectants . There was Maggie May lying in bed , pale and exhausted , but oh , so proud , because it was a fine big boy , and the image of Kip . The nurse brought him in on a pillow , and they were allowed to have a glimpse  --  an incredible spectacle , a red and wrinkled creature , alive , and making motions with its lips . It was Kip 's own , and really did look like a caricature of him , with a flat nose and a round bald head ! Afterwards they put it in a room with some fifty others , laid out in squirming rows , with a tag about ' each one 's ankle  --  but suppose they had made a mistake ? Visitors were not allowed inside , not even grandmothers . Poor old Mrs. Tarleton had to peer through a glass partition at her very own u grandchild ! There were several other old ladies peering indignantly ' through the glass , but Kip brought them to laughter by referring to the place as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back home , rosy and bright again , and bringing that precious miracle  --  that flat-nosed , baldheadedimage of Kip . It is a peculiar fact that life may make the worst possible failures , but when it starts all over again , nobody can resist it . Those tiny fingers , each endowed with its separate bit of magic ; those toes stuck into the air , turned the wrong way , wriggling and reaching around , as if trying to get hold of the branch of a tree ! Those mysterious angel smiles , " not in entire forgetful/ness "  --  no , there was no holding out against them , and Mrs. Fessenden , who had made a failure of her own , came over every day to gaze at this new one of her cousin 's , and advise her how to take care of it . She begged to be allowed to pay all the bills  --  she must have some solid part in this job of creation . Even Mrs. Ralston , the former Countess Ensenada , that brilliant young addict to countryclub life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the deeps of her , and she went off remarking that a poodle was n't enough . Word had gone by telegraph to Pointe Chilcote , and obscure instincts stirred there , and the other grandmother wrote that she must come and have a look . Mrs. Fessenden invited her to visit Broadhaven ; a couple of weeks later there she was , two hundred pounds of grand-maternity , quivering with pleasure because the new infant had been named Roger Chilcote Tarleton , and it was a double honor , because she was told it was after her late husband , and also after her son ! She took possession of the nursery and its treasure , and told Maggie May how she , Maggie May , had helm ved at that age , and how early Lelia had learned to talk , and how Lee had been so slow , but the doctors had said not to worry , and sure enough , it had turned out all right . She told Maggie May about Lee 's bride , and how she was expecting a baby next month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandmother feel that God would reward her in the hereafter . Kip was as proud as the rest of them . He did not analyze his own strange emotions ; but somehow he knew that he , and not all these fluttering women , had been the real cause of this marvel of creation . And no one could deny that this woman , Maggie May , this mother of his son , had done what she had done for his sake . She had had his baby for him  --  because she loved him ! He was not an egotistical man  --  he was just a man . He was glorified by this love which he had earned ; he was glad he had earned it ; he was glad he was a good husband ; he was glad that when he went to work , his wife could know that he was really working , and not thinking about some other woman , nor getting drunk . He was glad for her sake that she had found a husband who agreed with her ideas on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and Maggie May missed Seeing it ; but Kip went to the opening night , and brought the news.
