White-tired limousines and archaic London taxicabs rolled under the smoky colonnade of Burlington House in Piccadilly last week bringing notables to the open ing of the great International Exhibition of Persian Art . Waiting for them inside the building were exhibits with an insured value of $30,000,000 : crown jewels from the Shah , boxes of miniatures from Tur key , rugs , bronzes , ceramics and textiles from the U. S. , France , Germany and 21 other nations . The show was designed to follow the great Flemish and Italian exhibitions at the Royal Academy . But there was this difference : nearly every picture in the Flemish and Italian shows was familiar by reputation at least not only to critics but to the average intelligent tour ist . The Persian exhibition brought to gether for the first time thousands of objects from Persia , from unknown sources all over Europe hitherto absolutely inaccessible ( TIME , Aug. 1 8 ) . <P> Visitors on opening day received from the two crimson-gowned flunkies of the Royal Academy imposing leaflets which announced many royal and titled Patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have spotted in the roster the name of the man who conceived of the exhibition , sold the idea to the Royal Academy and persuaded the tycoons of a half dozen countries to lend it their treasures : Arthur Upham Pope of San Mateo , Calif . <P> Director Pope , 50 and super-kinetic , was graduated from Brown University in 1904 . <P> He has been a professor of philosophy of esthetics , is now Advisory Curator of Mohammedan Art in the Chicago Art Institute and Adviser in Persian Art to the Pennsylvania Art Museum in Philadelphia . <P> Also he is Honorary Adviser in Art to the Persian Government . He has always been wildly enthusiastic about Persian art . It is Brown legend that he helped work his way through college by selling rare oriental rugs to slightly bewildered undergraduates . <P> Mr. Pope still maintains his home in San Mateo , near San Francisco , but he has not been in it for four years . He lives with a huge pile of suitcases , his wife Dr. Phyllis Ackerman ( an authority on Gothic tapestries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one-eared goat from the time of Darius the Great . The goat 's name is Hugo . <P> Arthur Upham Pope seems healthy but no company will insure him . He travels everywhere by airplane , writes scathing letters to airline officials on the difficulty of typing or studying in their planes . In Persia he is intimate with the Shah , risks his life almost daily photographing mosques and sacred tombs. * Last April Archeologist Pope decided that what the U. S. needed was an American Institute for Persian Art &; Archeology , to do learned digging in Per sia , provide scholarships , publish mono graphs . In a few weeks he had dazzled such tycoons and pundits as Mortimer Leo Schiff , Professor Arthur Kingsley , Dr. William R. Valentiner , Percy R. Pyne Jr. , Frank Crowninshield , George Dwight Pratt , into accepting posts on the board of directors . Then he left for London with the Institute half organized . <P> To convince the Royal Academy of the desirability of a Persian exhibition was child 's play .
