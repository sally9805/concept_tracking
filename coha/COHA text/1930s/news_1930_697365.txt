txt " Vive Coste ! " " Vive Bellonte ! " " Vive la France ! " All over Paris these cries have roused the midnight hours . There is no one in the city who does not know that Coste and Bellonte have crossed safely from Paris to New York by air ; crossed between breakfast time on one day and supper time on the next . " They have done it , " has been cried up every street , and every one knew who " they " were and what they had done . And so to bed , with immense , tremendous happiness , contentment and pride . From Curtiss Field to the Place de la Concorde came the voice of Graham : " He 's taxiing down the field ! " The rest was interrupted by the clamor of those who did not understand . Then a French voice broke in : " Caste has landed ! " It was that way that Paris learned that the great adventure of east-Lowest crossing of the Atlantic had been accomplished , that Nungesser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindbergh 's great flight had been complemented and that the link between Paris and New York had been forged on both sides by air . By tremendous handclapping Captain Coste was acclaimed , and there was an immense sigh of relief . The great historic place , the Place de la Concorde , had been crowded . Even its immense acreage could scarcely hold those who came . It was impossible to count the multitude . For that was a rendezvous of all Paris . It was there that it had been arranged all news should be broadcast from the roof of the automobile club . Only that great space , it was certain , could hold the crowd of those who all day had been asking , " Where are they now ; when will they arrive ? " Crowd Sure of Success . There never was any doubt in any one 's mind all day  --  not in that of Mme. Coste or of Mme. Bellonte ; not in that of taxi drivers , who would ask their fares for the latest news ; not in that of concierges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of most extraordinary cama- raderie . There was nothing in any one 's mind but , these fliers . No one could talk of anything else , think of anything else . Yet there was no excitement . Coste 's coolness and self-control seemed to he shared by his countrymen . He had , too , given them his confidence . There was , none of that feverishness of that dreadful day when the city went first wild with excitement and then fierce with rage over the reports and truth of Nungesser 's and Coli 's tragic adventure . It seemed almost as if every one was waiting to hear that the Question Mark had arrived before he should let his emotions have scope . That was how it was , too , in the Place de la Concorde all evening . From 8 o'clock the crowd began to gather . By 9 it had swelled to such proportions that all traffic had to be stopped . By 10 o'clock every lamp post and all the statues of citizens of France which decorate the square were draped with youngsters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Champs Elysee and all roads leading to the square were packed with cars . It was impossible to move out or in except on foot . Yet there was no noise , no excitement . When about 9 o'clock it was announced that the Question Mark had been signalled near Boston there were cheers . When later it was reported as being over Southampton these cheers grew warmer . Enthusiasm Still Withheld . But there was still no tempest of enthusiasm . That was being bottled up for later . It seemed almost as if all these people would not dare risk excitement in case it should he premature . There have been so many failures to achieve a perfect flight . Better wait until one was sure they had arrived . Then came the message near 11 o'clock of fog and storm . The radio announcer tried his best to reassure the crowd . It might mean delay , but only delay . So eager was every one for a perfect , for another Lindbergh landing that the news fell like a fog itself on the multitude . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Even if they landed that would not be enough . They must reach Curtiss Field . Those with children and household cares began to melt away , for it was 11 o'clock . Others bethought themselves of the nearest cafe , for the Frenchman is practical . Most , however , remained waiting patiently , very decorously for their great moment . Crowd Yields at Last to Joy . It came at last near 11:45 , when from the roof a voice announced that the Question Mark had been over Norwich . Conn. , and that it might be expected at Curtiss Field in half an hour . Then , but not until then , did these French people 's cheering have any warmth , their handclapping expressing their joy . They were sure at last . Twenty-five minutes later all their pent-up emotion Ict Itself loose . In snatches , but sufficiently clear , came from Curtiss Field sentences in English which told that the great moment had come ; Lthat the two Frenchmen who left Paris yesterday morning after breakast had landed In New York . Realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the crowd kept shouting , drowning by its cries what detaials were being given . Then It cared nothing for details . ' The fact was enough . Victory had been won . " Vive Coste ! " they shouted in thousands , and the cry began to grow and grow . It surged out into Place de la Concorde , along Rue Royal into the boulevards . Around the Matin and Intransigeant offices other crowds of thousands had heard the news . It spread from mouth to mouth , from house to house , from street to street . In half an hour everybody knew it . Taximen shouted It to each other as they flashed past . People leaning from windows cried down to passersby asking and repeating what they had heard . There were many who embraced , many who clapped and cheered . Yet , not any great demonstration . That will be reserved for that day when Caste and Bellonte come home . Along boulevards youngsters formed in groups , shouting , " vive Coste " and vive la France , " and here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bared heads . It was all rather a solemn moment in Paris than one for demonstration . France to Honor Caste . PARIS , Sept. 3 ' ( Wednesday ) ( W ) . ? The government announced early this morning that it would make Captain Dieudonn ? Coste a Commander of the Legion of Honor in recognition of his achievement in flying from Paris to the United States . The news of the landing reached Paris three minutes after Coste set his wheels down at Curtiss Field , or fifteen minutes after midnight , Paris time . The height of enthusiasm was reached at the Place de la Concorde when the voice of Coste himself , speaking in a microphone at Curtiss Field , was heard by 25,000 Frenchmen . The victorious aviator in modest tones told the crowd in its native tongue of his trip . His voice was hoarse and husky , rather difficult to understand in comparison with the earlier reception , but the crowd caught the drift of his remarks and cheered until the voice of the aviator was drowned in the terrific din . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninterrupted for fully seven minutes . At 1,3 Bourget Airfield , whence the fliers took off on their transatlantic journey , practically all flying activities were halted after word had been received in the afternoon that Coste had made landfall on the North American continent ' : Aviators doffed their flying togs to sit in restaurants or stay on the field and chart the route of the ocean fliers as reports came in . One newspaper bore the headline " Coste Has Answered the Question Mark . " The newspaper adds " the question now should he changed to an exclamation of joy and admiration . " The cheering in the streets rose to a mighty roar when it was announced by a broadcaster that Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh would he on band in New . York to yfelconlo the Frenchmen to America . The throngs shouted " Vive Lindbergh " and " Vive Coste. " later , but each told his wife they would make the South American flight . Their main object , they said , was the Paris-New York crossing . Caste in particular , however , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had a triumphal reception on his round-the-world trip with Joseph Lebrix . Bellonte also is eager to go to South America and asked his wife to join him in New York before the flight south . He told her that it probably would be about a month after his present transatlantic flight , but his plans remained indefinite when he left . Friends and relatives said only Coste and Bellonte know exactly what they are going to do . When the mother of Nungesser was informed of Coste:s success she broke into tears of joy . " Since the departure of those brave men I Coste and Bellonte ) I have shared the anguish of all and have lived again those dolorous hours of three years ago , " she said . " I rejoice in their achievement . Their flight was admirably prepared , and I am certain that my dear son would have succeeded if as much care had been devoted to the preparation . " I welcome the triumph of Coste and Bellonte with all the joy of a mother . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
