The Death Traps of FX-31 A Commander John Hanson Adventure By Sewell Peaslee Wright * * * * * Sidenote : Commander John Hanson recalls his harrowing expedition among the giant spiders of FX-31 . I do not wish to appear prejudiced against scientists . I am not prejudiced , but I have observed the scientific mind in action , on a great many occasions , and I find it rather incomprehensible . It is true that there are men with a scientific turn of mind who , at the same time , you can feel safe to stand with shoulder to shoulder , in an emergency . Young Hendricks , who was my junior officer on the Ertak , back in those early days of the Special Patrol Service , about which I have written so much , was one of these . Nor , now that I come to think of the matter in the cool and impartial manner which is typical of me , was young Hendricks the only one . There was a chap -- let 's see , now . I remember his face very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alert men , a native of Earth , and his name was -- Inverness ! Carlos Inverness . Old John Hanson 's memory is n't quite as tricky as some of these smart young officers of the Service , so newly commissioned that the silver braid is not yet fitted to the curve of their sleeves , would lead one to believe . I met Inverness in the ante-room of the Chief of Command . The Chief was tied up in one of the long-winded meetings which the Silver-sleeves devoted largely to the making of new rules and regulations for the confusion of both men and officers of the Service , but he came out long enough to give me the Ertak 's orders in person . " Glad to see you here at Base again , Commander , " he said , in his crisp , business-like way . " Hear some good reports of your work ; keep it up ! " " Thank you , sir , " I said , wondering what was in the air . Any time the Chief was complimentary , it was well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected trouble . " Not at all , Commander , not at all . And now , let me present Carlos Inverness , the scientist , of whom you have undoubtedly heard . " I bowed and said nothing , but we shook hands after the fashion of Earth , and Inverness smiled quite humanly . " I imagine the good captain has been too busy to follow the activities of such as myself , " he said , sensibly enough . " A commander "  - -  and I laid enough emphasis on the title to point out to him his error in terminology --  " in the Special Patrol Service usually finds plenty to occupy his mind , " I commented , wondering more than ever what was up . Illustration : At the same instant two other trap-doors swung up . " True , " said the Chief briskly . " You 'll pardon me if I 'm exceedingly brief , Commander , but there 's a sizeable group in there waiting my return . " I have a special mission for you ; a welcome relief from routine patrol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , for assignments other than the routine work of the Service , Commander ? " He was boxing me up in a corner , and I knew it , but I could n't deny what he said , so I admitted it as gracefully as I could . " Very well , " nodded the Chief , and it seemed to me his eyes twinkled for an instant . " Inverness , here , is head of a party of scientists bent upon a certain exploration . They have interested the Council in the work , and the Council has requested the cooperation of this Service . " He glanced at me to make sure I understood . I certainly did ; when the Supreme Council requested something , that thing was done . " Very well , sir , " I said . " What are your orders ? " The Chief shrugged . " Simply that you are to cooperate with Inverness and his party , assisting them in every possible way , including the use of your ship for transporting them and a reasonable amount of equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship remains , of course , in you and your officers , but in every reasonable way the Ertak ? " " Perfectly , sir . " Nothing could have been clearer . I was to run the ship , and Inverness and his crew were to run me . I could just imagine how Correy , my fighting first officer , would take this bit of news . The mental picture almost made me laugh , disgusted as I was . " Written orders will , of course , be given you before departure . I believe that 's all . Good luck , Commander ! " The Chief offered his hand briefly , and then hurried back to the other room where the Silver-sleeves had gathered to make more rulings for the confusion of the Service . * * * * * " Since when , " asked Correy bitterly , " are we running excursions for civilians ? We 'll be personally conducting elderly ladies next thing . " " Or put on Attached Police Service , " growled Hendricks , referring to the poor devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populated worlds , cruising over the same pitiful routes day after day , never rising beyond the fringe of the stratosphere . " Perhaps , " suggested the level-headed Kincaide , " it is n't as bad as it sounds . Did n't you , say , sir , that this Inverness was rather a decent sort of chap ? " I nodded . " Very much so . You 'd scarcely take him for a scientist . " " And our destination is -- what ? " asked Kincaide . " That I do n't know . Inverness is to give us that information when he arrives , which will be very shortly , if he is on time . " " Our destination , " said Correy , " will probably be some little ball of mud with a tricky atmosphere or some freak vegetation they want to study . I 'd rather --  " A sharp rap on the door of the navigating room , where we had gathered for an informal council of war , interrupted . " Party of three civilians at the main exit port , Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard . " One sent his name : Carlos Inverness . " " Very good . Admit them at once , and recall the outer guards . We are leaving immediately . " As the guard saluted and hurried away , I nodded to Correy . " Have the operating room crew report for duty at once , " I ordered , " and ask Sub-officer Scholey to superintend the sealing of the ports . Mr. Kincaide , will you take the first watch as navigating officer ? Lift her easily until we determine our objective and can set a course ; this is like shoving off with sealed orders . " " Worse , " said Hendricks unhappily . " Sealed orders promise something interesting , and --  " " Carlos Inverness and party , " announced the guard from the doorway . Inverness nodded to me in friendly fashion and indicated his two companions . " Commander Hanson , " he said , " permit me to present Godar Tipene and Cleve Brady , who are my companions on this expedition . " I bowed , and shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not offer me this greeting of Earth . Then , quickly , I completed the round of introductions , studying Inverness 's companions with interest as I did so . * * * * * Brady was short , and rather red-faced ; a beefy , taciturn type , with a trap-like mouth and thoughtful discerning eyes . He struck me as being one with whom most men would like to be friendly , but who would have exceedingly few friends . The Zenian was a perfect foil for him . Tipene was exceedingly tall and slender , like all his race , and very dark . His eyes were almost womanly in their softness , and he had the nervous grace of a thoroughbred -- which is an Earth animal of particularly high breeding , raised for show purposes . He had the happy faculty of speaking the language of Earth without a trace of Zenian or Universal accent ; the Zenians are exceeded by none in linguistic ability , which was a real accomplishment before these decadent days when native languages are slipping so rapidly into obscurity . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were over , " I presume you 'll wish to know something about our destination and the objects of this expedition , sir ? " " It would be helpful in charting our course , " I admitted , smiling . Inverness , with beautiful disregard for the necessities of space navigation , spread voluminous papers over the table whose surface was formed by the pair of three-dimensional charts which were the Ertak 's eyes in outer space . " Our destination , " he said , " is a body designated on the charts as FX-31 . You are familiar with it , Commander Hanson ? " " Hardly familiar , " I admitted , smiling at Correy . " The universe is rather sizable , and even the named bodies are so numerous that one is able to be familiar with but an exceedingly small percentage . Its designation , of course , gives me certain information regarding its size , location and status , however . " " How much information , Commander ? " asked Tipene nervously . " Well , ' F ' indicates that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The numerals tells me where to locate it upon our space charts . And the ' X ' would indicate that it is inhabited , but not by intelligent beings . Or that there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of those inhabiting it . " " A very good summary of the knowledge we have , " nodded Inverness approvingly . " I can add but one bit of information which may or may not be accurate : that the sphere known as FX-31 is populated by a ruling class decidedly unusual in type , and possessed of a degree of intelligence which has made them virtual masters of the sphere . " " What are they like ? " asked Correy . " Will they put up a fight ? Are they dangerous ? " * * * * * " Our knowledge came from a luckless tramp liner which set down on FX-31 in search of water , their water-producing equipment having been damaged by carelessness . They found water , a great river of it , and sent a party of five men to determine its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had gone a hundred feet from the ship -- and no more men were sent out . They hovered over the stream and drew up the water in containers devised for the purpose . " " Snapped up ? " asked Correy impatiently . " By whom ? Or what ? " " By spiders ! " replied Inverness , his eyes shining with the fanatical gleam of a scientist who scents something strange . " Great spiders -- perhaps not true spiders , but akin to them , from the descriptions we have -- of what is known on Earth as the trap-door variety , but possessed of a high degree of intelligence , the power of communication , and definitely organized . " " Organized , " put in Tipene , " in the sense that they work together instead of individually ; that there are those to command and those to obey . " " You say they are large , " I commented . " How large ? " " Large enough , " said Inverness grimly , " to enable one of them to instantly overpower a strong man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes were located , and his eyes lit up with the thought of battle . " If there 's anything I hate , " he gritted , " it 's a spider . The hairy , crawling beasts ! I 'll man one of the tubes myself , just for the fun of seeing them dissolve into nice brown dust , and --  " " I 'm afraid not , Mr. Correy , " said Inverness , shaking his head . " We 're going to study them -- not to exterminate them . Our object is to learn their history , their customs , their mode of communication , and their degree of intelligence -- if possible . " " Yes , " grunted Brady . " If possible . " * * * * * Kincaide set the Ertak down on FX-31 , close to the shore of a river , as gently as a feather settling to earth . Correy and I made our way to the exit port , where Inverness and his companions had gathered , with a considerable amount of scientific apparatus , and what seemed to be a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientists were clad in suits of some gray material , flexible as cloth , but possessed of a certain metallic sheen , which completely covered them . The material had been stiffened to form a sort of helmet , with a broad band of transparent material set in at the eye level , so that the wearer could see to both sides , as well as to the front . I could also discern the outlines of menores -- the crude and cumbersome type of thought-transference instrument used in that day -- apparently built into the helmets . Belted around their middles were atomic pistols of the latest and most deadly model . " For emergency use only , Commander , " explained Inverness , observing my glance . His voice came quite clearly through the fabric which covered his face , so I gathered it was sufficiently porous to admit air for breathing . " This garment we wear will be sufficient protection , we believe ; their mandibles are the weapons of the creatures we are to study , and this fabric should be ample protection against much more deadly weapons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river ; if we are not molested -- and I believe we shall not be , here , because the infiltration of water would quickly fill any passage sunk into this sandy earth so close to the river -- please have your men bring our supplies to us , the boat first . " I nodded , and the three men walked through the open port , out across the gleaming , golden sand , to the water 's edge . A number of great scarlet birds , with long , fiercely taloned legs , swooped about them curiously , croaking hoarsely and snapping their hawkish beaks , but offering no real molestation . My men quickly carried their supplies to them , and before the last of the equipment had been delivered , the boat was assembled and afloat : a broad-beamed craft with hollow metal ribs , covered with some shining fabric which was unfamiliar to me . There was a small cabin forward and a small atomic engine housed back near the stern . I walked to the edge of the water and shook hands with Inverness and Brady ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Inverness , " that I am facing you with what will , undoubtedly , be a monotonous and wearying vigil , for we shall probably be gone several weeks . " He referred , I must explain , to a period of seven Earth days , a common unit of time on Earth . " We 'll make the best of it , " I said , thinking of Correy , and how he would rage at such a period of inaction . " The best of luck to you ! " " Thanks ; we 'll remain no longer than necessary , " smiled Inverness , smiling , his shining eyes already fixed on the river ahead . " And that will be no short time , " said the taciturn Brady . " Shall we start ? " * * * * * Correy raged . I had expected that , and I was in complete sympathy with him . Routine patrol was better than being earth-fast on this barren and uninteresting ball of mud . " Have I your permission , sir , " asked Correy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of inspection and exploration ? We might run into some fresh meat . " " I 'm not sure that would be wise . These spider creatures --  " " Pardon me , sir , " interrupted Correy eagerly , " but we could take a small landing force , armed with pistols and grenades . Even a field ray tube . Certainly we could handle anything which might turn up , then . " " And , you rather hope that something will turn up , Mr. Correy ? " Correy grinned and shrugged his shoulders . " It would break the monotony , would n't it , sir ? And , too , if anything should happen to them "  - -  and he glanced up the river , in the direction taken by the three scientists --  " we 'd know something about what we had to contend with , would n't we ? " I 'm not sure whether it was Correy 's argument or my own venturesome disposition which swayed me , but immediately after lunch Correy and I , with a picked crew of men , started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had confined our activities to the area between the ship and the shore -- a small enough space at best . Now we rounded the shining blunt bow of the Ertak and headed inland , Correy and myself in the lead , the two portable disintegrator ray-men immediately behind us , and the four other men of the party flanking the ray operators , two on each side . It was hot , but the air was dry and invigorating . There was not a cloud visible in the sky . Far ahead was a low line of bluish , fronded , vegetation ; whether small trees or some fern-like undergrowth , we could not determine . The ground between the ship and the line of vegetation was almost completely barren , the only growth being a lichenous sort of vegetation , gray-green in color . * * * * * Here and there on the ground were the imprints of sharp , split hoofs , and Correy pointed these out to me with the comment that one of the guards had reported seeing a number of slender-legged animals roaming here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange apparition of our ship . " From the way he described them , they 're something like the deer we used to have on Earth , " he said . " I 've seen the fossils in the museums , and they had little sharp , split hoofs like --  " One of the men behind us shouted a warning at that instant , and we both whirled in our tracks . My eyes fell instantly upon one of the strangest and most fearsome sights I have ever seen -- and I have explored many strange and terrible worlds . To our left , a huge circular section of the earth had lifted , and was swinging back on a hinge of glistening white fibers ; a disk as great in diameter as the height of a man , and as thick as a man 's body . Where the disk had been , gaped a tunnel slanting down into the earth , and lined with the same glistening white fibers which covered the bottom of the disk , and hinged it in place . As I looked , there sprang from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet which was too monstrous to be called by such an innocuous name . It was rust red in color , with eight bristling legs , each tipped with three curved and tufted claws . On each side of its face was an armored mandible , tipped with shining fangs , and beside them , slender , six-jointed palps stretched hungrily . The man who had seen the disk fly up opened fire without orders , and if he had not done so , some of us would not have returned to the ship . As it was , the atomic pistol whispered a steady stream of death which spattered the hairy body into an oozing pulp while it was still in mid-air . We leaped away , adding our fire to that of the alert guard who had first seen the apparition , and the spider , a twitching bundle of bespattered legs , fell on the spot where , an instant before , we had been . Almost at the same instant two other great circular trap-doors swung up , just beyond the first , and their hairy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our pistols were ready , now , however , and the portable ray equipment was humming . The ray dissolved the first into a sifting of reddish dust , and our pistols slashed the other into ribbons . " Back to the ship ! " I shouted . " Look , Mr. Correy -- there are hundreds of them ! " Before us score upon score of the great disks were lifting , and from the tunnel each revealed , monstrous rust-red bodies were pouring . Our retreat covered by the two ray operators , we made our way swiftly to the ship . The great spiders , apparently alarmed by the magical disappearance of those of their comrades upon which the disintegrator ray rested , hesitated for a moment , their tremendous legs tensed , and their mandibles quivering with venomous anger , and then scuttled back into their holes , swinging their covers into place as they did so . " We did n't do so badly , at that , " grinned Correy rather breathlessly , as we gained the welcome shelter of the Ertak . " There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many spiders did n't go back to tell about what happened to them . " " True -- but had they waited until they could have surrounded us , the Ertak would have been short-handed on the return trip . She would have been just two officers and six men short . " I have never seen a real expression of fear on Correy 's face , but I came as close to it then as I ever did . " They 're tough customers , " he said . " I never did like spiders , and I like them less , now . Those things stood half again as high as a man on their long legs , and could jump half the length of the ship . " " Hardly that , " I said . " But I 'll say this : if they 're the gentry Inverness and the other two are investigating , they 're welcome to their jobs ! " * * * * * There was n't any difficulty in keeping the men close to the ship after that , although waiting was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely , however , and found that they fed at night upon the deer-like creatures Correy had mentioned . These unwary beasts , seeking water , were pounced upon the instant they came close to one of the hidden dens , and dragged swiftly out of sight . These observations were made by television , and Correy in particular would sit up half the night watching the creatures at work . It was the second day of the fourth week that the sentry on duty called out that the boat was returning . We hastened down to the river to welcome them back , and I for one felt very much relieved . But as the boat approached , I felt my fears returning , for there was only one man visible : Tipene . The Zenian , bedraggled and weary , had lost or discarded the protective suit he had worn , and his lean , dark face was haggard . " We leave immediately , Commander Hanson , " he said as he disembarked . " Please give the necessary orders . " " But the others , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Tipene . " The Aranians got them . I barely escaped myself . " " And who are the Aranians ? " I asked . " The creatures which control this world . The spider creatures . Aranians , they call themselves . Do we leave at once , as I ordered ? " I thought quickly . I did n't like Tipene , and never had , and I fancied even less the high-handed attitude he was taking . " I would suggest , sir , that you first give us an account of what has happened , " I said shortly . " If there is anything we can do for the other two , perhaps --  " " I said they were dead , " snapped Tipene . " You ca n't do anything for dead men , can you ? " " No . But we must have a report to enter on our log , you understand , and -- I 'll be very busy on the return trip . I 'd like to have your story before we start . " Somehow , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn you I shall report your delay to your superiors . " I shrugged , and led the way to the dining saloon which , small as it was , held chairs enough to seat us all . * * * * * " My story is very brief , " he said , when my three officers , Tipene , and myself were seated . " We proceeded up the river to a spot which we deemed suited as a point of entry into the country , and far enough from the ship so that its presence would not be alarming to the inhabitants . " We permitted ourselves to be captured by the Aranians , knowing that our protective suits would prevent them from doing us serious bodily injury . " You have seen the creatures -- word of your adventure with them precipitated our misfortune , I might say here -- and you know of their tunnels . We were taken down one of these tunnels , and into a still larger one . This in turn gave onto a veritable subterranean avenue , and , in time , led to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growled Correy . " An underground city of those things ? " " I should like to ask that you do not interrupt , " said Tipene coldly . " This metropolis was really no more than a series of cubicles , opening off the innumerable crisscrossing tunnels , and many layers in thickness . Passage from one level to another was by means of slanting tunnels . " Some of these cubicles were very large , and utilized as storage rooms . Others were used for community activities , schools , entertainments , and so forth . We learned these things later , and explored them by means of our ethon lamps -- the entire system of tunnels being , of course , in utter darkness . " The first few days they were exceedingly hostile , and tried to tear us to pieces . When they could not do this , word was sent to some of their more learned members , and we were investigated . By the use of extra menores we had brought with us , we established a contact with their minds ; first by the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later by more direct process . " * * * * * " I will say nothing of the great scientific value of our discoveries , for you would neither understand nor appreciate them -- although they will set the scientific universe agog , " continued Tipene , his eyes gleaming suddenly with a triumphant light . " As we perfected communication , we convinced them that we were friendly , and we gained their complete confidence . " They are a very ancient race . Very slowly have they come to their present stage of mental development , but they now possess reasoning faculties , a language -- and a form of community government . There is much more , which , as I have said , would be of no significance to you . " And then word came that beings like ourselves had attacked and killed many of the Aranians . The news had traveled slowly , for their system of communication is crude , but it reached the community center in which we were staying . " Instantly , all was hostility . They felt they had been betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inverness , always rash and thoughtless , had discarded their protective suits , feeling sure they were perfectly safe , and they were torn to pieces . " I , having a more scientific and cautious mind , doubting everything as a true scientific mind must , still wore my armor . By the liberal use of my pistol , I managed to fight my way to the surface , and to the boat . And now , Commander Hanson , will you start back , as I have ordered ? " I do n't know what I would have said if I had not caught a peculiar glance from Correy , a glance accompanied by a significant , momentary closing of one eye ( a gesture of Earth which means many things , and which is impossible to explain ) and a slight nod . " Very well , Mr. Tipene , " I said shortly . " We 'll start at once . Gentlemen , will you join me in the navigating room ? " * * * * * Correy was the last to arrive in the navigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing . " I 've just transferred Tipene to another stateroom , sir , " he said . " A specially equipped stateroom . " " You what ? " " If you 'll give orders , sir , for an immediate start , I 'll tell you all about it , " chuckled Correy . " Tipene says he 's worn out , and is going to retire as soon as we start . And when he does -- we 'll learn something . " I nodded to Kincaide , and he gave the general attention signal . In a few seconds the outer sentry was recalled , and the exit port had been sealed . Slowly , the Ertak lifted . " Maybe I 'm wrong , sir , " said Correy then , " but I 'm convinced that Tipene is lying . Something 's wrong ; he was in altogether too much of a hurry to get away . " So , before I transferred him to the other stateroom , I concealed a menore under the mattress of his bunk , immediately under where his head will lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it will pick up enough energy to emanate what he 's thinking about . We 'll be in the next stateroom and see what we can pick up . How does that sound , sir ? " " Like something you 'd cook up , Mr. Correy ! " I said promptly . " And I believe , as you do , that if it works at all , we 'll find out something interesting . " We equipped ourselves with menores , adjusted to maximum power , and silently filed into the stateroom adjacent to Tipene 's . He was moving about slowly , apparently undressing , for we heard first one boot and then another drop to the floor . And we could sense vague emanations , too faint to be intelligible , and unmistakably coming from him . " Probably sitting on the edge of his bunk , " whispered Correy . " When he lies down , it 'll work like a charm ! " It did -- almost too well . Suddenly we caught a strong emanation , in the Universal language . * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving orders -- hurt his dignity . But I had my own way , and that 's all that 's important . Seemed to be suspicious -- they all were . Maybe I was a bit urgent -- but I was afraid -- those damned Aranians might have changed their spidery minds . " They ca n't be very intelligent -- to think I 'd come back with tribute to pay for the spiders that fool Hanson and his men killed . Why , the ship 's rays could wipe them all out , drill a hole in the ground -- they did n't realize that . Thought that by holding Brady and that conceited Inverness for hostages , they 'd be safe -- and I 'd be idiotic enough to not see this chance to get all the glory of the expedition for myself -- instead of sharing it with those two . You 're a quick thinker , Tipene -- the true , ruthless , scientific mind .... " I motioned for my officers to follow me , and we made our way , silent and grim-faced , to the navigating room . " Nice , friendly lad , is n't he ? " snarled Correy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your plans , sir ? " " We 'll go to the rescue of Inverness and Brady , of course . Mr. Correy , place Tipene under arrest , and bring him here at once . Mr. Kincaide , take over the ship ; give orders to set her down where we were . And you , Mr. Hendricks , will take personal command of the forward ray tubes . " My officers sprang to obey orders , and I paced restlessly up and down the room , thinking . Just as the Ertak settled softly to earth , Correy returned with his prisoner . Two men stood on guard with drawn atomic pistols at the door . " What 's the meaning of this indignity , sir ? " flared Tipene . He had dressed hurriedly , and was by no means an imposing spectacle . He drew himself up to his full height , and tried to look domineering , but there was fear in his eyes . " I shall report you --  " " You 'll do no reporting , Tipene , " I broke in coldly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know all about your little plan to desert your comrades , held by the Aranians as hostages , and to grasp all the glory of your findings for yourself . But -- the plan does n't work . We 're going back . " * * * * * Tipene 's face drained a dirty yellow -- a Zenian can never be actually pale . " You ... how .... " he floundered . " A menore , under your pillow , " I explained crisply . " But that does n't matter , now . You will guide us to the spot where you found the Aranian city , and establish communication with the Aranians . When that 's done , I 'll give you further orders . " " And if I wo n't ? " breathed Tipene , his teeth clenched in a shaking rage . " But you will . Otherwise , we 'll permit you to continue your explorations on this interesting little sphere -- minus your protective suit . " Tipene stared at me with horror-stricken eyes . I think he saw that I meant exactly what I said -- and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Then watch the river carefully , " I ordered . " Kincaide , lift her just enough so we can get a good view of the river . Tipene will tell you where to set her down . " Navigating visually , Kincaide followed the winding course of the river , covering in a few minutes a distance it had taken the scientists a day to navigate . " There -- there is the place , " said Tipene suddenly . " Just this side of the patch of vegetation . " " Very good . And remember what happens if you play any tricks , " I nodded grimly . " Descend to within a few yards of the ground , Mr. Kincaide ; we 'll drop Tipene through the trap . " Correy hurried the prisoner away , and I ordered the trap in the bottom of the Ertak 's hull to be opened . " Now , " I informed Tipene , " we 'll let you down and you will establish communication with the Aranians . Tell them you have brought back , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire city out of existence . It will be a simple matter for you to picture what an atomic grenade or one of the ship 's rays will do . We 'll arrange a little demonstration , if they 're not convinced . And tell them that if they do n't want to be wiped out , to bring Inverness and Brady to us , unharmed , as fast as their eight long legs will manage . " " They wo n't do it , " whined Tipene . " They were very angry over the killing of those others . I 'm just risking my life without the possibility of gain . " " You obey my orders , or you go down and stay there , " I said abruptly . " Which ? " " I 'll do as you say , " he said , and the cage dropped with him swiftly . * * * * * As soon as he was on the ground he reached up and adjusted his menore , peering around anxiously . For several minutes nothing happened , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trap-doors flew open . Out of it came one of the spiders , not rust-red like those we had seen , but faded to a dirty yellow . Close behind him were two of the rust-red Aranians , which fell in one on each side of the yellow chap . The first Aranian , I presumed -- and rightly -- was one of the old learned members of the race . As he scuttled closer to the cowering Tipene , I saw that , amidst the bristles which covered his head and thorax , was a menore . The three great spiders approached the ship warily , watching it constantly with huge , glittering eyes . A safe distance away they paused , and the old one fixed his attention on Tipene . Evidently , what Tipene emanated caused the old fellow to become very angry ; I could see his legs quivering , and his withered old mandibles fairly clattered . " He says he wo n't do it ! " Tipene called up to me , excitedly . " Says we ca n't reach them underground , and that they 'll kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ask him if there are any tunnels between the ship and the river , " I commanded . " We 'll demonstrate what we can do if he harms Inverness and Brady . " The two were in silent communion for a moment , and Tipene looked up and shook his head . " No , " he shouted . " No tunnels there . The water would seep into them . " " Then tell him to watch ! " I stepped back and pressed an attention signal . " Mr. Hendricks ? " " Yes , sir ! " " Open up with the starboard tube , full power , concentrated beam , at any spot halfway between here and the river . At once . " " At once , sir ! " * * * * * The ray generators hummed instantly , their note deepening a moment later . The ray bit into the dry , sandy soil , boring steadily into the earth , making an opening over twice the height of a man in diameter . The fine , reddish-brown dust of disintegration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , as the ray cut deeper into the earth , settled quickly and disappeared . " Cease operation , Mr. Hendricks ! " I commanded . " Keep the generators on , and stand by for further orders . " As soon as Hendricks ' quick acknowledgment came back , I called down to Tipene . " Tell your friend to inspect the little hole we drilled , " I said . " Tell him to crawl down into it , if he wishes to see how deep it is . And then inform him that we have several ray tubes like this one , and that if he does not immediately produce his hostages , unharmed , we 'll rise above his city and blast out a crater big enough to bury the Ertak . " Tipene nodded and communicated with the aged Aranian , who had cowered from the shaft in the earth disintegrated by our ray , and who now , very cautiously , approached it , flanked by his two far from eager guards . At the lip of the slanting tunnel he paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the lidded tunnel whence he had emerged . " He agrees , " Tipene called up sullenly . " He will deliver Inverness and Brady to us . But we must come and get them ; he says they have barricaded themselves in one of the cubicles , and will not permit any Aranian to approach . They still have their atomic pistols ; the Aranians did not realize they were weapons . " " Very well ; tell him a party from the ship will be ready in a few seconds . You will go with us as interpreter ; you understand how to communicate with them . " * * * * * I pressed Correy 's attention signal and he answered instantly . " Pick five good men for a landing party , two of them portable disintegrator ray operators , with equipment . The others will be provided with ethon lamps , pistols , and atomic grenades . Get the men to the trap as quickly as possible , please . " " Immediately , sir ! " I had the cage drawn up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , Correy was waiting with his men . " One second , Mr. Correy , and we 'll leave , " I said , calling the navigating room . " Mr. Kincaide , I 'm leaving you in command . We are going into the Aranian city to pick up Inverness and Brady . I anticipate no trouble , and if there is no trouble , we shall return within an hour . If we are not back within three hours , blast this entire area with atomic grenades , and riddle it with the rays . Is that clear ? " " Yes , sir , " said Kincaide . " And then proceed immediately to Base and report . I have made an entry in the log regarding this expedition , as official evidence , if needed . " " Right , sir , " said Kincaide , who was as near a perfect officer as I have ever seen . " Mr. Correy , you 've heard my orders . So have you , men . We 're going underground , into a veritable warren of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this service , you have my permission to withdraw . " Not a man moved . Correy hardly repressed a grin . He knew the men he had picked for the job . " Good ! " I said , and signaled to the cage operator . Swiftly we dropped to earth , where Tipene and our three hairy guides awaited us. * * * * * The descent into the white-lined tunnel was a terrifying experience . The lining was tough and fibrous , a sort of coarse material corresponding to the silk of a spider of normal size , although these strands were as large as my little finger , and strong as cables . A close inspection of our guides added nothing to my confidence or bravery ; their eight beady eyes , set at strategic spots about their heads , seemed unwinkingly ominous . And their mandibles , with fangs folded back like the blades of a pocket-knife , paired with their bristly palps , seemed like very capable weapons . The Aranians ran ahead of us , our ethon lamps making strange and distorted shadows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herded the unwilling Tipene just ahead of us , and the five picked men brought up the rear . About forty feet down , the floor of the tunnel curved sharply and leveled off ; a short distance farther on a number of other level tunnels merged with it , and the shape changed ; from a tube perfectly circular in cross-section , it became a flattened oval , perhaps half again the height of a man , and at least three times that dimension in width . Our party was joined by scores of other Aranians , who darted in from side passages ; some going ahead , some closing in behind us , until the tunnel was filled with the peculiar brittle sound of their walking . " They do n't lack for numbers , " muttered Correy softly . " Think they 'll make trouble , sir ? " " Your guess is as good as mine . I showed them what the ray would do ; I believe it threw a scare into the old chap . Did you tell them what we would do if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own life is endangered , is n't it ? " snapped the Zenian . " It certainly is , " I told him grimly . " And not only by the spiders , if you make any suspicious moves . " * * * * * We went on without further conversation , until we came to the beginning of the cubicles Tipene had mentioned . Each of these was closed , or could be closed , by a circular door such as those which concealed the outer entrance to the tunnels , save that these were swung on a side hinge . From the central passage we were following , smaller ones branched off in all directions : to the left , to the right ; upward and downward . And all were lined with the cubicles , from which a constantly increasing army of Aranians emerged to accompany us . We had gone but a short distance into the " city " when our ancient guide paused , turning to stare down a deserted passage . " He says , " grunted Tipene -- as near a grunt as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're down there . He asks that we go and get them ; he is afraid . They have killed two of the Aranians already with their atomic pistols . " " For which I do n't blame them in the least , " said Correy . " I 'd get as many as I could before I let them sink their mandibles into me . " " But I thought they were hostages , and being treated as such ? " " The Aranians got tired of waiting ; some of the younger ones tried to do their own executing , " explained Tipene . " The whole brood of them is in an ugly mood , the old fellow tells me . We were fools to come ! " I did n't argue the matter . You ca n't argue such a matter with a man like Tipene . Instead , I lifted my voice in a shout which echoed down the long corridors . " Brady ! Inverness ! Can you hear us ? " For a moment there was no reply , and then , as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened , and Inverness , his pistol drawn , peered out at us . A moment later , both he and Brady were running toward us . " Hanson ! " cried Inverness . " Man , but we 're glad to see a human face again -- but why did you come ? Now they 've got us all . " " But they 'll let us all go , " I said , with a confidence I did not feel . " I 've demonstrated to one of their leaders just what the Ertak can do -- and will do -- if we are n't aboard , safe and unhurt , in three hours . " " The young bloods do n't obey well , though , " said Brady , shaking his head . " Look at them , milling around there in the central passage ! They did n't see your demonstration , whatever it was . They started for us some time back , and we had to rip a couple of them to pieces , and barricade ourselves . " " Well , " said Correy grimly , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " * * * * * I turned to Tipene , who was staring at the packed mass of Aranians , who choked the tunnel in both directions . " Tell them to make way , " I commanded . " We 're leaving . " " I've -- I 've been in communication with him , " moaned Tipene . " And he has n't any power over these youngsters . They want blood . Blood ! They say the ship wo n't dare do anything so long as so many of us are here . " " It will , though , " I snapped . " Kincaide will obey my orders to the letter . It 'll be a wholesale slaughter , if we 're not there by the specified time . " " I know ! I know ! " groaned Tipene . " But I ca n't make them understand that . They ca n't appreciate the meaning of such discipline . " " I believe that , " put in Brady . " Their state of society is still low in the scale . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us than the whole group . " " It may not be so simple as they think . Mr. Correy , shall we make a dash for it ? " " I 'd be in favor of that , sir ! " he grinned . " Very well , you take three of the enlisted men , Mr. Correy , and give us a brisk rear-guard action when we get into the main passage -- if we do . Use the grenades if you have to , but throw them as fast as possible , or we 'll have the roof coming down on us . " The two ray operators and myself will try to open a way , backed up by Inverness and Brady . Understand , everybody ? " The men took the places I had indicated , nodding , and we stood at the mouth of the side tunnel , facing the main passage which intersected it at a right angle . The mouth of the passage was blocked by a crowded mass of the spider creatures , evidently eager to pounce on us , but afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came toward them , the Aranians packed about the entrance gave way grudgingly , all save two or three . Without an instant 's hesitation , I lifted my pistol and slashed them into jerking pulp . " Hold the ray , " I ordered the two men by my side , " until we need it . They 'll get a surprise when it goes into action . " * * * * * We needed it the moment we turned into the main corridor , for here the passage was broad , and in order to prevent the creatures from flanking us , we had to spread our front and rear guards until they were no more than two thin lines . Seeing their advantage , the Aranians rushed us . At a word from me , the ray operators went into action , and I did what I could with my comparatively ineffective pistol . Between us , we swept the passage clean as far as we could see -- which was not far , for the reddish dust of disintegration hung in the quiet air , and the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment I thought we would have clear sailing ; Correy and his men were doing fine work behind us , and our ray was sweeping everything before us . Then we came to the first of the intersecting passages , and a clattering horde of Aranians leaped out at us . The ray operators stopped them , but another passage on the opposite side was spewing out more than I could handle with my pistol . Two of the hairy creatures were fairly upon me before the ray swung to that side and dissolved them into dust . For an instant the party stopped , checked by these unexpected flank attacks . And there would be more of these sallies from the hundreds of passages which opened off the main corridor ; I had no doubt of that . And there the creatures had us : our deadly ray could not reach them out ahead ; we must wait until we were abreast , and then the single ray could work upon but one side . Correy needed every man he had to protect our rear , and my pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That fact had just been proved to me with unpleasant emphasis . It was rank folly to press on ; the party would be annihilated . " Down this passage , men , " I ordered the two ray operators . " We 'll have to think up a better plan . " They turned off into the passage they had swept clean with their ray , and the rest of the party followed swiftly . A few yards from the main corridor the passage turned and ran parallel to the corridor we had just left . Doors opened off this passage on both sides , but all the doors were open , and the cubicles thus revealed were empty . * * * * * " Well , sir , " said Correy , when we had come to the dead end of the passage , " now what ? " " I do n't know , " I confessed . " If we had two ray machines , we could make it . But if I remember correctly , it 's seven hundred yards , yet , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means several hundred side passages from which they can attack . We ca n't make it . " " Well , we can try again , anyway , sir , " Correy replied stoutly . " Better to go down fighting than stay here and starve , eh ? " " If you 'll pardon me , gentlemen , " put in Inverness , " I 'd like to make a suggestion . We ca n't return the way we came in ; I 'm convinced of that . It was the sheerest luck that Commander Hanson was n't brought down a moment ago -- luck , and excellent work on the part of the two ray operators . " But an analysis of our problem shows that our real objective is to reach the surface , and that need not be done the most obvious way , by returning over the course by which we entered . " " How , then ? " I asked sharply . " The disintegrator ray you have there should be able to cut a passage for us , " said Inverness . " Then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working . Once on the surface , we 'll be able to fight our way to the ship , will we not ? " " Of course ! You should be in command , Inverness , instead of myself . " His was the obvious solution to our difficulty ; once proposed , I felt amazingly stupid that the thought had not occurred to me . I gave the necessary orders to the ray men , and they started immediately , boring in steadily at an angle of about forty-five degrees . The reddish dust came back to us in choking clouds , and the Aranians , perhaps guessing what we were doing -- at least one of their number had seen how the ray could tunnel in the ground -- started working around the angle of the passage . * * * * * At first they came in small groups , and our pistols readily disposed of them , but as the dust filled the air , and it became increasingly difficult to see their spidery bodies , they rushed us in great masses . Correy and I , shoulder to shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud of dust . A score of times the rushes of the Aranians brought a few of them scuttling almost to our feet ; inside of a few minutes the passage was choked , waist high , with the riddled bodies -- and still they came ! " We 're through , sir ! " shouted one of the ray operators . " If you can hold them off another fifteen minutes , we 'll have the hole large enough to crawl through . " " Work fast ! " I ordered . Even with Inverness , Brady , and the three of the Ertak 's crew doing what they could in those narrow quarters , we were having a hard time holding back the horde of angry , desperate Aranians . Tipene was useless ; he was cowering beside the ray operators , chattering at them , urging them to hurry . Had we had good light , our task would have been easy , but the passage was choked now with dust . Our ethon lamps made little more than a dismal glow . The clattering Aranians were almost within leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one was stopped in mid-air by a spray from one pistol or another . " Ready , sir , " gasped the ray man who had spoken before . " I think we 've got it large enough , now . " " Good ! " I brought down two scuttling Aranians , so close that their twitching legs fell in an untidy heap almost at my feet . " You go first , and protect our advance . Then the rest of you ; Mr. Correy and I will bring up the --  " " No ! " screamed Tipene , shouldering aside the ray men . " I .... " He disappeared into the slanting shaft , and the two ray men followed quickly . The three members of the crew went next ; then Brady and Inverness . Correy and I backed toward the freshly cut passage . " I 'll be right behind you , " I snapped , " so keep moving ! " * * * * * Correy hesitated an instant ; I knew he would have preferred the place of danger as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest when time was so precious . He climbed into the slanting passage the ray had cut for us , and as he did so , I heard , or thought I heard , a cry from beyond him , from one of those ahead . I gave Correy several seconds before I followed ; when I did start , I planned on coming fast , for in that shoulder-tight tube I would be utterly at the mercy of any who might attack from behind . Fairly spraying the oncoming horde , I drove them back , for a moment , beyond the angle in the corridor ; then I fairly dived into the tunnel and crawled as fast as hands and knees could take me toward the blessed open air . I heard the things clatter into the space I had deserted . I heard them scratching frantically in the tunnel behind me , evidently handicapped by their long legs , which must have been drawn up very close to their bodies . Light came pouring in on me suddenly , and I realized that Correy had won free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold sweat broke out on me . How close a terrible death might be , I had no means of knowing -- but it was very close . My head emerged ; I drew my body swiftly out of the hole and snatched a grenade from my belt . Instantly I flung it down the slanting passage , with a shout of warning to my companions . With a muffled roar , the grenade shook the earth ; sent a brown cloud spattering around us . I had made a desperate leap to get away , but even then I was covered by the shower of earth . I looked around . Trapdoors were open everywhere , and from hundreds of these openings , Aranians were scuttling toward us . But the ray operators were working ; not only the little portable machine , but the big projectors on the Ertak , five or six hundred yards away ; laying down a deadly and impassable barrage on either side of us. * * * * * " They got Tipene , sir ! " said Correy . " He dodged out ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . They were dragging him away , tearing him . The ray men wiped them out . Tipene was already dead -- torn to fragments , they said . Back to the ship now , sir ? " " Back to the ship , " I nodded , still rather breathless . " Let the ray men cover our retreat ; we can take care of those between us and the ship with our pistols -- and the Ertak 's projectors will attend to our flanks . On the double , men ! " We fought every step of the way , in a fog of reddish dust from the big disintegrator rays playing on either side of us -- but we made it , a torn , weary , and bedraggled crew . " Quite an engagement , sir , " gasped Correy , when we were safely inside the Ertak . " Think they 'll remember this little visit of ours , sir ? " " I know we 'll remember it , anyway , " I said , shaking some of the dust of disintegration from my clothes . " Just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol . " " Sure , sir , " grinned Correy . " So would I -- until we were a day or two out from Base ! " * * * * *
