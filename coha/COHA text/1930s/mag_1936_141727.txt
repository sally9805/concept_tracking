Last week in Puerto Rico eligible voters had to be at their polling places by high noon . Precisely at that hour doors were closed against late comers and voting began . As their votes were recorded , voters were allowed to slip out quietly one by one . When the last Puerto Rican left his polling place the election was all over but the counting . When the counting was all over it was revealed that white-thatched old Santiago Iglesias , the Samuel Gompers of his island , had been re-elected Puerto Rico 's Resident Commissioner in Washington over Dr. Jos Lopez Antongiorgi , onetime Manhattan physician whose Liberal Party wants independence from the U. S. When Commissioner Iglesias , who miraculously escaped with a bullet-furrowed right arm when an assassin fired five shots at him last fortnight ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) , was notified of the result , he was the first to praise Puerto Rico 's new cheatproof election system , inspired by Maryland 's Senator Tydings.                 @ @ @ @
