txt Bethpage State Park . It seems to me that the money spent for the purchase of Bethpage State Park on Long Island could have been used to better advantage . The park has all the earmarks of a private institution . The greens fee for golf on Saturdays , Sundays and holidays is $2 . That is the fee charged by any number of private courses throughout Long Island . I realize that the fee goes toward maintenance , interest and amortization of the purchase price of the park . But if such prices had to be charged , why was the park purchased in the first place ? I am sure the people who really need a park like this are those who can afford only a dollar greens fee . Incidentally , a golf season ticket costs $65 . Quite a sum ! MILTON COHEN . New York , May 28 , 1935.
