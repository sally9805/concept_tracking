Again &; again the past three weeks a twin-motored Boeing 247-D transport took off from Oakland airport , circled lazily in the California sun , came in swiftly to a perfect landing . Each time the pilot , who could see nothing outside because canvas covered the windows , ignored wheel and rudder bar completely , merely twiddled a few knobs on the dashboard . Last week , with this technique producing 24 perfect landings out of every 25 at empts , United Airlines announced it had finally devised a practicable method of landing " blind . " <P> Flying blind is nothing new . All trans port pilots do it as a matter of course , letting a robot pilot keep the plane on the flying beam radioed from each major airport . Landing blind is another matter . First done in 1929 by Major James Harold Doolittle while a safety man watched from an open cockpit , it was not successfully executed solo until 1932 when Captain Albert F. Hegenberger managed it at Dayton . Since then , though many a method has been tried for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes to take-off &; land when fog shuts down . <P> United 's system embodies no new principle , is merely a new combination of two well-known mechanisms - the robot pilot and the landing beam system designed in 1933 by the Bureau of Air Commerce . As the plane approaches the airport , it leaves the flying beam and picks up two new beams by means of a special cross-shaped antenna on the plane 's nose . One of these is a vertical directional beam about five feet wide at the airport . The other is a lateral , curved landing beam which slants down onto the field from one side , almost vertical ten miles out , 60 feet above ground at field edge , 15 feet above at field-centre . When the pilot has put his plane squarely on the junction of these two beams , he turns the control over to the robot which brings the plane down the invisible slope to a landing . All the human pilot does is to handle the throttle , watch the instruments , apply the brakes when the wheels touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
