In 1934 rubbermen created the International Rubber Regulation Committee- a cartel that represents 98% of the world 's rubber producers . The I. R. R. C. 's aims are two:1 ) to establish and maintain a base limit to rubber planting , 2 ) to fix quarterly quotas on the amount of this rubber that is marketable . <P> Last spring , with rubber bounding over the 25-per-lb. level for the first time since 1929 , the I. R. R. C. met in London , upped the rubber quota for the second half of 1937 to 90% of the base ( TIME . March 29 , 1937 ) . Almost immediately afterward came the collapse of the British commodity boom , and rubber consumption presently slumped about 25% . In the U. S. , world 's biggest rubber buyer , rubber consumption dropped as much as 8,000 tons per month and the price to 14 a lb . Last December , therefore , the I. R. R. C. again met in London , cut the rubber quota for the first quarter of 1938 to 70% of the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Commodity Exchange , cheapest price in three years . Yet to appear was any sign of industrial revival sufficient to bounce rubber up again . But the I. R. R. C. 's 1934 agreement on planting bases expires this year . So the I. R. R. C. again met in London last week , this time to establish not only the export quota for the next three months , but a new planting limit . Recognizing the present slump , I. R. R. C. set the quarterly quota at 60% . Optimistic for the long pull , however , I. R. R. C. upped its bases along a graduated line . The 1934 base was 996,500 tons . Last week the I. R. R. C. proposed bases of 1,519,000 for 1939 , 1,541,000 for 1940 , 1,554,000 for 1941 , 1,563,000 for 1942 , 1,569,000 for 1943.
