Firmest rule of network broadcasting is " no recordings . " Reasons given : 1 ) when NBC set the style 13 years ago , recordings ( " platters " ) were pretty scratchy ; 2 ) the radio audience likes programs better fresh than canned . Many a recording man retorts that if recorded Jack Bennys , Charlie McCarthys and other big-name shows were centrally recorded and delivered to individual broadcasters for local transmission , they could have higher fidelity to the original than can be attained over the present wire hookups . <P> Just who would profit by such a system , except for recording companies and some finely trained audience ears , is still problematical , but sure losers would be : 1 ) networks which would have little reason for existing ; and 2 ) American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , which collects some $6,000,000 annually from the networks for the use of 202,000 miles of wire hookups . <P> NBC might be able to afford the change , because its parent Radio Corporation of America owns the biggest recording outfit in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one network recording ( the Hindenburg disaster ) . Last week , however , NBC stepped bravely out . Henceforth Canada Dry 's Information Please , staged in Manhattan 's Radio City on Tuesdays between 8:30 and 9 p. m . Eastern Daylight Time , will be recorded by Los Angeles ' KECA instead of being immediately broadcast when it reaches the West coast at 4:30 Pacific Standard Time . The recording will then be transmitted over a " platter " network of seven NBC-Blue Coast stations at 8:30 p. m. , Pacific Time , when most of the potential West Coast Canada Dry mixers have come home from golf or toil . <P> Information Please won this special dispensation because : 1 ) it is a scriptless , impromptu quiz show , hence can not be rebroadcast later , like more predictable shows ; 2 ) it is the star item on the Blue network , long considered a weak sister to NBC 's Red network and lately the subject of the briskest build-up campaign in NBC 's history . But to the suggestion that other big eastern shows now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC 's retort was : " Would you rather kiss a girl or her picture ? " <P> Experimenting on its own hook last week , KECA inaugurated a program called Encore Theatre , presenting the same show three times running each week to accommodate first-night absentees and those who might like to hear a program a second or third time .
