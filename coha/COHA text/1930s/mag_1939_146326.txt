When San Francisco 's Golden Gate International Exposition opened last February , it figured to break even if it could lock 24,000,000 admissions in a ten month run . Last week after nearly four months , it had clocked 3,600,000 . Although summer , with its crowds , is coming , the Exposition , which has averaged 32,000 visitors a day in the past , would have to almost quadruple daily attendance to hit 24,000,000-which is too much even for California optimism . Mired in debts , the Exposition even acknowledged last week to owing the city of San Francisco four months ' back rent - $4 , or $1 a month . <P> The New York World 's Fair ( attendance in six weeks : 7,419,283 ) is not only three times as large , but three times as lively , as the Golden Gate Exposition . By day the Exposition is more impressive looking . But with its many individual buildings for industrial firms ( a number of which have brilliant exhibits ) the Fair has strangled Broadway show business and night life , * while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco-smash hit as the Ice Follies of 1939 . The Fair 's Midway is mediocre but alive ; the Exposition 's Gayway exploits sex ( without glamor ) to the smutmost ; and its chief theatrical offering , Jake Shubert 's Ziegfeld Follies of 1939 , is a flop . <P> But since the Exposition was already playing to small audiences before the Fair opened , it is doubtful that transcontinental competition has hurt San Francisco 's show so much as lack of showmanship . To cure that defect the Exposition last week took a promising new managing director to succeed the dethroned Harris Connick ( TIME , May 15 ) . Smart , baldish New Director Dr. Charles Henry Strub , onetime ball player and chain dentist , present-day Santa Anita race-track operator , is all for brisker ballyhoo and livelier amusements . He may yet make Treasure Island a bigger attraction . Most notable of its present sights : <P> &gt; Almost roof-high and room-long in the Mines , Metals and Machinery Building stretches Treasure Mountain , showing open-pit mine operations aboveground , gold and copper mining along 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel 's diorama of a steel-built San Francisco of 1999 ; a 555-lb. piano hanging from a thin steel thread . <P> &gt; In the Electricity and Communication Building : lucky-number long-distance calls overheard by 125 listeners-in ( as at the New York World 's Fair ) . <P> &gt; Headliner in the Hall of Science is the University of California 's dramatic display of academic achievement . Most fascinating to visiting couples is the U. of C. 's not-too-scientific attempt to show them , by means of dolls , what their children will look like . Couples press buttons underneath the two dolls who most resemble them ; machinery whirrs and out pops a puppet combining the physical characteristics of the parent dolls . <P> &gt; In the Foods and Beverages Building visitors can 1 ) inspect a 1,000 Ib . Exposition Cake ; 2 ) see National Biscuit Co. ' s Mickey Mouse in color-the only commercial film Walt Disney has made ; 3 ) watch Hills Bros. ' color film on the making of coffee and , whenever a cup of it is flashed on the screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
