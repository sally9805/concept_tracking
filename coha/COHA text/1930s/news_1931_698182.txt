A $750,000,000 naval construction program will be placed before Congress for action in December . Chairman Hale of the last Senate Naval Committee and Chairman Britten of the last House Naval Committee have agreed to sponsor a bill calling for the construction allowed under the London naval treaty . Representative Britten said that he and Senator Hale were agreed on the American Legion 's resolution favoring construction under the terms of the London treaty which expires in 1936 . As Congress is charged by the Constitution with providing adequate defense , the Illinois member said , they had decided to call the Naval General Board members and other high naval officials for questioning as to the needs of the navy . On this expert testimony will depend largely the progress of the proposed legislation , he added . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the London treaty . It would call for the building up of the remaining tonnage in aircraft carriers , construction of 73,000 tons in small gun cruisers , with or without flying decks , depending upon the needs of the navy , and the replacement of a destroyer tonnage of 150 , - 000 , which becomes obsolescent within two years . Navy Far Under Treaty Quota . Under the disarmament treaty , the United States Is allowed 135,000 tons in aircraft carriers . The navy has one of - 3,800 tons under construction , and plans to dispose of the 11 , - 500-ton experimental carrier Langley . With the Saratoga and Lexington , each of 33,000 tons , four of about 14,000 tons can be constructed at a cost of $25,000,000 each . Under the London treaty , the United States is allowed 143,500 tons in light cruisers carrying six-inch guns . It has ten such craft totaling 70,500 tons , leaving 73,000 tons to be constructed . The proposed measure is to provide that if the new warships are to have flying decks , seven of 10,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each may be constructed . The cost of these vessels , depending upon the type , was estimated between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 each . While the allotment in destroyer tonnage is 150,000 , all but 77,000 becomes over the age limit next year , the year after all but 17,000 tons , and in three years all will be obsolescent . It was estimated that 100 destroyers of 1,500 tons each would be required to replace this tonnage . . It costs about $4,500,000 to construct a ship of this type . Both Senator Hale and Representative Britten have voiced opposition to the Chief Executive 's move to curtail construction .
