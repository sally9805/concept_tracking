Angelo Michieli left his native Italian village , sailed to the U. S. to make a new home . His wife and infant son he had to leave behind until he had their passage money saved . <P> He did it-by three years of working in kitchens , fierce economy , single-minded loyalty . Last week Angelo met the liner Rex , joyfully took into his arms brown-eyed Amelia and their four-year-old bambino , Bruno . <P> The home was ready , three neat rooms on Manhattan 's East Side . Most magnificent of all its furnishings was the gas range . Dazzled Amelia had never even seen one . Angelo proudly showed her how it worked , went off to his job . <P> At midnight came the end of Angelo 's day . He hurried home , shouted for Amelia at the door . No answer . He pushed inside , was met by blackness and the overpowering smell of gas . <P> The coffee pot had boiled over on the new stove , extinguished the flame . Little Bruno lay on the floor , Amelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two for a fruitless hour before they finally gave up . Angelo 's three years had become a life sentence .
