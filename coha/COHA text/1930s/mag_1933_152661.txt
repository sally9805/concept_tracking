( See front cover ) <P> Ornate but dusty chandeliers . Blue walls between stained white Ionic columns . A plaster frieze of dancing nymphs like a Wedgwood plaque . That is October Hall in the House of the Labor Unions in Moscow , and before the Revolution the gay dining room of the Nobles ' Club . The world 's eyes were on October Hall last week when six British engineers-together with twelve Russian defendants , in which neither Soviet nor world Press took much interest-went on trial for their lives charged with espionage and sabotage ( TIME , March 27 et seq . ) . If these men were found innocent millions of Russians might think the Soviet was afraid to mete out the same justice to the subjects of Imperial Britain as it does to its own Comrades . If they were found guilty , King George V had just put his signature to a bill empowering his Government to declare a complete embargo of Russian goods and cut off from Russia some $130,000,000 a year of her best customer 's trade . Every diplomat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blue &; white room and gazed eagerly at the tables covered with red cloth where sat three sack-suited judges . <P> No stranger to Soviet propaganda trials was the prosecutor . Stocky Andrey Y. Vyshinsky , decorated like a prize Percheron with the ribboned rosette of the Order of the Red Flag , served as presiding judge at another Soviet circus , the famed Shakhta Trial of five years ago ( TIME , July 2 , 1928 et seq . ) . But the presiding judge last week was not at all what foreign correspondents expected . Judge Vassily Ulrich , a chubby , baldish , moon-faced little fellow , was amiable , quite as eager to exchange quips with witnesses as any periwigged British magistrate . <P> One by one the Russian defendants were called to the stand . A long list of charges was rattled off by a clerk . When Prosecutor Vyshinsky put the question , " Do you admit these charges ? " each bowed his head and answered , " Priznayu " ( " I do ' ' ) . <P> " William MacDonald ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandyke beard and a twisted hip hobbled forward to the witness stand . Again the clerk 's voice droned on-carrying on military espionage under orders from his colleague , W. H. Thornton . . . . Helping wreck a power plant at the Zlatoust munitions factory . . . . Bribing Soviet citizens . ... At the end came the question , " Do you admit these charges ? " <P> In a voice that hardly reached the judges ' table William MacDonald answered : <P> " Priznayu . " <P> " Specific Statement " Britain was thunderstruck . In the House of Commons up popped Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon , his voice sharp with excitement : <P> " In view of the nature of the charges made against six British subjects at the trial in Moscow , I desire to make a specific statement . <P> " None of these men ever has been employed directly or indirectly in any connection with any branch of our intelligence service . None of them ever has supplied any information to any such branch . None of them ever has been paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these statements are equally true of the Metropolitan-Vickers Co. it-elf.
