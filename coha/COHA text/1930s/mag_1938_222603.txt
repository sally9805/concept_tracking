" Resolved , that the President is hereby requested to advise the House of Representatives , if not incompatible with the public interest- " 1 ) Whether any nation or nations during the last few years have violated any treaties to which they and the United States are signatories ; <P> " 2 ) If so , what nation or nations , when , and in what manner . . . . " <P> This imposing little questionnaire , introduced in the House last week by California 's liberal young Byron Nicholson Scott , provided Washington with a brief but lurid display of political fireworks against the cloudy sky of international relations . <P> Routine procedure in the case of Congressional resolutions concerning specific departments is to forward them promptly to the department concerned for comment before they are reported out of committee . Only relevant comment on the Scott Resolution the State Department could make would be to name Italy , Germany and Japan as treaty breakers-which cautious Secretary Cordell Hull , who was last week golfing at Pinehurst , N.

First guess was , therefore , that Franklin Roosevelt had inspired or at least approved his action as a means of justifying a new blast at totalitarian foreign policies in general . <P> First guess was at least partly wrong . The Scott Resolution did not force the State Department to lay down its face cards-which it may , nonetheless , do in the near future . On the other hand , something entirely different prompted Franklin Roosevelt to , who last summer met and greatly admired England 's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain . Last week , according to the most reliable reports , Mr. Chamberlain strongly urged his new friend , in the absence of canny Secretary Hull , to persuade Mr. Roosevelt to issue a statement approving the Anglo-Italian pact . In any case Mr. Roosevelt , who last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " felt obliged to tell a press conference : 1 ) that he had neither approved nor disapproved the Scott Resolution , and 2 ) that the U. S. " approved " the Anglo-Italian agreement as a " proof of the value of peaceful negotiations . "
