Back from Berlin last month on the world 's fastest liner , R. M. S. Queen Mary , came the world 's fastest blackamoor , Jesse Owens , with four Olympic crowns in his valise . With very little money in his pocket , Sprinter Owens made no secret of the fact that he was returning to the U. S. to cash in on his athletic reputation for all it was worth . Bug-eyed Radioclown Eddie Cantor , whose recent offer of a college scholarship ended in an unfortunate cribbing fiasco ( TIME , April 20 ) , was said to be offering Owens $4,000 a week just to take him on a personal tour . A Manhattan theatre was said to be clamoring for the dusky speedster 's services at $10,000 a week . Hotfoot to a radio telephone trotted Bill ( " Bojangles " ) Robinson . " Do n't do anything till you see me ! " implored the world 's greatest tapdancer . When the Queen Mary docked , " Bojangles " took Jesse up to Harlem , lined up a bevy of Lenox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs and hoped that he and Owens would soon have an act together . <P> Up to last week nobody had actually exploited a cent 's worth of publicity out of the season 's most publicized black man . when all of a sudden the valuable name of Owens appeared on a testimonial for the Republican Party . <P> In Manhattan , Jesse Owens announced that he was ready to stump for Alf M. Landon , was quoted as saying : " This country was built on the sweat and blood of the Negro race and this fact has n't yet been recognized . I believe Governor Landon will recognize it . . . . His election will be good for America and for the people of the colored race . . . . I want to meet Governor Landon personally . " Shocked at Owens ' ingratitude were Democrats . At Ohio State , Jesse Owens has been drawing $3 per day since February 1935 as a non-working page in the Democratic Legislature of that currently Democratic State . <P> Shocked at Owens ' lack of commercial acumen was Marty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle all his business and personal affairs . Snapped he : " Owens made his political statement without my permission . I did not know he was going to Republican Headquarters or I would have stopped him .
