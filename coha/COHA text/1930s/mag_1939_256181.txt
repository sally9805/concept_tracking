The League of Nations last week arrived in a unique situation . In quick succession Hungary and Albania resigned . The two countries acted not because of their own desires , but to suit the Axis powers . Last week Peru also resigned following the lead in recent years of Brazil , Chile , Costa Rica , Guatemala , Honduras , Nicaragua , Paraguay , El Salvador , Venezuela . <P> Also missing from the League are of course , the U. S. which never joined , Japan which withdrew in 1933 over the China " incident " ; Germany , which dropped out the same year over the question of rearmament ; Italy , which resigned in 1937 over Ethiopia and sanctions ; Austria , which was anschlussed ; Czecho-Slovakia which was Muniched . <P> Actually left in the League are none but France and Britain ( and some of their proteges ) , Russia and small fry nations : the Scandinavian countries , 13 minor European countries , ten Latin American countries , Liberia , Turkey , the unconquered tag-end of China , the defunct Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as represented by Haile Selassie ) . This League of leftovers represents only one of Europe 's two clattering armed camps , and no altercation was ever settled by having only one side sit down and talk things over . <P> Last week Switzerland told the League it would no longer be a welcome guest in case of war . So the League sat down and talked over how to evacuate Geneva and where to go-probably to France . <P> Last week the Middle Atlantic " Model Assembly of the League of Nations , " an annual assembly of U. S. college students , met at Bucknell University and was embarrassed . Delegate Jerome I. Aron of France ( i.e. , Haverford College ) summed the situation up in impeccable French , translated by an interpreter with a strong French accent : " Ze League eez an illusion .
