In Delaware , little mother of big corporations , a prime property right received new sanction last week-but not precisely to the liking of the corporation involved-which was Wilson &; Co . Last year this big Chicago packing house put through a recapitalization plan providing , among other things , for the payment of $12,600,000 in dividend arrears , not in cash but in stock . The payment was accepted as a satisfactory settlement by the owners of 99% of the shares affected . Among the holdouts was a Wall Streeter named Joseph Keller , who figured that if back dividends were to be paid at all he was entitled to hard cash , $21.25 on each of his 500 Class A shares . Hiring a smart Manhattan lawyer named Abraham L. Pomerantz , he filed suit in Delaware , where Wilson &; Co. was incorporated , seeking full cash payment of back dividends for all holdout stock . <P> In the lower courts stockholder Keller lost , the ruling being that a vote of the majority of the stock was binding on the minority . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opinion , holding that Stockholder Keller and his fellow holdouts were indeed entitled to cash . Said the high court of Delaware : " Property rights may not be destroyed . " <P> The court 's point was that the privileges of the preferred stockholder , plainly set forth in the certificate of incorporation , were acquired when stock was purchased and constitute a vested property right . To deprive a stockholder of that right-by majority vote in the Wilson case-was an infringement of the due-process clauses of State and Federal Constitutions . <P> The Delaware decision did not , of course , affect Wilson stockholders who had already assented to the plan . But it did affect all Delaware corporations organized before 1927 , may affect corporations chartered under the present law . On the ground that the high court of Delaware was laboring " under a misapprehension , " Wilson &; Co. filed for a rehearing . <P> After the decision last week . Federal Water Service Corp . and Consolidated Retail Stores Inc. both withdrew stock-for- back-dividends plans , and National Supply Co. held up its plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
