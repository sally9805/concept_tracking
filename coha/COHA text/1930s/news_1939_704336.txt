It was reported that 283 men ha . d lost their lives in the . Rawalpindi . The captain of the Pilsudski , who was the last to leave his ship , died after diving from the bridge into the frigid sea . In addition to these casualties , it was announced tonight that the 926-ton London steamer Hookwood had been sunk off the northeast coast of England Thursday after striking a mine and that the 6,376-ton Swedish vessel Gustaf E. Reuter had been seriously damaged by an explosion off North Scotland . Two members of the Hookwood 's crew are missing . There was no report on the fate of the crew of the Gustaf E. Reuter . In the eight days since the start of the German mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss since April , 1917 , when in that single month 430 Allied and neutral ships went to the bottom . Pilsudski British Troopship There was no indication where the Pilsudski was going or what she was doing when she was shaken by two terrific blasts . It is known that she was chartered by the British Government as a troopship but apparently only her Polish crew and fourteen British stewards and cooks were aboard at the time of the explosion . When the sleek flagship of the Polish merchant marine was off Northeast England , she was torpedoed or mined and immediately she developed a dangerous list to starboard .. Two minutes later another explosion shook her from stem to stern and she immediately began to go down . ' A British destroyer and a British trawler answered the S 0 S quickly . Meanwhile Captain Mamert Stankiewicz ordered the boats manned . The survivors , who arrived at northeast ports tonight , said the crew moved to their boat stations in a most orderly fashion and waited there while the captain gave instructions to enter the boats and lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and pushed away , the survivors said , did Captain Stankiewicz make a move to leave . By that time the ship was foundering fast and only at the final moment did he dive into the sea . Radwan Frenk , 19 years old , told how he dived into the sea and helped the captain to a raft . " I held him afloat with one arm , " the youth said , " until we reached the raft . We were on the raft , drifting about in the darkness for more than an hour , before the destroyer spotted us but the ordeal had been too much for the skipper . " Another member of the crew said the captain had been injured by one of the blasts . Ten Are Believed Dead The destroyer picked up 103 survivors and landed them at a northeast port and the trawler landed sixty-eight at another . It is believed seven of the crew are not accounted for and that two others in addition to the captain died . Many more were badly injured by the two explosions . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is feared others might have been trapped below decks . Some who were lying iri bed at the time of the explosion were injured when the upper berths fell on them . The Pilsudski had been unlucky ever since she was launched in an Italian shipyard in 1935 . Proudly displaying a huge portrait of Marshal Josef Pilsudski , the founder of modern Poland , at top of the main staircase , she sailed for New York on her maiden voyage right after all the excitement over the maiden voyages of the Queen Mary and Normandie . Consequently , except for the Polish community in New York , she received little attention . She was sailing for Gdynia , Poland , when the war broke out . British destroyers rushed out on the Atlantic , met her and brought her safely into a British port . When the survivors of the Pilsudski reached port the entire National Service Corps of that northeast coast town met them . Some were still in pajamas , wrapped in blankets . They were housed temporarily in church halls and police headquarters . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate except that she normally carries around 300 in the crew and that only seventeen are known to have survived . It was not stated where she was attacked or by whom or in what manner , though it is rumored here she was shelled . The Rawalpindi was formerly a Peninsular and Oriental liner , plying between London and Yokohama . At the start of the war she was requisitioned by the Admiralty . She was brought into drydock , her furnishings removes and guns emplaced . When she sailed again she was painted gray , naval officers were in command , she was offensively armed and she flew the naval ensign . It was a day of tragedy all around for this warring island kingdom . At Southport a pilot cutter went aground . She was out on a secret mission when she was wrecked , and though she was so gear land that four of the crew swam ashore , twenty-two were drowned . It also was announced that thirteen other men were feared lost . They were members of the crew of the trawler William Humphries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shelled , however , they took to the boats . Nothing has been heard of them since . Though the British have increased their minesweeping force there is still evidence that shipping is still upset by the German mine campaign . There has been no ship mail from the United States since before Armistice Day . It was announced tonight that the Ostend-Dover Channel service would be suspended tomorrow . There still is no sign of the Holland-America liner Statendam , though she was due Nov. 18 en route to New York . Passengers have been jumping on and off tenders at Southampton ever since Nov.18 , but every time they get on , expecting the ship to arrive , they are told to debark again and wait in their hotels . Many Pilsudski Men Hurt LONDON , Nov. 26 ( UP ) ? The two explosions that sank the Pilsudski were so terrific that many members of the crew in bunks below decks were blown into the sea . Many of the survivors limped ashore with bandaged feet . Others had bandaged heads and some were without shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were brought ashore in little else but blankets . The chief steward of the liner , who had turned in shortly before the blast , was into the water in his pajamas and was dragged into a lifeboat by the chief officer . He had been blown from another ship less than a month ago in the war at sea . The Britons aboard the Pilsudski were en route to join another vessel . Most of the injured suffered from cuts caused by broken glass . The most fortunate man of the ship 's company was the Chief Cook Kawko , who was asleep and was tossed from his bunk by the second explosion . " I managed to get on deck and found the boats had got away , " he said . " Apparently I was alone on the sinking ship . But as the Pilsudski started to go down I found one of our boats still at the davits and jumped into it . As it touched the water I slashed the rope with a knife and the boat drifted away . " I was alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . I drifted for five hours , and then a fishing boat picked me up . " The Pilsudski 's 300-pound Chief Engineer Opacki was blown from the engine room to a deck above in a fog of steam from broken pipes . He was black with oil . He slid down a rope into a lifeboat . Trawler Is Torpedoed LONDON , Nov. 26 ( UP ) ? An unidentified French trawler out of La Rochelle was torpedoed and sunk without warning in the Atlantic . The crew was rescued by Spanish fishermen . A Belgian fishing boat landed at Blankenderghe five survivors of an unidentified collier sunk in the Channel by a mine . Five of the collier 's crew drowned . In Tokyo the Japanese N. Y. K. Line , which last week lost its luxury liner Terukuni Manz by a mine explosion off the English coast , announced that it was canceling sailings to London and making Liverpool its English port of call . Germany Lists Sinkings BERLIN , Nov. 26 ( UP ) ? The German radio claimed today that two more British merchant ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sunk by German mines . The ships were the steamers Bordfield and Dryburgh . Lloyd 's Register lists the Dryburgh at 1,289 tons , registered at Leith , Scotland , and owned by G. Gibson &; Co. , Ltd. , but has no listing for the Bordfield . The radio claim said the Bordfield sailed from Leith with the Dryburgh Nov. 12 en route to Antwerp . The Bordfield struck a mine and sank a half hour out of Leith , the radio report said , and the Dryburgh struck another mine one hour later and had to be beached by two British destroyers near North Berwick . The radio charged that the British were keeping secret most of their shipping losses in the war and that the actual toll in ships was " much higher " than has been admitted by the Admiralty .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , were reported saved . The German news agency reports that the Adolph Woermann was watched by armed British merchantmen who called the British cruiser by wireless .

The Adolph Woermann was named after the founder of Germany 's oldest shipping line , the Woermann Line , serving South Africa and South America . The report that she was a German raider was described here as " another example of British hypocrisy . " LINER BUILT FOR S.
