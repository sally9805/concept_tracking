If a schoolteacher told an unruly pupil that as long as his conduct did not disturb the rest of the class she would not disturb him , the pupil might not feel complimented but he would certainly feel reassured . Last week U. S. stock-traders felt guilty about high security prices , wondered if the current Bull Market foreshadowed inflation , menaced the nation 's future . To them Marriner Stoddard Eccles , Governor of the Federal Reserve Board , replied from Washington . <P> " How is it possible to have inflation when men are idle and plants are idle ? There can be speculative excesses when surplus funds bid up stocks or real estate , but inflation in the generally accepted sense can come about only by increasing means of payment . . . faster than we can increase production . The volume and velocity of money must be related to the volume of actual and potential production of real wealth . <P> " What is meant by talk of dangerous inflation is not inflation . . . but a stock market inflation . " Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual production of wealth , sniffed at apprehension over " speculative excesses . " <P> True , such excesses might become dangerous if they absorbed too large a portion of the nation 's credit and restricted funds available for more basic enterprises . But , said Governor Eccles , " the rise in security prices has not been financed by bank credit . The securities are being bought mostly for cash . . . . Money going into the stock market is not . . . retarding recovery . " To prove his point , he cited the fact that although stock prices have risen 48% since mid-March , the Federal Reserve System 's loans on securities ( including loans to brokers ) have declined during the same period . <P> The Governor concluded : " The System has no authority whatsoever to curb buying of securities . . . . Its only authority in this matter is over margin requirements , which apply only when transactions are on credit . . . . There is no speculative use of bank credit in the present situation . " <P> Thereupon stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whooped gladly and put on a brisk weekend rally . Headlined the New York Times : WASHINGTON WILL NOT APPLY BRAKES TO BOOM IN STOCKS ; ECCLES CALLS IT HEALTHFUL . Said one smart broker , reading Governor Eccles ' statement : " Best market letter in years ! " Traders drew only one moral : the Administration 's " breathing spell " for business is to be followed by a breathing spell for the Stock Exchange .
