txt It is not surprising that the British example of converting high interest-paying bonds to lower interest-paying bonds , has been followed in France . Certainly far too much was being paid on these domestic loans , and since less can be obtained elsewhere on anything which offers the same safety in investment as what the British call " gilt-edged securities " and the French " placements de pores de famine , " It was inevitable that the state would , sooner or later , undertake a huge conversion . Nor was there any real opposition , though it was telt that it was somewhat unfair to place the burden of the general financial reform which Is necessary on the backs of the rentiers , or holders of government securities . It is acknowledged ' that great budgetary retrenchments must be effected , for the state has become too extravagant . Economists argue that the Government should have begun by the readjustment of- ex- ' penditure and of taxation , and have finished with the readjustment of interest on money loaned to it . Instead , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to proceed to a thorough overhauling of all the state finances . A A A It is easy to arouse sentiment against the rentier  --  to represent him as living like a parasite on the state . But his position is perfectly respectable . The French are thrifty people , and hard-working people , and when they were appealed to they brought to the state the money they had honestly earned because specific inducements were offered . It should nevertheless be made clear that there is no question of bad faith on the part of the state . From the beginning it was understood that the state could pay off its debts , and it is now prepared to do so . There was no forced conversion . There was simply , as it were , a ; calling in of the old bonds , and an issuing of new bonds at lower Interest . The choice was definitely given : those who wished to be repaid could be repaid ; and those who accepted the new conditions did ' so freely . In France ' the rentes are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither , on the bonds nor in ' the book of the public ' debt . All that is set down is the amount to which the holder is annually entitled . There is here a fine point of law as to whether it ' is not arbitrary to change that figure : but it is a point of law that was decided long ago in favor of the state . -j Again , it is argued that the realer has already , as a result of the fall of the franc and Its stabilization at a fifth of its former value , lost 80 per cent of his holding . Is it just to ask him to forgo 25 per cent of what remains ? The answer is that in the majority of cases this statement is not accurate . More than half the rentes which are converted were issued after 1926 ? that is to say , at a time when the franc no longer possessed its former value . It is estimated that only a small part of the other half remains in the hands of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of funds , and a large percentage of persons must have purchased their rentes with depreciated francs . The conversion is further justified by the fact that the bulk of the rentes is held-not by small holders but by large financial institutions . In any case it is felt that the vital need of the community as a whole is to reduce its obligations . Obviously an operation of this character must succeed , or the situation will be worse than before . That is why previous governments , while realizing the necessity for a conversion , hesitated . It required great courage on the part of the Government to take this step ; and the fact that it could summon up such courage may be taken as an earnest of its intention to take other measures of retrenchment and relief that , in the opinion of all sound financiers , are urgently required in France . There must now be no doubt that the Government will proceed to establish an equilibrium that will establish fresh confidence .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
