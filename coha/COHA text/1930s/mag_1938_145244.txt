Angels With Dirty Faces ( Warner Bros. - First National ) . To Hollywood 's Joe Breen. who does the dirty work of cinema self-censorship for Cinema Tsar Hays , this picture offered an interesting dilemma . Its hero , Rocky Sullivan ( James Cagney ) , is a slum urchin who , sent to a reformatory for a prankish freight-car robbery , grows up to be a big-league desperado . Rocky 's boyhood crony , Jerry Connolly ( Pat O'Brien ) , grows up to be a priest , consecrates his career to preventing a new generation of slum urchins-who idolize Rocky Sullivan-from patterning their careers on his . <P> When Rocky Sullivan goes to the death house for murdering a racketeer ( Humphrey Bogart ) , Jerry Connolly goes to his cell to make a last request : is Rocky man enough to forfeit the admiration of the parish guttersnipes by pretending to lose his nerve at the last moment ? Breen had the choice of : 1 ) obeying the Hays production code , which frowns on moral defeats for crusading padres , or 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-believe urchins that Rocky Sullivan was a coward , would convince the hordes of real small boys of precisely the opposite . <P> Cinema morals aside , Angels With Dirty Faces is a fine job of cinema technique . Rowland Brown 's story and Michael Curtiz ' direction bring nothing new to racketeer melodrama , but the brisk rattle of Cagney 's conversation and his associates ' machine guns has a pleasantly nostalgic quality . The film lives up to one of the year 's best titles . <P> Good shot : Sullivan and Connolly reminiscing about the day their paths separated-when Sullivan was nabbed by railroad detectives and Connolly got away because he could run faster .
