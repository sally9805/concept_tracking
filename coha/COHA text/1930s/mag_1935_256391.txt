Sentimental Stanley Baldwin , Lord President of the Council , last week gave the House of Commons Britain 's revised air program , two months after Adolf Hitler had told Sir John Simon that Germany 's new air fleet will match France 's 1,700 planes . Slow in coming , the British reply was impressive . Last week , while Baldwin explained the bellicose program in principle to the Commons , Air Minister Lord Londonderry gave the House of Lords the details : <P> " By March 1937 , the strength of the Royal Air Force based at home , irrespective of the fleet air arm , will be about 1,500 first-line machines . This compares with the actual figure of first-line machines of 580 today and with a total of 840 which we should have reached by March 1937 , under the expansion program announced last July . In short , we are nearly trebling the present strength of the Royal Air Force for the defense of the British Isles . " <P> Since reserve planes are usually in a 3-to-1 ratio to first-line planes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000,000 ( $147,300,000 ) . To man the planes the R. A. F. needs 2,500 more pilots , as well as 20,000 more mechanics , riggers , wireless operators , etc . <P> Noting that British airplane stocks are already soaring , Stanley Baldwin last week added : " I hope there will be no profiteering in a time we might call an emergency . ... I have been made almost physically sick to think that I and other statesmen of Europe should , 2,000 years after Christ was crucified , be spending our time thinking how we can take the mangled bodies of children to hospitals and how we can keep poison gas from going down the throats of people .
